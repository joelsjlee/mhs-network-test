							I told him I thought I should be able to answer him the day after
							to-morrow, and asked him to call then at my Office at One; and he
							promised he would. He asked again about the proposition concerning the
							fisheries— I told him I feared we should not be ready for that, as we
							had not yet our answers from the interested parts of the Country. He
							said if we waited for their consent we should never be ready. We also
							had a long conversation upon the South American Affairs, concerning <pb

								<persRef ref="harper-robert-goodloe">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							information relating to them. Judge Johnson was in great perplexity to
							determine, whether the Executive or the Legislature or the Judiciary
							possessed the right of recognizing foreign Powers— He thought it was a

								Bentzon</persRef>, the child’s Mother, who had been informed of the

							had before consulted M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, I gave it as
							my opinion that the mother’s wish should be gratified— I found
							afterwards that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had given the

							certainly something in the construction of different minds that leads
							them to different conclusions, upon questions in which there can be no

							Astor had had the child’s corpse carried to the burying ground with the
							other, but then took it back and concluded to send it to New-York. I
							took M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greuhm with me, in my Carriage to

								ref="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>;
							and also of his having advised M’Gregor to go to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bagot— That he thought this interposition utterly
							incompatible with the duties of his Office, and should have given him to
							understand as much, if he had been informed of these transactions at the
							time when they occurred, which he was not. The D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> expressed great concern that the President, for whom he said
							he had the highest respect should have disapproved his conduct— He
							equivocated a little about his having advised M’Gregor to go to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot, but ultimately did not deny the
							fact. He said he was afterwards sorry for it; and had distrusted
							M’Gregor, when he found he was gone to an English island— I referred him
							to his publication of 7. January, in the National Intelligencer, and the
							tone of censure upon the measures of the administration, relating to
							Amelia-Island—and implying a charge even of duplicity in the Government
							on that subject. He affected to consider that publication as referring
							only to the acts of the U.S. Naval Officers there, and pretended that he
							had thought they were acting without orders from the Government. I told
							him the President believed that he Thornton, had greatly misunderstood
							what M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush said, in the conversation
							referred to; and that a copy of his Letter would be sent to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush with a request that he would
							communicate his recollections of it. He said he had no objection to
							that; but he was sure his statement was perfectly correct; for after
							drawing it up, he had shewn it to his Clerk <persRef
								ref="elliot-william">Elliot</persRef>, and asked him, if it was not
							exactly conformable to what he had told Elliott at the time; of what
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush had said— That Elliott fully
							confirmed it; and if necessary was ready to attest to it upon Oath. The
								D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> asked me if I thought the President
							would see him in person to explain to him the motives of his conduct. I
							told him I would mention this his wish to the President and take his
							directions concerning it— That I would report to the President the
							explanations that he had now given to me— That I should do it with a
							disposition friendly to him; but that in candour I ought to tell him
							that my impressions in regard to his conduct in this affair were the
							same as those of the President. <persRef ref="irvine-baptis">B.

						<p><pb type="ms" n="313"/><date>27. VII:</date> Morning visit at my house
							from <persRef ref="onis-luis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Onis</persRef> the Spanish Minister. He came to ask for an answer to
							his late Note concerning <persRef ref="morphy-diego">Don Diego
								Morphy</persRef>, who while acting as Spanish Vice-Consul at
							New-Orleans was assaulted and beaten by a Frenchman whom the District
							Attorney there refuses to prosecute. Onis complained also that his own
							house had been of late repeatedly insulted—Windows broken—Lamps before
							the house broken; and one night a dead fowl, tied to the bell-rope at
							his door— This he said was a gross insult to his Sovereign and the
							Spanish Monarchy, importing that they were of no more consequence than a
							dead old hen— But if Spain was weak it was ungenerous to insult her
							weakness, which was owing to the unparalleled efforts she had made for
							the deliverance of all Europe from tyranny— I told him I hoped it was
							nothing more than the tricks of some mischievous boys— He said he had
							long been willing to think so, but was now convinced they were
							deliberate outrages of the South-Americans now here: he was sure that
							the people of the United States, and no person of this Country, had any
							agency in them. He also requested me, as the papers of our late
							Correspondence, were to be communicated to Congress, that he might
							previously see the translations of his Notes, made at my Office, that he
							might be satisfied of their correctness; an indulgence which <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>
							had granted him on a former occasion— I told him I should readily comply
							with his request, as I was very desirous the translations should be such
							as he himself would approve. I added that setting aside our official
							character I would tell him that I had directed the translations of his
							Notes to be compared with the pamphlet of Verus, and made conformable to
							it. This Verus is a pamphlet which he has lately published, containing
							the whole substance of his three long Notes to me; with some additional
							passages, insulting to the American Government, which he dared not put
							into them. He stammered something about Verus, not being a translation
							which he approved; but did not disavow the publication. I told him I
							should shortly send him a long and full reply to his Notes— That we
							regretted he had forced us again into this endless and useless
							discussion, but that my answer to him would be complete upon every
							point. This led us into a long conversation upon all the topics in which
							his principal refuge was to the uti possidetis of 1764. He left me, on
								<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> C.
								J. Ingersoll’s</persRef> coming in, whose object was only a visit—
								<persRef ref="bell-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bell</persRef>, son of <persRef ref="bell-unknown2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bell</persRef>, the late <persRef
								ref="hellen-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hellen’s</persRef> Sister, came to ask for an Office in any of the
							departments. Not obtainable. At the President’s I met <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>,
							who returned my draft of a Note to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis,
							proposing some erasures. He afterwards called at the Office, and made
							some further observations— The President had sent yesterday to the
							Office, to ask me to call as I should go home. But it escaped my Memory.
							He sent me this Morning a Note directing me to add a new paragraph to
							the Note to Onis concerning Amelia Island; promising to surrender it
							when the danger of its being reoccupied by adventurers shall cease. He
							told me this Morning, that he had given this direction in consequence of
							a Conversation yesterday with <persRef ref="barbour-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour</persRef> of the Senate, who
							told him it would be necessary to satisfy the friends of the
							Administration, many of whom did not consider the occupation of the
							Island as warranted by the Law of 1811— <persRef ref="pazos-vincente"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> V. Pazos</persRef> the man from
							Amelia-Island came to my Office to ask an answer to his memorial and
							papers from <persRef ref="aury-louis">Aury</persRef>. He asked me if
								<persRef ref="porter-david">Commodore Porter</persRef> had spoken to
							me of him— He had not. He complained of being here at heavy expence— I
							told him that his Papers were under Consideration of the President,
							whose determination upon them, I would make known to him, as soon as
							possible— I took the draft of my Note to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Onis, to <persRef ref="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> for his perusal and remarks. <persRef
								ref="correa-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Correa</persRef>
							the Portuguese Minister, spent an hour with me this Evening. He has just
							returned from a visit of ten days to Philadelphia— He says that the
							Negotiation between Spain and Portugal, at Paris will probably end in
							nothing. That Russia sides with Spain; but lately Great Britain sides
							with Portugal. And he added his belief that when the <persRef
								ref="poletica-pierre">Russian Minister</persRef> arrives here, we
							shall find him siding with Russia, also against us. My <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">wife</persRef> still continues confined
							to her bed.</p>

						<p><date>28. VII:</date> I made a draft of an additional paragraph, for the
							Note to <persRef ref="onis-luis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Onis</persRef>, according to the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef> directions, and concerning Amelia-Island. At
							the President’s I found <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>. On reading the new
							paragraph some alterations <pb type="ms" n="314"/>of it were directed—
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> returned the draft of the Note to the
							Office without any remarks. I took it to <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crowninshield</persRef>, who read and returned it to me, proposing
							several alterations and erasures which were accordingly made— I had at
							the Office, <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hyde de Neuville</persRef>, and afterwards <persRef
								ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R. King</persRef> of
							the Senate. The Minister came to renew applications, for the restoration
							of a French Vessel taken by <persRef ref="aury-louis">Aury</persRef> and
							carried into Amelia-Island, where it now is; for a right of Frenchmen,
							to pay in Louisiana, no other or higher duties than the most favoured
							Nation; for a reduction of the duties on French wines— What was he to
							do? The French vessel was there, at Amelia; he was bound to take every
							measure for obtaining restitution. If the vessel was at sea, it could be
							retaken by a French frigate; but a French frigate could not come and
							take it at Amelia, while in possession of the troops of the United
							States— I told him that the process from the Courts of the United States
							did not extend to Amelia-Island: of course we could not try the question
							of French property or not, unless the vessel should come or be brought
							within our Jurisdiction— Well, but what was he to do? He had been
							offered to have the vessel given up, for a trifle; but that was not
							consistent with the dignity of the Crown— As to Aury, if they caught him
							they would hang him—for he was a subject of the King of France, and had
							thus been robbing French Subjects of their property— I told him that by
							refusing to receive restitution of the property, on a principle of
							dignity, he had been more scrupulous than M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Onis who was very desirous of recovering a much larger property taken in
							the same manner by an accommodation— But if he must resort to
							Governments and Jurisdictions in this case, I could only refer him to
							the Sovereign of Aury, who he told me was the king of France; or to the
								<persRef ref="coppinger-jose">Governor of East-Florida</persRef>, of
							which Amelia-Island was a part— As to the pretension that the French
							should be admitted into the Ports of Louisiana, upon a footing different
							from that of other Nations, I should receive with due consideration any
							thing that he might think proper to write me on that subject; but our
							principles were so settled, I did not think any alteration could result
							from it. He hinted that he could bring a very strong argument to bear
							against us upon that point, but intimated that if we would be more
							compliant with regard to the wines, that might reconcile his Government
							better to the refusal in the other case. I told him that the President,
							the Secretary of the Treasury, and myself were all in favour of his wish
							in respect to the diminution of the duties upon French Wines, and he
							desired me to see and converse with <persRef ref="lowndes-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowndes</persRef>, the Chairman of the
							Committee of Ways and Means, concerning it— He also enquired if I had
							yet any answer from the <persRef ref="rabun-william">Governor of
								Georgia</persRef>, about the Frenchmen drawn as Militia men, at
							Savannah— I had not. The Conversation that I had with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> King, was of a general Nature; upon the
							state and prospects of our political relations with all the European
							Powers, particularly Spain and England— He gave me no particular
							intimation of his own views, upon these Subjects, but I inferred from
							the tenour of his Conversation, that he did not disapprove the course
							which the President has determined to pursue. It was near six O’Clock,
							when I left the Office and came home— On the way I overtook <persRef
								ref="scott-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Scott</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="pope-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pope</persRef> the Delegates of the Missouri &amp; Illinois
							Territories. <persRef ref="lucas-john">Judge Lucas</persRef> of the
							Missouri Territory had called at my Office two days ago, to speak about
							the re-appointment of <persRef ref="stuart-alexander">judge
								Stuart</persRef> one of his Colleagues, whose Commission has expired
							and was to be renewed. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Scott had written
							to me urging an early nomination, on the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							of this Month— The names had been sent to the President at the time, but
							the nomination was postponed and then forgotten. Scott says the
							nomination was only sent to the Senate yesterday; and that the
							Commission will not be received in Season for holding the Court, on the
							fourth Monday in March— <persRef ref="boyd-harriet">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boyd</persRef> spent the Evening here
							with my <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">wife</persRef>, who is yet
							very unwell and confined to her bed— <persRef ref="buchanan-susan">Susan
								Buchanan</persRef> was at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De
							Neuville’s where the <persRef ref="artois-charles">Comte
								d’Artois’s</persRef> birth-day was celebrated— We were invited to
							dine there— I was occupied the whole Evening in revising and finishing
							the draft of the Note to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis.</p>

							Still rising about seven in the Morning; and returning to bed about
							midnight— With the interval of half an hour at Breakfast and an hour at
							dinner, my whole time is absorbed in the business of my Office; in
							attendance upon the President concerning it, or in receiving Visitors.
							Business breeds faster than I can provide for it, and much of it is
							unavoidably neglected. I see as little of Company at home or abroad as
							possible, and consequently visitors are still more overlooked than
							business. I have projects of arranging and methodizing business in a
							manner which may expedite the transaction of it; but have not at least
							while Congress is in Session time to reduce the projects themselves into
							order— Every thing is hurried, and of course, scarcely any thing is done
							well. But I hope after the Session of Congress closes that there will be
							occasionally some hours of leisure.</p>
