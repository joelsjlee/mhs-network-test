						<p><date>1. VI:</date> Sunday. I was compelled reluctantly to devote this
							day to the duties of my Office—to prepare the draft of a despatch with
							Instructions to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">A. Gallatin</persRef> and
								<persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>, conformably to the
							decisions of the late Cabinet Meetings— It occupied the day, with the
							exception of an hour and a half before dinner, in which I took a long
							solitary walk, and another hour in which I was engaged in reading the
							Letters that came by the Mail. none from Boston or Quincy! not even that
							promised by <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet Welsh</persRef>! As the
							scene closes she is too constantly occupied to find a moment for
							writing, and how can she take the pen to dissolve that last hope, which
							she had led us still to cherish? <persRef ref="adams-abigail">My
								Mother</persRef> was an Angel upon Earth— She was a Minister of
							blessing to all human beings within her sphere of action. Her heart was
							the abode of heavenly purity. She had no feelings but of kindness and
							beneficence— Yet her mind was as firm as her temper was mild and gentle—
							She had known sorrow—but her sorrow was silent— She was acquainted with
							grief; but it was deposited in her own bosom— She was the real
							personification of female virtue—of piety—of charity, of ever active,
							and never intermitting benevolence— Oh! God! could she have been spared
							yet a little longer!— My lot in life <pb type="ms" n="431"/>has been
							almost always cast at a distance from her. I have enjoyed but for short
							seasons and at long distant intervals the happiness of her Society— Yet
							she has been to me more than a Mother. She has been a Spirit from above
							watching over me for good, and contributing by my mere consciousness of
							her existence, to the comfort of my life— That consciousness is gone;
							and without her the world feels to me like a solitude— Oh! what must it
							be to <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>, and how will he
							support life without her who has been to him its charm?— Not my will,
							heavenly father, but thine be done!</p>

						<p><date>2. III:45.</date> Sleep short and interrupted. I could find no
							repose in bed, and rose at that early hour. I called at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>, and read to him the draft
							of Instructions to Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi><persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef
								key="rush-richard">Rush</persRef>, which he approved. I found him in
							some displeasure at having learnt that the late Commissioners to South
							America <persRef ref="rodney-caesar">Rodney</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bland-theoderick">Bland</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="graham-john">Graham</persRef>, are so far from agreeing in the
							Report they are to make, that probably no two of them will agree upon
							the same. Bland arrived two days ago at Philadelphia from Valparaiso. He
							had parted from the two others at Buenos-Ayres, not agreeing then in
							opinion with them. Rodney and Graham it seems then thought they agreed
							together, and until Rodney came here two days since with his draft of a
							Report prepared. Graham then discovered some things in it which he did
							not approve. Rodney insisted upon inserting them, and Graham declined
							signing. So they will make their Reports separately— Rodney, the
							President hinted is under the influence of <persRef
								ref="brackenridge-henry">Breckenridge</persRef>, the Secretary to
							the Commission, who is a mere enthusiast, and so devoted to South
							America, that he has avowed the wish to America, all America, in
							conflict against all Europe. Rodney therefore traces the South-American
							to the North American Revolution; and identifies them together, in a
							manner which the President thinks will be offensive to the European
							allies; and he hinted that Rodney’s Report would be purposely adapted to
							the Views rather of <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>, and the
							opposition, than to those of the Administration. He said if that was not
							the case Rodney would have submitted his Report privately, with an offer
							to modify any thing that might counteract the views, and policy of the
							Administration. That his pursuing a different course indicates that he
							feels no such delicacy; and that he will make a Report, painting every
							thing at Buenos-Ayres, as he saw it, couleur de Rose, and that it will
							be used as a weapon of party— The President read me then some incipient
							paragraphs in the draft of his Message, concerning South-America— Rather
							a historical review of their revolutionary struggle, and its progress
							towards Independence, with an opinion that it will ultimately prevail,
							than a recommendation to recognize it immediately. He asked me to
							collect for him some minutes relating to the principal stages of the
							Revolution; and suggested to me the idea of seeing <persRef
								key="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef>
							and enquiring of him to what extent the confidential communications from
							the British Government of the measures concerted by the Allies for a
							Mediation between Spain and her Colonies, may be alluded to in the
							Messages, without a breach of Confidence— I observed to him that he
							might at least allude to every thing inferable from the Spanish Note of
							12. June last, which is public in the Newspapers— He asked me to send
							him a paper containing a copy of it, which I did— At the Office I found
								<persRef ref="purviance-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Purviance</persRef>, returned from his excursion of several weeks,
							into the Country—looking, and complaining of being very unwell. <persRef
								ref="bates-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bates</persRef> of
							Boston called at the Office— He has been upon a tour of several Months
							into the Western States of Ohio, and Indiana, concerning which he gave
							me some information— <persRef ref="greuhm-frederick">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Greuhm</persRef> the Prussian Minister
							Resident, who has just returned from the summer excursion into Canada
							upon which he has been absent, came to the Office but I could not see
							him. The mail had brought me too fatal confirmation of my apprehensions,
							in a Letter from <persRef ref="adams-john2">my Son John</persRef>, dated
							at Boston last Wednesday the 28<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of
							October, informing me that between 11 and 1. O’Clock of that day,
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef>, beloved and
							lamented more than language can express, yielded up her pure and gentle
							Spirit to its Creator! <pb type="ms" n="432"/>She was born on the 11/22
							of November 1744. and had completed within less than a month of her
							seventy-fourth year. Had she lived to the age of the Patriarchs, every
							day of her life would have been filled with deeds of goodness and of
							love. There is not a virtue that can abide in the female heart, but it
							was the ornament of hers. She had been fifty four years the delight of
								<persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> heart; the sweetener
							of all his toils—the comforter of all his sorrows; the sharer and
							heightener of all his joys— It was but the last time when I saw my
							father that he told me, with an ejaculation of gratitude to the giver of
							every good and every perfect gift, that in all the vicissitudes of his
							fortunes, through all the good Report, and evil Report of the World; in
							all his struggles, and in all his sorrows the affectionate
							participation, and cheering encouragement of his wife, had been his
							never failing support; without which he was sure he should never have
							lived through them— She was the daughter of <persRef
								ref="smith-william4">William Smith</persRef>, Minister at Weymouth,
							and of <persRef ref="smith-elizabeth">Elizabeth Quincy his
								wife</persRef>— Oh! God! may I die the death of the righteous and
							may my last end be like her’s! On receiving this deeply distressing
							intelligence I immediately left my Office and came home— After indulging
							the weakness of nature, I wrote Letters to my father and to my Son John—
							The despatch for Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Gallatin and Rush
							was sent me to sign— I enclosed it under cover to <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">A. H. Everett</persRef> at Boston; and
							employed the Evening upon the Journal of the day.</p>

						<p><date>3. V:</date> I omitted this day my usual attendance at the Office.
								<persRef ref="freeman-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Freeman</persRef> of Boston called, but I could not see him. took a
							solitary walk of near two hours, before dinner; and spent the remainder
							of the day, and the Evening at home. I expected with some anxiety by the
							Mail, Letters from Quincy; but was disappointed— None came— Alas! what
							could they have told me?— If there is existence and retribution beyond
							the grave, <persRef ref="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef> is happy—
							But if Virtue alone is happiness below, never was existence upon Earth
							more blessed than hers— She was married on the 25<hi rend="superscript"
								>th. </hi>of October 1764. at the age of twenty, and had five
							children; <persRef ref="adams-charles;adams-thomas" type="multi">three
								sons</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-susanna;smith-abigail"
								type="multi">two daughters</persRef>— Two only of the Sons have
							survived her— Never have I known another human being, the perpetual
							object of whose life, was so unremittingly to do good— It was a
							necessity of her nature— Yet so unostentatious, so unconscious even of
							her own excellence, that even the objects of her kindness, often knew
							not whence it came. She had seen the world—its glories without being
							dazzled; its vices and follies without being infected by them— She had
							suffered often and severely, from fits of long and painful sickness,
							always with calmness and resignation— She had a profound but not an
							obtrusive sensibility— She was always cheerful; never frivolous. she had
							neither gall nor guile. Her attention to the domestic economy of her
							family was unrivalled— Rising with the dawn, and superintending the
							household concerns with indefatigable, and all-foreseeing care. She had
							a warm and lively relish for literature; for social conversation; for
							whatever was interesting in the occurrences of the time, and even in
							political affairs— She had been during the war of our Revolution, an
							ardent patriot, and the earliest lesson of unbounded devotion to the
							cause of their Country that her children received, was from her. She had
							the most delicate sense of propriety of conduct—but nothing
							uncharitable—nothing bitter— Her price was indeed above rubies— But oh!
								<persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>! my aged and
							ever-venerated father! what solace is now left that can attach him to
							life?— Merciful God, be thou his stay and his staff; and in thy
							sovereign goodness provide for him consolations, such as this world
							cannot give— It is for him, and to hear from him that my anxiety now
							bears upon my mind— I received this day a large budget of despatches
							from an Agent in South-America, named <persRef ref="worthington-william"
								>Worthington</persRef>, who has been swelling upon his agency, until
							he has broken out into a self accredited Plenipotentiary; and the long
							expected Report from <persRef ref="rodney-caesar">C. A.
							Rodney</persRef>, one of the late Commissioners to South-America. Graham
							has declined signing it, and is to make some additional remarks of his
							own. Rodney’s Report, is that of an enthusiastic partizan of the
							South-American Cause, but communicating scarcely any information
							additional to that which was already known— It consists of a very
							superficial historical <pb type="ms" n="433"/>review of the
							South-American Revolution; and an apologetic eulogium upon the present
							Government of Buenos-Ayres. <persRef ref="graham-john">Graham</persRef>
							admires them much less; and <persRef ref="bland-theoderick"
								>Bland</persRef> holds them in abhorrence and contempt— <persRef
								ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef> left us this day; and
							sets out next Thursday upon his return to Princeton College, where he is
							in the junior Class. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My
								wife</persRef> was taken unwell with the swelling, and inflammation
							in her ear and head, with which she has so often and so much
							suffered.</p>

						<p><date>4. VI:</date> Resumed this Morning the work of preparation for a
							Report upon weights and measures. The pressure of current business upon
							me is so unintermitting, that since the close of the last Session of
							Congress I have scarcely been able to write a line upon this subject,
							and here is another Session to commence in ten days when every thing
							will be still more hurried. <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> D. Brent</persRef> called on me this
							Morning, and mentioned the turn which circumstances are taking in
							relation to the late Commissioners to South-America. No two of them
							agree together in their views, and each of them will make a separate
							Report. <persRef ref="bland-theoderick">Bland</persRef> had a very sharp
							misunderstanding with <persRef ref="rodney-caesar">Rodney</persRef> and
							with <persRef ref="brackenridge-henry">Brackenridge</persRef> the
							Secretary of the Commission, before he left them. Rodney now says that
							Bland left them against his consent, to go to Chili. <persRef
								ref="graham-john">Graham</persRef> says that tho’ Rodney had at
							first thought that measure unnecessary yet it had been ultimately agreed
							to unanimously. <persRef ref="purviance-henry">Purviance</persRef>
							lately returned from Baltimore, says it is currently reported there—that
							Bland was concerned in the South American privateering, with <persRef
								ref="skinner-john">Skinner</persRef> the Post-master at Baltimore;
							and that he went to Chili on that business, upon the pretence of his
							public trust— Rodney and Brackenridge countenance these Reports, but
							Graham has entire confidence in Bland’s integrity. Bland has just
							returned from Valparaiso, and was this day at the Office. He says that
							he shall be prepared in the course of ten days with his report. His
							opinions of the Government of Buenos Ayres continue to be
							unfavourable—and he gave me some account of the misunderstanding between
								<persRef ref="prevost-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Prevost</persRef> and <persRef ref="biddle-james">Captain
								Biddle</persRef> of the Ontario, which occasioned Prevost to leave
							the ship, and which is barely hinted at in Prevost’s Letters.— All these
							things tend to confirm what the experience of this Country has almost
							invariably proved— The extreme difficulty of maintaining harmony in
							joint Commissions— <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de Neuville</persRef> requested
							an interview and came to the Office. He spoke of several affairs of
							little consequence— A complaint from a French Master of a vessel at New
							York, not only that he could not recover a deserting Sailor, but was
							sued by him, and compelled to deliver his cloathes— There was a Bill
							before Congress last Session to remedy this evil, and I shewed him that
							it was among the earliest orders of the day to be taken up at the next—
							I advised him to write to me on the subject, which he said he would—
							Also upon applications he has heretofore made to obtain a reduction of
							the duties upon French wines. On this point he is exceedingly
							solicitous, and seems to think that the only obstacle to his obtaining
							the object is the opinion of <persRef ref="lowndes-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowndes</persRef> against it— He was
							at the last Session of Congress, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and
							Means, and objected to De Neuville that there was a heavy duty upon
							American Cottons in France. I myself had mentioned to him, the
							restrictive and excluding system, which they are resuming in their
							colonies against us. He says he has written upon that subject to France,
							and has received answers expressing a favourable disposition, and asking
							him to present further views concerning it, to see if any thing can be
							done, reconcileable to their necessary attention to their own interest.
							Then he spoke of a claim for 100 000 franks, upon bills drawn by
								<persRef ref="armstrong-john">General Armstrong</persRef> while
							Minister in France, under the Louisiana Convention, and afterwards
							protested by Armstrong’s own request— He said he had been in
							communication with the <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Secretary
								of the Treasury</persRef> on this affair; and would see further, if
							he could not get it through with him, before he would trouble me with
							it— He also reminded me of a long Note from him, yet unanswered,
							concerning the claim of France to special favours in the Ports of
							Louisiana— I told him I kept that for a bonne bouche— At last he came to
								<pb type="ms" n="434"/>the real object of his visit, and said “Eh!
							bien! aurons nous la Paix”? meaning between the U.S. and Spain. I told
							him he must ask <persRef ref="onis-luis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Onis</persRef>— It was in his hands— He had several days been in
							possession of my Note; and there appeared to be but one point upon which
							it was possible he should have any difficulty— That was the western
							boundary. I had given him on this point our ultimatum. We had retreated
							to the Wall; and Onis had in fact only to say yes or no, to settle the
							final question, whether our differences with Spain are to be adjusted or
							not— He asked whether we had been more yielding than heretofore. I
							shewed him upon <persRef ref="melish-john">Melish’s</persRef> map the
							line offered in my note, upon which he only remarked that we might have
							taken the Columbia river from its source to its mouth, instead of the
							forty first parallel of Latitude from the Snow-Mountains to the South
							Sea— He spoke of the earnestness with which he had endeavoured to
							promote this adjustment with Spain— Of his efforts to produce the
							conviction that Spain must make some conciliatory concessions, of his
							having hazarded even his own party-standing by his zeal in favour of the
							pretensions of the U. States. and finally of his regret that this
							negotiation must fail. For he did not admit that Onis had shewn him my
							note, though it was evident he had; even the part in which it is offered
							to agree that the United States will give a certificate that they have
							received no compensation from France, for the French Spoliations within
							Spanish Jurisdiction— For it escaped him to say that as to Spain’s
							having any claims upon France on that account it was ridiculous— France
							certainly would not pay for the same thing twice— I told him plainly
							that the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> was more
							indifferent now than he had been a year ago, to the issue of this
							Negotiation— That he knew we should obtain more by delay, than we now
							offered to accept, and that we might quietly wait for the operation of
							Time. He then asked what would be done about South-American Affairs— I
							told him they might be arranged as the allied Sovereigns should agree—if
							they could agree, upon, and could prevail upon the South Americans to
							agree to their plan. He said France was very desirous of acting in
							concert with the United States— I told him France had been more reserved
							with us on this affair than England— She had communicated to us,
							nothing— He asked what there had been to communicate?— I said at least
							her answer to the British circular plan for the Mediation between Spain
							and her Colonies; dated August 1817. He said the <persRef
								ref="richelieu-armand">Duke de Richelieu’s</persRef> last despatch
							to him promised him a full communication upon the subject shortly; but
							he was confident the allied powers would not agree upon their plan; and
							that Spain would ultimately lose her Colonies. I am obliged very much to
							compress the substance of this Conversation, for want of time to record
							it. At the President’s I met <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>. The President read
							to us, the draft of his Message so far as he has prepared it, which
							occasioned some remarks— Calhoun questioned whether the affair of
							Amelia-Island, was not made too prominent— He said that had been much
							discussed last Winter, but the public were now well satisfied with what
							had been done there. But I observed the President had now taken a new
							view of it as connected with the Seminole War. Calhoun questioned the
							evidence of this fact; and appeared quite surprized when I mentioned
							that <persRef ref="ambrister-robert">Ambrister</persRef> had a
							Commission from <persRef ref="macgregor-gregor">M’Gregor</persRef>— He
							was so confident there was nothing to prove this in the official
							documents, that I doubted where I had seen it— In the Evening at home I
							found it in the proceedings of the Court-Martial upon Ambrister’s trial.
							The President and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun both had
							Letters from New-York, highly commendatory of <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">Smith Thompson</persRef> the Chief Justice of
							that State; for the Office of Secretary of the Navy. The President said
							he had written and offered him the place several days ago, and expected
							his answer to-morrow— There was also some conversation about the
							projected removal of <persRef ref="heff-john">John Haff</persRef>,
							Surveyor of the Port of New-York, and the appointment of <persRef
								ref="swift-joseph">General Swift</persRef> in his stead— The
							newspapers have announced it, as having already taken place, and
							commented upon it with some severity. It is however to be done— The
							complaint against Heff, is for rudeness of deportment; in which he has
							persevered after repeated remonstrances and warnings, till the President
							has found it necessary to remove him— I left with the President M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodneys Report and Vouchers. After I came
							home, two young men, named <persRef ref="nicklye-unknown"
								>Nicklye</persRef> and <persRef ref="lowell-unknown"
								>Lowell</persRef> came to my house, and kept me more than an hour
							with a complaint that a cargo belonging to them going in a Spanish
							vessel from one Port to another on the Spanish Main had been taken by
							the Brutus <persRef ref="joly-unknown">Captain Joly</persRef>, one of
								<persRef ref="aury-louis">Aury’s</persRef> privateers, and
							irregularly condemned by <persRef ref="arismendi-juan">General
								Arismendi</persRef> in the island of Margarita— They brought a
							protest and documents to vouch the facts; I asked them to address me a
							Letter officially and enclose their vouchers; promised to lay them
							before the President, and <pb type="ms" n="435"/>told them they would be
							sent to the Agent in Venezuela, with instructions to remonstrate against
							the proceedings, and demand indemnity for the loss— But these young men
							were not satisfied with this— They told me their story over and over
							again; complained how hard their case was—it was all their little
							property, and without insurance— They had called upon me at my house,
							and not in office hours, for my private advice— They could tell me many
							things against Arismendi and the pretended Patriots of Venezuela. There
							was a privateer of <persRef ref="brion-luis">Brion’s</persRef> at
							Norfolk—could not the Government seize that to indemnify them?— To all
							this I answered with civility and temper; but when my opinions did not
							suit them, one of them was for arguing every point with me, till my
							Patience failed— I told them there was no doubt, but they had been
							greatly wronged, and the Government would do every thing in its power to
							obtain redress for them— If they were not satisfied with the opinions I
							had given them, they could apply to legal counsel, and act according to
							their advice. If I had not stop’d them in this way they would have kept
							me till to-morrow Morning. It was between six and seven when they left
							me— <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> W. S. Smith</persRef> dined with us, and with <persRef
								key="smith-william-steuben">her husband</persRef> spent the Evening
							here. The <persRef ref="correa-joseph">Abbe Correa</persRef> also called
							upon his return from Philadelphia— He told me he had a <persRef
								ref="amadogrehon-joseph">Secretary of Legation</persRef> at last
							arrived, and should write to me officially to ask to present him to the
							President— There are also other objects upon which he proposes to make
							occasional and official Communications. He has not receive the Packet
							from Palmella which I received from England, and forwarded to him last
							Saturday to Philadelphia— Speaking of the Meeting of the Sovereigns at
							Aix la Chapelle, he said there was an Italian proverb that when the
							foxes met, there was sure to be destruction among the fowls.— Thus
							passed my Evening. No writing— No Letters from Quincy!</p>

							note from the <persRef ref="goupydequabeck-alexander">Viscount de

							the abolition again of their discriminating duties against American

								<persRef ref="william-i">king of the Netherlands</persRef>,
							announcing the Birth of <persRef ref="williamalexander">a

							American Affairs, and after consulting me some time, asked me to take a

								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef>, of the Meeting at the President’s

							with Wirt; and <persRef key="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bagot</persRef> was with Crawford— I stopped at <persRef
								ref="pleasonton-stephen">Pleasonton’s</persRef> Office, and left
							word that he should settle <persRef ref="brackenridge-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brackenridge’s</persRef> Account as
							Secretary to the late Commission to South-America, according to a claim
							which he has sent in and which the President has directed should be
							allowed— The Meeting at the President’s next followed. <persRef
								ref="glenn-elias">Glenn</persRef> the District Attorney in
							Baltimore, applied some time since for permission to employ the Attorney
							General to assist him in prosecuting several distinguished persons there
							for being concerned in privateers fitted out there to cruize against
							Portuguese Vessels, under the flag <pb type="ms" n="437"/>of <persRef
								ref="artigas-jose">Artigas</persRef>. The Attorney-General does not
							incline to appear in the causes, because he thinks, under principles
							lately settled by the Supreme Court of the United States, the persons
							accused cannot be convicted— He said he thought the <persRef
								ref="correa-joseph">Abbe Correa</persRef>, was pushing for the
							conviction of those persons very indiscreetly; and said the Abbe had
							even offered him a fee to engage him in the prosecution. The President
							thought with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt, that it was not
							necessary, that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> should be concerned in the
							prosecution; and without him, it is easy to foresee what will be the
							result of it, under Glenn’s management— But the object of the President
							in calling this Meeting was to read the draft of the Message so far as
							he had proceeded, and consult our opinions upon it. Some observations
							were made on the paragraph respecting the commercial negotiation now on
							foot in England. No ultimate diversity of opinion however on that point—
							The part relating to the War in Florida, passed also with very little
							comment—though Calhoun thinks there is too much said in it about the old
							Story of Amelia Island; and that the President appears in this part of
							the Message to justify <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef> rather than himself— And it certainly does
							countenance much more strongly the ground that I took in favour of
							Jackson’s proceedings at the cabinet Meetings in July, than I was able
							to obtain then— But the part which occasioned the principal discussion
							was that relating to South America— It was not entirely prepared, but
							its general plan was such as I had advised—referring to the return of
							the Commissioners from South-America, to their Reports; and to the
							Mediation which the allied powers of Europe have undertaken between
							Spain, and her insurgent Colonies—collecting this fact from the circular
							Note of Spain to the allies, delivered last June, and inferring from
							their policy hitherto, that whatever the result of their Mediation might
							be, they would not use force to carry it into effect— A long discussion
							arose whether the President should not express his Satisfaction that no
							force was to be used; and this led to a suggestion from Calhoun, that a
							full and elaborate view of our policy hitherto pursued in this respect,
							should be taken, with a strong expression of sentiment and wishes in
							favour of the Patriots, and an argument to prove the inexpediency of a
							public acknowledgment of their Governments for the present. He thought
							even that the instructions given last Summer to Mess<hi
								rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Gallatin, Rush and <persRef
								ref="campbell-george">Campbell</persRef> in favour of the South
							Americans ought to be communicated— It was observed by him and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, that the main argument used in
							Congress at the last Session against the recognition of Buenos Ayres, as
							an Independent Government was that Commissioners had been sent, to
							obtain information, and it was proper to wait for their return— They had
							now returned: their Reports would be communicated to Congress, and the
							opinion of the Executive upon the result would be expected, with some
							reason assigned for still postponing the acknowledgment of the
							revolutionary Governments. It was scarcely possible, Calhoun said, to be
							too explicit in the Communications from the Executive to Congress. He
							had felt it by experience, when a member of the house. When the reasons
							for the policy of the Executive were not thus explained, it became
							necessary to make them known by personal intercourse with individual
							members, which occasioned jealousies, and heart-burnings, and gave rise
							to insinuations of improper influence— It would be asked why the Reports
							were communicated, and why anything was said of South-America, unless it
							was the intention of the President to recommend the adoption of some
							measure, and as that of recognition would not be recommended, the
							reasons should be assigned for not recognizing, and at the same time the
							Sentiment and wish of the Executive for the establishment of their
							Independence strongly expressed. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt
							thought it was a part of the Constitutional <hi rend="italic">duty</hi>
							of the President, and recurred to the Article in the Constitution, which
							prescribes that the President shall from time to time recommend to
							Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and <pb type="ms"
								n="438"/>expedient.— But this case is precisely the reverse; for he
							does not think it necessary or expedient, to recommend any measure— I
							said I saw no objection to the President’s stating to Congress that he
							did not contemplate any departure from the impartial neutrality hitherto
							observed in the contest between Spain and the South-Americans— But
							recurring to the Message at the Commencement of the last Session, I
							observed that the communication to Congress of the Reports of the
							Commissioners after their return, naturally followed from the manner in
							which their mission was mentioned then—. And although M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodney’s Report was a perpetual argument
							in favour of the recognition of Buenos-Ayres, yet the facts disclosed in
							it as well as the opinions of the other Commissioners afforded ample
							reason for postponing the acknowledgment of the Government of
							Buenos-Ayres— Another reason equally decisive for that postponement, was
							the Mediation undertaken by the European allies, between Spain and
							South-America, which is now in operation, and which we know must fail,
							because it goes upon the principle of restoring the Colonies to the
							subjection of Spain, and yet utterly disclaims the application of force
							in any Event— It is our true policy to let this experiment have its full
							effect, without attempting to disturb it; which might unnecessarily give
							offence to the allies—and after it shall have failed, as fail it must,
							and as England certainly must know it will, we shall then be at perfect
							liberty to recognize any of the South-American Governments without
							coming in collision with the allies— These were reasons more than
							sufficient to be substituted for that of waiting for the report of the
							Commissioners, which was used at the last Session for postponement— But
							with regard to the facts relating to the European Mediation, some of
							them had been communicated to us in close Confidence by the British
							Government, and the President could not dilate upon them without giving
							them a colour to charge us with a breach of that confidence. Still less
							can he enlarge upon the facts in the internal condition of South
							America, which operate against the acknowledgment of the Government of
							Buenos-Ayres—the principal of which is, that they pretend to the
							Sovereignty of the whole Vice-Royalty of La Plata, while Portugal is in
							possession of Montevideo, Artigas of the Banda Oriental, Paraguay under
							other separate Government, and the Spanish Royalists in five other
							Provinces. To assign these reasons would be doubtless offensive to
								<persRef ref="pueyrredon-juan">Pueyrredon</persRef> and his
							Government; yet they are reasons decisive for not acknowledging them at
							present. As to expressing Sentiments and wishes in favour of the
							Patriots, and at the same time giving all the reasons for not
							acknowledging their Governments, it would probably give dissatisfaction
							to both parties, and be liable to the charge of duplicity from both—from
							Spain, as incompatible with the profession of neutrality— From the
							Patriots, and their partizans here, as empty professions; contradicted
							by the refusal to do the only act, which they ask of you, and which
							could manifest your friendship for them, and your sympathy with their
							cause.— Crawford said he had no doubt this objection could be taken to
							such a course, and by those who were of very high consideration in
							Congress; He nevertheless inclined to its being taken. The President
							entered but little into this discussion, nor did he pronounce his own
							determination upon it— Calhoun said that we were unanimous in the
							opinion that the recognition ought not now to take place. The President
							avowed it as his opinion— Crawford and Wirt did not contradict it. The
							conversation burnt out, by four O’Clock— The President invited us all to
							dine with him— The others stayed, but I requested him to excuse me and
							came home. <persRef ref="buchanan-robert">Robert Buchanan</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="hellen-thomas">Tom Hellen</persRef> dined with us.
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> and <persRef

								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, asking me to call

							went accordingly, with Jackson’s Letter of 23 May to the Governor of
							Pensacola— The new paragraph for the Message related to the Mediation of
							the Allies, between Spain and South-America, and was entirely

								>Clarence</persRef> and <persRef ref="edward">Kent</persRef>, and

							announcing the birth of a <persRef ref="alexander">Son</persRef> to his

								<persRef ref="amadogrehon-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							is not much of an adept at etiquette. This introduction of European

							set it aside, if the foreign Ministers themselves were not so earnestly

							With the concluding sentence of his Letter I join him in prayer to an

								Neuville’s</persRef>, and <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> De Neuville</persRef> came and spent
							it with me. His object was to talk over with me the state of our
							negotiation with Spain; to ascertain whether we would yield any thing
							further on the Western boundary, and whether we contemplated any hostile
							measure towards Spain— I told him that as to the Western boundary we had
							retreated to the Wall: we had given our ultimatum to <persRef
								ref="onis-luis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis</persRef>, and
							only wished from him an explicit answer, yes or No— He said he was
							extremely sorry to find us still so wide apart— He had had a long
							conference this morning with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis, who
							could not agree to our terms. His powers would not authorize him to
							agree to them. But he might make other propositions to us, if there was
							any chance of their being accepted. I told him that if relating to the
							Western Boundary they would be useless. He said M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Onis wanted him to interpose by a Note or a declaration of
							France in favour of Spain, but intimated that he had declined, and told
							him that if he did give a declaration it would displease both parties.
							For it would be against the United States upon the Florida, and French
							consular points, and against Spain upon the western boundary. As to the
							indemnities for French consular and privateering depredations in Spain,
							neither Spain nor the United States could have any claim upon France on
							that account; that was quite out of the question— I told him that the
							United States neither had nor demanded any thing from France on that
							score— But if France as a common and impartial friend to both parties,
							interposed with her advice to arrange their differences we did not
							expect that she would present herself at the same time as making common
							cause with Spain, upon any of them— As to declarations, France under the
							Government of <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef> had

							formal interposition or declaration of France, could have no sort of
							effect, as a friend I would advise him to avoid any interposition at
							all. He professed to acquiesce in this opinion. He spoke also of
							South-America; said he had now full and accurate information of its

							Spain; without an appearance of rebellion against the royal Government—
							And that <persRef ref="pueyrredon-juan">Pueyrredon</persRef> was ready
							to receive a Prince of the family of Spain <pb type="ms" n="440"/>to be
							the king of Buenos-Ayres— I congratulated him upon the accuracy of his
							information; but I believe he thought I was laughing at him. He also
							told me he knew all about the arrangement between Spain and Portugal.
							Montevideo was to be given up, but Portugal was to remain afterwards
							neutral between Spain and her Colonies— I asked him to whom Montevideo
							was to be given up, for Spain? he said to a competent force? and whence
							was that competent force to come? he did not know. He admitted however
							that the course of Events would assume their own character—in spite of
							any thing that could be done by the allies. He spoke again about the
							claim of France to special favours in the Ports of Louisiana, and
							intimated to me as he has done several times before that M<hi

							in this case is just— He disconcerted by his visit all my projected

							my draft of a Letter to Erving, He has partly come over to the

								Crawford</persRef>, for his revision. <persRef
								ref="bloomfield-joseph">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Bloomfield</persRef> and <persRef ref="bloomfield-joseph2">his
								nephew</persRef>, the late acting Consul at Cadix—called at the
							Office, and young Bloomfield said he had some business, upon which he
							would call another day. The French Minister <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Hyde de Neuville</persRef> came to talk
							with me about our negotiations with Spain, and to urge our yielding
							farther upon the Western Boundary of Louisana— He said he had thought we
							offered the 42<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> degree of Latitude running
							to the South-Sea; but I had very explicitly told him and shewn him that
							it was the 41<hi rend="superscript">st. </hi>He went over all the
							arguments he could muster; but I repeated to him and requested him to
							write to the <persRef ref="richelieu-armand">Duke of Richelieu</persRef>
							that we had retreated to the Wall upon that quarter and would never give
							up one drop of the Waters of the Mississippi. I told him I would however
							give him a certificate that he was a faithful liege to the king of
							Spain; he said <persRef ref="onis-luis">Onis</persRef> would give him a
							counter certificate that he was a true American. He said the President’s
							Message had given more information than he knew of in respect to the
							Mediation of the allies between Spain and her Colonies—particularly that
							they did not intend to apply force— He thought nothing had been agreed
							upon in that respect— It was not known even that it would have been
							treated of at Aix-la-Chapelle at all— I asked him for what reason the
							conferences there had been suspended for a Month— He said it was on that
							account; it was true; but nothing had been agreed upon— He asked me
							quite confidentially and with an air of mystery, what possible motive,
							Portugal could have for taking such pains to prevent a settlement of the
							differences between the United States and Spain. I told him the motive
							was very obvious. Portugal had herself a quarrel with Spain, in which at
							its first eruption, the allied powers, in my opinion somewhat
							unadvisedly and hastily had taken part with her adversary— The Policy of
							Portugal was therefore forced and unnatural— She was under a pressure
							which compelled her to take advantage of every thing that can help to
							extricate her from her embarrassment— Nothing can serve her purpose in
							this respect, better than the continuance of misunderstanding between
							the United States and Spain; and as England has reconsidered her first
							movements in the affair between her and Spain, and now sides with
							Portugal she has a fair chance of coming off, with flying Colours— This
							I said as explaining the motive; but with regard to the fact, what was
							the ground of his insinuation that Portugal did take any part in
							fomenting our differences with Spain? He declined giving any further
							explanation, and repeated that what he had said was strictly
							confidential. He meant to insinuate that the <persRef
								ref="correa-joseph">Abbe Correa</persRef> was taking pains to
							prevent Onis from coming to terms with us— I told him I was perfectly
							satisfied that Spain had no intention of coming to terms with us— The
							note which I had <pb type="ms" n="444"/>received from him yesterday, was
							demonstration of it— He insisted upon the punishment of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>— He proposed as we
							could not agree, to refer the whole matter to the Congress of Sovereigns
							at Aix-la-Chapelle— What was this but arrant trifling— He said that he
							could not undertake the defence of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis’s
							Notes— I told him that while M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis wrote
							such Notes, he must be sensible there could be no chance of our coming
							to an arrangement— He left me, in very good humour— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> left her bed
							yesterday, and was this day much better— <persRef ref="way-andrew">M<hi

							said <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> treated scarcely any body
							with decency last Winter; but he thought he would be much smoother this

							he continued this Winter his last year’s course, he would certainly not
							be Speaker of the next House. He had disclaimed at home any intention of
							opposing the Administration, and he had done the same thing individually

								<persRef ref="graham-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G.

								>L’Allemand</persRef> and <persRef ref="lafitte-jean">La
								Fitte</persRef>; from which it appears that L’Allemand’s case is
							desperate. Graham’s transactions with La Fitte as related by himself did
							not exactly tally with my ideas of right, and they were altogether
							unauthorized. He says La Fitte told him that he had Commissions for his
							Privateers from the Mexican Congress; but they were like <persRef
								ref="aury-louis">Aury’s</persRef> Commissions; and he Graham advised
							him to take a Commission of Buenos-Ayres, and gave him a Letter to
								<persRef ref="deforest-david">De Forrest</persRef> at New-York, to
							assist him in obtaining one: and that La Fitte took his advice and
							immediately despatched a man to New-York for that purpose— Now I should
							not be surprized if we should hear more of this hereafter, and not in a
							very pleasant manner— But it was all of Graham’s own head; and in my
							opinion not much to the credit of its wisdom. He is for taking immediate
							possession of Galvezton, and so am I—and he has persuaded the President
							that we have offered Spain too much in consenting to take the Sabine for
							the boundary at the Gulph of Mexico. He thinks we should go to the
							Brassòs de Dios. The President wrote me a Note, suggesting a wish that I
							would send <persRef ref="onis-luis">Onis</persRef> as soon as possible
							an answer to his last Letter, and as he has rejected the Western
							Boundary offered as our ultimatum; the United States must no longer be
							bound to accept it. I was therefore engaged all the Evening upon the

							the street as I returned home from the Office— He was lodging at the

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot was going to have his child
							Christened, next Friday Evening— That he had called yesterday at my
							house, and given to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> an invitation to
							herself and me to <hi rend="italic">attend</hi>, at the Christening,
							which was to be at seven O’Clock, and after it, at eight, was to
							commence a Ball to which all the world was invited— That the Prince
							Regent was to be Sponsor for the child; but I was not to be the
							Representative of the Prince Regent— No such idea, to my knowledge had
							ever been thought of by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot— He had
							certainly mentioned none such to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams.
							He had told her that the Prince Regents Representative would be <persRef
								ref="greuhm-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Greuhm</persRef>, the Prussian Minister, his Sovereign being a
							family relation of the Royal family of England— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Adams had told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot, that
							owing to a calamity which had befallen in our own family, we did not yet
							go at all abroad into Company; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot
							having answered that this was a religious solemnity, upon which he had
							hoped we should make an exception, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams
							had told him we would come to the Christening, and immediately
							afterwards withdraw before the Ball begins— I should have given the same
							answer; but as I had in fact given none, I could yet if he thought it
							advisable to decline— My only scruple about it was, that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> and <persRef ref="bagot-mary">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bagot</persRef> having given the
							invitation, might feel hurt if it should be declined— He said no—he
							thought there would be no necessity for that— But as the account of the
							Christening would doubtless be published, it would be well to have it
							stated that we retired immediately after the Ceremony—and he asked me,
							if the other Heads of Departments were invited. I told him, I did not
							know; but I believed not to the Christening—They doubtless were to the
							Ball— And I supposed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot’s motive for
							asking us, was the special relation between him as a foreign Minister
							and the Department to which I belong— The President said that the Story
							of my being to represent the Prince Regent, was told him last Evening by
							a person friendly to me; that he did not believe it; and had said so;
							but that it would injure me very much; and if he should hear of it again
							he would contradict it, as he wished me also to do— He could not
							conceive what motive there could be for persons to make up such Stories—
							I told him I certainly had not expected that a political use was to be
							made of an invitation from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bagot to my wife and me; to be present at
							the Christening of their child—but the motive did not lie very deep—
							There had been a Spirit at work ever since I came to Washington, very
							anxious to find or make occasion of censure upon me— That Spirit, I
							could not lay— My only resource was to pursue my own course according to
							my own sense of right; and abide by the consequences— To which the
							President fully assented. At the Office, <persRef ref="lacock-abner"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lacock</persRef>, member of the
							Senate from the State of Pennsylvania, came to enquire; why a copy of
							the Documents which were to have accompanied the President’s Message to
							Congress, had not been sent to the Senate as well as one to the House of
							Representatives. He said some of the Senators were dissatisfied, and
							that there was talk of offering a Resolution for a call upon the
							President, to know why the papers had not been transmitted. <persRef
								ref="gaillard-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gaillard</persRef>, the President he said had been particularly
							displeased, and had said it was not the first time the Senate had been
							treated in this manner— I told him it was owing to the very late day at
							which the Commissioners to South-America had delivered in their Reports—
							So that it had been impossible to make out two Copies of them, in time—
								<persRef ref="bland-theoderick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bland’s</persRef> Report had been sent in only on the day that
							Congress met, and consisted of more than three hundred pages, besides
							voluminous documents— One Copy of <persRef ref="rodney-caesar">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodney’s</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="graham-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Graham’s</persRef> Reports had been only ready, and the President
							had insisted upon sending it in to the House of Representatives— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lacock said he would endeavour to explain
							the matter to the Senators, but that it would be best in future to send
							in the two copies at once, even if there should be some delay occasioned
							by it— He also enquired of me, if <persRef ref="bache-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bache</persRef>, the Editor of the
							Franklin Gazette in Philadelphia, had <pb type="ms" n="448"/>not
							endeavoured to obtain the printing of the Laws, instead of <persRef
								ref="binns-john">Binns</persRef>, Editor of the Democratic Press. I
							said he had not, though when the Franklin Gazette first commenced last
							year, he had applied for the printing of the Laws. But that no change of
							the Printers would take place without particular Reason, and none in
							Pennsylvania, without giving previous notice to him— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot came and I had a conversation of two
							hours with him— He had an Instruction from <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, to make
							enquiries concerning the crime of Forgery in this Country— He supposed
							it a circular; but did not exactly understand what it meant; whether
							referring to the Laws for its punishment; or to the fact of its
							frequency and extent; and of expedients used to prevent it— I told him I
							thought he would be safe in considering the Instruction as applicable to
							all those circumstances, and in reporting information upon them all— I
							read to him the Laws of the United States relating to forgery; and
							referred him to the British Consuls, to obtain from them the Laws of the
							several States on the same Subject. I referred him also to <persRef
								ref="perkins-jacob">Jacob Perkins</persRef> at Philadelphia, for his
							patent invention of Steel plates for engraving Bills, which cannot be
							counterfeited, and to the Newspapers of last Spring, for accounts of the
							detection of a Gang of Bank-Bill forgers in Canada, on the borders of
							the United States— He thanked me, and said I had entirely relieved him
							from his embarrassment by pointing him to sources by which he would be
							enabled to give a satisfactory answer to the despatch— He then spoke
							upon several subjects concerning which he has lately written to me— The
							money, embezzled by <persRef ref="rudd-tharon">Rudd</persRef>, Clerk of
							the New-York District Court— The Extra-Pilotage, levied upon a King’s
							Ship there— The Bonds said to have been unnecessarily required of a
							British Vessel bound to Liverpool; and finally asked if there was any
							further information that I had to communicate in relation to the
							Execution of <persRef ref="arbuthnot-alexander">Arbuthnot</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="ambrister-robert">Ambrister</persRef>. With regard to
							the other points I promised early attention to them; and as to the last
							told him, that a full exposition of the Causes and origin of the War in
							Florida, would be given in a despatch to <persRef ref="erving-george"
								>our Minister in Spain</persRef>, together with all the vouchers
							supporting the Statement of facts— That the War would be traced to
								<persRef ref="nicholls-edward">Nicholls</persRef> and his
							Negro-Fort— And that Arbuthnot will be shewn to have been the cause of
							the renewal of the War. He said he had thought Arbuthnot had been merely
							a meddling trader. Ambrister indeed evidently had political objects in
							view— But he thought there was no evidence of any connection between
							Arbuthnot and <persRef ref="woodbine-george">Woodbine</persRef>— I
							immediately referred him to documents which proved that there was. He
							read me the Instruction which he had first received from Lord
							Castlereagh upon the subject, and in which he appears to be embarrassed
							and distressed about it— He was anxious to persuade me that the British
							Government had given no countenance or encouragement to the Indians, and
							declared that he never had any Instructions whatever to attend at all to
							the Affairs of the Indians— I said that I was convinced, Arbuthnot had
							been an impostor, and falsely pretended to authority; but he had
							explicitly referred to <persRef ref="cameron-charles">Governor
								Cameron</persRef>, as having given him the copy of a Letter from
								<persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Earl Bathurst</persRef>, to be
							communicated to the Indians, stating that he Bagot was instructed to
							attend to the affairs and rights of the Indians— He said Cameron ought
							to explain that to him— He did not know how to account for it; unless
							Cameron had turned South-American Patriot, and was in concert with
								<persRef ref="macgregor-gregor">M’Gregor</persRef>— I said that our
							object in what would be published would be merely to justify ourselves—
							We did not wish to enter into discussion with the British Government
							upon any of the facts that would be disclosed, but if the British
							Government should find any thing in the publication which they should
							judge required denial or explanation to vindicate their own good faith,
							we should be happy to receive it. To be candid with him, I did think
							that if his Government had been as explicit in the disapprobation of
							Nicholls to himself as they had been to me, I believed we never should
							have had this War. He said the Government had been very explicit with
							Nicholls— He had himself copies of the papers that had passed between
							him and Earl Bathurst— His Treaty was disapproved. He was told that he
							had made it without authority, and that <persRef ref="hadjo-hillis"
								>Hidlis Hedjo</persRef> must be sent back and told that his People
							must make the best terms with the United States that they could— That
							the only presents made him were a pair of silver-mounted pistols, twelve
							spades, as many hoes, and some other instruments of agriculture— That it
							was not true that he had received a Commission as a British Officer— I
							mentioned his complaint in one of the papers that he had lost his
							uniform— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot had not seen that; but
							said the uniform said to have been found at the house of one of the
							Chiefs must have been Ambrister’s— I said that among the papers to be
							published would be one of <pb type="ms" n="449"/><persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson’s</persRef>, charging with some
							severity his Government. We should have been glad to avoid the
							publication of it, but as Jackson’s own conduct had been much brought in
							question, it was thought due in Justice to him to suppress nothing that
							he had alledged in his own vindication— He said he should think little
							of any thing said or written by Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Jackson, because he thought there were evident marks in his conduct of
							personal bitterness and inveteracy— I said that I thought the papers
							which he had before him would have produced the same impressions upon
							the most impartial person— And that I thought the execution of the two
							men, was justifiable according to the ordinary laws of War— He said he
							wished Jackson had sent them bound hand and foot to be punished here— I
							told him we could not in that case even have tried, and much less have
							punished them— We must immediately have let them loose, and the next day
							they might have played over the same game again— It was past five when
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot left me: as he went, he spoke
							of his Christening— I asked him to excuse us from attendance, as we went
							out no-where, and should not even attend the Drawing Room at the
							President’s to-morrow Evening. He consented, saying that he had
							appointed the Christening for seven O’Clock, and the Ball to begin at
							eight—but perhaps, they might run one into the other— <persRef

						<p><date>25. VI:</date> After being engaged all the morning till noon, upon
							the Journal of yesterday, I called at <persRef

								Crawford’s</persRef> Office, without finding him; at <persRef
								ref="pleasonton-stephen">Pleasonton’s</persRef> to enquire about the
							settlement of <persRef ref="hackley-richard">R. Hackley’s</persRef>
							accounts as Consul at Cadix, in which <persRef ref="bloomfield-joseph2"
								>young Bloomfield</persRef> is interested— There is a heavy charge
							for expences incurred by the seizure at Cadix under the Instructions of
								<persRef ref="erving-george">G. W. Erving</persRef> then Charge
							d’Affaires at Madrid of an American vessel in the year 1808 for a breach
							of the Embargo-Laws— Erving charged it upon the settlement of his
							Account in 1810. but it was then and still remains suspended. It now
							comes as a charge of Hackley’s, made over for certain advances to young
							Bloomfield— I called also at <persRef ref="anderson-joseph"
								>Anderson’s</persRef> Office, about my own accounts; which he has
							not yet adjusted. At the President’s I found M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford, and spoke to him, about an answer to be returned
							to <persRef key="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bagot</persRef>, on a complaint, of excessive Bonds said to have
							been required upon the Cargo of a British vessel, going from New-York.
							He promised to send me the <persRef ref="galston-unknown"
								>Collector’s</persRef> answer— We also conversed upon certain
							difficulties raised against the Execution of an Act of Congress of the
							last Session. The <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>
							returned me the draft of a Letter to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, with a direction
							to make an alteration of one sentence— On reaching my Office I found
								<persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								King</persRef> and had with him a conversation of more than two
							hours, ranging over the whole extent of our public affairs— He is not
							reconciled to our agreement to renew the Commercial Convention of July
							1815. though I shewed him the list of British and American Vessels which
							have entered at the Port of Liverpool since the Peace; manifestly
							shewing that our shipping are rapidly eating out the British, from
							almost the whole of the direct trade, between the United States and
							England. King acknowledged that it was a very powerful document, but he
							wants to have our privileges of trading with the British East-Indies
							enlarged; particularly so as to enable us to go from thence directly to
							China. As he was leaving me, he said it was reported I was to stand
							proxy for the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef> at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot’s Christening; and asked me if it
							was true. I told him it was not— He had simply invited me to his
							Christening, but I had declined going; as I do not go into company any
							where. He said he was glad of it, because some nasty story might have
							been made out of it. When I came home, I found <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> had been visiting, and it was all over the town
							among the Ladies that at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot’s
							Christening she was to have held the Child— To trace the source of these
							reports, fabricated from an incident so perfectly insignificant, and for
							purposes so obviously malevolent to me would be useless; but even from
							this, I would learn a lesson of humility and of discretion— Of humility
							at seeing the President thrown into such a state <pb type="ms" n="450"
							/>of trepidation for fear that I was about to commit an enormous
							indiscretion, which might ruin the popularity of his Administration, as
							without waiting to ascertain the facts, to mention the matter to me
							at-all. If there was not a want of delicacy towards me in this
							proceedure, there was at least a great want of confidence in my
							prudence. It gives me therefore the measure of the President’s feelings
							and opinions in reference to me; and they are not flattering— In my own
							opinion, if the whole Story had been true, the circumstance would have
							been of so paltry and insignificant a character that it was utterly
							unworthy of the President’s attention for a single moment. That it would
							have afforded occasion for invidious and malignant paragraphs in the
							newspapers both against him and me, I certainly should have seen without
							needing an admonition from him; and therefore if M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bagot had made the proposal to me, of standing as the Prince
							Regent’s proxy I should have declined; and I think the President might
							have trusted sufficiently to my judgment, to presume that I should not
							expose myself or him to obloquy so entirely without necessity. But the
							President takes impressions very hastily, and they are apt to unsettle
							his own judgment for a short time— In this instance I have perhaps
							complied with them further than perhaps I ought to have done. One great
							motive for it has been that so soon after my dear <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail">Mother’s</persRef> decease I was unwilling to go
							to the house of feasting at-all, and was glad of an opportunity to make
							an excuse for avoiding it— The lesson of discretion, is to take double
							heed to my steps— When without any agency of mine, falsehoods like this
							are raised from the most trivial incidents of daily occurrence in
							domestic life, to make me ridiculous and odious in the public opinion;
							what can I say, but that it is not in man that walketh to direct his
							steps—and to implore guidance from above, to walk uprightly; and
							strength from above, to go through good Report, and evil Report— This
							Evening was the first drawing Room at the President’s for the Season— We
							did not attend.</p>

							He talked to me of the clumsy manner in which the President’s Message

							popularity of <persRef ref="bland-theoderick">Judge Bland</persRef>, who
							he says narrowly escaped being indicted last week at Baltimore, for

							any employment suited to his abilities and for which there would be
							adequate compensation. He spoke particularly of the superintendence of
							the publication of the Journal of the Convention of 1787. and of other
							documents according to a Resolution of Congress adopted at their last
							Session— I mentioned him to the President, who spoke of him
							respectfully, but thought the public feeling was not prepared to be
							satisfied at seeing him employed. Walsh removed last Spring to
							Germantown, and since then to Philadelphia. His temper, never good is
							now soured by deep disappointment— I am afraid his circumstances are

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef> called and

							British Government of <persRef ref="nicholls-edward">Nicholl’s</persRef>
							transactions in Florida, after the Peace. One was copy of a Letter from
							Nicholls to <persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Earl Bathurst</persRef>, dated
							July 1815. announcing his arrival in England, with <persRef
								ref="hadjo-hillis">Hillis Hadjo</persRef> and the Treaty of Alliance
							Offensive and Defensive; and an answer from Lord Bathurst declaring that
							Nicholls had no authority to make any such Treaty; and that Hillis Hadjo
							must immediately be sent home— There was also a Letter to Hillis Hadjo
							himself informing him that a passage back was provided for him and
							advising him to make peace with the Americans as soon as possible. A
							Letter to <persRef ref="baker-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker</persRef> then Charge d’Affaires at Washington, communicating
							these papers and further disavowing Nicholls— With an endorsement by
							Baker, that he had communicated these papers to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe at an interview on the 6<hi rend="superscript">th:
							</hi>of December 1815. Lord Bathurst’s Letter to Baker is dated 24.
							September 1815 the day after my Note to him on the subject. I told Bagot
							that I was sorry I had not had copies of those papers to communicate
							with the other documents which would be published; as they would
							strongly confirm the proof that the conduct of <persRef
								ref="arbuthnot-alexander">Arbuthnott</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="woodbine-george">Woodbine</persRef> had not been authorized by
							the British Government. <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de Neuville</persRef> came also
							to the Office, and had a long conversation with me upon our affairs with
							Spain— I read to him <persRef ref="pizarro-joseph">Pizarro’s</persRef>
							note of 29. August to <persRef ref="erving-george">Erving</persRef>,
							which he told me, that Onis had not communicated to him, and he was
							extremely urgent that we should wait till Onis can have new Instructions
							from his Government since the change of Ministry there, before we send
							in to Congress the papers of the late Negotiation— He says that now
							Pizarro is out of Office he can tell me, that he was one of the great
								<pb type="ms" n="452"/>obstacles to an arrangement with the United
							States, and that the <persRef ref="richelieu-armand">Duke de
								Richelieu</persRef> was much dissatisfied with him on that account.
							I told him we had no reason to expect any thing favourable from the
							exchange the <persRef ref="casairujo-carlos">Marquis of Casa
								Yrujo</persRef> being well known in this Country; and that the
							documents of the Negotiation having been promised to Congress, could not
							be withheld. He endeavoured to press again upon the subject of the
							Western boundary; but I told him I had sent this morning a Letter to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis, informing him that as he had
							rejected our offer of taking the Sabine for a Boundary, we should no
							longer be bound by it— We parted in very good humour— In the Evening
								<persRef key="smith-william-steuben">W. S. Smith</persRef> and
								<persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">his wife</persRef> were here,
							and he had some conversation with me relating to his own and <persRef
								ref="smith-william">his father’s</persRef> affairs— He shewed me a
							Letter from <persRef ref="smith-james">James Smith</persRef> at New-York
							which needs explanation.</p>
