						<p><date>1. IV:30.</date> Friday. I rode with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> to look at a house and land that are for sale near
							the river, and at a Square belonging to <persRef ref="thornton-william"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton</persRef>, also near
							the river. At the Office I had visitors, <persRef ref="maury-fontaine"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fontaine Maury</persRef>,
							brother of the <persRef ref="maury-james">Consul at Liverpool</persRef>,
							who came to solicit an office as Clerk in one of the Departments,
								<persRef ref="mcrae-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Alexander M’Rae</persRef> who has been appointed Consul at
							Amsterdam; but who is not certain whether he can accept the Office, but
							will soon inform me. <persRef ref="dana-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Dana</persRef>, who brought me a draft of a Bill which
							he thinks of proposing concerning the extent of our jurisdiction from
							the shores, and <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> the Secretary of War, to whom I gave
							the despatches lately received from South America, and from <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Rush</persRef> at
							London. In the Evening I had a visit from <persRef ref="correa-joseph"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Correa</persRef> the Portuguese
								<pb type="ms" n="343"/>Minister, with whom I had a long, and not
							very pleasant conversation. He said he had been much hurt by a paragraph
							in yesterday’s National Intelligencer, noticing in harsh terms the
							reception and ill-treatment experienced by the Congress Frigate, and the
							neglect of our Commissioners at Rio Janeyro— He brought me an anonymous
							Letter to himself written at Savannah, last November, containing an
							account of a Portuguese vessel taken and carried to Amelia Island, by
							the adventurers there, and condemned as a Spaniard— And this event he
							pretended had exasperated the people at Rio Janeiro, against us; and
							occasioned the ill treatment of our Officers. As to those <hi
								rend="italic">Up Stairs</hi>, he said (meaning <persRef
								ref="john-vi">the king</persRef>) there was an affair, ever since
							last June, which had indisposed them—meaning the Countenance given here,
							to Da Cruz, a man who came as deputy from the Insurgents at Pernambuco.
							And <persRef ref="villanova-unknown">Count Villa Nova</persRef>, the
							present acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, <persRef ref="bezerra-joao"
								>Bezerra</persRef> having died last November, was a man of morose,
							unconciliatory temper, and strongly prejudiced against the United
							States. I told him, first, that the Article in the National
							Intelligencer, was not inserted from the Government; and I knew nothing
							of it— I supposed it founded upon private Letters— Secondly that the
							reception of the Frigate, and of the Commissioners had not been
							friendly. Disagreeable incidents had occurred, which however had been I
							hoped ultimately explained to mutual satisfaction— Thirdly that the
							Minister Villa Nova had made the unwarranted and inadmissible demand
							that all the Portuguese Sailors on board the Congress should be
							discharged. In that Correa said, as we never practiced impressment, the
							Minister Villa Nova was certainly wrong. This led us into a long
							discussion, about Spain, Portugal, South America, the European Alliance
							and this Country, in which with a pretence of Confidential
							Communication, and mysterious inuendos he hinted that the European
							Alliance had determined to take part against the South-Americans, and
							that Russia was to have some great foot-hold on the American Continent—
							It was obvious that he had some conjectural as well as some real
							information from Paris; and that he wished me to consider the
							South-American business as entirely settled by the European Alliance—I
							told him if they thought of settling affairs of such importance, and in
							which we have so deep an interest, without consulting us, they must not
							complain if we pursued our course concerning it without consulting them—
							He fully admitted our right, but in the course of our discussion there
							was something like acerbity, in the collision of our opinions— We parted
							however in mutual good humour.</p>

							came at ten, in high Spirits, and entirely released from his terrors,
							and his ominous conjectures about the European Alliance— He had a Letter

							return from Paris in Feb<hi rend="superscript">y.</hi> Palmella tells
							him that <persRef ref="delosrios-carlos">Fernan Nuñez</persRef> and he
							have both received their full Powers to arrange the affair of
							Montevideo, between Spain and Portugal— That he is determined to admit
							only the Mediation, and not the umpirage of the other European Powers—
							That he will agree to restore Montevideo, only on the preliminary
							condition that the affair between Spain and her Colonies shall be
							settled either by her acknowledgment of their Independence, or by her
							subduing them; of which he says the prospect is from day to day more
							remote— He expresses much satisfaction, at our occupation of
							Amelia-Island, and at <pb type="ms" n="344"/>the motives assigned in the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> Messages for that
							measure. He requests M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Correa to send him
							all the documents relating to that affair, and says they will have great
							effect in justifying the occupation of Montevideo by the Portuguese
							Government; shewing that similar causes produced the same effects, and
							gave rise to measures founded on the same principles; without
							co’operation or even concert between the two Governments— He adds that
							he shall return to Paris, and protract the negotiation, until the
							Meeting of the kings which is to be next September at Aix La Chapelle,
							and which the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">king of Spain</persRef> means
							to attend— There Palmella expects that this subject will be merged in
							the general questions about South-America, and that the whole will end
							in smoke. Correa said he was very much gratified to find such a perfect
							coincidence with the sentiments and opinions that I had expressed to him
							the Evening; before last. and the more so, as it was not an official
							despatch but a friendly and confidential Letter— He had also a Letter
							from the acting Minister of foreign Affairs <persRef
								ref="villanova-unknown">Villa Nova</persRef>, which shews he had
							been very polite and attentive to <persRef ref="biddle-james">Captain
								Biddle</persRef>, and which speaks with much esteem of <persRef
								ref="sumter-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sumter</persRef>—
							He is therefore entirely convinced that the unpleasant incidents that
							occurred while the Congress Frigate was there were accidental; and that
							the Non-introduction of our Commissioners to the king, was owing only to
							the informality of their characters; and perhaps to avoid giving direct
							Offence to Spain, whose <persRef ref="casaflores-unknown">Minister
								Casa-Flores</persRef> had perhaps made an extraordinary stir, upon
							the occasion— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Correa told me he should go
							for Philadelphia, the day after to-morrow, and asked me to hold this as
							his visit to take leave. The remainder of the day, with the exception of
							an hour’s walk in the midst of the gale, I was still absorbed in the
							arrangement of my Accounts, a labour so much like idleness that I can
							scarcely justify it to myself. There was a Mail, unusually large, of
							despatches from Sweden and England.</p>

							Book. I found the dimensions of the two Lots in Square N. 231. which I

								>President’s</persRef> he had rode out. <persRef
								ref="deforest-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De
								Forrest</persRef> was at the Office— I told him that he could not be
							recognized in the character of Consul General, as that would import a
							recognition of the Government of Buenos-Ayres. But if he should have any
							communications to make at the Department of State, they would be
							received with the same attention as if he was acknowledged: and I added
							that the supposed Treaty, which <persRef ref="worthington-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Worthington</persRef> had assumed to
							make was without any authority and had not been approved by the
							President. He said it had been thought ridiculous by all the Americans
							at Buenos-Ayres, and done solely with a view to give himself
							consequence—he would doubtless make a similar Treaty in Chili— But as a
							Consul from this Country had been appointed to Buenos-Ayres, the
								<persRef ref="pueyrredon-juan">Director Pueyrredon</persRef> had
							thought there would be no difficulty in receiving one. He was himself a
							native Citizen of the United-States, and now returned to remain here,
							having no intention ever to go back to South-America. His appointment
							was of very little consequence, and was given him unsolicited by him,
							with a view to prevent the irregularities which had been committed by
							privateers under the flag of Buenos-Ayres which the Director highly
							disapproved— But he asked me whether he should exhibit his Commission to
							me; and whether he should make an application for the exequatur in
							writing, to receive an answer in the same manner— I said that we had
							appointed many Consuls to reside at Colonial establishments they were
							seldom received with those regular titles, but were generally allowed to
							act as <hi rend="strikethrough">Colonial</hi> commercial Agents At
							Buenos Ayres <persRef ref="halsey-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Halsey</persRef> had been formally received— This was altogether a
							voluntary act on the part of the Government there, who might have
							declined it without offence to us— But the Director himself in
							announcing his, De Forrest’s appointment as Consul General had referred
							to Worthington’s Treaty which was entirely disavowed. As to writing, I
							thought that would be unnecessary. It would be more consistent with
							delicacy from each party to the other that it should be thus understood
							by verbal communication. If however he preferred writing, and would
							address a Note to me, I would send him an answer to the same effect with
							what I now told him— I asked him if his Commission interfered with that
							of <persRef ref="aguirre-manuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Aguirre</persRef>; he said no— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Aguirre’s Commission was merely to procure arms, and naval Stores; and
							an armed vessel— He had no authority to ask the acknowledgment of his
								<pb type="ms" n="346"/>Government, and he knew it was not the wish
							of the Director to press this Government upon that subject. But Aguirre
							had been instigated here, by other persons to all that he had lately
							done— He then asked if there was not a demand from the Director that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Halsey should be recalled. I told him
							that there was; and that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Halsey had been
							already sometime since, dismissed— There were doubts as to the
							President’s power, to recall, an individual Citizen from a foreign
							Country; but Halsey’s Commission being revoked, if the Director thought
							it essential that he should be personally removed he would of course be
							subject to the Police regulations of the Country— De Forrest asked
							whether he could see the President. I told him I had no doubt he could.
							I would mention his wish to-morrow Morning and had no doubt he would be
							received, if he called at the house— I sent for young <persRef
								ref="thruston-charles">Thruston</persRef> and informed him that I
							had appointed him one of the Clerk’s in the Department— I am still too
							much engaged with my papers.</p>

							of Florida, the Government of the United States would take any measure
							to prevent it— I told him that the same Law, by virtue of which
							possession was lately taken of Amelia Island would apply on such
							contingency to the remainder of Florida; it had been in existence ever
							since the year 1811. and expressly provided that no foreign power could
							be permitted to take possession of that Province, or any part of it: The
							United States had a claim upon it, for indemnities which have long been
							due from Spain, and they cannot suffer that it should be taken out of
							their hands by a third party— He said the Government of Buenos Ayres had
							no concern in the late transactions at Amelia-Island, and were entirely
							satisfied with the steps taken there by the United-States. But the
							possession of a Port in the Gulph of Mexico, would be of great
							importance to them, as a means of annoyance to Spain; and unless they
							could take Florida, they could have no Port upon the Gulph to which
							their privateers could resort. I said the Law of Congress had been made,
							without any intention to injure the interests of Buenos-Ayres, but while
							it remained in force, the President was bound to have it executed. That
							the Commissioners to South America, had been instructed to give every

							leave the affair of his Office as Consul-General from the Provinces of

							Communication, particularly as we were already in possession of the
							Answer of Russia, to the propositions made by Great-Britain— He said he
							had no doubt that the delay of the Communication was occasioned solely
							by the fact that nothing had been definitively agreed upon— He said he
							was likewise expressly instructed to present the thanks of his <pb

							proceeding observed in the suppression of a paragraph of a Letter, among

						<p><date>13. IV:</date> But notwithstanding I rose at this early hour, by

								>Attorney General</persRef> recommending a pardon, or remission of a

							called at the Branch Bank and left an order on the Cashier of the U.S.

							for <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef>, and <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">W. S.

							Adams.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye promised also to make it
							known to <persRef ref="boyd-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Boyd</persRef>— <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef>, one of
							the Editors of the National Intelligencer came to say something about
							the printing of public documents— I had some conversation with him on
							the expediency of importing one of <persRef ref="konig-fredrich"
								>Konig’s</persRef> completing Machines, for the public printing, but
							found upon examination that it would not effectually answer the purpose
							of having the printing done with much greater expedition than at
							Present— At eleven O’Clock, I attended the Cabinet meeting at the
							President’s. He proposed several questions for Consideration. 1. Whether
							Amelia-Island should with or without a new application from the <persRef
								ref="onis-luis">Spanish Minister</persRef>, be evacuated? 2. Whether
							if the War with the Seminole Indians should come to an end, by their
							surrender, our troops shall evacuate Florida? 3. Whether an armed force
							shall be sent, to visit both sides of the Coast of South-America, for
							the protection of our Commerce, and to countenance the Patriots. To
							which was added the further question, whether a Frigate should also be
							sent into the India Seas? 4. Whether a person of confidence should be
							sent to Galveston, to ascertain by what authority the late Settlement
							there has been made; and to give warning that it is the Territory of the
							United States. 5. Whether the Ministers of the United States in Europe
							shall be instructed, that the United States will not join in any project
							of interposition between Spain and the South-Americans, which should not
							be to promote the complete Independence of those Provinces, and whether
							measures shall be taken to ascertain if this be the policy of the
							British Government, and if so to establish a concert with them for the
							support of this policy. 6. Whether any measures shall be taken with
							regard to the renewal of the Commercial Convention of 3. July 1815. with
							Great-Britain. All these points were discussed without much diversity of
							opinion, upon any of them. It was agreed that neither Amelia-Island nor
							Florida should be evacuated for the present— As to sending an Agent to
							Galveston nothing definitive was determined— There were incidental
							questions, with regard to the kind of agent <pb type="ms" n="349"/>to be
							sent, whether ostensible, or secret; and from which of the Departments.
							No positive decision was made. It was concluded to send a frigate and a
							Sloop of War, one into the India Seas and the other on the South
							American Coast— The conclusion with regard to the Commercial Convention
							of July 1815 was that since our late Navigation Act, we might propose to
							Great-Britain the simple renewal of the Convention, and express at the
							same time our willingness to negotiate with them further for other
							objects, if they should be so inclined— The point upon which there
							appeared the most variety of opinion was on the Instructions to be given
							to our Ministers abroad, concerning the Spanish and South-American
							quarrel— I thought that instead of one general circular instruction,
							there should be different Instructions given, and a different course
							prescribed to different Ministers; and particularly that no proposal
							should be made to Great-Britain, for concerted measures with her to
							promote the Independence of South-America— First, because it would be a
							departure from neutrality— Secondly, because Great-Britain though she
							will readily acquiesce in the South-American Independence, will
							cautiously avoid having the appearance of supporting it; and thirdly,
							because she would at once decline our overture, and make it an
								<unclear>engine</unclear> to injure us, with the other European
							Powers. Finally, the President directed me to make drafts of
							Instructions to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="campbell-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Campbell</persRef>, for his Consideration.— There was some
							conversation upon the Warrant for the delivery of the Passamaquoddy
							Islands; and question to whom it should be sent—which was not settled—
							The appointment of <persRef ref="little-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Little</persRef> as one of the new Appraizers of
							Merchandize at Boston was determined—that of the second postponed: At
							the President’s request we all went out with him and viewed the ground
							where they have begun digging for the foundation of one of the new
							Executive Offices. We all agreed that the place where they have begun is
							not well chosen and that another should be selected. But the opinions
							differed whether the new Scites should be parallel to the present
							buildings; or at right angles with them— It was three O’Clock when I
							returned to my Office. Received a numerous Mail of Letters— A Short
							Evening— When I rise so early, I find writing or reading after dinner
							quite impracticable. But for study; one morning hour is worth two in the
							Evening.</p>

								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> to <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>,
							stating that with regard to the Slaves carried from the United States by
							British Officers after the late Peace, the British Government accepted
							the proposal made by that of the United States, to refer the question of
							Construction of the Treaty which has arisen upon it, to the arbitration
							of a friendly Sovereign— But it was thought advisable to take as a
							previous measure the course of the Treaty in regard to other questions
							between the parties, and to refer the question to Commissioners mutually
							chosen. At the same time it was wished to take the opportunity for
							settling another and the only remaining question of <pb type="ms"
								n="350"/>boundary between the two Countries; namely that of the line
							from the North-west corner of the lake of the Woods, westward— It had
							been left undetermined at the Treaty of Ghent; though it was known that
							the line of the Treaty of 1783 was a nullity, and the Treaty of 1794, by
							which some provision was made for the difficulty, no longer existed.—
							And as our Settlements westward were on both sides pushing on very
							rapidly, it was very desirable, that the present favorable moment should
							be taken for coming to an arrangement of the question; which it was
							proposed to do also by the means of Commissioners I observed to him that
							there was a third question which had also been suggested by Lord
							Castlereagh to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush; that relating to
							Columbia river. He said he considered it as involved in the other. And
							he further observed that his Government had been a little hurt at
							learning from him of the Ontario’s having been despatched to take
							possession of the Mouth of Columbia River, without giving notice to him
							of the measure. That his Government in the fullest and most explicit
							manner admitted the obligation of restoring any Post, which had existed
							there at the commencement of the late War under the authority of the
							United States. That on receiving information of the Ontario’s expedition
							immediate orders had been issued from the Lords of the Admiralty, to
							prevent any collision in the Execution of the Ontario’s orders— That no
							resistance would be made against them; but he was instructed to add that
							the British Government did not admit the validity of our title to that
							territory— I told him that although I was here when the Ontario sailed,
							the measure had been determined upon, before I came— That I should
							inform the President of the substance of his communication; but in the
							meantime I could assure him that the omission to give him notice of the
							object of that expedition, was not from any intentional concealment; but
							altogether in consequence of the answer given by <persRef
								ref="baker-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>,
							when in 1815. the restoration of that Post had been demanded by <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>—
							Which was that the American Post, at the mouth of Columbia river, taken
							by the British during the War, had not been occupied by them, but
							immediately abandoned— That concluding thence, that there was no British
							Post there, the Ontario had been sent there with instructions to persons
							on board merely to resume the possession of the United States; and as it
							was expected that no British Post would be found there, it had not
							occurred that there was any occasion to give notice of the expedition to
							him, or to his Government. He said he was entirely satisfied with this
							explanation which he was sure would be equally satisfactory to his
							Government. I said that no force was intended to be used in the
							execution of this Service— The Officers charged with it were instructed
							if they should find any settlement there, and any opposition made to
							their taking possession, not to commit any act of hostility or of force.
							He said no resistance would be made— I told him that we had no thoughts
							of making War, at present for the Empire of Astoria, but, with regard to
							the title we had not only that settlement actually established before
							the late War, but a purchase of a large tract of the Country made from
							the Indians in the year 1787. more than thirty years since— He said he
							had never heard of that before— I told him I was not aware of any
							material objection that there would be to referring these Subjects to
							Commissioners, unless it should be the dissatisfaction, which has been
							manifested in Congress at the slowness, and expensiveness of the
							Commissions now in operation. But there were other Subjects to be
							arranged between the two Countries— There were the fisheries— The
							renewal of commercial arrangements, to meet the expiration of the
							Convention of 3. July 1815— The additional Articles proposed by Lord
							Castlereagh, and, I hoped some further liberal provision with regard to
							the West-India trade. A hope that I the more freely indulged after
							seeing Lord Castlereagh’s Speech in February last, in answer to <persRef
								ref="lyttleton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lyttleton’s</persRef> questions on the Slave trade abolition Treaty,
							with Spain. He said those remarks of Lord Castlereagh had been
							generally, and much applauded every where in England— With regard to the
							Convention of 1815, the impression of many of the merchants among us
							here, was that its operation was disadvantageous to us, and to the
							advantage of Great-Britain. Yet I believed rather than incur the greater
							evil, of setting the whole business afloat again; of reviving the
							discriminating duties on both sides, and letting loose, all the petty
							fractious regulations, so troublesome to the merchants, we should be
							willing to agree at all Events that the duration of the Convention
							should be prolonged for some years: but if Great-Britain objects to
							that, and prefers that the Convention should be permitted to expire it
							will be necessary to give notice of it very soon; that the Merchants may
							be prepared accordingly. To all this M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bagot fully agreed. <pb type="ms" n="351"/>As to the fisheries he said
							he regretted very much not having received from us the proposal that had
							been promised him; as now the Legislature of Nova-Scotia had taken up
							the subject— They were addressing the crown, and although their
							influence might be not very great, yet it must always be something— I
							said I hoped they would not listen to the Nova-Scotia Legislature, who
							suffered their temper to run away with their interest. They had found
							themselves compelled to repeal their Plaister Law, and now took up the
							fisheries by way of avenging themselves. If they were suffered to have
							their way they would make perpetual war between Great-Britain and the
							United States He said that was very true. But that we did not seem to
							think the complaints of the great inconveniences suffered by the
							British, in consequence of our fishermen frequenting their coast, were
							well founded. I said we knew very well there was the inconvenience of
							competition. Their fishermen would be better satisfied if they had the
							whole Coast to themselves— This was an old inconvenience which had
							always existed when the fishery was common to the French and English—
							The competition also sometimes gave rise to quarrels between the
							fishermen of the different Nations— That was an inconvenience, but it
							did not affect the question of right. He said he alluded to the
							opportunities afforded for smuggling. I said there might have been
							something in that, at one particular period of time before the late War;
							when large American ships went there and took Cargoes for Europe— A
							state of things which probably would never happen again— Our fishing
							vessels now and in all ordinary times were small; without Cargoes;
							frequenting chiefly a desert Coast, where there could be no smuggling. I
							thought there was very little cause for such complaint now— The case of
							one of our vessels seized last Summer at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Andrew’s about which I had written to him, shewed there was much more
							suspicion than real smuggling on that Coast— As to the proposal, which
							was to have been made to the British Government, and which had hitherto
							been delayed, its postponement had been owing to difficulties which had
							been discovered since it was promised. It was founded on the principle
							of assuming a range of Coast within given Latitudes, for our fishermen
							to frequent, and abandoning the right to fish for the rest— But the fish
							themselves resorted at different times to different parts of the Coast,
							and a place which might be selected as very eligible now, might be in
							the course of four or five years entirely deserted. For my own part I
							had always been averse to any proposal of accommodation— I thought our
							whole right as stipulated by the Treaty of 1783 so clear, that I was for
							maintaining the whole, and if force should be applied to prevent our
							fishermen from frequenting the Coast, I would have protested against it,
							and reserved the right of recovering the whole by force, whenever we
							should be able. It had however been determined, otherwise here, and a
							proposal had been promised. Perhaps we should ultimately offer to give
							up the right of drying and curing on the shore, and reserve the whole
							right of fishing— He said that whatever was done, he hoped to hear from
							me again soon, upon this, and the other subjects of this interview—
								<persRef ref="lee-william">W. Lee</persRef> called upon me to

								Pleasonton</persRef> the Auditor— There was in the year 1811 an
