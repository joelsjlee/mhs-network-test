								ref="onis-luis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis</persRef>; he
							said he had some; but had reserved them for the general Cabinet meeting
							at which he had expected it would be considered— The President had told
							me it would be sufficient to give it separately to each of the heads of
							departments, for examination and remark, without submitting it to a
							cabinet meeting. Now however he directed a meeting for that purpose
							to-morrow at Noon— And at my request the Answer to be given to <persRef
								ref="pazos-vincente">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pazos</persRef>,
							is also to be then considered— The President likewise told me, that
								<persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> L.
								Harris</persRef> had been with him, and with many declarations of
							his respect for me, and his belief of my integrity, had intimated the

							himself might be referred to two others of the heads of Departments to
							Report upon the whole subject to him— I told the President, I should be
							perfectly satisfied that the affair should take this course, or any
							other that would be satisfactory to him and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Harris, and relieve me from having any thing further to do
							with the affair. I had candidly told Harris my opinion upon his case,
							and that if he had continued in Office, I should have felt it my duty to
							pursue the subject further. But that as he was no longer in the public
							service, I was under no obligation to act upon it— I knew indeed that he
							was desirous of obtaining a new appointment, and if he could satisfy the
							President of his integrity, he might apply directly to him, without
							addressing himself at all to the Department of State— I should be
							satisfied with any determination the President should finally make in
							the case; provided my opinion concerning it should not be asked—
								<persRef ref="everett-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> A.

								>President’s</persRef> at Noon, where there was a full

							noticed by <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi

							which had been so completely discussed at Aranjuez, that I had omitted

								>r</hi> Crawford thought that this paper ought to contain a complete
							exposition of our whole controversy with Spain, and that no essential
							part of our argument ought to be omitted even if it was contained in
							previous papers; I acquiesced in his opinion, though the President
							thought that the addition of one or two sentences would be sufficient—
							There was also some consideration about the answer to be given to
								<persRef ref="pazos-vincente">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pazos</persRef>, and finally determined that I should draft a
							written answer, to be considered by the President— It was just upon five

							has it seems obtained more than his share, and Silsbee is not willing to
							be satisfied with what is left. But I am not authorized to judge between
							adverse claims to the Money; and still less between a claim yet open,
							and one already settled— I also called at <persRef

							wife <persRef ref="smith-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Smith</persRef>, is suffering very severely in the same manner;
							which obliged him to go to Baltimore for some days. He came back
							yesterday— He took occasion to hint again the desire of his <persRef
								ref="smith-john2">Son</persRef>, to go abroad in a public Character,
							and said we should want a rich man to go to Russia. I drafted a Report
							to the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> on the papers to
							be submitted to Congress relative to the Spanish Negotiation. By his
							direction I left it with him. At the Office I had a succession of
							visitors, all the morning. <persRef ref="lucas-john">Judge
								Lucas</persRef> of the Missouri territory; very much dissatisfied
							with the nomination and appointment of <persRef ref="wash-r">R.
								Wash</persRef> as U.S. Attorney for that territory. I told him that
							Wash was recommended by the Governor of the territory <persRef
								ref="clark-william">Clarke</persRef>. He said he supposed so, and it
							was the worst recommendation that could have been given— That territory
							has been torn to pieces by opposite factions ever since it was
							constituted; and Lucas has been one of the most ardent partizans among
							them— His <persRef ref="lucas-charles">Son</persRef> was the last U.S.
							Attorney there, and was killed last Summer in a duel, which sprung from
							these party feuds. Lucas spoke also against a <persRef
								ref="ofallon-unknown">Captain O’Fallon</persRef> who is also a
							Candidate to be receiver of monies at a new Land-Office opened there,
							and is recommended also by Governor Clarke, and by <persRef
								ref="pope-john">J</persRef> and <persRef ref="pope-nathaniel">N.
								Pope</persRef>— Lucas hinted that the Governor, and Wash and
							O’Fallon all had <pb type="ms" n="317"/>a personal interest to favour a
							certain unfounded claim to lead mines in the territory, called <persRef
								ref="dubuc-unknown">Dubuc’s</persRef> claim, which <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> had declared to be unwarranted, for which he
							referred me to the compilation of the land-laws— He said also that Wash
							had published an unprovoked and insolent pamphlet against him; and as
							evidence that he himself took no part in the political contests, he
							stated that he had not voted at all at the last election of a delegate
							for the Territory; when the contest was between <persRef
								ref="scott-john">Scott</persRef> and <persRef ref="easton-unknown"
								>Easton</persRef>. He said there had been two other Candidates for
							the Office of Attorney, besides Wash— <persRef ref="chamberlain-unknown"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chamberlin</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="wheler-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wheler</persRef>, both New-Englandmen—respectable and quiet

								>r</hi> Wheler might have had the appointment; to give more weight
							in the Territory to the peaceable tranquil character of New-England;
							instead of the restless and turbulent, and overbearing Spirit of
							Virginia and Kentucky— Master Lucas is a knowing one; and thought he
							knew his man, when he said this— He would not have talked thus to the
							President— <persRef ref="roberts-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Roberts</persRef> of the Senate came next, to have some

							was followed by <persRef ref="blake-george">G. Blake</persRef>, who came
							for a written statement concerning his official conduct on some of the
							South-American privateering Affairs— He sent this Statement to the
							President, and wishes now to have it returned— It cannot be found at the
							President’s— I advised Blake to see <persRef
								ref="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>, the Secretary of the Treasury, and explain to
							him the transaction of his going to Portland— He asked me from whom the
							information of the fact had come— I told him from the Collector at
							Portland. He went accordingly to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford
							at the Treasury. The two Members of the House of Representatives from
							Rhode-Island, <persRef ref="burrill-james">Burrell</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="boss-john">Boss</persRef>, and the Senator, <persRef
								ref="hunter-william">Hunter</persRef> came to make an application in

							Consul at Buenos Ayres; and they brought me a Letter from some American
							lately from Buenos Ayres, to Halsey’s father expressing his belief that
							Halsey had not been concerned in the Buenos Ayres privateering— I shewed
							to these Gentlemen Halsey’s own Letter to <persRef ref="dewolf-james">De
								Wolfe</persRef>, and all the blank Commissions he had sent for a
							privateer, to which they had nothing to reply— <persRef
								ref="otis-harrison">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="amory-rufus">R. G. Amory</persRef> then came, and made

							Consul at Amsterdam. <persRef ref="johnson-henry">M<hi

								Newcomb</persRef>, for dividends on 6 and 3 per Cent U.S. Stocks for
							which I gave a receipt as his Attorney— The Power had been sent me by my

							Bank. The Dividends were from 1. Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1796
							to 30. June 1816— I took a draft on the Branch Bank at Boston for the

						<p><pb type="ms" n="318"/><date>9. VI:15.</date> I called at <persRef
								ref="pleasonton-stephen">Pleasonton’s</persRef> Office about my
							Accounts. <persRef ref="harris-levett">L. Harris</persRef> was there— In
							explaining some of the charges against which objections are made, I
							found that Pleasonton who is the Auditor left the whole business to a
							Clerk in his Office, named <persRef ref="ross-unknown">Ross</persRef>;
							and whenever I shewed Pleasonton that he had committed an error in the
							examination he was obliged to call up Ross to explain how it had
							happened— They insisted that I had charged twice over a Plate for
							Passports in England— The last time I saw Pleasonton I proved to him
							that it was not and could not be so— He was then fully convinced; but
							this day without a shadow of reason he had got it into his head again;
							and I was obliged to prove again not only to him but to his Clerk Ross
							that they were mistaken; and even then he would not give it up— This to
							my extreme Mortification put me out of temper, and I scolded Pleasonton
							in a manner richly deserved by him, but most unworthy of me— Ross told
							me that if I had produced no vouchers at all, for contingencies, he
							would have passed all my charges without asking a question; but as I had
							produced vouchers he allowed nothing, that was not vouched— I had
							expressly told Pleasonton that there were some charges for which I had
							taken no vouchers, and could take none— But Pleasonton had not told Ross
							this and now persevered in cavilling and quibbling against conviction— I
							called at <persRef ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Anderson</persRef> the Comptroller’s Office; and there found a
								<persRef ref="casaux-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Casaux</persRef>, a Canadian, complaining that Congress had last
							Session, been swindled out of a law granting upwards of 40000 dollars to
							a pretended agent of his <persRef ref="cazeaux-gerard"
								>father’s</persRef>; and asserting that his claim as the
							representative of his father was still unsatisfied. This law of last
							Session was obtained by <persRef ref="stuart-unknown">Captain
								Stuart</persRef>, who went to England as <persRef
								ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Aspinwall’s</persRef> Secretary, and there got hold of this claim
							through <persRef ref="grubb-james">Grubb</persRef>, from a man named
								<persRef ref="corbaux-unknown">Corbaux</persRef>, who pretended to
							be Assignee and Attorney irrevocable of Casaux— Corbaux did apply to me
							about the claim, while I was in England, and I thought it not worth a
							dollar— At the <persRef ref="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> I left
							with him my Report on the late Negotiation in Holland— At the Office, I
							had <persRef ref="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bagot</persRef> conversing two hours upon various subjects— The
							recovery of deserting Seamen—Colonial trade; the Plaister of Paris Law
							in New Brunswic and its repeal; and the disarming on the Lakes. I have
							no time to detail the particulars of our Conversation upon these points
							though on all it was important— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"

									>r</hi> John O’Sullivan</persRef> came to my house. He had
							obtained a Commission as Consul at Mogadore in the Empire of Morocco;
							which having been found contrary to the Law of 1. May 1810 was a few
							days since revoked. He now came to ask for the appointment as Consul at
							Teneriffe, and having heard complaints against his conduct had been made
							wished to be informed what they were, and an opportunity to refute them.
							He was aware they had been made by <persRef ref="riley-james">Captain
								Riley</persRef>, and attributed them to resentment at his having
							taken measures while as Consul at Mogadore, to vindicate the reputation
							of certain merchants there, defamed by Captain Riley’s Narrative. I told
							him that I had received a Letter from Captain Riley containing
							imputations against him— That the substance of them should be made known
							to him, and an opportunity given him to justify himself against them.
							Afterwards I received a Letter from him asking for a copy of Riley’s
							Letter against him— When I called at the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef>, he was out riding; but on his return he sent
							me word he was at home, and I went to him— <persRef ref="porter-peter"
								>General P. B. Porter</persRef> and <persRef ref="elliot-jonathan"

							and the latter upon a Petition to the House of Representatives, asking
							for the Patronage of Congress to a project of printing two or three
							Volumes of domestic State papers; which Petition, the House have
							referred to the Secretary of State— Elliot is to furnish me a paper
							containing the particulars of his plan, and a list of the documents he
							proposes to publish— I called at the Office of the <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Secretary of War</persRef>, but did not find
							him—and at that of the <persRef ref="crowninshield-benjamin">Secretary

							and then to go to Copenhagen for the mutineers of the Plattsburg— There
							was some question whether the order of the West-India stages of the
							Voyage should not be changed; but we concluded to leave it as it had
							been settled— I had called again at <persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen"
								>Pleasonton’s</persRef> Office this Morning about my accounts, and
							had gone further explanation with him and <persRef ref="ross-unknown"
								>Ross</persRef> concerning them— I admitted some of the deductions
							which they had made; all that upon examination I had found to be errors
							in my accounts; and they amounted altogether only to a few dollars— I
							also proved to them again their own errors, which they at last both
							admitted— I am now to see the <persRef ref="anderson-joseph"
								>Comptroller</persRef> on the principle of allowance which they have
							adopted, and stated my objections to it in writing. <persRef

								Babcock</persRef> as Consular Agent at the Isle of Bourbon; where he
							has been residing these ten years; with a certificate in his favour from
							several respectable Merchants of Boston— I shewed these papers to the

							Office, <persRef ref="ross-unknown">Ross</persRef> the Clerk in <persRef
								ref="pleasonton-stephen">Pleasonton’s</persRef> Office came again to
							discuss the question about the mode of calculating the number of days
							for the fractions of Quarters in my accounts, at the commencement and

							the number of days in proportion to the year; and the last account being
							for part of a quarter, I had reckoned for the number of days in
							proportion to the whole Quarter; and after this explanation I told him I
							would contend no more about it—they might settle it as they pleased.
								<persRef ref="harris-levett">L. Harris</persRef> came to the Office,

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodde</persRef> of Revel, nor
							should I, unless called upon by them to know, if I had any information
							upon the subject, say any thing to them about it— That if they should
							call upon me, I had a minute of what Rodde told me, taken in writing at
							the time (v. Journal 14. May 1814 vol. 4. p. 102.) the substance of
							which I should state to them. He desired me, if that should be the case,
							I would also point the attention of those Gentlemen to the letter from
							the same D. Rodde to him, which he has promised in his defence, which I
							promised him I would— He also spoke about his nephew <persRef
								ref="harris-john">J. L. Harris</persRef>, and his quarrel with
								<persRef ref="lewis-william">Lewis</persRef>. He was very sorry to
							find upon examination that his nephew had been wrong in his conduct on

							express removal of young Harris; he Levett should write to him, and
							advise him to come home— I told him that would be the best manner of
							terminating the affair, and of sparing the feelings of all the parties—
							I called upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun, the Secretary of

							yesterday was 124. to 28. <persRef ref="sergeant-john"
								>Sergeant</persRef> asked me last Evening if there would be any

						<p><date>18. V:45.</date> Walking this Morning to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, I met <persRef
								key="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef>
							who turned and walked with me. He told me that he had received Letters
							from <persRef ref="milne-david">Admiral Milne</persRef> commanding on
							the Jamaica Station, informing him that he had issued orders similar to
							those of last year, to seize all American Vessels, which may be found
							fishing within the British Jurisdiction; and that he could not take upon
							himself the responsibility of counteracting those orders. He had been
							promised a proposal from us, ever since last May, and had received none
							yet— I told him that the President’s illness had prevented it— That upon
							full enquiry it had been found that we could not safely accept any
							particular limited bounds for fishing grounds; because the fish resorted
							at different times to different places— That <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> had promised me,
							he would direct certain statements to be furnished to us, upon which we
							might have founded proposals which was not done; that he should
							counteract Admiral Milne’s Order, because the judge at Halifax had
							decided last year that those seizures were unlawful without an Act of
							Parliament— That I was afraid we should have to fight for this matter in
							the end, and I was so confident of our right that I was for it— He said
							the correctness of the judge’s decision was very doubtful. That
							Great-Britain had gone as far in this affair to accommodate us as she
							could go; and he thought would do nothing further &amp;c. He thanked me
							for having set <persRef ref="onis-luis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Onis</persRef> right, in my note to him, about a British Mediation;
							and said Onis’s statement of the case must have been a wilful
							misrepresentation— At the President’s we saw him in his Bedchamber— Met
							there <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef>; who upon reflection has concluded
							not to press his Bill for the repeal of all discriminating duties; but
							to leave it on the foundation of my Report, and so that Congress if they
							choose to go further may do it of their own movement. The President
							asked me to draft a Message for him to send in with my Report— At the
							Office, I had as visitors, <persRef ref="mason-john">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> John Mason</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="lee-william">W. Lee</persRef> and <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef> the French Minister, and <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>.
							Mason came about a Letter from <persRef ref="skinner-john">J. S.
								S.</persRef> at Baltimore, concerning <persRef
								ref="macgregor-gregor">M’Gregor</persRef>; and enclosing one from
							M’Gregor to him. Mason had given these Letters to the President; who now
							enquired whether Mason was willing they should be communicated to
							Congress. Mason has written to enquire of Skinner, who in his answer
							demurs, but in another private Note to Mason adds circumstantial
							instances in proof of M’Gregor’s want of principle and veracity. Mason
							said he would write again to Skinner on the subject. Lee came to give me
							a hint on a very ridiculous affair; but which shews how I am situated;
							my office as Secretary of State; makes it the interest of all the
							partizans of the Candidates for the next Presidency to say no more; to
							deny me as much as possible in the public opinion— The most conspicuous
							of these Candidates, are Crawford, the Secretary of the Treasury,
								<persRef ref="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>, the Speaker of the House
							of Representatives, and <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">DeWitt
								Clinton</persRef>, Governor of New York. Clay expected himself to
							have been Secretary of State, and he and all his creatures were
							disappointed by my appointment. He is therefore coming out as the head
							of a new Opposition in Congress to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe’s Administration; and he makes no scruple of giving the tone to
							all his party in running me down— On the publication of the concluding
							part of my late Letter to Onis, he went about the House of
							Representatives, shewing and sneering at a passage where it is said that
							the United States after waiting thirteen years for justice from Spain,
							could without much effort wait somewhat longer. Clinton’s party operate
							in another way— There was published lately in the National Advocate, a
							New York Newspaper in opposition to Clinton, a Letter purporting to be
							from an agent of Clinton’s to another named <persRef ref="clark-asahal"
								>Asahal Clark</persRef>, and detailing a journey of intrigue in the
							State of Vermont, to secure partizans in favour of Clinton. The Letter
							is signed E. W. Robinson— Clark who is a real personage and now at
							Washington has published repeated disavowals of having ever been engaged
							in any such transactions, and certificates that there is no such person
							in Vermont, as E. W. Robinson— The Letter appears therefore to be a
							forgery, and the Clintonian’s turn it back as a battery against the
							National Advocate and its Editor <persRef ref="noah-mordecai">M. M.
								Noah</persRef>. Lee’s visit to me, was to tell me, that it was
							whispered <pb type="ms" n="322"/>about that Noah had received a Letter
							franked by me; and that it was to advise him to say no more about the
							Robinson Letter. The remarkable part of this affair, is that Noah did
							actually receive lately a Letter from me, which was to call upon him to
							refund to the Government of the United States, a sum of 1000 dollars,
							which Noah, upon being recalled from Tunis as Consul of the United
							States there, had left due for two years house rent, and which <persRef
								ref="shaler-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaler</persRef>
							upon his late visit to Tunis, found himself bound to pay, from the
							public monies— On these facts I observe three things— 1. The espionage
							of Clinton’s partizans, discovering the fact that Noah had received a
							Letter, franked by me. 2. Their suspicious inference that a letter to
							Noah franked by me, must relate to the Robinson Letter. 3. Their policy,
							in circulating a report founded on this false inference, that I am
							intriguing underhandedly against Clinton, and had some concern in the
							publication of the Robinson Letter— Of Crawford’s rivalry, I have yet
							had no other evidence than what has seemed to me a sort of effort to
							differ from me in opinions concerning the important measures to be
							pursued by the administration; &amp; a disposition to impress upon my
							Mind, every particular of Clay’s operations against me— When <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">Everett</persRef> was here he asked me, if
							it would not be advisable, to expose Clay’s conduct and motives in the
							Newspapers, to which I answered very explicitly in the negative— He also
							asked me if I was determined to do nothing with a view to promote my
							future election to the Presidency as the successor of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe— I told him I should do absolutely
							nothing— He said that as others would not be so scrupulous, I should not
							stand upon equal footing with them— I told him that was not my fault. My
							business was to serve the public to the best of my abilities, in the
							station assigned to me, and not to intrigue for further advancement— I
							never by the most distant hint to any one ever expressed a wish for any
							public Office; and I should not now begin to ask, for that which of all
							others ought to be most freely and spontaneously bestowed— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> De Neuville’s visit was to speak upon
							various subjects concerning which he has written to me—<persRef
								ref="haff-lawrence">Lawrence Haff</persRef>—Le Gros, the French
							vessels carried to Amelia-Island; but especially the expedition of the
								<persRef ref="lallemand-charles;lallemand-henri" type="multi"
								>L’Allemands</persRef>, who he says have arrived at New Orleans; and
							of their Associates who have landed at Galvezton— He says Onis has
							protested to him upon his honour, that he knows nothing of them or their
							project— I told him he might rely upon it that Onis did know something
							of them— He said that as they were Frenchmen, and most of them might
							return to France if they chose, it would be equally displeasing to his
							Government, whether their projects were against the United States or
							Spain— <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sergeant</persRef> spent a couple of hours with me, this Evening—
							The subject of the Neutrality Laws is before Congress. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay pushes for the repeal of Laws, which
							trammel the means of giving aid to the South-American Revolutionists;
							and there is no member of the House of Representatives friendly to the
							Administration, who has Spirit, and Ability and Mastery of the Subject,
							adequate to withstand him— The federalists hitherto have taken little or
							no share in the debate.</p>

						<p><date>22. VI:30.</date> Easter Sunday— It has been a great question in
							the Newspapers whether Easter ought this year to be this day or the Next
							Sunday. This day was the real full moon; but the full moon of the
							Almanac is I believe a day sooner. <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>, Chairman of the
							Committee of Foreign Relations called upon me. He came to ask for the

							proposed Mediation of England, between the United States and Spain; and
							also of what passed between <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef> and me respecting Florida. Forsyth told me the
							Committee had it in contemplation to propose a Bill authorizing the
							President to take possession of East Florida, and asked me, if I should
							have any objection to it— I told him, personally none. If Congress chose
							to assume that attitude with Spain, and encounter its responsibility, so
							far as I should have to share it as a member of the Administration I was
							prepared for it— But I added, for the sense of the Administration you
							must ask the opinion of the <persRef ref="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef>, and not mine— I believe the President’s
							opinion is not in favour of that measure. He said he had seen the
							President, and found him averse to it; but he should nevertheless be
							disposed to present it— The Chairman of the Committee of Foreign
							Relations has always been considered as a member in the Confidence of
							the Executive, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth acted thus at
							the last Session— The President has hitherto considered him as perfectly
							confidential, and directed me to communicate freely to him the documents
							concerning foreign Affairs, particularly those with Spain, which I have
							done. Early in the course of the Session of Congress, I observed a
							paragraph circulating in the Newspapers, intimating that the Chairman of
							the Committee of Foreign Relations was destined to a Mission abroad, and
							Prussia was specially named as the Court to which he would be
							accredited. <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> who has been marshaling his forces for a system of
							regular opposition to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s
							Administration, in sneering hints and inuendo’s has been continually
							stinging Forsyth, as if he were a dependent tool of the Executive.
							Forsyth is a man of mild amiable disposition, and good talents, but
							neither by weight of character, force of genius or keenness of Spirit,
							at all able to cope with Clay. He has suffered himself to be goaded by
							Clay, not only into disavowals of any subserviency to the views of the
							Executive; and to declarations in the face of the house that he did not
							care a fig for the Administration or any member of it; but into the
							humour of proposing measures which the President utterly disapproves—
							From mere horror of being thought the tool of the Executive he has made
							himself the tool of Clay’s opposition. To manifest his Independence he
							has given broad hints of an intention to propose measures of actual
							hostility against Spain, and now is so far committed that he cannot
							withdraw from them. I told him that nothing had passed in writing on the
							subject of the mediation, but that if it was desired the substance of my
							Conversations with Lord Castlereagh concerning Florida, would be
							communicated to the Committee— <persRef ref="buchanan-susan">Susan
								Buchanan</persRef> returned from <persRef ref="frye-carolina">M<hi

								18</persRef>. there had been a deliberation of his Council, whether
							they should not declare War against the United States— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> De Neuville appeared to be much offended

							struck with his manner, and spoke to me of it— I made light of it. De

						<p><date>27. VI:30.</date> I received yesterday a French Note from a person
							calling himself <persRef ref="antinori-joseph">Joseph
							Antinori</persRef>, requesting me to appoint a time when I could receive
							him; for which I appointed this Morning at ten O’Clock. He came and with
							a mysterious air and manner told me that his family name was really
							Antinori, but that he was the Duke de Brindisi a Neopolitan— That he had
							arrived about a month since at Philadelphia, whither he should
							immediately return and embark for Europe. He came upon a secret mission
							from one of the greatest Ministers of the State of the Age— From
								<persRef ref="metternick-klemons">Prince Metternick</persRef> the
							Austrian prime Minister. He came to tell me that a Treaty was concluded
							two years ago, at Rome, between Austria and England entirely by secret,
							signed by <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Stewart</persRef> for
							England, and by <persRef ref="lebzeltern-ludwig">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lebzeltern</persRef> for Austria, against Russia— That
							in consequence of that Treaty and of the projects of Russia, which it
							was intended to counteract, the European Powers were preparing for War,
							which would soon break out— That <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron
								Tuyll</persRef> would very shortly arrive here as Russian Minister.
							(We know that Tuyll’s destination is changed and that <persRef
								ref="poletica-pierre">Poletica</persRef> is coming in his stead)
							that he would come with many compliments, and fair words, and
							cajoleries, and would make propositions to us, to take side with her in
							the War— That he himself was instructed to come here, and by indirect
							means, to seek and obtain my acquaintance; to sound my opinions, and
							those of the Government and Public, here: but he had preferred coming to
							the point at once— He had therefore asked an interview of me, and he was
							charged to enquire, if the United States were favourably inclined to
							receive propositions from Austria, to take a part in this alliance
							against Russia, or whether they would determine to remain neutral. That
							as propositions would certainly be made to us by the Russian Minister;
							he on his part was instructed to say that if we would join in the
							Alliance of Austria and England, one object of which would be to break
							up the Russian Settlements on the North-west Coast of America, Austria
							would engage to secure to us, an Establishment in the Mediterranean,
							which we had been desirous of obtaining— I told him I should report to
							the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> the substance of his
							communication; but he must be aware the President would enquire if he
							had produced any evidence of his being authorized to make it. He would
							not require a fo<unclear>rma</unclear>l Letter of Credence, but
							something to shew his authority would be indispensable— He said that
							hereafter he had no doubt he should be regularly accredited, and would
							spin out into forty Notes, what he had now disclosed in a quarter of an
							hour; but that the manner of the Austrian Government was to begin by <pb
								type="ms" n="326"/>suggestions of unaccredited agents, and if they
							found their propositions were acceptable to pursue the object further— I
							told him that it would not be necessary, for him to come to me again for
							an answer— That the Austrian Government might be sure any proposal
							coming from them would be received and considered with all the respect
							due to them; but no answer whatever could be given to anything proposed
							by a person totally unaccredited. He said he should return to-morrow
							towards Philadelphia, and in a few days embark for Europe— But as some
							notice might be taken of his having been in conference with me, there
							was another subject which he wished to give out, as his motive for
							obtaining it— He then presented me a paper, containing a petition for a
							grant of Lands to Italian emigrants; also for a privilege to set up, and
							carry on a Lotto Lottery, engaging to pay an annuity, and to furnish a
							frigate of forty guns, ready built and equipped, six years successively
							for the privilege. I told him that every application for a grant of
							Land, must be made to Congress, and that for a Lottery to the State
							Legislatures. He finally asked if he might report to the Austrian
							Government that, if they thought proper to accredit him to the United
							States, there would be no personal objection to him, on the part of this
							Government. I told him that not having the honour of any personal
							acquaintance with him, and presuming that he was equally unknown to the
							President, there could be no personal objection to him as an official
							agent of Austria, if she should think proper to accredit him— He then
							left me in doubt whether to consider him as an imposter, or a lunatic. I
							had afterwards some slight suspicions that he might be an emissary from
								<persRef ref="dashkov-andrei">Daschkoff</persRef>, to entrap the
							Executive of the United States; at least so as to countenance a charge
							of having listened to proposals hostile to Russia— The man named
								<persRef ref="king-unknown3">King</persRef>, a workman at the
							Navy-Yard came with his <persRef ref="moore-unknown">daughter</persRef>,
							wife to a man named <persRef ref="moore-j">J. P. Moore</persRef>, an
							American, Master of the Successo, one of <persRef ref="aury-louis"
								>Aury’s</persRef> piratical privateers— He brought two Letters from
							Moore dated 17. and 18 of this Month at Charleston where he is in prison
							at the prosecution of the Spanish Consul— He also writes that Aury is in
							prison there— King said <persRef ref="middleton-henry">Governor
								Middleton</persRef> had promised him to support a petition to the
							President to direct the prosecution against Moore to be dropp’d—
								<persRef ref="watmough-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							from its mouth to above New-Orleans which he has been lately taking— At
							the Office, <persRef ref="tencate-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> ten
								Cate</persRef>, the Chargé d’Affaires from the Netherlands came to
							converse with me, concerning the late Message and Report, upon the
							Negotiation with the Netherlands— He expressed himself to be in general
							well pleased with it, but said it seemed to manifest a determination not
							to renew the negotiation. I told him that was not at all intended— We
							should readily renew the Negotiation, if desired by his Government, and
							if they had any expedient to propose, by which the two obstacles to the
							conclusion of the Treaty, which had occasioned the suspension of the
							negotiation could be removed— That the difficulty on our part was
							occasioned solely by the difficulty on their’s— We were willing to give
							up ours, if they would abandon theirs. He asked if there was any
							question whether the Treaty of 1782 was yet in force. I said none— We
							considered it as yet in full force. He said his Government did the same—
							He made various other remarks, and said <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi

							said in a Speech, that this Government had sent a Minister to the

						<p><date>28. V:30.</date> At the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef> this Morning, I had the voluminous despatches
							from <persRef ref="erving-george">G. W. Erving</persRef>, at Madrid, and
							from <persRef ref="worthington-william">Worthington</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="halsey-thomas">Halsey</persRef> at Buenos Ayres to
							read, but the President though convalescent is yet so weak, that he
							declined hearing them wholly read, and asked me to state the substance
							of them to him— When I told him that Worthington, one of the informal
							agents sent to South America, to collect information had been concluding
							a Treaty there; he said with quick and irritated tone—Dismiss him
							instantly—Recall him—Dismiss him! Now, to think what recommendations
							that man had! Dismiss him at once! and send him the notice of his
							dismission, by every possible channel— Send it to Halsey; though Halsey
							himself is recalled— However the Commissioners when they arrived there
							will have set all right— He then spoke to me of the Pennsylvania Militia
							fines; upon which he has adopted the opinion of the Attorney-General
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef>, though opposite to that which he had formed before—
							He said he had misapprehended the facts. He desired me to examine
							particularly the question, and if I should come to a conclusion
							different from that of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt, to delay the
							answer till further consideration. But the subject which seems to absorb
							all the faculties of his mind, is the violent systematic opposition that
								<pb type="ms" n="327"/><persRef ref="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> is
							raising against his Administration. Clay appears to have made up his
							Account to succeed Monroe in the Presidency, and supported his Election,
							in the expectation of being appointed Secretary of State. In this he was
							disappointed, and though offered the War Department declined accepting
							it, and from that moment formed the project of rising upon the ruin of
							the Administration— He therefore took opposition ground upon all the
							cardinal points of Policy, taken by the President, but most especially
							upon the Constitutional question concerning internal improvement and
							upon South American Affairs— On the Amelia-Island Affair, at the very
							outset of the Session of Congress he pronounced himself against it, and
							as one of his own Kentucky papers stated, broke ground within battering
							distance of the Message— From that day to this he has been indefatigable
							in every private company where he has been, in expressing disapprobation
							of that transaction, and of the mission to South America— The President
							told me that last Evening a Member of the Senate came to him and asked
							him, if at the Cabinet Meetings before the Commencement of the Session
							of Congress, the determination was taken not to acknowledge the
							Government of Buenos Ayres, professedly to the end that Congress might
							take the lead in the measure— And this was now enquired, obviously with
							a view to justify the present conduct of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay. The President answered that at that time the Questions were
							proposed, whether the Executive was competent to acknowledge the
							Independence of Buenos Ayres, and if so, whether it was expedient. That
							it had been concluded the Executive was competent. But that it was not
							expedient to take the step, without the certainty of being supported in
							it by the public opinion; which if decidedly favourable to the measure
							would be manifested by measures of Congress. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe added, that if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							had taken the ground that the Executive had gone as far as he could go
							with propriety towards the acknowledgment of the South Americans; that
							he was well disposed to go further, if such were the feeling of the
							Nation and of Congress; and had made his Motion with that view, to
							ascertain the real Sentiments of Congress, it might have been in perfect
							harmony with the Executive. But between that and the angry, acrimonious
							course pursued by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay there was a wide
							difference— At the Office, I had a visit from <persRef
								ref="bernard-simon">General Bernard</persRef> and his Aid, with
								<persRef ref="lee-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W.
								Lee</persRef>—and afterwards from <persRef ref="sanford-nathan">M<hi

							was absent, his brother <persRef ref="brent-robert2">Robert’s</persRef>

							it— As our interest is to promote the total Independence of the

							the next Session, if I should be then yet here, with a better method of
							transacting the business. Congress have agreed to adjourn the 20<hi

							The <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> illness has
