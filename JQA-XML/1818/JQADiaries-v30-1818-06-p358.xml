							The weather which is warm and rainy, with my necessary occupations

							told him that I knew nothing of that— My objections and observations

						<p><date>3. V:45.</date> Morning much wasted. At the Office <persRef
								ref="graham-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G.
								Graham</persRef> came and took his final instructions. It is always
							embarrassing to settle the compensation for these anomalous services. In
							this case the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> said the
							analogy that occurred to him as proper, was an equality with the pay of
							a member of Congress. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham’s expences
							were to be paid; and I thought the addition of five dollars a day would
							make that equality. The President directed me to fix it at that— He had
							however spoken himself of six dollars a day. Graham however seems to
							think it not enough. He said he had told the President that as he had
							intended, independent of this appointment to make a tour this Summer to
							the Alabama Territory, and as his expences would be paid, he should
							receive no other compensation; for there was no compensation in money,
							which would induce him to go upon such an expedition as this, at this
							Season of the year— I am curious to see how this pretension will end—
							Whether upon his return, he will quietly take his five dollars a day,
							and expences? Whether his expences will amount to less than three
							dollars a day: (to equalize his pay with that of a member of Congress)
							and whether his disinterested obligingness to the President, will
							eventuate in pretensions to better offices?— He also shewed me two
							Letters recommendatory of <persRef ref="graham-john">his brother
								John</persRef>; one from <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef> to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, and the other from M<hi

							the Event of <persRef ref="sumter-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sumter’s</persRef> return home; which is now to be remembered;
							Sumter having positively asked for his recall— But George says his

							change his mind— I took a long walk with <persRef

							Campbell has a great aversion to having <persRef ref="pinkney-charles"
								>Charles Pinkney</persRef>, on account of his youth, and
							inexperience; but since <persRef ref="pinkney-william">W.
								Pinkney</persRef> has asked for the place for his Son, he feels
							himself somewhat delicately situated, not knowing how to decline— The
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> agreed with him that
							the appointment should be postponed till he reaches Boston, but Campbell
							strongly intimated to me that <hi rend="italic">his</hi> choice was
							fixed, and he <hi rend="italic">should</hi> offer it to Gray— He even
							proposed to me to write to Gray and sound him, whether he would incline
							to go. I thought it best however to leave it to himself; and to take no

							Martinique— That the deputy Collector at New York had demanded a tonnage
							duty of 2 1/2 dollars a ton, as upon a foreign vessel coming from a
							Port, where American vessels are not allowed to go and trade. The French
							Consul had insisted that this regulation applied only to Merchant
							vessels and not to ships of War; to which <persRef ref="galston-unknown"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Galston</persRef> the Collector
							assented, but wished to have a line of Instruction from the Department—
							I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De Neuville that meant the
							Treasury Department, and referred him to <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>. We had some Conversation upon the French
							Colonial, excluding Laws, of which I complained, and told him I should
							hereafter remonstrate farther. He professed to be well disposed on that
							subject— Two foreigners came to the Office—one a native of Smyrna, named
								<persRef ref="yhary-unknown">Hiary</persRef>; who came to this
							Country with <persRef ref="mina-martin">Mina</persRef>, and being
							without employment and in want, offered his services, as a translator

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef> sent me a note
							asking an interview, for which I appointed 3 O’Clock. He came, and said

								<persRef ref="ambrister-robert">Ambrister</persRef>, and the
							occupation of Pensacola by <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General

							Court-Martials had been received— I told him they had not; nor any
							official account of the taking of Pensacola— I could without hesitation
							tell him however, that this measure was not authorized by the
							Government, and was unexpected. General Jackson’s despatches would no
							doubt disclose his motives, of which it was not possible to judge by
							anticipation— He said he had never for a moment believed that General
							Jackson had been authorised to take Pensacola— As to the case of the two
							men, he could not undertake to say before hand that there were no
							possible circumstances which would warrant their execution; he could not
							indeed imagine any; but the proceedings of the Court-Martial, might shew
							them.— As I was willing to change the subject of Conversation, I asked
							him if he had any late intelligence from England—particularly with
							regard to Spanish and South American Affairs— He had none— I said I
							wished that in writing to his Government he would remind <persRef

							made through him Bagot, last January, to communicate to us very shortly,
							what the allies were doing about South-America— He said he was convinced

							nothing further himself—that nothing further had been done. I mentioned
								<persRef ref="rioadaira-unknown">Rioadaira’s</persRef> Letter to

							from other sources, and which he might have communicated; and I desired
							him to urge upon his Government the necessity of communicating freely
							with us, of their acts and intentions, if they expected from us a course
							harmonizing with theirs— I then entered at large upon the question what
							the allies would and what they could do— And declared the conviction
							that there could be no rational interference of foreign powers in that
							quarrel, but on the basis of the Independence of the South Americans—to
							which he opposed nothing as argument— He finished by requesting me to
							ascertain whether British vessels would under our new Navigation Act, be
							admitted from Bermuda?— I received several despatches from Buenos Ayres,
							Chili, and Spain, which I immediately sent over to the President. After
