						<p><date>1. IV:30.</date> Saturday. Bath with <persRef ref="giusta-antoine"
								>Antoine</persRef>, at five— The tide had about an hour to rise.
								<persRef key="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bagot</persRef> called upon me at the Office, and we had
							conversation upon various subjects— The British Cabinet, and
							particularly <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef> have been much annoyed by the Report of a
							Committee of the House of Representatives at the last Session of
							Congress, which remarked that the four Articles proposed by Lord
							Castlereagh as a <pb type="ms" n="383"/>projected addition to the
							Commercial Convention of 3. July 1815. had been promptly rejected by
							this Government, although three of them might have been acceptable,
							because the fourth would have been incompatible with the policy of the
							United States of excluding foreigners from intercourse with the Indians
							within our territories— Lord Castlereagh has addressed a note on the
							subject to <persRef ref="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef>, disavowing any such intention, and asking by what
							course of reasoning the Committee came to their conclusion— We have not
							yet received a copy of this Note from Rush, but Lord Castlereagh sent
							one to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot, who shewed it to me. I told
							him that I could not say how the Committee had reasoned; having had no
							communication with them, other than that of transmitting the papers to
							them. He then spoke of our Navigation Act of the last Session, which
							requires that British Vessels laden in our Ports should give Bonds with
							securities, not to unlade their Cargoes, in any, Port from which Vessels
							of the United States are excluded. He complained that with regard to
							British vessels unequivocally engaged only in the direct trade between
							the British Ports in Europe and the United States, this provision
							subjected them to a charge, other than those to which the vessels of the
							United States are subject; and thus was incompatible with the Convention
							of 3 July 1815. particularly that part which required securities— This
							was to be strictly considered as an additional charge; which the owners
							of British vessels trading here, as strangers, could probably not
							effect, without paying a Commission which is usually charged in such
							cases— I told him that these Bonds could not be considered as an
							additional charge— That in bona-fide cases there could be no possible
							difficulty for the Masters of Vessels to obtain securities; as the most
							respectable merchants in the Country would very readily give them
							without charge, for the benefit of the consignment— That in a case
							bearing much analogy to this; I had addressed his Government, noticing a
								<hi rend="italic">restriction</hi> upon American vessels in England
							to which British vessels were not subject, as being a charge, within the
							intent of the Convention of 1815. but his Government did not agree with
							my reasoning or allow the restriction to be removed— However, if he
							would address me a Note on the subject, it should receive all proper
							consideration; and we should readily yield every accommodation
							compatible with the necessity of carrying our law into effective
							execution— He spoke also upon the fisheries—and said Lord Castlereagh
							had written him that orders had again been issued to the Naval Officers
							on the American station to suspend the captures of American fishing
							Vessels for the present Season— This measure had been taken, although
							the British Government had waited Month after Month to receive the
							proposals which had been so long and so frequently promised here— I told
							him that the delays which had occurred to the making of those proposals
							had not been intentional, but occasioned by the varying information
							which had been received from the parts of the Country most interested in
							the fisheries, and I added that if <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> and Rush to whom I
							should this day despatch the final instructions for their commercial
							negotiation should not be able to conclude an article upon this subject,
							it would be our wish that a final decision by the Lords of Appeal, on
							the legality of the captures of our fishing vessels should take place,
							upon a full and solemn argument of all the questions involved in it— I
							asked him whether Consuls of the United States would be admitted into
							the free-Ports established by the late Acts of Parliament? He said he
							did not see that there could be any objection to it, but perhaps the
							Governors might not feel themselves authorized to admit them. He would
							however immediately write to ascertain— I sent off to New-York the
							despatches for Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Gallatin and Rush—
								<persRef ref="pierce-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pierce</persRef> called at the Office, but I had no funds to pay for

						<p><date>8. V:</date> Resuming the researches necessary to prepare a Report
							upon Weights and Measures, I find my time again so absorbed by them that
							I can make scarce any progress with the Report itself. At the Office I
							found a Note from <persRef ref="aguirre-manuel">Don Manuel H de
								Aguirre</persRef> the Agent from Buenos Ayres, asking for <pb
								type="ms" n="385"/>an interview— I sent him a Note appointing three
							O’Clock for that purpose but it was four when he came, and he was with
							me an hour. He began by complaining of his having been arrested at
							New-York by a warrant from <persRef ref="livingston-henry">Judge
								Livingston</persRef>— He said that for some weeks past his house had
							been a mere house of Marshals and Sheriff’s and Officers of the Law.
							That he had once been arrested in the Streets, and once taken out of his
							bed at Midnight by processes at Law, commenced or instigated by the
								<persRef ref="stoughton-thomas">Spanish Consul</persRef>; though I
							had told him he might consider himself here as a public Minister— I told
							him that he had very much mistaken me; that I had very distinctly
							informed him that he could not be considered here as a Public Minister,
							for two reasons; one because the Government from which he came was not
							recognized; and the other because he had produced no credentials or
							powers as a Public Minister; his Commission, styling him only Agent, and
							his Letters to the President giving him no authority to negotiate,
							whatever— That upon both these grounds it was not in the power of the
							President to exempt or protect him from arrest— That no persons other
							than Public Ministers and their families were exempted from arrest; not
							even the President of the United States himself— He then went over the
							history of his mission to this Country— He was charged to build and
							despatch to the Government of Chili six Sloops of War, and came to this
							Country with two hundred thousand dollars in cash and a power to borrow
							two Millions— He was authorized to pledge the faith of both the
							Governments of Buenos-Ayres and Chili, for this loan; but the merchants
							here demanded other security, and said they would be satisfied with the
							Guaranty of the Government of the United States. He was also authorized
							to offer a profit of fifty per Cent upon the cost of the vessels to any
							Merchant who would dispatch them— Upon his arrival here he came and
							informed <persRef ref="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> of the object of his Mission, and he told him that
							nothing in the Law prevented the building and sending away the vessels
							as a commercial speculation— They had been built accordingly, and were
							now ready for Sea, with their Crews on board, lying at New-York at an
							expence of a thousand dollars a day— But the Spanish Consuls and Agents
							had seduced away some of his Officers and a part of his Crew. It was
							upon the Affidavits of some of his own Officers that he and his Captains
							had been arrested by warrants from judge Livingston. He had also been
							obliged to make an ostensible transfer of his two Ships to his Captains
								<persRef ref="delano-unknown">Delano</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="skinner-joseph">Skinner</persRef>, and to have them registered
							in their names. And now the Ships were attached to answer for the debts
							of those Captains. He found it therefore impracticable to execute the
							orders of his Government— His funds were exhausted, and his only
							resource now was to sell his vessels, just as they are. But they are
							built for vessels of War, and are not saleable for purposes of Commerce—
							He came therefore now to enquire if the Government of the United States
							would purchase them— I promised to lay the proposal before the
							President, and give him a verbal answer, as soon as I shall receive it.
							I asked him what price he would ask for the vessels. He said he could
							not now exactly tell; but if the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> thought the officer admissable he would
							immediately ascertain. I desired him to present his proposal in writing,
							and he said he would bring it at two O’Clock on Monday. It was near six
							when I came home, and the Evening was cool enough to admit of reading by
							Candle light, which I did.</p>

							against him in the State of New-York. That there is no security for any

							a member of Congress from New-York, and Son of <persRef
								ref="spencer-ambrose">Ambrose Spencer</persRef>— Porter expressed
							some apprehension that I had been personally unfriendly to him—and
							countenanced the charges against him last Winter— I assured him that his
							suspicion was entirely without foundation— He complained that the
							charges for his private expences were not allowed in addition to his
							Salary, while those of the Agent, whose Salary he said had been
							increased to equal that of the Commissioner, were allowed. He further
							insisted that the private expences of the Commissioners under the Treaty
							of 1794. had been allowed; and that the Salaries of the American
							Commissioners under that Treaty had been the same as those of the
							British Commissioners, and that it was £1200 Sterling each— I told him
							that I had settled the agreement with <persRef ref="grenville-william"
								>Lord Grenville</persRef> upon this subject myself, but he still
							persisted that <persRef ref="barclay-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Barclay</persRef> had told him it was otherwise—that he
							had received £1200 though he had not crossed the Sea to execute the
							Commission, and <persRef key="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bagot</persRef> had told him £1200 was the standing
							Salary of all British Commissioners for all sorts of Services— I told
							him that this could not apply to cases whether there was a compact upon
							the subject with another Government— That the private expences of the
							Commissioner had not been allowed under the former Commissions, and were
							not allowed to the Agents now. I added it was my belief that if the
							Executive should allow these claims now, Congress would at the next
							Session either refuse the appropriation, or take some other measure
							which would put an end to the Commissions altogether— And I mentioned to
							him the Resolution passed by the House of Representatives, the last
							Evening of the late Session. As to Hawkins, I told him he might dismiss
							all fear of his having the public money to waste, and I read to him my
							Letter to Hawkins of 5. May giving him the President’s explicit
							directions concerning the subordination of the agent’s office to that of
							the Commissioner, and confining the accountability for the expences of
							the Commission, to the Commissioner. The General was but partially
							satisfied with my explanations, and I think it is not in my power to
							satisfy him. This afternoon there were three Balloons sent up from

							what I should answer on a claim that France has set up to special
