								<persRef ref="tyler-benjamin">Benjamin Owen Tyler</persRef>, the

							defence of himself against <persRef ref="binns-john">John
								Binns</persRef>, who charges him with having stolen his plan, for

								Tucker</persRef>, Treasurer U.S. for 900 dollars to balance the
							account of <persRef ref="everett-alexander">A. H. Everett</persRef>, as

							upon examination of the books some weeks ago could not be found— Called

							Minister, asking an interview this morning, upon an affair of
							importance, and requesting, if I should go late to my Office, to see me
							previously at my house. I answered his Note, and appointed eleven
							O’Clock to see him, at my house. He came at the time and had an hour’s
							Conversation with me on the subject of the taking of Pensacola— He began
							by taking up the subject in a very grave tone; shaking his head and
							saying it was a very disagreeable affair; but he was convinced it had
							been an act of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson’s</persRef>
							to which he was not authorized by his Instructions— He had not yet seen
								<persRef ref="onis-luis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Onis</persRef>, but was going to see him immediately, and he wished
							to know if he might tell him that Jackson had no Instructions to take
							Pensacola. Perceiving what he was aiming at, I said that the despatches
							from General Jackson had been received yesterday and immediately
							forwarded to the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>. That I
							could say nothing official, until I should receive his Instructions; but
							I advised him de Neuville not to say one word to Onis which should lead
							him to expect that Jackson’s proceedings would be disavowed by the
							President; for my private opinion was that the President would approve
							them; and I entered at large upon the grounds of justification for them—
							His fervour was quite cooled down before he left me, and he appeared
							convinced that however we deprecate war, as an evil, we are not to be
							frightened with it as a bug-bear— I went to the Office and sent word to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis that I would see him at two
							O’Clock when he came— I had a similar Scene <pb type="ms" n="371"/>to go
							through with him—as with de Neuville; but with less success— He left
							with me a new Note on the Affair of Pensacola, which he requested me to
							Answer; and told me at the same time that he had received new
							Instructions from Spain, which would have enabled him to conclude a
							Treaty with me, satisfactory to both parties, if it had not been for
							this unfortunate incident—and asked if I had transmitted instructions to
								<persRef ref="erving-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Erving</persRef>, by which he could conclude with <persRef

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Erving on the idea that the Treaty would
							be concluded there, but if he Onis had such Instructions as he alledged
							I did not see why we should not conclude it here— He again asked an
							answer to the Note which he delivered to me, and I promised him he
							should have it. I received a Letter from the President which I answered—
							A <persRef ref="abbatt-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							and which took away part of the aggravation of the case— It was the
							promise to restore the place in suitable time. He said he had felt it to

							were willing to give us the Florida’s for nothing; and <pb type="ms"
								n="372"/>as there were large claims of indemnity for depredations on
							both sides, they were willing to set them off against each other, each
							of the two Governments undertaking to indemnify its own people. For all
							this, they would only ask of us to take the boundary Westward, at the
							Carcasu or Mennentao—from the Mouth to the source, thence a line to pass
							between Adeas and Natchitoches to the red river, and from that to the
							Missouri— I told him all the other points would now be easily adjusted;
							but this last, which was impossible— But we would adjust the rest, and
							leave that in the same state, as it has been hitherto; to be adjusted
							hereafter— To this however he would not at all listen— We parted without
							any prospect of approximating. Rode on horseback to the Office. Received
							there a Letter from the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>
							mentioning that he should leave little river to come to the City next
							Monday. The illness of <persRef ref="monroe-elizabeth">M<hi

							from coming sooner. A day of intense Summer heat. I retired to bed
							shortly after Sunset. This was my birthday, and I commenced upon the
							fifty second year of my age. It was a day of gratitude to Heaven for all
							the blessings bestowed upon me and my family; of prayer for the
							continuance of the bounties of Providence, so far as is compatible with
							the decrees of an all wise disposer— Of humiliation for my own
							weaknesses and deficiences both of body and mind and of humble hope,
							that Supreme goodness and power, will open to me an issue from the trial
							which I am now undergoing, useful to my Country, and honourable to
							myself— Above all, that till I die, I may not suffer my integrity to
							depart from me, and that for whatever dispensation of Providence
							hereafter awaits me, I may be prepared to receive it with Prudence,
							Temperance, Justice and Fortitude.</p>

							The difference between the heat of yesterday and of this day was that

							day it was first North-East, then East, then Southeast, and felt cool to
							the skin— Yet as the hottest part of the day came on, there crept upon

							Several sudden human deaths occurred both yesterday and this day;
							particularly of persons who drank cold water while heated— Soon
							afternoon the sky clouded over, and at four I walked home from my
							Office. As we were sitting down to dinner, there came on a violent
							flurry of dry wind, which lasted about two hours, and was soon after
							succeeded by one of the longest and most violent storms of thunder and

							nearly through the Night. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi

						<p><date>15. IV:30.</date> Bath in the Potowmack, and took Antoine with me.
							Attended the Cabinet Meeting at the President’s, from Noon till near
							five O’clock— The subject of deliberation was <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson’s</persRef> late transactions
							in Florida; particularly the taking of Pensacola. The <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> and all the members of the
							Cabinet except myself are of opinion that Jackson acted not only
							without, but against his Instructions— That he has committed War upon
							Spain, which cannot be justified, and in which if not disavowed by the
							Administration, they will be abandoned by the Country. My opinion is
							that there was no real though an apparent violation of his instructions,
							that his proceedings were justified by the necessity of the case, and by
							the misconduct of the Spanish commanding Officers in Florida. The
							question is embarrassing and complicated, not only as involving that of
							an actual war with Spain; but that of the Executive power, to authorize
							hostilities without a declaration of War by Congress— There is no doubt
							that <hi rend="italic">defensive</hi> acts of hostility may be
							authorized by the Executive; but Jackson was authorised to cross the
							Spanish line in pursuit of the Indian Enemy. My argument is that the
							question of the Constitutional authority of the Executive is precisely
							there—that all the rest, even to the order for taking the fort of
							Barrancas by Storm, was incidental—deriving its character from the
							object, which was not hostility to Spain, but the termination of the
							Indian War— This is the justification alledged by Jackson himself; but
							he also alledges that an imaginary line of the 31<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> degree of Latitude, could not afford protection to our
							frontiers, while the Indians could have a safe refuge in Florida, and
							that all his operations were founded on that consideration. <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> the Secretary at War generally
							of sound, judicious and comprehensive mind, seems in this case to be
							personally offended, with the idea, that Jackson has set at nought the
							Instructions of the Department— The President supposes there might be
							cases which would have justified Jackson’s measures but that he has not
							made out his case. Some of the newspapers, especially in Georgia and
							Virginia, without waiting for the Evidence of facts, have commenced
							attacks, both upon the Administration, and upon General Jackson, and the
							fear of charges of usurpation, of duplicity and of War, operate to such
							a degree, that there is not vigour to bear out the bold energy of
							Jackson, and there seems a wish not only to disavow what he has done,
							but to depreciate even the strong reasons which he alledged for his
							justification— <pb type="ms" n="374"/>Standing alone in my opinions, and
							finding that they necessarily had little weight, while counteracting
							feelings as well as opinions, I developed them not so fully as I might
							have done, but obtained an adjournment of the question and meeting till
							to morrow— We remained and dined at the President’s. <persRef

						<p><date>16. V:</date> Bath in the Potowmack alone. Second Cabinet Meeting
							at the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>; and the
							question of the course to be pursued with relation to <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson’s</persRef> proceedings in
							Florida recurred— As the opinion is unanimous against Jackson, excepting
							mine, my range of argument now is only upon the degree to which his acts
							are to be disavowed. It was urged that the public dissatisfaction at the
							taking of Pensacola, is so great that the Administration must
							immediately and publicly disclaim having given any authority for it; and
							publish all the Instructions given to him, to throw the blame entirely
							upon him. There was a violent attack upon him and his measures in the
							Richmond Enquirer, which came this morning, and which <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef> said he had no doubt was written
							by <persRef ref="roane-spencer">Judge Roane</persRef>— I did not
							conceive it necessary to make of this affair an immediate newspaper
							negotiation for public opinion. <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford</persRef> said that if the Administration did not
							immediately declare itself and restore Pensacola, it would be held
							responsible for Jackson’s having taken it, and for having commenced a
							War in violation of the Constitution. That the People would not support
							the Administration in such a War. That our Shipping, Navigation and
							Commerce would be destroyed by Privateers from all parts of the world
							under the Spanish flag, and that the Administration would sink under it—
							I thought it would be quite in time if all the documents relating to the
							subject should be communicated to Congress at their next Meeting, by
							which means they would naturally become public— That to disavow and
							publish now, would look like a disposition entirely to put down Jackson
							in the public opinion— That he would immediately resign, and turn the
							attack upon the administration, and would carry a large portion of the
							public opinion with him. That Pensacola might be restored, and its
							capture by him still justified. That I did not believe War would follow
							from this measure though I admitted it might— That if it should, it
							would seriously injure but not destroy our shipping and Commerce— That
							the only privateering against us to be apprehended would be from English
							people; and that to no very great extent. That the administration would
							stand or sink under the War according to its success and that in this
							and in all other cases the Event must rest with the disposer of Events—
							In the interval of the discussion I went to my Office and received
								<persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Hyde de Neuville</persRef>. He
							is extremely anxious for the preservation of Peace, and desirous of
							contributing to it. We looked over the map, and I marked out the
							boundary which it had been agreed at the President’s that I should be
							authorized to offer. The Trinity from its mouth to its source; then a
							line North to the red river; following the course of that to its source,
							then crossing to the Rio del Norte, and following the course of it, or
							the summit of a chain of mountains northward and parallel to it. There
							stop, or take a line west to the Pacific— De Neuville said he would
							himself go and propose this line to <persRef ref="onis-luis"
								>Onis</persRef> at Bristol— But Onis would probably not dare to
							conclude without first having an answer, to his Note complaining against
							Jackson, and the capture of Pensacola— I told him I should answer Onis’s
							Note, that he would be told that Jackson had taken Pensacola, without
							orders and upon his own responsibility— That the place would be
							restored; but that no blame could be admitted as attaching to General
							Jackson; and strong charges would be made against the <persRef
								ref="masot-jose">Governor of Pensacola</persRef>, and the Commandant
							of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Marks— He asked if I could not write
							a note passing lightly over the conduct of the Officers on both sides
							and stating that Pensacola would be restored with the expression of
							regret at what has taken place— If I could, he would himself take the
							Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis at Bristol; and if on
							conversing with him he found him prepared to agree to the terms of a
							Treaty which would be satisfactory to us, he would deliver the Letter to
							him—if not he would bring it back— I returned to the President’s and
							after consideration of this proposal it was determined to accept the
							offer of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de Neuville, if he thought fit
							to use his influence with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis, to
							prevail upon him to agree to our terms, but that the answer to Onis’s
							Note, must be totally disconnected with the success of the Negotiation,
							and delivered to him at all Events— We dined again at the President’s.

						<p><date>20. V:30.</date> Received this Morning a Note from the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> requesting me to insert some
							additional paragraphs in the Letter to <persRef ref="onis-luis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis</persRef>; of which I accordingly
							prepared a draft— Looking over <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson’s</persRef> Letters, it struck me there was a new point of
							view in which his conduct in taking Pensacola was defensible, and at the
							Cabinet Meeting I presented it again; and argued it with all the force I
							could— It appeared to make some impression upon <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>;
							but the President and <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> were inflexible— My
							reasoning was that Jackson took Pensacola, only because the <persRef
								ref="masot-jose">Governor</persRef> threatened to drive him out of
							the Province by force, if he did not withdraw. That Jackson was only
							executing his orders when he received this threat— That he could not
							withdraw his troops from the Province consistently with his orders and
							that his only alternative was to prevent the Execution of the threat. I
							produced as Authority <persRef ref="martens-georg"
							>Martens</persRef>—Book VIII—Ch. 2. §.226, and Ch. 6. §.267.— I insisted
							that the character of Jackson’s measures was decided by the intention
							with which they were taken; which was not hostility to Spain, but
							self-defence against the hostility of Spanish Officers. I admitted that
							it was necessary to carry the reasoning upon my principles to the utmost
							extent it would bear to come to this conclusion— But if the question was
							dubious, it was better to err on the side of vigour than on the side of
							weakness— On the side of our own Officer who had rendered the most
							eminent services to the Nation, than on the side of our bitterest
							enemies, and against him— I glanced at the construction which would be
							given by Jackson’s friends and by a large portion of the public to the
							disavowal of his Acts. It would be said that he was an obnoxious man:
							that after having the benefit of his services, he was abandoned and
							sacrificed to the enemies of the Country. That his case would be
							compared with that of <persRef ref="raleigh-walter">Sir Walter
								Raleigh</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun
							principally bore the argument against me; insisting that the capture of
							Pensacola was not necessary upon principles of self defence, and
							therefore was both an act of War against Spain, and a violation of the
							Constitution. That the administration by approving it would take all the
							blame of it upon themselves. That by leaving it upon his responsibility
							they would take away from Spain all pretext for War, and for resorting
							to the aid of other European powers— They would also be free from all
							reproach of having violated the Constitution— That it was not the menace
							of the Governor of Pensacola, that had determined Jackson to take that
							place— That he had really resolved to take it before; that he had
							violated his orders, and upon his own arbitrary will, set all authority
							at defiance. The President heard with candour and good humour all that I
							said, but without any variation from his original opinion, and my draft
							of a Note to Onis, with all its amendments was finally fixed precisely
							on the grounds of the President’s original sketch— I received this day a
							Note from <persRef key="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bagot</persRef>, requesting an interview. I had not answered that of
							last Thursday in which he had asked for an Audience of the President, to
							deliver a Letter from the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince
								Regent</persRef> announcing the marriage of the <persRef
								ref="elizabeth">Princess Elizabeth</persRef>— The President fixed
							one O’Clock to-morrow to receive the Letter, and I appointed the
							interview at Noon— Heavy Thunder Shower this Evening.</p>

								>Onis</persRef> had told me before, and which he doubtless had from
							the Commandant of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Marks— I avoided
							discussion with him on the subject as much as possible; but I saw that

							introduce an English gentleman to the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef>— A <persRef ref="ratterbury-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Ratterbury</persRef> late from

								ref="elizabeth">Princess Elizabeth</persRef>: after which we
							retired, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot returned to the
							President and introduced M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ratterbury.
							These ceremonies occupied not more than half an hour; after which there
							was a Cabinet meeting, at which the second draft of my Letter to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis was read, and finally fixed— <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>
							read what he called a second Edition of his Articles for the National
							Intelligencer. I strenuously reurged my objections especially to a
							paragraph declaring that the President thought he had no Constitutional
							power to have authorized General Jackson to take Pensacola; and to
							another holding out a hope to the Public that, notwithstanding this
							collision between the officers of the two Governments in Florida, yet we
							shall soon have an amicable settlement of all our differences with
							Spain, and obtain the cession of the Florida’s too. But I could make no
							more impression upon either of these points than upon those in the Note
							to Onis— To all my objections, offers were made to vary the phrase, or
							to strike out, parts of sentences but still adhering to the disclaimer
							of Power— I finally gave up the debate, acquiescing in the determination
							which had been taken— The Administration were placed in a dilemma from
							which it is impossible for them to escape censure by some, and factious
							crimination by many. If they avow and approve Jackson’s conduct; they
							incur the double responsibility of having commenced a War against Spain,
							and of warring in violation of the Constitution, without the authority
							of Congress. If they disavowed him, they must give offence to all his
							friends, encounter the shock of his popularity and have the appearance
							of truckling to Spain— For all this, I should be prepared— But the
							mischief of this determination lies deeper. 1. It is weakness, and a
							confession of weakness. 2. The disclaimer of power in the Executive is
							of dangerous example; and of evil consequences. 3. There is injustice to
							the Officer in disavowing him, when in principle he is strictly
							justifiable. These charges will be urged with great vehemence on one
							side, while those who would have censured the other course will not
							support or defend the Administration for taking this— I believe the
							other would have been a safer as well as a bolder course— <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> says he has heard that the
							Court Martial at first acquitted the two Englishmen; but that Jackson
							sent the case back to them— He says also that last winter there was a
							company formed in Tennessee, who sent <persRef ref="donelson-andrew"
								>Jackson’s nephew</persRef> to Pensacola, and purchased Florida
							Lands; and that Jackson himself is reported to be interested in the
							Speculation— I hope not.</p>

							of the discourse, and says something about <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Jackson</persRef> and Pensacola. <pb type="ms" n="379"/>He gave me
							yesterday two Letters to read in confidence as they had been
							communicated to him. One was from <persRef ref="bland-theoderick">Judge
								Bland</persRef> at Buenos-Ayres, to <persRef ref="skinner-john">J.
								S. Skinner</persRef> the Postmaster at Baltimore, and the other from
								<persRef ref="winder-william-henry">General Winder</persRef> to the
								<persRef ref="pueyrredon-juan">Supreme Director
							Pueyrredon</persRef>. Bland’s letter is long, private, and
							confidential—contains much information concerning the state of the
							Country—a decided opinion that they will never again submit to the
							dominion of Spain, and an opinion equally strong that the Government of
							the United States ought not at present to recognize that of Buenos
							Ayres. He has a very bad opinion of Pueyrredon, and still more of his
							Secretary of <persRef ref="tagle-unknown">State Tagle</persRef>— I asked
							the President whether the other two Commissioners entertained the same
							opinions as judge Bland— He said he did not know. I said that much would
							depend upon that, as Congress would doubtless look to their report
							particularly with a view to the question whether Buenos-Ayres was to be
							acknowledged or not— He said they would only state facts, and give no
							opinion of their own. I told him that would be very well, if they should
							state all the facts; but many of those stated by judge Bland, and
							precisely those upon which <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had made up his
							opinion were of a nature not to be officially and publicly stated; and
							yet if they were suppressed it would be impossible to give a view of the
							state of things upon which any reliance could be placed. He shewed some
							little impatience of manner at these remarks, and passed on to another
							subject— Two days ago, he had very abruptly asked me to see <persRef
								key="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef>,
							and propose through him to the British Government, an immediate
							co-operation between the United States and Great-Britain, to promote the
							Independence of South-America— I asked him what part of South-America?—
							All South-America—and Mexico; and the islands included— I told him I
							thought Great-Britain was not yet prepared for such a direct
							proposition; and entering into details I immediately found it was a
							crude idea, which he immediately abandoned— But I conjectured that
							either <persRef ref="rodney-caesar">Rodney</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="brackenridge-henry">Breckenridge</persRef>, or the Richmond
							Enquirer had put it into his head— For the Richmond Enquirer, which
								<persRef key="clay-henry">Clay’s</persRef> Kentucky Reporter calls
							the President’s domestic paper, is on the contrary the Paper by which
							Virginia works upon the President. Its influence is much more upon him
							than for him, and it is excessively impatient for the acknowledgment of
							Buenos Ayres— Winder’s letter to Pueyrredon was to decline the
							appointment of Agent for Buenos Ayres here, which had been sent him and
							with it was a long and judicious argument to convince him that the
							formal acknowledgment of Buenos Ayres by the Government of the United
							States would be contrary to the interests of both— I finally despatched
								<persRef ref="wichelhausen-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wichelhausen</persRef>, with a copy of the Proclamation in favour of
							the vessels of Bremen. The President left the City this Evening; but

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lechleitner</persRef><pb

								rend="superscript">r</hi> ten Cate still persisted in acting as the
							Chargé d’Affaires from the Netherlands, though he had been sometime
							since recalled, and he, Lechleitner had presented to me his credential
							Letter, as his successor— He came therefore to ask that it might be
							officially announced in the National Intelligencer, that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> ten Cate was recalled, and that he
							Lechleitner was the Charge d’Affaires from the Netherlands— I told him
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> ten Cate had not delivered his
							Letters of recall, but only sent me a copy of them, and informed me that
							he should present the original Letter shortly— That as he was acting
							under his responsibility towards his own Government it would scarcely be
							decent to him to urge him for the delivery of the Letter, and it would
							be very disagreeable for this Government to interfere between them— I
							hoped they would settle it between themselves— He said that ten Cate had
							been recalled, on account of his having made debts. His Salary was
							punctually paid, but he had been extravagant in his expences— Ten Cate
							himself came soon after with complaints against Lechleitner, who, he
							said very unexpectedly came to him yesterday, and made of him a formal
							written demand for the papers and documents of the Mission— He said that
							he had not been ordered by his Government to deliver immediately his
							Letter of recall; and he had a few days since received new Instructions
							from his Government to execute, not even addressed in case of his
							absence to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lechleitner— That he had
							written to his Government, soliciting to be continued here, and had
							hopes of succeeding—and he hoped we should recognize no other than him
							as the Representative of his Government until he should deliver his
							Letter of recall— I told him that we were perfectly satisfied with his
							conduct, and should be very happy if his Government would continue him—
							But we should avoid as much as possible interfering in the question
							between him and Lechleitner— They must endeavour to settle it between
							themselves as I had told Lechleitner— If however they could not, and
							Lechleitner should apply to me about it again, I should tell him he must
							address a written note to me: the substance of which I should
							communicate to him that he might also address his representation in
							writing, upon which we should come to such conclusion, as would be due
							to them, and to their Government— A <persRef ref="parry-edward">M<hi

							Government, upon which there is no prospect of any thing’s being done at
							present. I promised him if they should become more favourable, that
							public notice should be given them— Weather sultry and showery.</p>

							Potowmack Bridge. There is a new wharf building near the place. The

								<persRef ref="mitchell-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mitchell</persRef>, one of the Clerks in the Treasury Department
							came to say that <persRef ref="mitchel-john">his father</persRef> the
							Consul at the Island of Martinique had arrived at Norfolk, and he
							expected him here to-morrow— His present object would be to obtain an
							appointment as a clerk in one of the Departments, and as there were two
							vacancies of such places under the War Department, he wished me to speak
							with <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef>, in behalf of his father— I called accordingly at
								M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Calhoun’s Office, and gave my
							testimony, as far as I could in favour of the old man, who as Consul at
							Martinique has been a very vigilant Officer, and attentive Correspondent
							with the Department. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s only
							objection was to his age, which was upwards of seventy— I also consulted
							with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun upon various other subjects—
								<persRef ref="tencate-j">ten Cate</persRef> sent me a private Note,
							stating that he found a difficulty in negotiating drafts upon his
							Government, and enquiring if this Government could give him any
							assistance to that purpose— Calhoun thought he ought to be accommodated
							for a moderate sum— The <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>
							had directed that persons should be appointed to run a new line between
							the State of Georgia, and the Creek Indians upon a request from the
								<persRef ref="rabun-william">Governor of Georgia</persRef>; as it is
							to be done through the Department <pb type="ms" n="381"/>of War, Calhoun
							promised immediate attention to it— There are new difficulties suggested
							to the appointment of a special Court for the trial of <persRef
								ref="wright-obed">Captain Obed Wright</persRef>, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun agreed with me in opinion that the
							best course would be to refer the trial to the ordinary circuit Court
							which is to sit in Georgia next December— Calhoun spoke also upon the
							subject of South American affairs. <persRef ref="bland-theoderick">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bland’s</persRef> Letter to <persRef
								ref="skinner-john">Skinner</persRef> gives an opinion very
							explicitly against the recognition of the Government of Buenos Ayres,
							but Calhoun says <persRef ref="rodney-caesar">Rodney</persRef> is of a
							different opinion, as well as <persRef ref="brackenridge-henry"
								>Brackenridge</persRef>, the Secretary to the Commissioners, and
							although no Report has yet been made to the Government Rodney and
							Brackenridge, are filling the Newspapers through the Delaware Watchman,
							with publications to operate on the public opinion in favour of the
							recognition. It appears from Bland’s Letter to Skinner, that he
							quarreled with Brackenridge on board the ship, and that they had no
							intercourse with each other after they landed— Calhoun is also anxiously
							waiting to see the effect on the public opinion, of the course adopted
							by the Government with regard to Florida and <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>— The Article for the
							Intelligencer was published yesterday Morning— Nothing said about
							unanimity in the Cabinet. The disclaimer of power in the Executive to
							have given Jackson authority to take Pensacola entirely struck out; and
							the restoration placed on the footing of the President’s incompetency to
							retain it— There is in the Country a great Mass of desire to be in
							opposition to the Administration— It is a sort of instinctive impression
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroes administration will
							terminate by bringing in an <hi rend="italic">adverse</hi> party to it—
							This of itself engages all the newspapers not employed by public
							patronage, but desiring it, and many of those possessing it, against the
							administration. This propensity to blame, is still increased by an
							affectation of shewing their Independence, and escaping the charge of
							subserviency to the executive— All the restless and uneasy Spirits
							naturally fall into the ranks of opposition; and <persRef
								key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> who has seen all this has from the
							time of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s election squared his
							conduct accordingly— He has been constantly looking out for positions
							upon which to erect his batteries against the Administration— And this
							affair of Florida appears so favourable to him, that in his newspaper
							the Kentucky Reporter, there is a piece which the President told me was
							said to be written by him, and where he takes ground against the
							Administration, upon both the alternatives; if they should have
							authorized Jackson’s proceedings, or if disavowing them they should
							restore Pensacola— The truth is, that there is in this, and perhaps must
							be in every administration in this Country, a perpetual tendency to
							fall, as well as leaders of opposition always on the watch to trip them
							up, or pull them down. Whatever their management may be, nothing but
							success can keep them up. Success is undoubtedly the effect partly of
							judicious management, and partly of good fortune. The points upon which
							important interests in this Country are depending, and upon which
							success or failure will affect the issue of the Administration, are the
							relations with Spain; those with Great-Britain; and Indian Affairs. The
							Spanish include those with South-America— Now upon neither of these
							points is any great and signal successful Event to be expected, if even
							possible, and while opposition will be recruiting and mustering forces
							from every quarter, the Administration will be upon a perpetual
							defensive, and constantly losing ground. Virginia is already lukewarm to
							the President, and shews a disposition to dictate to him his measures
							without scruple or delicacy— The Richmond Enquirer which is the voice of
							Virginia speaks to him like a Master to his Slave— As there is no
							present prospect that a Citizen of Virginia, can be raised to the next
							Presidency, the <hi rend="italic">pis aller</hi> of Virginia, will be to
							put in a native of that State, residing in another, for which either
							Clay or <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> will
							serve the turn. An anonymous Letter-writer has asserted that the
							intention of Virginia, after M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s
							term will be to set up <persRef ref="randolph-john">John
								Randolph</persRef>, which I doubt; but that nothing less than a
							Virginian will satisfy Virginia is to me perfectly demonstrated— These
							reflections may be pursued hereafter. I told Calhoun, I was convinced
							the course taken by the Administration was <pb type="ms" n="382"/>the
							safe course, and would be approved by the great majority of the People—
							Its safety consists in this that in every event, it throws off the blame
							of commencing War, and it takes away all possible complaint in or by
							Congress— A person named <persRef ref="pierce-unknown">Pierce</persRef>
							came to solicit employment as a temporary clerk in the Office.</p>
