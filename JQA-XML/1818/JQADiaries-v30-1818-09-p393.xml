						<p><date>1. V:30.</date> Tuesday. Having no conveniences for writing, I
							wasted the morning of this day. Called about eleven o’clock at <persRef
								ref="trumbull-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Trumbull’s</persRef> house, and saw his picture of the declaration
							of independence, which is now nearly finished. I cannot say I was
							disappointed in the Execution of it, because my expectations were very
							low, but the picture is immeasurably below the dignity of the subject.
							It may be said of Trumbull’s talent, as the Spaniards say of heroes who
							were brave on a certain day— He has painted good pictures. I think the
							old smtall picture far superior to this large new one. He himself thinks
							otherwise. He has some Books on the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef> table, which the <persRef ref="correa-joseph"
								>Abbe Correa</persRef>, advised him to Letter on the backs—<persRef
								ref="locke-john">Locke</persRef>, and <persRef ref="sidney-algernon"
								>Sidney</persRef>— I told him I thought that was not the place for
							them— They were books for the members to read at home, but not to take
							with them there. I advised him to Letter them simply “Journals.” On
							returning to my lodgings I found there <persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> R. King</persRef>— I had written from
							Washington requesting him to call this day here, as I should not be able
							to visit him on Long Island. I had upwards of two hours conversation
							with him, on political affairs, and chiefly, on our Navigation Act of
							the last Session of Congress. I found he was averse to the renewal of
							our commercial Convention of 3 July 1815 with Great-Britain— His views
							with regard to the taking of Pensacola, and the proceedings in Florida
							coincided altogether with those which I had maintained— His son <persRef
								ref="king-charles">Charles</persRef>, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							and <persRef ref="trumbull-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Trumbull</persRef>, <persRef ref="pitcairn-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pitcairn</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="clarkson-william">W. S. Clarkson</persRef> also paid us visits—
							Dined with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary Hellen</persRef>, at <persRef
								ref="mccormick-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Cormick’s</persRef>— Pitcairn, his nephew <persRef
								ref="brodie-unknown">Brodie</persRef>, and Clarkson were there. I
							received two Packets of despatches from the Department of State, with a
							Letter from the President, and the Letter to <persRef
								ref="aguirre-manuel">Aguirre</persRef> altered and corrected from my
							draft. I sealed it and carried it myself to the Post-Office— Clarkson
							went with us this Evening to the Circus. The very worst exhibition of
							feats of Horsemanship that I ever saw. One of the Riders fell, and
							struck his head against the benches so that they apologized for his not
							appearing again. The still vaulting was not much better— We came home
							about eleven O’Clock.</p>

						<p><date>2. VI:</date> Met <persRef ref="parker-isaac">Chief Justice Isaac

							at the door of the City Hotel. He came by the Steam-Boats from Boston,
							to go up the Hudson river to Albany, and thence about thirty miles

							Court. At eight O’Clock we took the Steam-Boat, Connecticut, <persRef

								<persRef ref="pitcairn-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							/>The heat of the day was extreme; my thermometer nearly at 90. and all
							the morning a flat calm. We sat nevertheless an hour or two after dinner
							at table, conversing upon topics of literature, and the Arts. Judge
							Johnson I find is one of the anti-classical despisers of <persRef

							and <persRef ref="southey-robert">Southey</persRef>— He is a very
							ingenious and learned man and defends his opinions with so much
							earnestness, and vigour, that I found it advisable after some discussion
							to wave the subject; and left him philosophising with another of the
							Passengers, upon the construction of the Steam-Boat, and the conflicting
							pretensions of <persRef ref="fitch-john">Fitch</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="fulton-robert">Fulton</persRef>. About eight in the Evening we
							reached the wharf at New-Haven; and transmigrated to the Fulton,
								<persRef ref="law-unknown2">Captain Law</persRef>, in which we
							proceeded for Norwich. Judge Johnson and his family, and at least fifty
							other passengers left us, at New-Haven—thirty or forty others continued
							with us, and five or six came on board at New-Haven. It was near ten
							O’Clock when we left this place, continuing to plow the deep through the
							Night.</p>

						<p><date>3. III.</date> Although there is little motion in the Steam-Boats;

							reflected into the Cabin, for day light, rose and went upon deck, where
							for two hours and more my occupations consisted of Star-gazing, and
							conversing with a Baptist clergyman of dutch extraction, belonging to
							the interior of the State of New-York— He speaks English with a strong
							dutch accent, though he assures me that he himself and his father and

							arrived at <persRef ref="chappotin-leon">Chapotin’s</persRef>, in
							Providence— The day was warm, and the Roads excessively dusty. The town
							seemed scarcely recovered from the frolic of Commencement, which was
							yesterday. In the Evening we all went to the Theatre where we saw a cure
							for the heart-ache and the forty thieves. It was near Midnight when we

						<p><date>9. VI:</date> The storm continues night and day; again prevented me
							from going to Boston, and again kept me confined to the house— It is but
							this moment that I have brought up my arrears, at the approach of
							Evening; for having examined <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef> in a passage of <persRef ref="plato"
								>Plato’s</persRef> Crito, and then referred to the Volume of the
							Bibliotheque des Philosophes, containing <persRef ref="dacier-andre"
								>Dacier’s</persRef> translation of it, I was allured by the Phedon
							which immediately succeeds and could not lay down the book until I had
							read it through. This delicious but unseasonable occupation, consumed
							the morning almost to the hour of dinner— If the study of Plato <pb
								type="ms" n="396"/>were my proper business, I should be wasting my
							time with something else. The reflections that have occurred to me upon
							this perusal of the Phedon might be useful to me hereafter, if I had
							time to commit them to writing. The arguments of <persRef ref="socrates"
								>Socrates</persRef> to prove the immortality of the Soul, are so
							weak that they hardly deserve the name of arguments. His principle that
							all things are generated by their contraries; that heat and cold,
							greatness and littleness, life and death produce each other, is an
							absurdity. His doctrine of innate ideas, of reminiscences and of
							abstract entities, is subtle but utterly groundless. One idea only
							appears to me to have weight that is the spiritual, simple, uncompounded
							nature of the Soul, and the inference from it that the Soul is therefore
							not subject to death— There is something very admirable in the
							composure, and tranquility with which he discourses at such a moment;
							but there is a want of sensibility in the coldness which he shews at
							parting from his wife and children. The objection taken by <persRef
								ref="sumunias-unknown">Sumunias</persRef>, to the immortality of the
							Soul, that the Soul is a mere harmony resulting from the composition of
							the body, and its illustration, by comparison with the music produced by
							the Sound of a lyre, is so strong that Socrates by no means answers it—
							That of Cabes that the Soul is superior in excellence and duration to
							the body, and may outlast several bodies, as a man wears out several
							suits of Cloaths, but yet must finally perish, is equally weak, and
							indeed both sides of the argument appear to me to be so wretchedly
							managed, that as a logical controversy, it is scarcely worth reading—
							Yet it affords an inexhaustible fund for meditation— It gave me an
							ardent longing for leisure; which I should but too probably waste, if I
							had it— In the Evening I read part of a Dissertation upon the origin of
							the Constellations and of Fables, by <persRef ref="dupuis-charles"
								>Dupuis</persRef>, in the fourth Volume of <persRef
								ref="lalande-jerome">La Landes</persRef> Astronomy. This also opened

						<p><date>19. VI:</date> A continual storm of rain the whole day— I sat to
								<persRef ref="stuart-gilbert">Stewart</persRef>, before and after
							breakfast; and found his conversation, as it has been at every sitting,
							very entertaining. His own figure is highly picturesque, with his dress
							always disordered, and taking snuff, from a large round tin wafer box,
							holding perhaps half a pound which he must use up in a day. He considers
							himself beyond all question the first portrait painter of the age, and
							tells numbers of anecdotes concerning himself to prove it, with the
							utmost simplicity, and unconsciousness of ridicule. His conclusion is
							not very wide from the truth— I had intended to pay visits this Morning,
							but was prevented by the weather. <persRef ref="motte-mellish">Melish
								Mott</persRef>, and <persRef ref="lyon-unknown">Lyon</persRef>, two
							of <persRef ref="adams-george">George’s</persRef> classmates came and
							dined with him, and after dinner Mott went out to Quincy with him. They
							are to be chambermates, at the University, the year that is now about
							commencing. Mott is from Charleston South Carolina, and <persRef
								ref="motte-abraham">his father</persRef> was at Washington last
							Spring. I dined at <persRef ref="blake-george">G. Blake’s</persRef>,
							with a company of 28 persons, among whom was the <persRef
								ref="bentzon-adrian">Governor of the Danish Island of S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Thomas</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="holley-horace">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holley</persRef>
							was there, and after dinner I became involved in a conversation with him
							upon religious topics, which almost became a controversy. The
							consequence was that the table-talk was almost engrossed by us, and the
							attention of the whole table was turned to us, much to my disadvantage,
							the topic being one upon which he was much more exercised and better
							prepared than I was. <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi

						<p><date>20. VI:</date> Breakfasted with <persRef ref="degrand-peter">P. P.
								F. de Grand</persRef>, at his lodgings, and he discoursed with me
							much about the politics, and the state of parties in this Commonwealth.
							He wishes me to take some part or interest in them: but I see no object
							of public usefulness to be answered by it. He told me that <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>
							just before he made the appointment of Secretary of State, wrote a note
							to <persRef ref="story-joseph">Judge Story</persRef>, requesting to see

							been his intention to appoint me Secretary of State; but <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> had
							objected to the appointment, on the allegation that I was not a

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crowninshield</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">Jonathan Russell</persRef> had assured the
							President that it was so— I was not a republican. So it would seem that
							Story undertook to answer for my republicanism— Whether my appointment
							was for my own good or for that of my Country is known only to God. As
							yet I have far more reason to lament than to rejoice at the Event. Yet I
							feel not the less the obligation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe’s confidence in me, and the duty of personal devotion to the
							success of his administration which it imposes upon me— That Clay should
							have taken pains to prevent my appointment, is as natural as that he
							should have coveted it himself. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crowninshield’s opposition to me arose no doubt from party, and
							Russell’s from personal motives. That Clay, should, have had the talent
							of making tools of those men for his purposes, is no mean proof of his
							address. His mind is of a very superior cast to their’s, but in his
							management of his opposition to me, there is a total disregard, not only
							of generosity, but of fairness. So painful however is the situation in
							which I am placed, that I wish every hour of my life, he had succeeded
							in keeping me from it— No more of this— <persRef ref="blake-george"
								>George Blake</persRef> came and took me to hear <persRef

							the Essex Coffee-House, the house in which <persRef ref="gray-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. Gray</persRef> resided when

							Bentley’s house. Another of his curiosities, is a beautiful persian
							Manuscript of Sadi’s poems; an octavo Volume, with a number of

							inexhaustible in conversation—learned, honest, fanciful, deep in

							brain, unable to controul either his likings or his dislikings;
							censuring without thought of giving offence; and the grossest of

								Gallatin’s</persRef> having been joined with him in it; and the

							his health but looks well, and says he is better than he was last year.
							He often draws a long breath, and complains of internal heat at the pit
							of the Stomach. He says he has consulted the most eminent physicians of
							the Netherlands, France and England, none of whom could tell him what

						<p><date>26. VI:</date> A great part of this morning passed away like all
							the rest of the time since I have been here; in conversing with <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> and in reading. My journal in
							the mean time has run up a week in arrear. Shall I never overcome this
							subtle thief of time procrastination? At last, little before Noon,
							finding the prospect inevitable of a large arrear at the moment of
							departing upon my return home which must of course accumulate during the
							Journey, and perhaps become irretrievable by the crowd of business which
							I must meet upon my return to Washington, I seriously began and wrote
							before and after dinner about five hours, upon this journal— Nothing
							else done, the whole day. <persRef ref="adams-thomas">My
								brother</persRef>, with <persRef ref="adams-ann">his wife</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="adams-joseph">youngest child</persRef> were here. They
							had taken it to Milton, to consult <persRef ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Holbrook</persRef>, the child being
							ill with the Cholera— After they returned, he was worse and they send
							for the Doctor who called here on his return home— He brought with him a
							large white seed Cuccumber, from the seed sent last year by <persRef
								ref="bentham-jeremy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bentham</persRef> to my father. <persRef ref="otis-george">M<hi

								ref="smith-h">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> H. Smith</persRef>,
							were also here this Morning. My sons <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>,
							were expected here to dinner, but only came out in the Evening. <persRef

									>r</hi> Dean</persRef> of Scituate. His morning text was from 1.
							Corinthians XII.13. “and have been all made to drink into one Spirit”—
							That of the afternoon from 1. Corinthians VI:11. “And such were some of
							you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified”— The doctrine of the
							morning discourse was that the object of all religions is the same; and
							that of the afternoon, the indispensible necessity of religion. His
							manner resembles much that of <persRef ref="kirkland-john">Doctor
								Kirkland</persRef>, but with more animation— It is not generally
							pleasing. He is of the liberal Class, who consider religion as merely a
							system of morals. He and <persRef ref="cruft-edward">M<hi

							us at <persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef>. I had intended to

								ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De
								Grand</persRef> came out from Boston, and spent the afternoon and

								<persRef ref="artiguenave-joseph">Artiguenave</persRef>, who

							me, and proposed to call upon me again at seven, to-morrow morning.
								<persRef ref="waite-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									>r</hi> Eustis</persRef>, with whom I had a long Conversation

							the manuscripts of the secret Journals, and Correspondence of the old

							remain here until next Monday or Tuesday, after which, no further
							despatches from the Department of State addressed to me here are to be
							expected, and I authorized him to open those which may be received here
							after my departure. I sat to <persRef ref="stuart-gilbert"
								>Stewart</persRef>, but it was so much later than the hour I had
							appointed with him, that we were interrupted by other visitors at his
							rooms. I called at <persRef ref="payne-william">W. Payne</persRef> and
							Co. Office, and left with Hall a small Certificate of Stock in the
							Boston Bank, to be sold with those in the State Bank, which I
							transferred last week. I went to the Stage-Office in Hanover Street; and
							engaged four Seats in the Mail Stage to Worcester for the day after
							to-morrow. They start at one O’Clock P.M. and will take us up at our
							lodgings. We dined at them this day— After dinner <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> and <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary Hellen</persRef>
							went to <persRef ref="welsh-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Welsh’s</persRef> and I was engaged in writing till eight O’Clock,
							when I went to <persRef ref="degrand-peter">De Grand’s</persRef>. He had
							assembled there a large party of Republicans, few of whom were
							personally known to me—<persRef ref="austin-benjamin">B.
								Austin</persRef>, <persRef ref="brazier-john">J. Brazier</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="little-william">W. Little</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="ballard-davis">Ballard</persRef> one of the Editors of the
							Chronicle, and <persRef ref="orne-henry">Orne</persRef>, Editor of the
							Yankee were there, and <persRef ref="foster-william">W. Foster jun<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> who was not among friends.
								<pb type="ms" n="404"/>There was no Conversation upon politics, but
							Artiguenave was there, and I told him I would either see him to-morrow
							Morning, or receive his communication this Evening. Finding I should
							walk home, he walked with me, and then made it. Artiguenave is a
							Frenchman, of respectable parentage, and good education, who as he says
							from an irresistible impulse, much against the will of his Parents went
							upon the Stage, and was one of the principal performers on the
							Theatre-Français— But being an ardent revolutionist and Napoleonite, on
							the late restoration of the Bourbons he abandoned the Stage and France,
							and came by the way of England here. He came to me in England, where I
							gave him some facility to procure his passage, which he could not else
							have effected, and he feels some obligation to me for this service. He
							teaches French here, and occasionally gives public readings of French
							Plays— He has been very successful and now proposes to settle here— By
							teaching French he has access to the principal families in Boston, and
							hears their Conversations— After some apologies, and some professions of
							honourable motives, he asked me, whether I thought <persRef
								ref="otis-harrison">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> H. G.
								Otis</persRef> was my friend? I told him—to a certain extent; but
							not to that of giving me a right to expect any important proof of his
							friendship. He said he was any thing but my friend— That he was burning
							with ambition for a foreign mission, and even now so impressed with the
							hope of receiving the appointment to France, that he had sent for him
							Artiguenave, to renew his French lessons to <persRef ref="otis-sophia"
								>his daughter</persRef> and told him, that it was in order that she
							might understand and speak French when they should arrive there, that he
							is so confident of receiving the appointment, that William Foster this
							very Evening at De Grand’s had told him he should very shortly go to
							France; for that Otis would certainly be appointed Minister there, and
							had promised him Foster the appointment of Secretary to the Legation—
							That with all this Confidence, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis had
							spoken to a friend of mine, whom he was not at liberty to name, with
							extreme contempt of the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>,
							and with much rancour and fear of me— That he represented M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe as a weak man, influenced entirely
							by me. Yet he pretended to have been in great intimacy with the
							President at Washington last winter—that the President was entirely
							disposed to appoint him as Minister to France, but he was not sure of my
							concurrence and was afraid of opposition from me. He never spoke of me,
							but with ill-disguised bitterness. The friend of mine to whom he had
							alluded, was so disgusted with what Otis had said of me, that he had
							repeated it to Artiguenave with indignation; and although he could not
							repeat it to me himself, had given Artiguenave permission to tell me of
							it if he pleased. That Otis was so far persuaded of receiving the
							appointment to France, that he was in correspondence with <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef> on the subject, and within a few days had
							received a Letter from him giving him new encouragement to expect it— I
							told Artiguenave that I justly appreciated the motive of his
							communication— That Otis and I had many years been friends, as far as
							courtesy extended, and I had never been his enemy in any shape. But with
							many good and some brilliant qualities M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Otis had always chosen to see in me a rival; and under constant social
							civilities and attentions, had never missed an opportunity of giving me
							a back-handed thrust—and as I never returned it, I had always been in
							the habit of receiving his good words and friendly courtesies—returning
							them when I could, and estimating them at precisely what they were
							worth— More than thirty years ago, at my very first outset in life, he
							had sped a dart at me— I very soon after knew that it was from his hand;
							but to this day he knows not that I ever made the discovery. He is now,
							precisely what he was then; and his great misfortune is that he cannot
							keep his own secret. The opinions he now gives out concerning M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe are utterly unfounded— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe is neither a weak man, nor is he
							unduly influenced by me. As little is he disposed to give M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis a Mission abroad, as M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis was last winter in his intimacy— He
							has mistaken M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s civilities for
							Confidence. Artiguenave told me he had written to me more than three
							Months since on this subject—but the friend to whom he gave the letter
							did not go to Washington and returned him his Letter.</p>
