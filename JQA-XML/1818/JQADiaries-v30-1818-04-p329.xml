						<p><date>1. VI:30.</date> Wednesday. <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">W.
								S. Smith</persRef> came this morning, and told me that he proposed
							to apply for an appointment abroad— For the first vacancy as Secretary
							of Legation; and enquired if I should oppose his appointment. I told him
							that if my opinion was asked, I should give it, and should feel myself
							compelled to state facts relating to the demand which he made upon his
							return from Europe, for which I referred him to <persRef
								ref="pleasonton-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pleasonton</persRef>; advising him to compare the receipt which he
							gave me at Paris 22 March 1815, with the charge which he made after his

							with me upon the Bills in contemplation relating to Colonial trade, and
							Navigation. Pitkin read me the draft of a Bill proposed by <persRef
								ref="smith-samuel2">General S. Smith</persRef>, for a total repeal
							of discriminating duties without conditioning for our admission to the
							Colonies of the European Powers in return. I told him what had passed
							between <persRef ref="tencate-j">ten Cate</persRef> and me, on this
							subject. He thought Smith’s Bill went too far, and that the measures
							proposed in my Report on the Netherland Negotiation would be sufficient—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawkins came with a Letter from
								<persRef ref="claiborne-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T.

							Articles, and his opinion upon their principle— Hawkins asked my opinion
							what he was to do— The field of enquiry he said was so wide that he
							scarcely knew how to answer the Letter— I advised him to go before the
							Committee, and give such explanations as they might ask— Cathcart came
							about some old claims of his own, and to plead his merits in our public
							transactions with Algiers; as to his claims I told him Congress was the
							only competent authority now for admitting them— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> King told me the Committee of Foreign Relations of the

						<p><date>4. VI:</date> At the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef>, he mentioned to me, his intentions in
							respect to the nominations to be made before the close of the present
							Session of the Senate, for the foreign Missions— He proposes to send two
							Commissioners to Constantinople; <persRef ref="lowndes-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> William Lowndes</persRef>, the present
							Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, and <persRef
								ref="smith-samuel2">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> S.
								Smith</persRef> of Baltimore; with powers to negotiate a Treaty.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowndes to remain there, and General
							Smith to return by the way of Naples and make a further attempt to
							negotiate for the claims upon that Government which were the object of
								<persRef ref="pinkney-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W.
								Pinkney’s</persRef> Mission. For the mission to Russia, he proposes
							to nominate <persRef ref="campbell-george">G. W. Campbell</persRef>, now
							a Senator from Tennessee— He said he did not approve the principle of
							appointing Members of Congress to foreign Missions, but as it had been
							established in practice from the first organization of the present
							Government, and as the members of Congress would not be satisfied with
							the opposite principle, he did not think proper to make it a rule for
							himself. He asked my opinion of the persons he had mentioned, and I gave
							it freely, notwithstanding the delicacy and difficulty of the task— The
							President spoke of his desire to appoint some person from the Western
							Country to one of the highest Offices of the Government. He had informed
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> of his intention to appoint me Secretary of State,
							and had offered him the War Department which he declined. He had also
							consulted him as to his disposition, whether he would accept the Mission
							to England; which he had also repelled; observing that he was satisfied
							with the situation which he held, and could render more service to the
							public than in the other situations offered him— The War Department had
							then offered to <persRef ref="shelby-isaac">Governor Shelby</persRef> of
							Kentucky, at the urgent recommendation of <persRef ref="johnson-richard"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M. Johnson</persRef>, who
							had expressed the opinion that he would accept it; but he declined on
							account of his age, his habits and a determination that he had taken not
							to engage again in the public service. Since then no character belonging
							to the Western Country had occurred with stronger claims to distinction
							than G. W. Campbell— There were indeed <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>General Jackson</persRef><persRef ref="harrison-william">General
								Harrison</persRef> and Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M.
							Johnson, all of whom might have claims; but he thought none of them
							ought to prevail over those of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell—
							He passed in review the principal States of the Union; observed that
							Massachusetts had had its share of the late Diplomatic appointments—
							That there was no prominent character in New-York; except <persRef
								ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King</persRef>, who
							probably would not incline to go abroad again; who had already received
							a full portion of the honours of this description, and who now filled a
							station of usefulness and honour, in which he was highly distinguished—
							I asked him whether the present <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">Governor
								of New-York</persRef> had occurred to him, as a person suitable for
							a foreign Mission— He looked surprized, but said the Governor of
							New-York certainly was a very prominent character; but he believed his
							views were not to a mission abroad— He would probably not accept one if
							it should be offered— Pennsylvania he said had already two of the
							Missions, and <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> did not now appear to be inclined to
							return home— So that as he was not for the present inclined to bring
							forward any Virginian; he thought the new Missions ought to be filled
							from the South and the West. I gave him my opinion with the utmost
							freedom; and perfect confidence, concerning all the persons whom he had
							mentioned— With respect to <persRef ref="eustis-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Eustis</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef> he was very determined they should come home.
							Eustis’s state of health, rendered it advisable; and as to Russell he
							had received as much notice and distinction from the Government, as the
							public opinion of the Country would tolerate; <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef>
							had with extreme reluctance consented to his last return to Sweden, and
							at the earnest solicitation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay— He
							the President had acquiesced in it; but the only public object to be
							accomplished by it was the completion of the Negotiation of the
							Commercial Treaty, which could not take more than a Month or two of
							time— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell instead of going
							directly to Stockholm his destination, had been amusing himself at
							London and Paris, and indulging his taste for traveling at the public
							expence— It was time this should cease, and he directed me to write to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell, informing him very
							explicityly that his mission there must terminate <pb type="ms" n="331"
							/>in the course of the present year. At the Office, <persRef
								ref="tencate-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ten Cate</persRef>,
							sent me a certificate under his official seal that he had appointed
								<persRef ref="morphy-diego">Don Diego Morphy</persRef>, now acting
							as Spanish Vice-Consul at New Orleans, to be the Consular Agent of the
							Netherlands, there in the room of another person whom he removed. I
							found no record in the Office that this person had ever been appointed.
							I sent and requested ten Cate to come to the Office; and he immediately
							came. I told him the regular manner in which he should communicate to me
							his appointment of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morphy, upon which an
							exequatur would issue, and be sent to him— I mentioned also that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Morphy was no longer acting as Spanish
							Vice-Consul at New-Orleans. He took back his certificate and said he
							would send me a notification in due form: but it would be too late to
							send as he had intended by <persRef ref="noeli-luis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Noëli</persRef> who was going off this
							day for New-Orleans. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ten Cate then
							entered at large into Conversation with me, on the subject of the late
							abortive Negotiation, at The Hague, and the revocation of the
							discriminating duties. He recapitulated what had passed between us
							heretofore, for the purpose he said of making with more certainty a
							correct report of it to his Government, and he took the opportunity to
							sound further what we should be disposed to do, if the Negotiation
							should be resumed. He left me, apparently not dissatisfied— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

							leaving <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary Hellen</persRef> at her <persRef

							to take him home in the Carriage. We got home with difficulty; being
							twice on the point of oversetting, and at the Treasury-Office Corner, we
							were both obliged to get out of the Carriage in the mud. I called out
							the guard of the Treasury-Office, and borrowed a lanthorn with which we
							came home— We immediately sent for the surgeon nearest at hand who came
							and bled Philip— It was a mercy that we all got home with whole

							heard <persRef ref="holley-horace">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Holley</persRef> again— His discourse was rather a lecture than a
							Sermon; and was not so long, as that of last Sunday. He opened his
							doctrines more fully, and his argument bore upon two very distinct
							points. one was to urge mutual and universal toleration—and the other
							was upon the poetical imagery, or what he termed expressly the mythology
							of the Bible. He drew a parallel between the Fables of Chronos, Ouranon
							and Gee, Jupiter, Neptune and Pluto, and Cupid and Psyche, and the six
							days of the Creation—the Creation of the woman from the rib of man, and
							the Serpent the tree of knowledge and the fatal apple. He explained the
							exoteric and the esoteric meanings of these passages of scripture, and
							pronounced the fable of Saturn’s devouring his own children equally
							true, with the narratives in the Book of Genesis. I could scarcely sit
							and hear him with Patience. The house was full— I returned immediately
							home. <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">W. S. Smith</persRef> came to

							Paris, and of his account at the Treasury. He could not account for how

								ref="chevallie-j;chevallie-unknown" type="multi">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Chevallié</persRef>; after which I had a long one, from Col<hi

							come from Amelia-Island, and whom much to my surprize I found to be
								<persRef ref="forbes-james">James Forbes</persRef>, brother of the
							Consul at Copenhagen. I had seen the name of Forbes among those of the
							mock legislature of the Florida’s at Fernandina, but without imagining
							that it was he. Without explicitly informing me how, or when he went
							there, or for what purpose he gave me to understand that he had been
							there most if not all the time from <persRef ref="macgregor-gregor"
								>M’Gregor’s</persRef> taking the island, until possession was taken
							of it by <persRef ref="henley-john">Captain Henley</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="bankhead-james">Major Bankhead</persRef>. He gave me
							many particulars, of the proceedings of the sham patriots under M’Gregor
							and <persRef ref="aury-louis">Aury</persRef>, and of the characters of
							the men, confirming everything that has been said of their profligacy—
							He says that the Mexican Congress was a vessel bought by <persRef
								ref="mina-martin">Mina</persRef> at Baltimore, then called the
							Calypso; and that Aury contrived to get her from Mina, without paying
							for her— That Aury was originally a French Sail-maker—afterwards a
							Sailor, and lived in S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Domingo; till in
							1813 he went <pb type="ms" n="332"/>and offered his services to the
							Patriots of New-Grenada, who gave him a Commission, as Lieutenant in
							their Navy. He is a man entirely illiterate and ignorant; and his papers
							were written by <persRef ref="gual-pedro">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gual</persRef>; and by a young man named <persRef
								ref="comte-unknown">Comte</persRef>, who was born at Baltimore, and
							educated at the Jesuits College there. Son of a S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Domingo refugee not more than twenty years old— Of some
							abilities, but habitually addicted to intoxication. Gual was the most
							respectable man among them; but in desperate circumstances and having no
							means of subsistence— He went there from New-York in the America Libre,
							in September last, and took <persRef ref="pazos-vincente"
								>Pazos</persRef> with him— Pazos was a Printer at Buenos-Ayres,
							banished by the <persRef ref="pueyrredon-juan">Supreme Director
								Pueyrredon</persRef>. <persRef ref="murden-unknown">Murden</persRef>
							was a South-Carolinian, ignorant and worthless. <persRef

								>Mabrity</persRef> a Spanish South-American speaking no other

							his recruiting there having been stopped short. They were constantly for
							some time on the point of bloodshed between the French and American
							parties which were so equally balanced that in their pretended
							legislature they were four and four; and he Forbes would have been the
							ninth, if he had accepted; but had declined. A number of prizes had been
							brought in by Aury’s prizes, but by his bad management he had got
							nothing by them— <persRef ref="heath-unknown">Heath</persRef> had been

							came he made <persRef ref="rousselin-unknown">Rousselin</persRef> the
							judge, who had been the collector of the Customs at Galveston— Forbes
							made some enquiry, if I had lately heard from his brother at Copenhagen;
							he had mentioned his distressed situation there, by the insufficiency of

							rhumatic pains was soon obliged to desist.</p>

								type="multi">two Senators from Pennsylvania</persRef>, with both of

							to appoint Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jackson to the Russian

							before he had been there a Month! I told the President that as the other
							persons whom he had consulted personally knew all the characters much
							better than I did, I should press no further the objection to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell— The President said that there
							was another difficulty in the way of appointing Jackson. He was second

							only in his own views, and upon principles many of which are not those
							of the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, or of any part
							of his Administration. His support might therefore do more harm than
							good. He expressed a desire this Morning to be appointed as Editor of
							the secret Journals of the Old Congress, which by a Resolution of the

							allowed for making the selection, and said it would be a very pleasant
							occupation. He hinted that he would speak of it to the President. I

							him the controul of the President over public money was very limited and
							that the advance which he requested could not be made. He talked of the
							desperation of his Circumstances, and a starving family of children. It
							is very difficult to resist such applications as this; but in the public
							service, and especially in the care of public monies, it seems as if one
							were required to have a heart of stone. I could reply nothing to this
							man’s tale of distress, but I remained inflexible. He asked me, if in
							case he should obtain from private resources the means of going to
							Europe, I would give him instructions <pb type="ms" n="334"/>to our
								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">Ministers in France</persRef>, and

							not only asks all the remainder of the money, but insists upon reserving

							Algerine Money. Crawford was for huffing the demand, and refusing to be
							teazed about it— Crawford would not act so in his own Department; but
							such are the mazes of the human heart. This is not the first time, I
							have seen the drift of Crawford’s advice— While he is assiduously making
							friends to himself, he has no objection to my making as many enemies to
							myself as circumstances will admit; he has not pursued this course so
							far as <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>; who with all his ardour

								>Russell</persRef> go back to Sweden, as Minister, and now in his
							last Speech for the Buenos-Ayres appropriation blames the administration
							for keeping Ministers at Stockholm, and in the Netherlands— I left
							Silsbee’s papers with the President and asked him to give me directions
							with regard to the payment of the remaining money; having some doubt of
							my authority to pay it out. The President asked me to call again as I
							returned home from the Office— <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">Asbury
								Dickins</persRef> a Clerk in the Treasury Department brought me
							yesterday a draft of a Memorial to Congress proposed to be signed by all
							the Clerks, asking for an increase of their Salaries— He said M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford had suggested to him the
							propriety of adding a paragraph stating that the Memorial had been
							submitted to the heads of Departments and had their approbation— I
							thought there should be some discrimination— That some of the Clerks
							were sufficiently paid, and others were not— But M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford thought no discrimination necessary, and I
							consented to the addition of the paragraph, if agreed to by the other
							Heads of Departments— <persRef ref="riley-james">Captain Riley</persRef>
							came and took leave, intending to go for New-York to-morrow. He asked
							for a copy of <persRef ref="osullivan-john">O’Sullivan’s</persRef>
							answer to his Letter of charges— I declined giving it, as it was merely
							a defence of himself and contained no charges against Riley— On
							returning to the President’s, I found he had this morning offered to
								<persRef ref="lowndes-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								William Lowndes</persRef>, the choice of a Mission to Constantinople
							or to Russia. He shewed me his answer, declining both. And he said as
							Congress appeared to be getting into a querulous humour, about the
							foreign Missions, and as he knew no other person whose nomination would
							carry the same weight in its favour, he inclined rather to postpone any
							nomination to Constantinople for the present. I told him that I had
							intended this morning, to suggest to his Consideration the propriety of
							postponing the measure: which upon the perusal of a Memoir which had
							been furnished by <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">General S.
								Smith,</persRef> I had concluded would be most expedient— The
							President again expressed his conviction that <persRef
								ref="campbell-george">G. W. Campbell</persRef> would be the most
							eligible Western man, to send to Russia. I told him I should press no
							farther any objection against him— The President told me he had been
							astonished, at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s attack upon the
							administration, for the Swedish Mission, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay having himself been the cause of Russell’s going back— Russell had
							come home with a sort of avowed determination not to go back— But he
							first through Clay, solicited some employment at home, and finding that
							was not attainable he then was anxious to go back, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay became again his solicitor, on the
							ground that he was the only member of the Ghent Commission, who had not
							been specially noticed by distinction; and as there was to be further
							negotiation about the Treaty that Russell had made with Sweden, <persRef

						<p><date>14. VI:</date> The Letter to <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my
								brother</persRef> insensibly absorbed the morning, till <persRef
								ref="onis-luis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis</persRef> called
							upon me at my house, and kept me more than two hours in Conversation,
							upon the state of Affairs between the United States and Spain. He is
							about to send of <persRef ref="pizarro-martinez">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pizarro</persRef>, one of the persons attached to the
							Mission, to Spain, to ask for new Instructions, and offered to forward
							by him any Instructions for <persRef ref="erving-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Erving</persRef>. He said he had only
							two days since received the leave of absence which he had been long
							soliciting: but he was instructed not to use it, until the negotiation
							for settling the differences between the two Countries, should be
							concluded; an event for which the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii"
								>king</persRef> was extremely solicitous— It would give him extreme
							satisfaction if he could be so happy as to conclude the Treaty and he
							wished very much that a close alliance might be formed between the
							United States and Spain— But if the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> thought the Treaty might with more advantage be
							accomplished at Madrid; he for his part, should very cheerfully
							acquiesce in that arrangement— I told him, it would be equally
							satisfactory, to the President, if the arrangement could be made either
							here or at Madrid; but that he thought it utterly useless either to
							write or to talk any more, upon the subject; as there never had been a
							negotiation so completely <pb type="ms" n="336"/>exhausted, and upon
							which there was so little prospect that the parties would ever come to
							an understanding with each other— He said he did not see why they should
							not; that he hoped we should ultimately yield something; that he wanted
							an Alliance between the United States and Spain. That Spain would grant
							us commercial advantages, and especially any thing that would counteract
							the commercial tyranny of England. He said I had opened his eyes upon
							the conduct of England towards Spain, which was full of duplicity. I
							might be assured that Spain had not asked the Mediation of England to
							settle her differences with us. Spain had made a statement to England of
							the state of affairs between her, and us— She had informed England that
							the king had made up his mind, to cede the Floridas to us and asked the
							acquiescence of England in the measure; having had previous engagements
							with England not to cede any territories in America— England instead of
							agreeing to the proposed cession, offered her mediation, and left it at
							the option of Spain whether it should be offered here by him, Onis, or
							by <persRef key="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bagot</persRef>— He spoke with no small bitterness of England, and
							of her project of mediation in the affairs of the Colonies. Said he
							hoped Spain would settle the affair with the Colonists themselves and
							without intervention of any Mediators; and that if the United States
							would do any thing to come to an arrangement, Spain would secure to them
							commercial advantages, which it was evident England wanted to engross
							exclusively to herself. But with all these Professions M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis proposed nothing, and pretended that
							the Spanish Government had always supposed the river Colorado, which we
							had offered to take for the boundary was the red River of Natchitoches,
							and never imagined it was the Colorado of Texas; which they called the
							river of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Bernard— I told him that this
							mistake was very extraordinary as the boundary in dispute was to
							commence from the gulph of Mexico, and as we knew of no maps in which
							the red river of Natchitoches was called Colorado— Its French name being
							Rouge and its Spanish name Roxo— He said Colorado was the Spanish word
							for red, and that the river of Natchitoches falling into the Mississippi
							fell indirectly into the gulph of Mexico— I told M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Onis that I would write to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Erving, by his Messenger— At the President’s I met <persRef

							been none. He said he had ascertained there had been something in a

								Hasler</persRef>, who has been for some years employed upon a survey

							consequence of the dissatisfaction at the proceedings under the Ghent

							recondite mysteries which no human being will understand without an

						<p><date>28. V:15.</date> Received while at Breakfast this Morning a Note

								>Wirt</persRef> were there. <persRef ref="crowninshield-benjamin"
								>Crowinshield</persRef> is confined at home by sickness— The
							question concerning the Instructions to be given to Hawkins was
							discussed. This Gentleman who is the Agent of the United States before
							the Commission under the 6<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> and 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Articles of the Treaty of Ghent has
							given such a Construction to the Treaty as would take the whole business
							from the Commissioners and place it in the Agents— Although he has been
							repeatedly informed that the President is not of that opinion, he
							perseveres in his own, and has now called for explicit Instructions. The
							opinion of the meeting this day was unanimous, that the power of
							decision belonged to the Commissioners, and that they have the right of
							executing the duty in such manner as they think proper— Crawford
							insisted that in that Commission there was no need of Agents, and hinted
							that it was an oversight in the Treaty to have allowed any Agents. In
							this opinion however he was alone. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt
							appeared to think more about his Salary, or what he called bread and
							meat for his children, than of any other Subject. There was a Bill
							before Congress at the close of the late Session, <del>of Congress</del>
							for increasing the Salaries of all the heads of Departments— It passed
							through both houses, but fell through by a disagreement between them
							upon the details— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt wrote sometime
							since to the President, urging him to recommend to Congress an increase
							of Salary for the Attorney General; and a Clerk, to be allowed him; and
							an Office, and various other comforts and conveniences— The President
							asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford and me, whether we thought
							he ought to make a recommendation by special message for this increase
							of Salary which he said must of course include all the Heads of
							Departments— We both agreed that he ought not That any measure of
							Congress for that purpose should be spontaneous on the part of Congress—
							Wirt however is much dissatisfied, and gave some hints of resigning— He
							has a large family, and cannot hold the Office of Attorney General,
							without a sacrifice of private practice, for which the salary cannot
							compensate. I think he will not hold the place long, and although he has
							opinions and prejudices, not very appropriate to an <pb type="ms"
								n="341"/>Attorney General of the United States, the President would
							not easily fill his place. He has two faults which may have an ill
							influence in the affairs of this Nation— An excessive leaning to State
							Supremacy, and to popular humours. He asked me to negotiate an
							arrangement this day with the State of Pennsylvania, about a delinquent
							debtor both to the United States, and the State of Pennsylvania— The
							United States Marshal took his property in Execution; and the
							Pennsylvania Sheriff took it from the Marshal— The question was now he
							said before the Supreme Court, and he was <hi rend="italic">afraid</hi>
							the decision would be in favour of the United States. Pennsylvania was
							indignant at being summoned before the Court, and refused to appear. I
							asked him what the Department of State had to do with the affair. He did
							not know— As a delinquent debtor, I said his case belonged to the
							Treasury Department— He replied that the Treasury could not relinquish
							the debt— Nor said I can the Department of State— He said, if the
							decision should be in favour of the United States, it would certainly
							stir up a dust—which I told him we could not help— At the Office, I had
							visitors, <persRef ref="hassler-ferdinand">M<hi rend="superscript"

							perhaps a Letter to the <persRef ref="apodaca-juan">Vice-Roy of
								Mexico</persRef> but he employed him only as a Spy— But there was a
							great force, coming to join these people from Europe— The despatches
							that he received from Europe all spoke of it with great anxiety; and
							that was the great cause of the earnestness with which they urged that
							our differences with Spain may be settled. This led to various remarks
							and replies, in which he manifested the wish that Spain should cede the
							Florida’s to us, for a sum of Money; that we should leave the Western
							Boundary of Louisiana unsettled, and that we should give up the claim
							for French Spoliations within Spanish Jurisdiction— All this I assured
							him was out of the question. At the Office I had a visit from <persRef
								key="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef>,
							who also spoke as if alarmed at the L’Allemand expedition to Galvezton
							and said if there was a Buonaparte concerned in it, his Government would
							of course consider it as deserving high attention. I referred him to
								<persRef ref="macgregor-gregor">M’Gregor’s</persRef> expedition, not
							yet abandoned; to the numbers of people coming out from England to join
							it— To the popular disposition in England, favouring the cause of the
							South-Americans, and to the increasing energy of that Sentiment— He has
							no despatches from England later than January— The February Packet from
							Falmouth put back six times, and finally sailed in company with that of
							March, which has arrived by the way of Halifax; while the other coming
							by the way of Bermuda is not yet here. All his despatches for two
							Months, are on board— He spoke of several objects concerning which he
							has written Notes, and as yet received no Answer— The Act for returning
							extra-duties levied after 3. July 1815. The Proclamation about the
							militia-man in Georgia, and the money deposited in one of the New-York
							judicial districts, which is withheld from the owner, because it was
							adjudicated by the Court for the other district— I told him how all
							these cases stood— We had also some slight conversation, upon the
							subject of Colonial policy; upon which he is confident that
							Great-Britain will not yield— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My

						<!-- This is a summary entry without a date.-->
						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> The only change in the distribution of my time since
							the last Month has been effected by the adjournment of Congress. Since
							which, I should have some leisure, but for the arrangement of my
							accounts, the necessity of which was accidentally brought to my
							attention; and which I find a work of very considerable labour. I have
							in one shape or another preserved minutes and vouchers which enable me
							to resume and preserve the thread of all my pecuniary transactions, but
							it is doubtful whether I shall ever be able to bring them into perfect
							order, in the shape of accounts. The Great difficulty is of the charges
							which belong to several different accounts, and those which may at
							option be set down to any one of several. It often happens that the
							proper account to which a charge should be set down depends upon that to
							which a preceding charge made perhaps years before, was set down: and
							that may be forgotten— Thus the Accounts of Stock, Cash, Interest,
							Profit and Loss, family expences, Exchange, and the like often run into
							one another and introduce perplexity and confusion. I have often
							wondered how Merchants in extensive business, and still more, how the
							Treasuries of Nations, can keep any regular Accounts when mine, so
							simple, and so trifling in amount get into a confusion from which I
							cannot extricate them— There is however no confusion or embarrassment in
							the present state of my Affairs.</p>
