							suffice to warn them off or remove them. I advised him therefore to
							procure the names of the persons complained of and upon receiving them,

							prepared to acknowledge one or more of the South-American Governments,
							and we should then be prepared to act in concert with her; not of formal
							compact, but of common good understanding— I desired him to write thus
							to <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, and to
							urge the necessity of an early decision upon the subject— I told him my

							The President found upon enquiry of <persRef ref="jackson-william">Major

							Minister— Nor had any other President— He determined therefore not to

								Monroe</persRef>; upon which we could have no deliberation, and
							which was therefore left to her own decision— The President went and

							first—that it should leave her position with respect to the Ladies of
							the foreign Minister, precisely where it was. That she would afterwards
							neither visit them, nor receive visits from them; nor accept of any
							invitation to their parties. 2. That no rank or station should be
							assigned to her at the Ball— No pretence of distinguishing her as the
							President’s daughter— That at Supper she would find her place somewhere
							among the Commodore’s wives; but must have no particular distinction
							shewn her. 3. That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de Neuville might
							write to his own Government, whatever he pleased upon the subject; but
							that if an account of the Ball, was to be published in the Newspapers
							here, her name should not be mentioned, as having been present. M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Monroe then made some remarks about her
							own determination not to go, and about the multitude of questions
							concerning first visits, which are as numerous as there are individuals—
							Among the rest she told me that the Ladies of some Senators did not
							visit her, because she had adopted the rule of not returning visits. But
							they accepted invitations to her house— I next called at the
							President’s— He spoke to me; about a call from the House of
							Representatives, for the correspondence between the <persRef
								ref="rabun-william">Governor of Georgia</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> about the destruction
							of the Chehaw Town— He said there appeared a disposition in the house to
							push hard upon Jackson, and although it was impossible to justify him
							upon every thing, yet as the whole view of the affair would be
							honourable to him, it was desirable that Congress should have all the
							papers on the subject— I promised to look up all those in the
							Department. He said it would be best for some member to move for an
							enlargement of the Call, to embrace all the papers— I told the President
							I had seen <persRef ref="graham-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								John Graham</persRef>, who would accept the appointment to Rio de
							Janeiro. I also mentioned <persRef ref="appleton-john"
								>Appleton</persRef> to him— He spoke again of <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="middleton-henry">Middleton</persRef> for Spain— Forsyth will
							undoubtedly be the man— I sent for de Neuville to the Office, and
							informed him of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hay’s conditions, upon
							which she will go to his Ball. He put up with them more coolly than I
							expected. We had also some conversation upon our affairs with Spain; and
							upon those of South-America— I desired him to write to the <persRef
								ref="richelieu-armand">Duke de Richelieu</persRef>, and state to him
							that we hope France will be soon prepared to move with us in the formal
							acknowledgment of the Government of Buenos Ayres— That we have given the

							interfering in the policy of the allies on the subject, and as they have
							not agreed upon any thing, and the fact of the Independence of
							Buenos-Ayres appears established, we think it necessary that it should
							be recognized— He appeared to be startled, and not fully prepared to
							talk upon the subject which he soon changed to his demand for a
							reduction of our duties on French wines— the <persRef
								ref="goupydequabeck-alexander">Viscount de Quabeck</persRef><pb

						<p><date>14. VII.</date> On rising this Morning I found for the first time
							this Season the ground covered with Snow. I gave a sitting of an hour to
								<persRef ref="peale-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Peale</persRef>. At the Office I had a long Conference with <persRef
								ref="deforest-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De
								Forrest</persRef> who came last May with an application to be
							recognized as Consul General from the Provinces of South-America, and
							who last week sent me two Notes renewing the application— I now told him
							that the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> considered it
							would be a formal recognition of the Government of Buenos-Ayres, to
							issue to him an exequatur as Consul General— That the President thought
							the time had not yet arrived when that recognition ought to take place;
							having in view both their interests and our own— That this Government
							had been using, and now were using their influence to produce a
							simultaneous acknowledgment of Buenos-Ayres, by other Powers as well as
							by the United States— That there was reason to believe that influence
							had already produced effects favourable to Buenos-Ayres, and to expect
							it would produce more— That when the proper time should come, the
							acknowledgment would not be withheld— He said he was not a Negotiator,
							but a Merchant, and his Commission was only that of a Consul— And asked
							if he should recommend to the <persRef ref="pueyrredon-juan">Supreme
								Director</persRef> to send out here a Minister with full Powers— I
							said not at present, because the objection to his reception would
							probably still exist—when that would cease I could not say; but when the
							time comes notice of it would be given to Buenos-Ayres— In answer to the
							reasons assigned by him for asking an exequatur, I told him that would
							confer no privileges upon him in our Courts of Justice, and that with
							regard to the prize vessel mentioned by him, measures would be taken
							upon Representations made by our own Officers— I added that it might be
							well for him to make known to his Government, that if the United States
							should hereafter acknowledge them it will be without involving
							themselves in any question as to the extent of their authority, or
							territory— Particularly they will not be considered as taking any part
							in their questions with the Portuguese or <persRef ref="artigas-jose"
								>Artigas</persRef>, upon the Banda Oriental—or with Paraguay Santa
							Fe or any provinces contesting their authority— That we should also
							expect to know, whether the Independence that we were to acknowledge was
							complete, or partial— When <persRef ref="worthington-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Worthington</persRef> had without any
							authority undertaken to negotiate a Treaty the Supreme Director had
							refused to accede to an Article placing the parties respectively on the
							footing of the most favoured Nation, upon the alledged principle that
							Spain having claims upon the Country they must reserve the right of
							granting special privileges to her as an equivalent for renouncing them—
							We should consider this as incompatible with total Independence— It was
							essentially different from our own Declaration in which Great-Britain
							was thenceforward placed upon precisely the same footing as other
							Nations—Enemies in War—in Peace, Friends—a principle assumed as
							explicitly in the Treaty of 1778 with France, by which our Independence
							was acknowledged— He said he knew nothing of this negotiation of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Worthington’s; that if there had been any
							reservation of a right to grant special privileges to <pb type="ms"
								n="458"/>Spain it must have arisen only from a distrust of their own
							strength a year or two ago, no longer now existing— He did indeed know
							that there had been a determination to grant special privileges to the
							Nation which should first acknowledge their Independence— I told him we
							should ask none such for ourselves. We should not sell our
							acknowledgment at a price— And if any such exclusive favours should be
							granted to any other Nation we should consider them as evidence rather
							of dependence transferred than of independence— I could not say that we
							should refuse to acknowledge a Government with such qualified
							dependence, but we should certainly not regard it as independence
							entire. He asked me, if I would give a written answer to his Notes, and
							suggest these ideas in it. I promised a written answer; but told him it
							would be in general terms, as the particular ideas that I had mentioned
							having arisen from incidents in which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Worthington had transcended his powers, it might be inconvenient to
							refer to them in written documents though very proper that they should
							be fully understood at Buenos-Ayres— He then asked me, if there would be
							any impropriety in his appearing at the President’s Drawing Room; to
							which I answered that I was not aware of any; but would speak of it to
							the President, and let him know— It was near six O’Clock when I came
							home— After dinner we called on <persRef

							for the next Presidential election but for the one after that is working
							and counterworking, with many of the worst features of elective

							neither party; but neither can find much to attack in it— Hopkinson is
							ardent against Jackson; and no admirer of the Administration, but is in
							profession, and to a certain extent in reality, personally friendly to
							me— Hopkinson moved the call for my late Letter to <persRef

							than <persRef ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef>, or <persRef

							arrive there early in the Spring. He enquired how far the frigate would

							Legation, whether <persRef ref="brent-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"

							could be employed for the service— That her port of arrival might be
							Cadix or Lisbon, at his option; and that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brent would <pb type="ms" n="460"/>probably remain at Madrid, the

								ref="monroe-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Monroe</persRef> is better, but still very sick. I had appointed
							this day at two O’Clock, to see <persRef ref="pederson-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pedersen</persRef> the Danish Minister
							who accordingly came— He began with the case of the Brig Henrick, which
							is rather worse in prospect than I found it, when I first came into
							Congress fifteen years ago— It then passed the House of Representatives
							almost unanimously, but was stopped in the Senate; by the revival of old
							claims for prizes taken during our Revolutionary War; carried into
							Bergen in Norway; and there delivered up to the British. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pedersen that we had now such a mass of
							recent claims, which the Danish Government would not listen to, that not
							only there would be no chance for the owners of the Brig Henrick in
							Congress, but the very presentation of the claim would give rise to
							debates very unpleasant, and very unprofitable. He said he should
							acquiesce in this opinion, and not press his claim further at this time.
							He then spoke of the project of negotiating a Treaty of Commerce between
							the United-States and Denmark. Said <persRef ref="rosenkrantz-niels"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de Rosenkrantz</persRef> had
							assured him that full powers to that effect would be sent to him if
							there should be a desire on the part of the United States for such a
							Treaty. Denmark would be willing to abolish all discriminating duties,
							adopting the principle of our Convention of 3. July 1815. now renewed;
							but it could be of little or no advantage to her unless the equalization
							of duties should extend to all merchandize not only of the produce or
							manufacture of Denmark, but also to that of all the Baltic— There was
							also a difference between the duties paid at the passage of the Sound,
							upon Vessels of Nations which have Treaties with Denmark, and upon
							others—and if the United States should expect the reduction of the Sound
							duties in consequence of the Treaty, it would be reasonable that they
							should grant some equivalent to Denmark for the advantage. As to their
							Colonies; their Ports in the East Indies were open to all Nations— In
							the West Indies, S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Thomas was a free Port,
							and Santa Crux was open only to the United States besides Denmark— I
							told him that the dispositions of this Government towards Denmark were
							entirely friendly; and we should very readily conclude with her a
							commercial Treaty if she should desire it, upon the same principles as
							those of our Convention with Great-Britain— But if we did make a Treaty
							we should of course expect the same advantages, in respect to the Sound
							duties, as other Nations enjoyed by Treaty, and as we might agree to
							extend the equalization of duties to merchandize—usually first exported
							from the Ports of Denmark, that of itself would operate so much in
							favour of Denmark that it would be an equivalent—for the reduction of
							the Sound duties.— I added that although we were willing to negotiate, I
							thought it would be best not to attempt it formally unless we could
							first agree upon the principles to be adopted— He asked me for a Copy of
							the new Edition of the Laws of the United States, and said he intended
							to return to Philadelphia, in about a fortnight— I dined with <persRef

							there is much agitation, misapprehension, and conflict of opinion, in
							the public mind, and in Congress. Parties are rallying round the
							questions involved in these transactions; and connecting themselves with
							the views of individuals upon the next Presidency. There is a
							considerable party disposed to bring forward Jackson as a Candidate, and
							the services of his late Campaign, would have given them great strength,
							if he had not counteracted his own interest, by several of his actions
							in it. But he wrote an inconsiderate Letter to the <persRef
								ref="rabun-william">Governor of Georgia</persRef>, and by that and
							other imprudences, turned the whole of that State against him— He had
							all Kentucky against him, upon something of a similar cause before— He
							has also turned against him all the Governors of the States, and the
							high sticklers for State rights— All Virginia is against him for this
							and sundry other causes. <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford’s</persRef> partizans in Congress, are endeavouring to
							turn the whole affair to his account; first by running down Jackson; and
							then by implicating the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>,
							and the rest of the administration except Crawford, in Jackson’s faults.
							But as this does not suit the views of the Clintonians, they appear
							disposed to rally in support of Jackson, and even of the administration
							upon this occasion— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tallmadge told me he
							had thoughts of bringing forward a series of specific, terse, discreet
							and firm resolutions, declaring the approbation by Congress, of the
							principal contested measures of Jackson, and of the course pursued by
							the administration. He said he was sure of the support of <persRef
								ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King</persRef> in
							the Senate—of Sergeant in the House, and of 22 or 23 votes out of the
							27. of the New-York Delegation. His only doubt was whether he should
							immediately offer these Resolutions, or wait for the attack from the
							other side, and then offer them as a substitute for any Resolutions of
							censure that may be proposed— He said he would further consult with me
							upon the subject before he would move— We had company to dinner.

						<p><date>28. VII:</date><persRef ref="lane-samuel">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Lane</persRef>, the Commissioner of the Public
							Buildings came this morning with a complaint against <persRef
								ref="dougherty-joseph">Dougherty</persRef> the Superintendent of the
							Building in which the Offices of the Departments of State, War and the
							Navy are kept; for having beaten him with a Cowskin this morning at
								<persRef ref="davis-unknown">Davis’s</persRef> tavern, in the
							presence of ten or twelve persons. Lane is a cripple, having no use of
							his right arm, and quite disabled for personal self-defence. By his own
							account the provocation given by him was very trifling; in words only.
							But he says Dougherty had been insolent to him before—and has borne him
							a grudge these eighteen months, because Lane had suspected him of
							dishonesty, in some business that he had done for the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, and had mentioned to the
							President, his suspicions. I called at <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s</persRef> Office, and
							consulted with him what was to be done in the case. He thought a written
							statement of the facts should be made by Col<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi> Lane, and when we should have that, we should send for
							Dougherty; hear what he has to say in his defence, and if insufficient,
							dismiss him from his place, unless Lane himself should declare himself
							satisfied, and consent that Dougherty should be retained— I received the
							Convention with Great-Britain signed on the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.
							</hi>of October. last by <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">A.
								Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef key="rush-richard">R.
							Rush</persRef>, with copies of all the Documents of the Negotiation;
							which I immediately took over to the President— I read to him the
							Convention, and the Letter from Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							Gallatin and Rush of 20. October giving a general account of the
							Negotiation. The Protocol’s of the Conferences, and other documents
							which are voluminous, I took home with me, and am to send them to morrow
							Morning to the President. I returned from his house to my Office; and as
							it rained, after waiting till past five, I sent my Messenger to my
							house, to have the Carriage sent for me— It came after six, and it was
							near seven when I got home to dinner. <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef> came after dinner, and requested to have some
							private conversation with me. He was apparently under great agitation,
							labouring with something which he meant to communicate to me, and yet
							afraid of expressing to me all his feelings— There was an incoherent
							jumble of a multitude of objects national and individual, working at
							once upon his Passions, and producing a perfect Chaos of Confusion in
							his Mind. The main object of his coming professedly was to enquire,
							whether the remarks that I made to him on the 12<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> of this month, concerning the recognition of the
							Independence of Buenos Ayres were intended, to consult the opinion of
							the French Government, or merely to give notice of the intentions of the
							United States— I told him it was partly both— It was to inform France of
							our opinions, as to the proper course to be pursued, and to offer to
							France the opportunity of moving in concert with us, an offer which we
							had at the same time made to <pb type="ms" n="464"/>Great-Britain— He
							then talked incoherently and obscurely about his own personal situation,
							and that of his party, in France the <hi rend="italic">Ultra’s</hi>.
							Said they had been lately “un peu battus,” but would recover their
							ascendancy— That he had no respect or attachment to the present French
							Administration, except the <persRef ref="richelieu-armand">Duke de
								Richelieu</persRef> who was a galant homme, but who would not
							continue six Months longer in office— <persRef ref="laine-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> L’Oiné</persRef> he said the Minister
							of the Interior had commenced a Correspondence with him, and paid him
							high Compliments; but he had enemies in the king’s Council, (he named
								<persRef ref="decazes-elie">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de
								Caze</persRef>) who misrepresented his conduct, and endeavoured to
							ruin him with his party— He was even informed by his private Letters
							that his despatches had been all shewn to <persRef
								ref="pozzodiborgo-carlo">Pozzo di Borgo</persRef> the Russian
							Minister at Paris, and to the Spanish Minister, and he asked me if I had
							any such information? But without waiting for an answer he proceeded to
							say that he himself had written his own secret instructions, when he
							came to America—that the king called him the Don Quixot of America. That
							here he had been in relation with all the proscribed refugees, and had
							obtained permission for many of them to return to France— That <persRef
								ref="lefebvredesnouettes-charles">Lefevre Desnouettes</persRef> had
							been with him in his Cabinet a very few days since. That he hated and
							detested the English, and they were hated in France more than ever— But
							he wished to enquire, if within three or four Months, the Spanish
							Government should agree to conclude a Treaty with us upon our own terms,
							whether the Government of the United States would give a pledge not to
							precipitate measures concerning South-America— Not that France would
							have any objection, if we should acknowledge Buenos-Ayres, but France
							did not wish that England should have all the advantage of taking the
							first steps in that affair— The commercial despotism of England must be
							opposed; not by War—there was no necessity of making war, but by a
							steady and concerted pacific opposition. But if we would not join France
							in it, France would undertake it alone; and now that she was unshackled
							she was quite competent to it— The <persRef ref="louis-xviii">King of
								France</persRef> was under obligations to the <persRef
								ref="george-iv">English Prince Regent</persRef>, who was a brave et
							loyal Chevalier; but France was under no obligations to the English; and
							he would much prefer that his king should return and live at Hartwell,
							rather than that the Bourbons should pass for the creatures and tools of
							England— I told him that the Government of the U.S. could give no such
							pledge as that which he desired— The two objects could not thus be
							connected together. Events were placing the affairs of South America
							quite out of our controul, and it was probable that even now the
							Patriots were in possession of the whole Coast of Terra firma, and had
							driven <persRef ref="morillo-pablo">Morillo</persRef> out of the
							Country. But as to South-America, if Spain had taken the pains to adjust
							her differences with us, there would probably be much less ardour in
							this Country against Spain, and consequently less in favour of the
							South-Americans. Spain might have trusted to the operation of those
							effects. Now, it might be too late— I could answer for nothing. He
							complained of the English influence existing here; even upon members of
							Congress; especially the federalists; and said that had been the cause
							of the failure of the <persRef ref="beaumarchais-pierre"
								>Beaumarchais</persRef> claim; which he said France would pay; if we
							did not eventually pay it, here— His discourse was altogether rambling
							and discontinuous, shewing feelings deeply agitated and I mind scarcely
							in possession of itself. He said he did not care for his place and had
							many times offered his resignation— But he is evidently under great
							apprehension of losing it, and even of being disgraced by his own
							Government— He was here at least two hours, talking all the time;
							ardently, passionately, and with much affectation of confidence and
							mystery; without communicating after all one intelligible or one
							rational idea— Tom’s a’ Cold.</p>

							required any declaration or reservation of their rights by them— I told

							it was for them to make it, and not for the Executive to suggest it to
							them— He accordingly said nothing about it; but I think some of the
							Senators have been whispering to him, and that he expects some question

								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>

						<!-- This is a summary entry without a date.-->
						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> During the cold weather, I ran almost insensibly into
							the practice of keeping later evening hours, which is followed of course
							by later rising in the Morning— In the Evening my room is warm and
							comfortable for writing. In the cold mornings it takes two or three
							hours before the fire warms it to a suitable temperature. This month
							therefore I have risen mostly after daylight, and have retired to bed
							between 11. and 12. I have likewise been several times in company
							abroad, which absorbs every time an evening and a part of the next
							Morning. The distribution of the day continues regular; but the month
							has been far less effective to industrious occupation than the last. My
							friends earnestly urge me to mingle more in society, and to make myself
							more extensively known; but I am scarcely ever satisfied with myself,
							after going into company, and always have the impression that my time at
							home is more usefully spent.</p>
						<p> The year is closed— Its most remarkable event as a portion of the annals
							of my life, has been one of the severest afflictions to which human
							existence is liable—the decease of <persRef ref="adams-abigail">my
								Mother</persRef>—The silver cord is broken—the tenderest of natural
							ties is dissolved— Life is no longer to me what it was—my home is no
							longer the abode of my Mother— While she lived, whenever I returned to
							the paternal roof, I felt as if the joys and charms of childhood
							returned to make me happy— All was kindness and affection—at once silent
							and active as the movement of the orbs of Heaven—one of the links that
							connected me with former ages, is no more— May a merciful Providence
							spare for many future years, <persRef ref="adams-john">my only remaining
								Parent</persRef>!— With the exception of this distressing
							bereavement, the year has been crowned with blessings, for which I am
							grateful to the author of all good. My own health has been preserved;
							that of my partner and children as good as could generally be expected—
							My public duties have been discharged faithfully, and as well as the
							infirmities of my nature have admitted— My Country has prospered with
							the smiles of Heaven— May they be continued!— May the wisdom that is
							from above inspire my thoughts; and the guidance of a gracious Spirit
							direct my steps!—and may the future allotment of Providence whether
							prosperous or adverse, find me with a heart and mind prepared for either
							fortune—to meet adversity with fortitude, or success, with temperance,
							moderation and gratitude to God!</p>
