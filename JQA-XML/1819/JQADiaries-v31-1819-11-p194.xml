						<p><date>2. V:15.</date> I am making an Abstract of the Regulations of the
							several States of this Union upon the subject of weights and Measures.
							Shortly after the Resolution of the Senate passed 3. March 1817.
							requiring a Report from the Secretary of State on this subject, <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>
							wrote a circular to the Governor’s of the States requesting of them
							returns of the Legislative measures of their respective States on this
							head— The answers to this Circular, are yet very imperfect—two States,
							Georgia and Tennessee have not been heard from at all. Maryland has only
							promised an answer; and from several other States short abstracts from
							their Statutes have only been transmitted. As the Session of Congress
							draws near, my apprehensions increase that either I must make a very
							lame Report, or postpone it over again to another Session— I wrote this
							day to the Governors of Maryland, and Georgia requesting again returns
							from them— There is a Law requiring that the Secretary of State should
							from time to time procure the Statutes of the Several States, and yet I
							believe there is not at the Department nor indeed in Washington a single
							complete set of the Laws of any one State in the Union. I must make an
							attempt to remedy this as far as it can be remedied. In this City the
							weights and measures are regulated by the Laws of Maryland, and
							Ordinances of the City Legislature. A <persRef ref="leonard-jacob">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Leonard</persRef> is the Standard
							keeper, and Scaler of weights and Measures— I called upon him this
							Morning to make some enquiries of him; but he was abroad; employed upon
							the duties of his office, and had his weights and measures with him—
							Called at the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>, and
							found <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> and <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> with him— They were
							conversing with him upon the result of the Court Martial on the <persRef
								ref="ragland-thomas;fairfax-wilson;holmes-charles;loring-nathaniel;vining-charles"
								type="multi">Cadets</persRef> at West-Point, in which the Court
							decided that they had no jurisdiction, &amp; thus that the Cadets were
							not subject to the Articles of War. After one such decision by the Court
							Martial <pb type="ms" n="195"/>an elaborate opinion of the
							Attorney-General was taken and approved by the President, and
							transmitted to the Court with orders to reassemble, and reconsider the
							question which they did, and adhered to their former decision. This is
							the second instance within twelve months of sending to a Court Martial
							an opinion of the Attorney General to induce them to revise their
							judgment; which in both cases they have refused. I think the same result
							may almost always be expected. Crawford thought that Court-Martials were
							bound to abide by the opinions of the Attorney-General, sanctioned by
							the President— I very much incline to think that in this instance the
							decision of the Court Martial was right, and it is remarkable that the
							whole tenour of Wirt’s argument which is learned and ingenious, is in
							direct opposition to his conclusion— It is indeed one of those questions
							upon which the Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States or the
							twelve Judges of England might be equally divided— The investigation of
							this affair has however satisfied me that the Cadets ought not to be
							subject to the Articles of War; but to a system of discipline more
							suited to their circumstances as youths and Students, combining part of
							the Articles of War, with other Regulations adapted to the good
							management of Seminaries of Instruction. I suggested this idea which was
							well received, and may be further considered hereafter— But the
							difficulty lies in the present case itself— These Cadets five in number
							have now been nearly a year under arrest; and suspended from attendance
							on the course of Instruction at the Academy. The Court-Martial by which
							one of them was tried, decided, not upon an objection made by them, but
							on a question raised by the Court itself that it was not competent to
							try them— To discharge and restore them without censure would be to
							place them in a very awkward relation with the Superintendent at the
							head of the Institution <persRef ref="thayer-sylvanus">Major
								Thayer</persRef>, whose veracity they attempted to impeach by
							testimony improperly admitted by the Court Martial— To dismiss them
							would be a harsh measure, as their offence if any was not of an
							aggravated nature; as they have never declined, but have rather courted
							a trial; and the President said he had received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="loring-unknown">the father</persRef> of one of the Cadets,
							Loring, complaining of the great hardship of the case. Crawford was for
							dismissing them at once, by the discretionary power of the President.
							But neither M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt nor the President,
							appeared to be prepared for so decisive a measure as that— I had
							difficulty in restraining myself from opposing it, but I forebore— At
							these consultations I have frequent occasion to observe that Crawford
							advances opinions, so preposterous, that it is difficult to impute them
							to perfectly correct motives— The dismission of these Cadets would not
							only be an act of extreme injustice, but certainly an act highly
							unpopular on the part of the President. Crawford feels this, though he
							is perhaps not conscious, that it infects his opinions and advice; but
							he takes special care to recommend no measure which could bring a breath
							of unpopularity upon his own Department. He advances other opinions,
							more for the sake of being in collision with mine, than from any special
							attachment to them as his own— I ought to lay it down as a rule to
							myself never to oppose any opinion advanced by Crawford, in the Cabinet,
							when I know, that without my opposition the President will not adopt it—
							Perhaps it would be well to extend the rule to what is said by any other
							member of the administration—to avoid every conflict of opinion, when it
							is unnecessary to affect the result, and to leave absurdity to die a
							natural death. The President said that Thayer was an excellent Officer,
							and that the Academy at West-Point was in a very flourishing condition.
							There was some desultory Conversation about <persRef
								ref="partridge-alden">Captain Partridge</persRef>, against whom
							Crawford told several very ugly anecdotes, and about <persRef
								ref="collins-charles">Charles Collins</persRef>, Collector of
							Bristol Rhode-Island, who he says is undoubtedly concerned in the
							Slave-trade, though legal proof of it cannot be obtained— Crawford said
							he had done nothing yet about <persRef ref="bagot-mary">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bagot’s</persRef> silks from Canton,
							though at his request I had given my opinion that they ought to be
							admitted without payment of duties. He said he thought if admitted at
							all it should be upon condition that they should be re-exported. This
							gave rise to a discussion, in which I stated my opinion that the
							allowance of the privilege to foreign Ministers, of free admission of
							Articles <hi rend="italic">for their own or family use</hi>, ought to be
							as liberal as possible, <pb type="ms" n="196"/>so long as there is no
							suspicion of fraud or bad faith, and that the indulgence ought to stop
							the instant that abuse or even suspicion of abuse should begin. He
							admitted there was no cause for suspicion in the present case, but said
							there was no Law for allowing the exemption— The President said it was
							by the Law of Nations: and directed that the silks should be admitted—
							Crawford in his argument to support the principle that the Court Martial
							ought to be bound by the opinion of the Attorney-General, had laid it
							down as a general rule that when the opinion of that Officer is asked on
							a point of Law by a competent authority, it ought to be taken by them as
							conclusive; because if they could come to a decisive opinion against it,
							they ought not to take the opinion at all. It struck me that Crawford
							ought to have applied his principle to his own practice— He ought not to
							have referred this case to me for my opinion, or he ought to have abided
							by my opinion when given—which it was very explicitly. The object itself
							is so trifling, and the principle I assume at once so fair and safe that
							I cannot very easily account for his disregard of my opinion after
							asking it, but from the belief that his own opinion inclined the other
							way; but that he was willing to haggle with a foreign Minister about the
							duties upon two or three pieces of silk, and at the same time to put all
							the littleness, and all the petty trouble of the discussion upon me— He
							said that under the colour of this permission, other silks than those
							ordered for <persRef key="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bagot</persRef>, might be delivered with them— I said it would be
							proper to require of <persRef ref="antrobus-gibbs">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Antrobus</persRef> to specify the
							identical Silks imported by order of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bagot; and to limit the Collector to the free admission of them only— He
							had objections even to this— He said Antrobus might answer that he did
							not know. I said <persRef ref="astor-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Astor</persRef>, the importer must know, and might be
							required to state— There were also two other cases of applications from
							Antrobus, which I had referred to Crawford, who has decided against one
							of them, and who said he should decide probably against the other, and
							in both instances rightly— The President said Astor had made the same
							offer to him to import any Articles for him from China, and <persRef
								ref="monroe-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Monroe</persRef>, had ordered some Teas; upon which of course the
							duties would be paid— Crawford said he had only ordered some plants of
							the <hi rend="italic">Tick</hi>-tree, which he thought would grow in
							Louisiana—I had understood him the other day, to say the Tea-Plant— We
							were at the President’s till past three; so that I was only a half an
							hour at my Office— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and <persRef
								ref="crawford-susanna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> paid us an Evening visit, and <persRef
								key="smith-william-steuben">W. S. Smith</persRef> was here— <persRef

						<p><date>3. V:</date> In the course of my enquiries to prepare the Report to
							the Senate upon weights and measures, I came naturally to the question
							what was their condition in this District— In Washington they are
							regulated by the By-Laws of the Corporation— The <persRef
								ref="smallwood-samuel">Mayor</persRef> was authorised to procure a
							complete set according to the standard used in Maryland, and a Sealer is
							appointed who is required once every three Months to enter every Store
							shop or place where goods are bought and sold and examine the weights
							and measures— A <persRef ref="leonard-jacob">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Leonard</persRef> holds this Office now, who has a shop
							near my house. I called there yesterday and several times this Morning
							to see him and his Standards; but he was absent in the performance of
							his duties. I left a request to see him to-morrow morning— I was at the
							Office of <persRef ref="nourse-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nourse</persRef> the Register of the Treasury on some private
							concern of mine, and enquired of him whether any Instructions had ever
							been given to the Revenue Officers of the United States, with regard to
							the weights and measures used by them— He thought there were none, but
							promised to make enquiry— In analyzing the answers from the Governors of
							the States to the circulars requesting information of their respective
							Regulations, I find them still so imperfect; and questions connected
							with the subject multiply upon me in such a manner, that I feel the want
							of another year at least to make a better Report than I shall be able to
							prepare for the ensuing Session of Congress. But on the other hand this
							will be the third Session since the Report was called for by the Senate,
							and there is some impatience both in Congress and in the Public Mind,
							for something to be done by Congress, under their authority to regulate
							weights and measures— I shall therefore be obliged to make a report,
							unsatisfactory to myself, and which will probably prove so to Congress
							and to the Public. I received a Note from <persRef
								ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron Stakelberg</persRef> the Swedish
							Chargé des Affaires, who arrived here last Evening <pb type="ms" n="197"
							/>requesting me to appoint a time when I would see him— I directed an
							answer to be sent, fixing to-morrow at one O’Clock to see him at the
							Office. A Note from <persRef ref="antrobus-gibbs">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Antrobus</persRef> the British Charge
							d’Affaires enclosed a copy of a Letter from the <persRef ref="george-iv"
								>Prince Regent</persRef> to The United States of America—with a
							request for an Audience of the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> to deliver it— The President directed me to
							appoint one O’Clock on Friday when he would receive them both. I spoke
							to the President, concerning Instructions to be given to <persRef
								key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef> to propose again to the British
							Government, the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef>,
							for the umpire, upon the disputed question upon the construction of the
							first Article of the Treaty of Ghent relating to the restoration of
							Slaves and other captured property— He directed me to prepare them. I
							also suggested to him the idea of asking M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rush and <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> to procure and transmit the Laws and regulations
							by which the military Schools in France and England are governed: with a
							view to adopt those of them which may be found proper, for the Academy
							at West Point—which he approved. I asked him if he could not restore the
								<persRef
								ref="ragland-thomas;fairfax-wilson;holmes-charles;loring-nathaniel;vining-charles"
								type="multi">five Cadets</persRef> who had been so long suspended,
							with an expression of his disapprobation upon their conduct if he
							disapproved it; and also censuring the Court-Martial for admitting
							illegal testimony to the discredit of <persRef ref="thayer-sylvanus"
								>Major Thayer</persRef>— He shewed me a Copy of a Letter from the
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Secretary of War</persRef>, to Major
							Thayer, dated last January, declaring the President’s approbation of his
							conduct and his disapprobation of that of the Cadets; but directing the
							dismission of <persRef ref="bliss-john">Bliss</persRef>, the professor,
							against whom the Cadets complained, and that Thayer should restore them
							as soon as might be consistent with the Service— The President added
							that <persRef ref="vandeventer-christopher">Major van Deventer</persRef>
							the Chief Clerk in the War Department said that if this Letter had been
							communicated to the Cadets by Thayer when he received it, the whole
							affair would have subsided. But the Court Martial having been ordered,
							Thayer felt a delicacy at communicating the order.— The arrested Cadets
							are all young men of good character and promise— Their offence, though a
							serious one in reference to military discipline, was no offence at all,
							in the members of a civil, scientific institution. Such transactions
							should be treated with great lenity; and the whole of this affair shews
							the necessity of other Regulations for the Government of this Academy,
							than the mere Articles of War— <persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen"
								>Pleasonton</persRef> was at my Office and explained to me the cause

							and a yard. They are of brass and copper—but no Beer measure, nor Troy
							weights— Leonard told me that the Alexandria Weights and Measures being

							which are from the Standards of Maryland. Leonard had some old Troy
							weights of his own which I found upon trial were light— I sent for a tin
							Quart Pot and tried my Decanters till I found one that held exactly a
							Quart. I also weighed a Quart of Water, which I found to be 14724 grains

							to all persons whom it might concern and constituting him Charge
							d’Affaires, in the absence of <persRef ref="clemente-lino">Don Lino

								type="ms" n="198"/>but directing him to use every exertion in his
							power to promote the cause of Venezuela, and its Independence, without
							infringing upon the Laws of Nations or of the United States— Torres left
							these papers, and a translation of them with me— I promised to lay them
							before the President, and told him I had no doubt I should be authorised
							to receive any communication from him which he might have occasion to
							make— Torres told me he had been constantly residing in the United
							States since the year 1796— I took his papers to the President, who said
							he had been informed that Torres would not be guilty of such misconduct
							as that of his predecessor Clemente; who he said had upon his return to
							Venezuela been imprisoned— Roscio told <persRef ref="perry-oliver"
								>Commodore Perry</persRef> that it was impossible for the Government

							Meeting of Congress, I thought it would be proper at the commencement of
							the Session, to communicate the papers of the Negotiation; to state the
							fact that her arrival might be expected at an early day and that a
							further communication would then be made— When she arrives the proper
							course of proceeding will be shaped according to the information to be
							received by her— But I thought nothing should be suspended to wait for
							the Spanish negotiator. When he comes, the ground with him should be
							changed— A direct and explicit refusal to negotiate upon any thing
							settled by the Treaty, and a call upon him to treat for the injury
							sustained by the United States, from the non-ratification within the
							limited and stipulated time seems to be the only proper course to be
							pursued— I still retained the opinion that the President should
							explicitly recommend to Congress an Act, authorising the immediate
							occupation of Florida— That a force should be sent sufficient to
							accomplish it without bloodshed, and a strong manifestation be given
							that the occupation is intended not as an act of hostility; but as the
							mere assertion of a right, unjustly withheld— The President fully
							concurred in this opinion, and said he thought it would be expected by
							the world— That all the principal powers of Europe had pronounced
							themselves against Spain upon the point of the ratification; and that if
							we should not act with promptitude, decision and vigour we should lose
							consideration in the eyes of the world; it would be taken for a symptom
							of weakness, and all the other Nations whose respect it is important to
							us to command would immediately take advantage of it against us— The
							President next spoke of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef>, and expressed some apprehension that he would
							again bring up the subject of the Report of the Committee of the Senate
							against him last Winter, and that it might lead to very unpleasant and
							distressing consequences: and he asked me whether I thought he ought to
							write to Jackson, and dissuade him from it. I said that as the friend of
							General Jackson, which it was certainly my wish to be, I should most
							earnestly wish that the subject of that Report should not be brought up
							again in the Senate by him or on his part, and although it might not be
							suitable for the President to enter into a correspondence with him to
							dissuade him from it, yet if there was any friend of the General’s in
							whom he had confidence, and who had influence over his mind, who could
							take the liberty of giving him advice, I thought it impossible he should
							be too urgent in giving it. My own belief was that if he had any thought
							of bringing it up again, it was from an apprehension that it would be
							brought up, by his enemies against him— The President said there were
							false stories in circulation, about Jackson, one of which <persRef
								ref="worthington-thomas">Governor Worthington</persRef> of Ohio had
							told him last Evening. It was that last Winter Jackson came to the
							President’s house, and asked to see him—was told by the Porter there was
							a Gentleman with him; enquired who it was; and was told it was <persRef
								ref="eppes-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Eppes</persRef>;
							upon which he turned upon his heel, and said he would never set his foot
							in a house where such a fellow as Eppes was received— The President said
							there was no truth in this—enquiry had been made of his Porter, who did
							not even know M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eppes, and who declared
							that nothing like it had ever been said by Jackson— I said it was
							however certain that Jackson had been exasperated to the highest pitch
							against Eppes—that when he went from here last March it was with extreme
							difficulty he had been dissuaded from going to Eppes’s residence to
							challenge him, and that if the subject should be brought up again next
							Winter and he should be here, I was afraid nothing could prevent their
							fighting— He said he thought so, and it would be much to be lamented;
							but he also thought with me, that he could not directly interfere, to
							prevent it; especially as he had made an unsuccessful effort to
							reconcile Jackson with <persRef ref="scott-winfield">Scott</persRef>—
							Jackson had told him he had no sort of doubt that Scott was a brave
							man—that he would not challenge him—that if when he wrote to him in
							consequence of the anonymous letter, Scott had answered him with candour
							that in a conversation at a private table, he had expressed opinions as
							he felt them without expecting that they would be reported to him; he
							would have thought no more of it—but to be charged with mutiny by his
							inferior officer—he did not see how it was possible for him to overlook
							it, without forfeiting his own self-respect— Other topics to be
							introduced into the message were postponed— But the President mentioned
							the Cadet Court-Martial again, and asked whether in disapproving the
							Sentence of the Court, he ought not to accompany it with some <pb
								type="ms" n="200"/>further notice of displeasure— I said if he
							thought the proceedings of the Court were to be viewed in the light of
							misconduct to be punished, he might dismiss the Officers who composed it
							from the army; but if not, I thought it would be sufficient to
							disapprove in one word their proceedings, and to say no more on the
							subject. For to controvert their decision in a book—to argue against
							their opinion, would be perhaps descending to their level, and perhaps
							impair the dignity of the President’s Office. If it was to be mere
							reasoning against the sentence, they might say, well, the President’s
							opinion is one way, and ours is another—and the misfortune was that
							their’s was the effective opinion— To argue against that which he could
							not annul would be unprofitable waste of censure, and if more than mere
							official disapprobation was to be given, it ought to be by some act, and
							not by words— The President appeared to give assent to this— He said
							however that the arrested <persRef
								ref="ragland-thomas;fairfax-wilson;holmes-charles;loring-nathaniel;vining-charles"
								type="multi">Cadets</persRef>, had written a long and quite improper
							Letter to him— This was the first time I had heard of that— On returning
							from the President’s to my Office, I learnt that <persRef

						<p><date>10. V:30.</date> For several days past until this morning, I had
							fallen into a lazy habit of not rising till day-light. I was this day
							more regular, but with little improvement of profitable occupation— At
							the Office <persRef ref="brown-francis">President Brown</persRef> of
							Dartmouth College brought me a Letter of Introduction from <persRef
								ref="kirkland-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Kirkland</persRef>. He is an invalid, apparently deep in a
							consumption, and travelling with <persRef ref="brown-elizabeth">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brown</persRef>, to South-Carolina,
							or Georgia, for a mild Winter Climate— They remain here only a few days.
							I called at the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>; and
							he read to me the first sketches, of the Message he is preparing for the
							Commencement of the ensuing Session of Congress— They relate to Spain
							and the South-American Affairs; state the Circumstances of the failure
							of Spain to ratify the Treaty—the measures since taken by him; and
							recommend for the Consideration of Congress, whether we ought not to
							proceed, as if the Treaty had been ratified— The present state of the
							contest in South America, was spoken of in general terms, with the
							remark that success had generally attended the Patriots, who had
							maintained their cause in Buenos-Ayres, Chili and Venezuela, with
							increasing prospects of its ultimate establishment— These paragraphs
							were not finished; but he said he proposed to add that as it could not
							be expected that the struggle would be much longer protracted, the
							probability of its terminating in favour of the Independents had been
							considered, and proposals had been made to the British Government, for a
							recognition of the Independence of Buenos-Ayres, in concert; a
							proposition which might be offered at a suitable time to the other
							principal European powers— He said as the British Government had made
							known this proposition to Spain, it was no secret; and he thought it
							would be best to avow it explicitly; as it would take from those who
							wished to make a handle of the South-Americans against the
							administration, the ground from under them— I saw no adequate motive for
							objecting to this communication— And the President directed to have two
							copies made out of the Instructions given to <persRef ref="perry-oliver"
								>Commodore Perry</persRef>, and to his successor Morris. Besides
							these Subjects he spoke of the appointments to be made of District
							Judges for the Southern District of New-York and for Maryland— For the
							former there are several Candidates, all strongly recommended. For the
							latter he observed the recommendations in favour of <persRef
								ref="bland-theoderick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bland</persRef> had multiplied and strengthened; and among them was
							that of <persRef ref="lloyd-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lloyd</persRef>, who would probably come as one of the Senators from
							that State— It is obvious that Bland will be appointed, and that the
							President wished me to assent to the appointment— But I could not
							reconcile it to my sense of right and of duty— I told him that I was
							aware the pressure of influence in favour of Bland had much
							increased—that I thought too much of it had been used— I considered the
							imputations upon his integrity to be groundless— I believed him entirely
							honest— But I could not admit the principle upon which his appointment
							was urged to be absolutely necessary; as a vindication of his character,
							and the original objection against his appointment, that upon many of
							the most important causes pending before the Court, it was impossible
							that he should be impartial, still remained in force. The President said
							that these and some other considerations which were suggested had great
							weight and came for the present to no decision— He spoke also of the Law
							of the last Session of Congress authorising him to send to Africa, to
							which he thought <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> was for giving too
							extensive, and <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Wirt</persRef> too limited a construction— He himself
							considered it as giving him power to appoint and send two agents to the
							Coast of Africa, to reside there, and to make provision for the
							comfortable subsistence of the coloured people to be <pb type="ms"
								n="202"/>transported thither by virtue of the act— I believe this
							may be done under the act, but observed that the Act itself had
							evidently passed without much consideration of its purport, and that it
							would be desirable that the whole subject should be revised by Congress—
							I submitted a question also upon a claim of <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>, for an allowance from the contingent expenses of
							the Mission to France, for Office-Rent; which claim has also been made,

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>—
							No definitive determination— This Evening I began writing again upon the
							Report concerning weights and measures— My studies on this subject for
							many days have been at once very laborious and unprofitable.</p>

								Greuhm</persRef>, the Prussian Minister Resident came this morning,
							and informed me that he had come to the determination to be married in
							the course of a few days to <persRef ref="lawless-virginie">Miss
								Bridon</persRef>; upon which I offered him my congratulations and my
							best wishes. He said he was tired of living a wandering and solitary
							life, as he had done these ten years— Solitude always distant from his
							natural friends and kindred, and continually removing from one set of
							acquaintance to another, had become irksome to him. He wanted somebody
							to love; and he had found the tastes and sentiments and habits of Miss
							Bridon so congenial to his own, that he had made up his mind to marry
							her. He had also received from his Government, a leave of absence, of
							which he should avail himself next Spring; and in the meantime, <persRef
								ref="middleton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Middleton</persRef> had been so obliging as to let them have his
							house at Kalorama. He also told me much of the history of his own life,
							and of that of his intended Bride, whose <persRef ref="bridon-unknown2"
								>father</persRef> had been wealthy, and had given her an excellent
							education; but having by an unfortunate speculation lost his whole
							fortune in one day, and shortly after died, had left his <persRef
								ref="bridon-unknown3">widow</persRef> and two daughters entirely
							destitute; and Miss Bridon had been obliged to maintain herself as
							Governess to an American family, with whom she came from France; and
							since then at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton’s— Greuhm himself
							is a native of Darmstadt; but has been ever since the year 1797 in the
							Prussian Service— At Noon, after a mere call at the Office, I attended
							at the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> where <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> and <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> soon afterwards came—
							The President read to us, the portion of his Message that he has
							prepared, and which was very little more than what he read to me last
							week— It must in all probability undergo, an entirely new Modification
							on its principal topic, our relations with Spain, upon the arrival of
							the Hornet, which I still hope will be before the Meeting of Congress—
							The recommendation of the President is to consider the Treaty as if it
							was ratified, and to carry it into execution in the same manner— He had
							drawn two concluding paragraphs referring to the contingency that Spain
							should assume a hostile attitude; one of which was in general terms; and
							the other more explicit; glancing at the propriety of occupying the
							territory between the Sabine and the Rio Bravo— Crawford preferred the
							general expressions, and told a Story about old <persRef
								ref="telfaire-edward">Governor Telfair</persRef> of Georgia, who
							having got into a sharp correspondence with some Officer, and looking
							over a draft of a Letter which his Secretary had prepared for him to the
							Officer, pointed to a paragraph which struck him as too high toned, and
							told his Secretary he would thank him to make that passage “<hi
								rend="italic">a little more mysterious</hi>.” We all laughed very
							heartily at the joke, which so pleased Crawford that he told the Story
							over again in detail—but it was good upon repetition— He said he had
							been conversing with <persRef ref="lowndes-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowndes</persRef>, who told him that
							both in England and France, every body with whom he had conversed,
							appeared to be profoundly impressed with the idea, that we were an
							ambitious and encroaching people; and he thought we ought to be very
							guarded and moderate in our policy to remove this impression— I said I
							doubted whether we ought to give ourselves any concern about it— Great
							Britain after vilifying us twenty years as a mean low-minded, pedlaring
							Nation having no generous ambition and no God but gold, had now changed
							her tone and was endeavouring to alarm the world at the gigantic grasp
							of our ambition— Spain had been doing the same; and Europe who even
							since the commencement of our Government under the present Constitution
							had seen those Nations intriguing with the Indians and negotiating to
							bound us by the Ohio, had first been startled by our acquisition of
							Louisiana, and now by our pretension to extend to the South Sea; and
							readily gave credit to the envious and jealous clamour of Spain and
							England against our ambition— Nothing that we could do or say would
							remove this <pb type="ms" n="205"/>impression, until the world shall be
							familiarized with the idea of considering our proper dominion to be the
							Continent of North America. From the time when we became an independent
							people, it was as much a Law of Nature that this should become our
							pretension as that the Mississippi should flow to the sea— Spain had
							possessions upon our Southern and Great Britain upon our Northern
							border— It was impossible that centuries should elapse without finding
							them annexed to the United States— Not that any spirit of encroachment
							or ambition on our part renders it necessary; but because it is a
							physical, moral and political absurdity that such fragments of
							territory, with Sovereigns at fifteen hundred miles beyond sea,
							worthless and burdensome to their owners should exist permanently
							contiguous to a great, powerful, enterprizing and rapidly growing
							Nation. Most of the Spanish territory which had been in our
							neighbourhood, had already become our own; by the most unexceptionable
							of all acquisitions; fair purchase, for a valuable consideration. This
							rendered it still more unavoidable that the remainder of the Continent
							should ultimately be ours. But it is very lately that we have distinctly
							seen this ourselves; very lately that we have avowed the pretension of
							extending to the South-Sea; and until Europe shall find it a settled
							geographical element that the United States and North-America are
							identical, any effort on our part to reason the world out of a belief
							that we are ambitious, will have no other effect than to convince them
							that we add to our ambition, hypocrisy— Crawford spoke of an Article in
							the last Edinburgh Review, defending us against this charge of Ambition;
							but if the world do not hold us for Romans, they will take us for Jews,
							and of the two vices I had rather be charged with that which has
							greatness mingled in its composition— On the part of the Message
							relating to the South Americans there was little said. Crawford said he
							had met <persRef ref="torres-manuel">Torres</persRef> last Evening at
								<persRef ref="mason-john">General Mason’s</persRef>, and he had told
							him, that the change in Venezuela, by which <persRef
								ref="arismendi-juan">Arismendi</persRef> had been placed at the head
							of the civil Government, would be for the better; and give them new
							energy— The message makes an advance towards a recognition, of
							Buenos-Ayres, Chili and Venezuela; but not more than is warranted by
							circumstances. There were two or three short paragraphs in the draft
							relating to the late prevalence of the yellow fever—to the drought, and
							the pecuniary embarrassments of the Country. They closed with
							consolatory assurances that these evils had in a great measure ceased—
							Crawford and Wirt both objected that this would be thought as regarded
							the money concerns a flattering representation; and the President said
							he would substitute in part removed, instead of a great measure. This
							introduced a desultory conversation, upon various topics, and
							particularly upon the Report which Crawford is to make to Congress upon
							the currency— He said that scarcely any of the State Banks to whom he
							had applied for returns of the state of their affairs had made them; and
							he must wait to receive copies of those which they were obliged to make
							to the respective State Legislatures— I spoke to the President and took
							his directions concerning several of the current affairs of the Office—
							On my return to it I found <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton</persRef> there. He lent me
							several volumes of the Philosophical Transactions; and among the rest
							the volume for 1768. containing the account of <persRef
								ref="bird-unknown">Bird’s</persRef> admeasurement of the old French
							Toise; which I read this Evening— The Journal of the day employed the
							rest of it, and was not completed— <persRef ref="cardelli-pietro"

						<p><date>17. V:15.</date> The morning was absorbed in completing the Journal
							of yesterday— I have a French Kilogramme, an Amsterdam commercial pound,
							A Swedish Victual pound, and three Russian Pounds, one of Iron and two
							of brass— I took them all with me this morning to the Branch Bank to
							make the experiment of weighing them with their weights and Scales; but
							I have little confidence in the result— They have a pair of Standard
							Scales made by <persRef ref="dearborn-benjamin">Dearborn</persRef>,
							which belonged to the Branch of the Old Bank of the United States, but
							which having been long disused are not regulated, and have grown rusty—
							They are indeed so much out of order that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi><pb type="ms" n="206"/><persRef ref="smith-richard"
								>Smith</persRef> the Cashier asked me to come again in a few days,
							and repeat the experiment, promising in the mean time to have the Scales
							properly regulated. I shall therefore postpone marking the result. At
							the Office I had visits from <persRef ref="torres-manuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Torres</persRef> and from <persRef
								ref="poletica-pierre">Poletica</persRef>, the Russian Minister— I
							told Torres that I had laid his papers before the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> who had directed me to
							receive from him any communications that he might be disposed to make—
							He repeated that it was his full determination, and the intention of his
							Government that he should do nothing which might give dissatisfaction to
							the Government of the United States. He then said that he was charged to
							open and extend friendly relations between the two Countries to the
							utmost of his power— That he had orders to procure provisions for the
							English troops of <persRef ref="devereux-john">General
								Devereux’s</persRef> legion who had arrived in Venezuela, and whom
							they could not maintain with the same kind of provisions which they
							supplied their own countrymen with— That by the occupation of
							New-Grenada, he hoped they would now have a good supply of funds, but
							that previous to that event they were in want of immediate pecuniary
							means. That through the medium of <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Sergeant</persRef>, he had made a
							proposal to the Bank of the United States to obtain from them, an
							immediate sum of 500 000 dollars to be repaid within eighteen Months in
							gold, and silver Bullion— It had at first been objected that the Bank
							were restricted from making loans to a foreign Government; but he had
							stated it was not precisely a loan that he wanted— The bank were
							purchasing bullion— He offered to contract to furnish them with a given
							quantity of it, to be supplied at a certain time and asked payment for
							it in advance upon such terms as they might agree to— The subject was
							now before the Bank for Consideration, and they might wish to know in
							what light it would be considered by the Government. I promised to
							mention it to the President; and said I was confident there would be no
							objection on his part to the Government of Venezuela’s obtaining in this
							Country any supplies of provisions for which they might have occasion—
							That the Directors of the Bank must determine what contracts they may
							legally make according to their Act of incorporation, and what they may
							deem expedient for their interests; and that if they should find the
							contract proposed by him within their powers and expedient, it would in
							no manner be disapproved or discountenanced by this Government— He then
							shewed me his Letter to Sergeant and said there were some other objects
							of less importance upon which he should hereafter speak to me; and
							intimated a wish to pay his respects to the President; as well as to
							write me a Note expressive of the objects with which he is charged— He
							asked for the return of his Papers; but they were locked up in the desk
							of <persRef ref="purviance-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Purviance</persRef> who was not at the Office— He said he would call
							for them again— Poletica brought with him a despatch enclosed to
								<persRef ref="pozzodiborgo-carlo">Pozzo di Borgo</persRef> which he
							asked me to forward for him— He repeated what he has said to me many
							times before that he could send nothing by the way of England, because
							the British Government opened all the Letters written by Russian
							Ministers that ever came in their power. He spoke of South-American
							Affairs and said it appeared they were in a state of complete anarchy at
							Angostura. I told him quite the contrary— That the appointment of
								<persRef ref="arismendi-juan">Arismendi</persRef> as Vice-President
							was expected to give new energy to the management of their Affairs— That
							the successes of <persRef ref="bolivar-simon">Bolivar</persRef> in
							New-Grenada had been splendid, and unless <persRef ref="morillo-pablo"
								>Morillo</persRef> should very soon receive reinforcements I thought
							he would be compelled to abandon the Country— He said he thought there
							was great exaggeration in the accounts of Bolivar’s success— He had but
							three thousand men—what was it possible to do with 3000 men? I said
							there was no doubt great exaggeration— But Bolivar had certainly taken
							Santa Fé de Bogota, and New-Grenada was revolutionized— That this had
							been accomplished by so small a force, indicated that the Mass of the
							People favoured the Revolution, and that was the Spirit which Spain
							never would subdue— He said that he was perfectly convinced that Spain
							never would recover the dominion of <pb type="ms" n="207"/>those
							Provinces, but he was equally confident that in seven years from this
							time they would have no regular government. That I observed was entirely
							a distinct question— I took this opportunity to tell him that about a
							year ago, a proposition was made by this Government to that of
							Great-Britain for an acknowledgment in concert of the Government of
							Buenos Ayres; which was not accepted— I stated to him the principles
							upon which it had been made, and I wished him to inform his Government
							that the only reason why it was not at the same time made to the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> was the reason we had
							to suppose that the proposition itself would not only have been
							unacceptable to him, but that it would not have been agreeable to him
							that it should be made— For the same reason it was not made to France,
							and as the President’s Message to Congress at their approaching Session
							will communicate and make public the fact of the proposal made to
							England, I said I wished him to assure his Government that it was made
							to Great-Britain alone, not with the purpose of a partial concert with
							her; but of a general concert of all the great European Powers with us—
							If he had been here at the time when we made the proposal to
							Great-Britain, I should have communicated it to him, and would have
							conversed as freely with him concerning it as I had with the <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French Minister</persRef>— But <persRef
								ref="dashkov-andrei">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Daschkoff</persRef> was not here; and the situation in which he
							stood with this Government was such, that if he had been I could not
							have communicated with him freely— He said there was a delicacy in his
							touching upon this with his Government, as Daschkoff was now gone home,
							and his personal prospects might be effected by any thing thus said of
							him. I replied that it would be quite unnecessary; if he would
							distinctly state the only reason why our proposition to recognize
							Buenos-Ayres was not made to the Emperor at the same time that it was
							made to England. He promised to do it, and told me he would shew me the
							Memoir upon South-America, drawn up before the Congress at Aix la
							Chapelle met.— We had a long discussion upon the propriety and
							expediency of the recognition, in which I urged all the topics in its
							favour, and he all the topics against it, though he strenuously denied
							that Russia had any leaning in the case either against the
							South-Americans or in favour of Spain. I hinted to him that after a
							reasonable time if the great Powers of Europe, should continue to
							decline the acknowledgment in concert with us; we should perhaps adopt
							the measure ourselves. He appeared disposed to argue against this, but I
							told him we must be the judge of our own policy; upon which he said he
							was speaking only as an individual, and not as Russian Minister— He also
							asked me for the papers he had lent me last winter about the holy
							alliance, which I promised to have looked up and return to him. This
							evening <persRef ref="dexter-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S.

							advised him to obtain recommendations or testimonials from respectable

							papers upon various subjects to take his directions— Among the rest a

									>r</hi> Ellery</persRef> of Boston against <persRef
								ref="cochrane-thomas">Lord Cochrane</persRef> for taking money <pb
								type="ms" n="208"/>from him in Peru; upon which the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> asked what was to be done?
							and added he supposed a demand of restitution must be made upon the
							Chilian Government. I recommended the Appointment of an Agent, and
							mentioned <persRef ref="forbes-john">Forbes</persRef> as <persRef
								ref="prevost-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Prevost</persRef>
							has probably before this received his orders to go to Buenos-Ayres— The
							President said he would think of it till to-morrow. He said <persRef
								ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> N.
								Biddle</persRef> had spoken to him about a sword which had been
							presented by the <persRef ref="lapezuela-joaquin">Viceroy of
								Peru</persRef> to his brother <persRef ref="biddle-james">Captain
								Biddle</persRef>, and upon which there has been some public
							animadversion— Captain Biddle had proposed to deposit it in the
							Department of State— I observed there were already some such presents
							there, and had been others which have been taken away again— Nothing
							however was finally determined upon this affair. The President gave me a
							small slip of a newspaper containing a paragraph of a message which the
							late <persRef ref="rabun-william">Governor Rabun</persRef> had prepared
							to communicate to the Legislature at their Meeting— He died just before
							they met; and it was sent by <persRef ref="clarke-john2">his
								successor</persRef> to the Legislature as he found it— It was a
							complaint that on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of February last
							he had written to the Secretary of State enclosing certain Resolutions
							of the Legislature of Georgia, of the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.
							</hi>of December last concerning certain negroes that had been stolen by
							the Creek Indians from Citizens of Georgia, in violation of the Treaties
							of New-York and Colerain— That he had requested the Resolutions might be
							laid before the President of the United States, that he might proceed
							thereon as he should think proper— That he had not even received a reply
							to his Letter, and that as the General Government had hitherto
							manifested no disposition to give any aid to Georgia, on this and many
							other of her complaints he had forborn to press the subject any further—
							I had no recollection of having received this Letter; but upon returning
							to my Office, I found by the Register of Letters that it was received on
							the first of March, just at the close of the Session of Congress; and
							amidst the extreme pressure of business at that moment must have been
							overlooked, and afterwards forgotten. <persRef ref="brent-daniel"
								>Brent</persRef> was gone from the Office so that I could not now
							procure the letter— Cases of this kind happen too frequently
							notwithstanding the anxious and constant care that I take to avoid them—
							But it was only last week that I wrote to that same Governor Rabun,
							requesting an answer to a circular written to him from the Department of
							State more than two years ago; applying for the Legislative Acts of
							Georgia relating to weights and Measures— When I came home I found in
							the City Gazette the whole of this posthumous Message, which contains
							other complaints against the Secretary of War and the General
							Government, for which there was less foundation than I am sorry to
							confess there is for that of his having received no reply from the
							Secretary of State. <persRef ref="cardelli-pietro">Cardelli</persRef>

						<p><date>19. VI.</date> Soon after I went to my Office this morning the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> sent to request me
							to call at his house, and when I came there he put into my hands a
							Letter which he had just received from Raleigh North-Carolina, where the
							Legislature of that State have just commenced their Session— It was to
							inform him that <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> the Secretary at War, was lying very
							dangerously ill at the house of a <persRef ref="bethel-unknown">General
								Bethel</persRef> in Rockingham County of that State. The Letter
							added that he was thought to be past recovery, but without mentioning
							the nature of his disease. The President spoke also of <persRef
								ref="hawkins-samuel">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Hawkins</persRef>, the agent to the Commission under the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>and 6<hi rend="superscript">th.
							</hi>Articles of the Treaty of Ghent, who has not attended upon the
							Commission at any part of the last Season, and who is now here on his
							way to Mobile, where he has purchased a contract for erecting a Fort,
							from the Bondsmen and Administrator of a <persRef ref="hopkins-unknown"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Hopkins</persRef>, lately
							dead. The President thought that the engagement for this contract was
							incompatible with his holding the Commission as Agent, and expressed
							himself altogether dissatisfied with Hawkins. He said Hawkins had called
							yesterday, and this morning again at his house, but he had not seen him
							and indeed did not wish to see him; for if he did he could not well
							avoid entering into explanations with him which it would be inconvenient
							for him to discuss— He asked me, if I had any objection to sending for
								Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Hawkins, and conversing with him
							upon these Affairs— I said certainly not, if he desired it— He sent for
							Major Van <pb type="ms" n="209"/><persRef ref="vandeventer-christopher"
								>Deventer</persRef> the Chief Clerk in the War Department, to
							enquire how Hawkins had obtained the contract for building the Fort— Van
							Deventer said he had purchased it, of the Administrator of Hopkins for
							twenty thousand dollars— When Hopkins died, there had been seventy or
							eighty thousand dollars advanced to him by the Government upon his
							contract, beyond the value of the work done upon the Fort— He had five
							bondsmen, to the amount in all, of 100,000 dollars— But as no Executors
							or Administrators were named in the contract, it was doubtful whether
							they could be held for its performance— The Secretary at War therefore
							had called upon the bondsmen, and had given them the option of
							compelling Hopkins’s representatives to fulfill the contract, or of
							giving it up, and of paying to the Government, the advances, beyond the
							amount of the work performed. Hawkins steps in, to take the contract,
							with all its advances, and obligations, and offers two good sureties,
							for 150,000 instead of Hopkins’s five for 100 000 dollars— I asked Major
							Vandeventer to put the name of <persRef ref="thomas-frederick">Frederic
								Thomas</persRef>, son of <persRef ref="thomas-thomas">Thomas
								Thomas</persRef> down, upon the list of Candidates to be Cadets— I
							presented again to the President, the case of the property taken by
								<persRef ref="cochrane-thomas">Lord Cochrane</persRef> from <persRef
								ref="ellery-john">Ellery</persRef> and others; and also that of the
							Captain and crew of the Cossack, who appear to have had their ship taken
							from them and to be detained as prisoners in California; and I urged
							again the appointment of an agent in Chili, and that a Sloop of War may
							be sent there to convey the Agent, and then to go, or to take
							instructions to <persRef ref="downes-john">Captain Downes</persRef> to
							go and look for the Captain and crew of the Cossack and endeavour to
							obtain their release. The President assented and authorized me to
							consult with the Navy Department, and ascertain if there is a spare
							public ship that could be employed in the service— I sent for <persRef
								ref="homans-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Homans</persRef> the Chief Clerk of the Navy Department, and found
							from him that there is no disposable ship but the Hornet, not yet
							returned but hourly expected from Spain— I asked Homans to put down the
							names of <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef><persRef
								ref="adams-thomas2">son Thomas</persRef>, and of <persRef
								ref="whitcomb-tilly">Whitcomb’s</persRef><persRef
								ref="whitcomb-thomas">Son</persRef>, among the applicants for
							warrants as Midshipmen. I also reminded him of young <persRef
								ref="bradley-patrick">Bradley</persRef>, where name he said he had
							upon a Select list that he should present to the <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">Secretary of the Navy</persRef> immediately
							upon his return— Homans said he wished also to obtain a Warrant for
								<persRef ref="homans-james">his own Son</persRef>— I wrote several
							short Letters, and had an uninterrupted Evening at home.</p>

								>Charles’s</persRef> dog Booth, stimulated by that of other dogs
							abroad which was occasioned by a fire in the City, in the direction of
							the Navy-Yard. As usually happens, I had no sleep for the remainder of
							the Night. On rising at six I resumed my draft of a Report upon weights
							and Measures, in which my progress is most painfully slow. A new Report
							of Commissioners appointed by the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince
								Regent</persRef> of Great-Britain has just been published, which
							discomposes many of my ideas, though it confirms several of the
							principles upon which I had ventured to differ from the prevailing
							current of opinions among men of Science for the last thirty years: They
							give a new measure for the Pendulum, and a new proportion between the
							English foot and the French Meter. I called upon the first Comptroller
								<persRef ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Anderson</persRef>, to speak with him about the settlement of the
							account for contingent expenses of the Department of State; and
							particularly for the charge of printing the Laws in the Newspapers— Some

							appropriation for that purpose contained in an Act of April 1818. upon a
							question made at the Treasury whether that Law, or rather that Section
							of the Law, was not limited to the year 1818 when it passed. I shewed
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Anderson by reference to the law that
							it could not admit of that construction— He required however further
							time to consider of it. While I was there a <persRef ref="wilson-thomas"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilson</persRef> came in;
							formerly a member of Congress from Pennsylvania, who told me he had been
							intending to call at my Office, about an application to the President
							from persons in the Western Counties of Pennsylvania, for an object
							interesting to at least half a Million of People there, and in the State
							of Ohio— They wanted the General Government to purchase of the Indians
							an Island near Michillimackinac, and a tract of the main land in the
							same vicinity, which produce a great abundance of Plaister of Paris. I
							told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilson that the War Department was
							the proper channel through which to apply to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> for such <pb type="ms"
								n="210"/>objects; but as the Secretary of War, was not here, and
							unfortunately not likely soon to be here, if he would make a minute of
							what was desired I would lay it before the President, which he promised.
								<persRef ref="trimble-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							of Congress. I made a draft of a Letter to the <persRef
								ref="clarke-john2">Governor of Georgia</persRef>, and two other
							short ones— Called at the President’s, and read the draft to him, which
							he approved— Spoke with him again about <persRef ref="hawkins-samuel"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Hawkins’s</persRef> and his
							contract. Upon which he was not yet prepared to give me his final

							Bland was appointed to go to South-America, <persRef ref="graham-john"
								>his brother</persRef> was so dissatisfied with the idea of having
							him for a Colleague, from the impression that he was too partial to the
							South-Americans, that he had thought of resigning; and was only
							dissuaded from it by him— But that from Bland’s conduct during the
							Mission, Graham had changed his opinion of him and thought him perfectly
							impartial and upright— That Brackenridge’ s Deportment to him upon the
							passage had been improper, and his conduct at Buenos Ayres so very
							exceptionable that if they had remained there longer, Graham would have
							felt it his duty to have proposed that he should be dismissed— I shewed
							Graham the Commission for Bland upon my table, ready to be forwarded,
							and said that would settle all questions as to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> opinion of his integrity.
							The conduct of Brackenridge in this affair has certainly not been
							remarkable for delicacy; for he not only wrote two or three Letters to
							prevent his appointment, but joined in a written recommendation for the
							appointment of <persRef ref="glenn-elias">Glenn</persRef>, and then
							wrote me a Letter applying for the Office for himself. Poletica had sent
							me to read a copy of the Russian Memoir upon South American Affairs,
							sent as a circular Instruction to the Russian Ministers abroad shortly
							before the Meeting of the Congress at Aix La Chapelle; which we had seen
							before; but he sent with it the Instructions to <persRef
								ref="tatischeff-dimitry">Tatischeff</persRef>, the Minister at
							Madrid transmitted to him with the Memoir— The Russian Plan was: first
							that Spain and Portugal should settle their quarrel about Montevideo,
							and thenceforward act in concert to suppress the Insurrection; and
							secondly that Spain should give Constitutions to the South American
							Provinces, with Representative popular Assemblies— The Letter to
							Tatischeff instructed him to urge upon the Spanish Government this
							course— As a further demonstration of confidence, Poletica now read to
							me private Instructions to himself, written by <persRef
								ref="kapodistrias-john">Capo d’Istrias</persRef> at Warsaw, in
							which, after observing that the United States, <hi rend="italic"
								>sympathised</hi> with the South-Americans, and that among the
							probable contingencies of futurity then, was an alliance between the
							United States and Portugal, in joint league with the South-Americans
							against Spain— That upon Poletica’s arrival here the American Government
							might wish to be informed what would be the policy and conduct of Russia
							on those contingencies— They might wish to know, 1. Whether Russia had
							any engagements of special alliance with Spain. 2. What the policy of
							Russia would be in regard to the acknowledgment of South-American
							Independence, if the then projected Mediation of the European Allies
							between Spain and the Colonies should fail—and 3. Whether, if the United
							States should acknowledge the Independence of the South-Americans, and a
							war between them and Spain should ensue as the consequence of it, Russia
							would take part with Spain in the War.— It was observed that the United
							States formed no part of the European Alliance; and that having a
							distinct system of policy of their own, they had never manifested a
							desire to become members of the Holy League; without which, the Emperor
							could not have the same motive for taking a particular interest in their
							relations with other European Powers— But that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Poletica in his intercourse with me should be reserved or
							confidential with me, in proportion, as I should set the example of
							being so with him— That upon the three questions above stated he might
							in such case assure me 1—That Russia had no special engagements of any
							kind with Spain; and that all special and partial leagues were entirely
							adverse to the whole system of the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> Policy. 2. That if the Mediation of the allies
							between Spain and her South American Colonies should entirely fail, the
							subsequent course of Russia would be regulated by the course of Events.
							3. That the great and paramount object of the Emperor’s anxiety was the
							maintenance and preservation of the general peace, and to secure to the
							world a long period of the repose which it so much needed— That he would
							therefore see with peculiar concern, the breaking out of any War, which
							from the existing state of Europe the smothered flames of passions
							everywhere—burning under the embers, and the multitude of reduced
							military men scattered abroad every where, and eager to burst open anew
								<hi rend="italic">their</hi> avenue to wealth and honour, there was
							so much reason to fear, could terminate no otherwise than by a general
							War.— Poletica then added that he read <pb type="ms" n="213"/>me this
							paper in conformity with its spirit and in return for the confidence
							which I had shewn him, by my late communications, and that I should see
							in it the reason for the Emperor’s wish that the United States should
							became members of the Holy Alliance. He left at the Office a despatch to
							be forwarded, for his Government. I called at the Presidents with
							papers, but he was riding out. Returning to my office, I met <persRef
								ref="tayloe-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Tayloe</persRef>
							and D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Thornton. Tayloe told me that he had
							written to his son <persRef ref="tayloe-edward-thornton"
								>Edward</persRef>, who is a Freshman at Harvard University, to come
							on here, at the ensuing winter vacation with <persRef
								ref="adams-john2;adams-george" type="multi">my two Sons</persRef>— I
							spoke to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton about a project upon
							which <persRef ref="blagrove-william">W<hi rend="superscript">m.</hi>
								Blagrove</persRef> had yesterday brought me a Prospectus; for a
							periodical publication to be called the Patent Recorder—to contain the
							Laws relating to Patents; and copies of all the useful Patents that have
							expired; and Plates of the drawings or Models— I asked the Doctor if
							there was any objection to the plan— He said that <persRef
								ref="allison-burgess">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Allison</persRef>, and <persRef ref="elliot-william"
								>Elliot</persRef> the Clerk in the Patent Office had a similar plan,
							and had made a large collection of materials for it. This would be an
							objection to another publication on the same plan. The D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> promised to make enquiry and give me
							further information to-morrow morning— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de
							Neuville’s call was only to enquire whether I had received intelligence
							of the ratification by the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">king of

							while he was at Copenhagen sent me a box containing a set of Cologne
							Weights, from 50 Marks down to one Richtpfenning of which there are
							65536 to a Mark. I sent the box some days since to the U.S. Branch Bank;
							and this day called there and with <persRef ref="smith-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> weighed the large
							Cologne weights in the old Standard Money Scales of <persRef
								ref="dearborn-benjamin">Dearborn</persRef>, and the small ones, in a
							small Troy weight of Scales, which was however in very bad order. The
							large Scales have been disused since the old Bank of the United States
							ceased to exist; which is seven years, and are somewhat rusted— There
							was a difference from two to four or five grains in the result, by the
							transfer of the weights balancing each other from one scale to another—
							Their weights, which were regulated at the Bank of the United States are
							in pennyweights and their decimal multiples to thousands. The largest is
							5000 pennyweights; and they have no weight smaller than half a grain— I
							found the Mark weighed 3608 grains, precisely the weight which it should
							have according to <persRef ref="kruse-jurgen">Kruse’s</persRef> Hamburg
							Contorist. The fifty Marks weight was = 7518 Pennyweights or 180432
							Grains; being 32 Grams more in the mass than 3608 grains to the Mark,
							and if correct makes the Mark = 3608.64 grains Troy. Whether this
							difference was in the Cologne weights or in those of the Bank; or
							whether from imperfection of the scale I had not time to ascertain— The
							Cologne weights were made with great care at the Mint of Copenhagen; and
							have every appearance of being minutely correct— as I was coming out
							from the Bank <persRef ref="graham-george">G. Graham</persRef> the
							President told me that <persRef ref="read-george">Captain Read</persRef>
							of the Hornet had arrived— I found him at the Office; but no
							ratification of the Treaty. He had large bundles of despatches from
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>, and I received at the
							same time several other despatches from <persRef ref="gallatin-albert"
								>A. Gallatin</persRef>; and from <persRef key="rush-richard">R.

							through, before <persRef ref="gouverneur-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gouverneur</persRef> came over from the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> to enquire what the
							substance of the despatches brought by Captain Read was— I took them,
							with those from Gallatin and Rush over to the President’s— <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef> had been with me to say that he had a short
							Letter from the <persRef ref="laval-anne">Duke de Laval</persRef>
							informing him that the Treaty was not ratified, but that the <persRef
								ref="ferdinand-vii">king of Spain</persRef> himself had assured him
							of his earnest desire to be upon terms of amity and good harmony with
							the United States— I found the President extremely anxious at this state
							of things; and evidently unwilling to recommend to Congress the course
							which the draft of his Message had pointed out; which was to consider
							the Treaty as ratified, and proceed immediately to execute it; and at
							once take possession of Florida— Gallatin says in his last despatch that
							the French Minister of Foreign Affairs <persRef ref="dessolles-jean"
								>Dessolles</persRef>, and the Russian Minister at Paris both most
							earnestly deprecated the taking of any violent measures by the United
							States, and Dessolles said that without them, we should be sure of
							obtaining ultimately our object, with all Europe on our side— I
							suggested to the President whether he might not vary the draft of his
							Message, by stating that although we should be fully justified in taking
							the execution of our right immediately into our own hands, yet in
							deference to the wishes of other respectable <pb type="ms" n="214"
							/>Powers, friendly to the United States, and fully convinced of our
							right on this occasion, he should think it advisable to give an
							additional proof of our forbearance by waiting to hear what explanations
							the promised <persRef ref="vives-don">Minister from Spain</persRef>
							might have to ask or give, and by making in the mean time such
							preparations as may be necessary for ultimately vindicating our right,
							if it should be required— The President said he would think of it; but
							as the time was very short there must be a meeting of the members of the
							Administration immediately— He first proposed this Evening but agreed to
							have it to-morrow at noon— <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi

								Meigs</persRef> the Commissioner of the Land-Office, and his Son
								<persRef ref="meigs-henry">Henry Meigs</persRef> a member of the

								<persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> where I found
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef>— I read as well as I could from the
							Spanish the Letter from the <persRef ref="melgarejo-joaquin">Duke of San
								Fernando</persRef> to <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>, finally declaring
							the determination of the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">King of
								Spain</persRef> to delay the ratification of the Treaty, and to send
							a minister to the United States to ask for explanations. I found that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, who at the last meeting was
							wavering upon the policy of taking possession of Florida, was now very
							decided in favour of it, and urged all the considerations that recommend
							it very forcibly. As the President has appeared to hesitate, and as the
							despatches from Europe have produced in my own mind a disposition to
							pause and review, before the decisive step is taken, I suggested all the
							reasons that occurred to me in favour of a recommendation to Congress to
							wait until this new Minister shall arrive and demand his explanations—
							As I am still doubtful myself whether the boldest course is not also the
							safest, my argument was not very strong, not very ardent— Crawford
							objected altogether to the idea, of delaying to act, from deference to
							the wishes of France and Russia; which he said was inviting them to
							interfere, and assuming the appearance of being dictated to the Powers
							of Europe. He said that by hesitating to act now the Government would
							lose character and the enemies to the administration would take ground
							to charge it with want of vigour and energy. This I readily admitted;
							but observed it was one of those cases in which no course which the
							administration could steer would be free from censure— If the President
							recommended delay, he would be charged with weakness and pusillanimity—
							If he proposed immediate action he would be accused of rashness and
							violence— Crawford said Congress and the Country would be unanimous for
							the immediate occupation— I thought on the contrary there would be more
							opposition both in Congress and the Country to that course than to the
							other; but there would undoubtedly be great opposition to either— I
							declared that entertaining my present views of the subject with
							diffidence, I should cheerfully concur in whatever determination the
							President shall finally take— Crawford referred to the proposals last
							winter for a Law to authorize the occupation of Florida; and to the wish
							then expressed for such a Law by <persRef ref="holmes-john"
								>Holmes</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means; but
							the object of that was to legalize what had been done by authorizing the
							Executive to hold Pensacola, and Amelia Island. The President said it
							was an exceedingly difficult question, and would think profoundly upon
							it, before coming to his final determination— I told him, that I had the
							more freely given him all my present impressions from a consideration
							that it was by our Constitution the President himself, who was
							responsible for all the great national measures recommended by him— The
							heads of Departments are responsible only as his subalterns— The measure
							now to be adopted, will be in itself an act of War— It may very probably
							involve us in a real and very formidable War. I would not have it said
							that by my advice we had crossed the Rubicon without looking before or
							behind us— And there are strange workings in the human mind. <pb
								type="ms" n="215"/>Until yesterday I had invariably thought and
							advised the President as Crawford did this day—until this day Crawford
							without directly advising otherwise had constantly hinted doubts, and
							thrown dampers in the way. lately, and particularly yesterday I saw that
							my advice had become irksome to the President— That he was verging to a
							suspicion that I was spurring him to rash and violent measures— I fell
							therefore entirely into his own views of the subject, and Crawford
							having discovered this, immediately took the ground I had abandoned and
							is for at once assuming the offensive with Spain. The enemies of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s administration and my enemies
							have been continually labouring with the industry and venom of Spiders,
							to excite in his mind a jealousy of me— They have so far succeeded, that
							whatever I earnestly recommend, he distrusts— If I had persevered in
							recommending the immediate occupation of Florida, I am sure he would
							have ended by striking out that part of his Message. Crawford would have
							continued to blow cold upon it, and nothing would have been done— This
							day as I have taken the white flag, and have discarded all warlike
							humour, the President appears to like it much better— I should not be
							surprized, if he should return now to the spirited and vigorous course—
							He will however certainly not conclude upon it unadvisedly— After the
							Meeting at the President’s I had scarcely half an hour at the Office.

						<p><date>27. VI:</date> I called this Morning at the Office of <persRef
								ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Anderson</persRef> the first Comptroller of the Treasury and shewed
							him the sum paid this year for printing the Laws in the Newspapers
							beyond the appropriation of the year, and told him I wished to have the
							excess charged to the particular appropriation authorized by the act of
							20. April 1818. and the like sum credited to the Contingent fund of the
							Department of State, from which it has been taken— He said he was
							perfectly satisfied that it would be conformable to the Law, and that it
							should be done on Monday. On reaching my Office, I found a Message from
							the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> requesting me to
							call at his house, and immediately went. <persRef ref="brent-daniel">D.
								Brent</persRef> was there— The President was preparing a new draft
							for his Message, and his object was to let me know that he now inclined
							to recommend to Congress the immediate occupation of Florida— He said
							that hitherto the opinion of all the members of the administration had
							been unanimous upon the course to be pursued with Spain; and that this
							unanimity had produced the happiest effects throughout the Country— That
							my concurrence in particular had been of great importance, not only by
							its influence upon the Eastern Section of the Union, but upon the
							Western Country. That a difference of opinion in the administration,
							immediately got abroad; advantage was instantly taken of it by its
							enemies; other objects and other views immediately connected themselves
							with it, and embarrassments multiplied upon the administration.— He then
							went again all over the ground of argument in favour of the two courses
							to be pursued, and one of which must be recommended to Congress; said it
							was a question of extreme difficulty upon which he should decide; but on
							the whole he inclined to recommend that of the immediate occupation— I
							told him that the opinion which I had intimated yesterday and the day
							before had rather been given from a desire to concur, in what I thought
							I had perceived was a change of his own opinion, than an original
							thought of mine— He immediately admitted that he had felt such a change—
							I then said that I had offered my present views founded upon the last
							despatch from <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, with great diffidence, and with a
							full determination to give all the support in my power to any course
							that he should conclude to recommend— His embarrassment is very great;
							and has been encreased by the difference of opinion yesterday manifested
							by <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> and me— He
							sees, and I see with pain that upon all subjects of eminent importance
							Crawford’s opinion is becoming whatever is not mine— I lament this,
							because its tendency must be to weaken and distract the public Councils;
							but the seeds of this discord are sown in the practice which the
							Virginia President’s have taken so much pains to engraft upon the
							Constitution of the Union—making it a principle that no President can be
							more than twice elected; and that whoever is not thrown out after one
							term of service, must be decline being a candidate after the second.
							This is not a principle of the Constitution, and I am satisfied that it
							ought not to be. Its inevitable consequence is to make every <pb
								type="ms" n="216"/>administration a scene of continual and furious
							electioneering for the succession to the Presidency. It was so during
							the whole of <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Madison’s</persRef> Administration, and is so now— Crawford was made
							a candidate against Monroe, and in the Legislative Caucus very nearly
							out voted him— He therefore considers himself as the natural successor,
							and has made all his arrangements accordingly— During the first year of
							the administration seeing that I had no personal friends, or at least no
							political partizans, and numerous inveterate opponents in Congress, he
							probably took it for granted, that I should in no event be an obstacle
							in his way— Within the last eighteen Months he has begun to fear that I
							might; and although he sees that I have gained nothing of electioneering
							force in Congress, but that on the contrary strong new electioneering
							force will be brought to bear against me, he has seen some indications
							of popular sentiment in my favour; in quarters where he did not expect
							them; and feels a necessity of working against my influence with the
							President; and with the public— Now in all important questions of public
							policy it is difficult to choose the best and safest path, and where two
							present themselves with nearly an equal advantage and nearly equal
							objectionable points, the mind in suspense upon their respective merits
							is easily determined by extraneous circumstances; in such cases
							Crawford’s ambition is the sword of <persRef ref="brennus"
								>Brennus</persRef> and turns the Scale against my opinion. The
							President’s opinion is now the same as mine— But he thinks we should
							both concur with that of Crawford, for the: sake of union, in the
							administration; and to this I have agreed— The President said something
							of stating both the courses to Congress, and leaving it for them to
							decide— I remarked that he, or <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> on a former occasion
							had observed that Congress would do nothing without an opinion directly
							expressed by the Executive— He said it was so; and during M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison’s administration he had constant
							proofs of it; among which he related one, peculiarly striking—when
							towards the close of the War, he read to Committees of the Senate and of
							the House his plan for raising men by levies as in the Revolutionary
							War; <persRef ref="giles-william">Giles</persRef> who was on the
							Committee of the Senate after hearing the plan, refused to do any think
							until the Report explaining, and recommending it was produced, and when
							it was, utterly opposed the plan and said it was a conscription. After
							returning from the President’s I had visitors at the Office—<persRef
								ref="read-george">Captain Read</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="rhea-john">John Rhea</persRef> of Tennessee. <persRef
								ref="irvine-baptis">B. Irvine</persRef>, and <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef>, who was with me nearly two hours— Irvine’s
							object seemed to be to enquire whether he might charge another Quarter’s
							Salary, for the time and labour he has bestowed upon his voluminous
							Report, and I told him I would mention it to the President. De Neuville
							told me that <persRef ref="demun-unknown">Demun</persRef> had arrived,
							and brought him voluminous despatches, among which was an instruction to
							postpone his journey to France— He said that the French Government
							finding that the Ratification of the Treaty by Spain was likely to fail,
							had made the strongest remonstrances to the Spanish Cabinet; and finally
							called upon them in the most explicit manner to declare what they
							intended to do— That the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">king of
								Spain</persRef> had given the strongest assurances that it was his
							most earnest desire and his settled determination to finish this
							transaction amicably with the United States; that he would immediately
							send out a Minister to obtain the desired explanations: and the French
							Government had been informed what was the real obstacle to the
							Ratification— It was not the affair of the Grants— The Minister would
							say something upon that subject, but it would ultimately make no real
							difficulty. The great stumbling block was South-America— The proposition
							which we had made to England, and were ready to make to France and
							Russia, for a joint recognition of the Independence of Buenos-Ayres, had
							been made use of to persuade the king of Spain that if he should ratify
							the Treaty the next day we should recognize the South-Americans and make
							a common cause with them. His jealousy being thus excited had been much
							strengthened, by exaggerated representations from this Country of a
							miserable plundering expedition into the Province of Texas, which has
							been carried on the last Summer by people from the United States. De
							Neuville’s instructions are therefore to use all his influence with the
							Government of the United States, to prevail upon them to take no
							precipitate measure, which might produce War, but to wait until <persRef
								ref="vives-don">this Spanish Minister</persRef> shall come, with the
							perfect assurance that we shall obtain the ratification without needing
							the application of force. De Neuville added that however short of full
							and explicit candour <persRef ref="onis-luis">Onis’s</persRef>
							conversation here had been, he had been clear and unequivocal in his
							declarations at Paris and at Madrid— His talk here therefore was
							undoubtedly inspired by the fear of being harshly treated, perhaps <pb
								type="ms" n="217"/>exiled or imprisoned upon his return to Spain.
							And the order to arrest him had actually been signed by the king— He was
							at large; but without employment; and had not been consulted upon
							anything that was done— De Neuville urged therefore with all possible
							earnestness that the President should wait to hear what this Spanish
							Minister has to say, before recommending to Congress that any further
							step should be taken: and expressed the wish that the President would
							also in the Message say something which Spain might receive as a pledge
							that the United States would not immediately after the ratification of
							the Treaty recognize the South-Americans, or make common cause with
							them— I told him that the draft of the President’s message was made—
							That it recommended to Congress to authorize the immediate occupation of
							Florida— That no hostility to Spain was intended by this measure; and if
							peaceable possession of the Province should be given no hostility would
							be committed— That possession being taken we should readily receive the
							Spanish Minister, and give and receive from him any explanation which
							his Government could desire— That I would faithfully report to the
							President all that he had said to me, but I could not promise him that
							the President would think any modification of the Message possible— The
							opinion upon which it had been prepared had been not only the
							President’s, but unanimously that of all his advisers— That after coming
							to a Resolution of the indispensable necessity for an act of energy,
							which was of course preceded by deep deliberation, he knew how difficult
							it must be to minds of a firm texture, to retreat upon at least a
							feebler course. Yet this sacrifice of injured and indignant feeling must
							be made not only by the President but by all his counsellors to warrant
							a change without losing that precious unanimity so conducive to the
							success of all energetic policy— That a further objection to a change
							must arise from the knowledge which he now communicated, of the nature
							of the explanations which the Spanish Minister would come instructed to
							ask. As to the grants, we could not negotiate about them— It was
							disgusting even to discuss a subject, upon which Spain could not even
							advance a pretension without the grossest outrage upon good faith. And
							with regard to South America, no such pledge as that which the Minister
							was to ask for, could or would be given. We had invariably refused to
							make any stipulation upon that subject; we should certainly make none,
							express or implied now—knowing therefore that we can meet only by a
							direct negative the proposals which the Spanish Minister will bring, why
							should the President suspend the contemplated measures to hear what he
							has to say— He replied that the United States had now the whole
							advantage ground of the Negotiation— Spain had no support from any
							quarter. They could lose nothing by Moderation. They were the strongest
							party— The resort to force would always be in their power. He would not
							ask for delay beyond the present Session of Congress— If no Minister
							from Spain should come, or if one should come, with attempts to protract
							and evade the ratification beyond the term of the Session; he would say
							not one word further— The king of Spain had given him the Grand Cross of
							the order of <persRef ref="isabella-i">Isabella</persRef>, but it was
							impossible for him to ask for Spain more than was reasonable— If the
							Minister to come should not give us satisfaction, he would say no more—
							In the meantime the <persRef ref="louis-xviii">King of France</persRef>
							would take it as the greatest obligation if the President would give
							this proof of further forbearance; and he was persuaded it would meet
							the approbation even of the People of this Country. A resort to force
							would change the state of the question; Spain would then have in the
							face of the world the appearance of being the injured party— She would
							say that the United States by the ground they took, in effect denied the
							very right of a Sovereign to ratify his Treaties. Spain would then have
							some plausible grounds to hold forth, in support of her Cause— This last
							act of forbearance on the part of the United States, will leave her
							none— I promised to report all this to the President, and to say nothing
							on my part to weaken its effect— It was near five O’Clock when de
							Neuville left me; and knowing it was the President’s dining hour, I
							postponed calling upon him till to-morrow— <persRef ref="hellen-mary"

							read me the further portion of the draft for his message, which he had

							then to wait and hear <persRef ref="vives-don">the Spanish
								Minister</persRef>— He appeared to be pleased with this suggestion
							and said he would make the draft conformable to it. I asked him whether
							it would not be advisable also to make some slight modification of the
							part of the message relating to South-America. To this he appeared more
							reluctant; and said that as it was drawn it avowed the intention not to
							recognize them at present. But I observed it contained a public
							invitation to all the European great Powers, to join in the recognition;
							and as this was the only essential obstacle to the ratification of the
							Treaty, in the present temper of the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">king
								of Spain</persRef> such an invitation might tend to confirm his
							suspicions, and fix him in the policy of refusing the ratification. He
							said he would consider of it. I reminded him that it had already been
							proposed that he should recommend some further legal provisions for the
							suppression of piracy. He said he would, and asked me to send him
							minutes of the points in which the revision of those Laws would be
							expedient— After leaving the President’s I paid visits to <persRef

						<p><date>29. VI:</date> I called at the lodgings and at the Office of the
								<persRef ref="thompson-smith">Secretary of the Navy</persRef> to see
							him but he was absent from both. <persRef ref="read-george">Captain
								Read</persRef> of the Hornet, brought his account of expences upon

								<persRef ref="bowie-washington">Bowie</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="kurtz-john">Kurtz</persRef> of Georgetown, upon their claim,
							which they have brought to me three times successively in different
							forms, to obtain what I am not authorized to allow— I also wrote two
							other short Letters— Called twice at the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef>; he read me what he has further written for
							the Message. He proposes recommending to Congress to authorize the
							Executive to carry the Florida Treaty into Execution, in like manner as
							if it had been ratified by Spain; but to make it contingent, and to take
							effect only in case the Minister promised from Spain should fail to
							come, or should come without a satisfactory result— This course of
							proceeding now appears to him by far the most eligible of all that have
							yet been suggested; but it has yet to pass through the ordeal of the
							Cabinet. The President said there had been with him this Morning three
							of the members of the House of Representatives from Tennessee; all very
							earnest against getting into a War; and he had no doubt this would be
							the sentiment of a great majority of the Congress— The draft of the
							message enters much into detail upon the subject of the grants— The
							President said he did this to take away the ground from under those who
							would be disposed to criticise, from motives of hostility to the
							Administration; who would of course fasten upon this article— This was
							what constituted he thought the difference between the communication to
							Congress at the commencement of a Session, and the Speech to Parliament
							in England— There, short allusions to the principal topics of public
							affairs, and in very general terms were sufficient; because if the
							Government was attacked, the Ministers were in Parliament to defend
							themselves; but here it was necessary to anticipate and refute
							objections from the outset; because the Executive have no one in the
							Legislature to support them except members who occasionally appear as
							volunteers, and generally even without any previous concert with the
							Executive— This is very true—and the want of a regular and constant
							medium of communication between the Executive and Legislative
							departments is apparently a defect in our Constitution. Though on the
							other hand there are inconveniences, in allowing Executive Officers to
							be at the same time members of the Legislature.— <persRef
								ref="fromentin-eligius">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							at my house— He has been employed all the Summer upon a Mission to
							Pensacola; he was sent there in the expectation, that the place would
							have been delivered to us in the course of the Summer— When it was found
							there was no prospect of the ratification of the Treaty by the king of
							Spain, he was recalled— <persRef ref="cardelli-pietro"
