						<p><date>1. V: Wednesday.</date> Quincy. I had anticipated some difficulty
							in obtaining a conveyance directly from Dedham to my father’s house; but
							it happened that the usual daily Stage from Dedham to Boston, has an
							exception on Wednesday’s, and I engaged it to take us to Quincy; where
							we arrived at ten this Morning. My Sensations on approaching the
							paternal mansion, and on Meeting <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>, are inexpressible. The world, and life itself, are
							no longer the same to me that they were while <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef> lived, but here it is that I
							feel in all its desolateness, the privation of the blessing which her
							presence always diffused around her. We were all deeply and painfully
							affected with the change of Scene. In the midst of it, <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy</persRef>
							came; and afterwards <persRef ref="holbrook-jerusha">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Holbrook</persRef>, with <persRef

								Harris</persRef>, a young physician, son of <persRef
								ref="harris-thaddeus">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. M.
								Harris</persRef>, of Dorchester. After dinner I rode with my father
							to his farm at Mount Wollaston, where he has lately lost two Barns by
							fire, and to which he appears to be determined to remove, the next
							Spring. In the Evening there were visits from <persRef

							employs the greatest part of his time upon his farm, constantly making
							experimental improvements, and attempts hitherto ineffectual to render
							it profitable. My father has employed a large portion of his life in the
							same attempt, which the barrenness of our soil renders utterly
							impracticable. A Farm on my dear native rocks, will barely feed with
							brown bread, milk and salt pork, an ordinary farmer, but to a gentleman
							and his family, is and always will be, a bill of cost. Quincy who has
							one of the best farms in the town, and has been these fifteen years
							improving it, told me that last year he spent 2500 dollars upon it, and
							received in cash 2300 dollars from it— But then he has vegetables, milk,
							butter and cheese for the use of his family, which diminish his
							household expences— This Evening we had visits from M<hi

							Nahant has been for many years a place of fashionable resort for many of
							the inhabitants of Boston in the Summer Season; though it is otherwise,
							almost a solitude— A mere cove projected into the Sea; forming part of
							the Town of Lynn, between it and which there is a beach covered with
							water at high tide. There are at Nahant only four or five farm houses,
							none of them formal Inns, but all serving as such to the occasional
							visitors from Boston— There is a small Church, used also as a school
							house, and in which is a small library, collected from the donations of
							the liberal— There are ledges of rocks, from which the lovers of angling
							fish for perch, with a depth of three or four fathoms at the lowest
							tide. We found the <persRef ref="brimmer-unknown">Brimmer
								family</persRef> at one of them; but they had been there all the
							morning, and very soon left the place to us. The fish were in such
							plenty, that we caught at least ten dozen of them in the course of the
							day— At two O’Clock we dined at the farm house where we had stopped;
							before dining I bathed with my two boys in the Sea; but the water was so
							excessively cold that we could not abide it, and after two or three
							plunges immediately came out. There is a Steam-boat which plies three
							times a week between Boston and Nahant, and which made a trip there this
							day— There were also many persons carne in Carriages, some of whom after
							a short stay proceeded to certain Springs in the town of Lynn— I met my
							old friend <persRef ref="phillips-john">John Phillips</persRef> who is
							now President of the Senate of this State, but whose countenance is not

							take such a part, yet being called upon to perform it, he should
							consider it as a duty, from which he would not shrink. He would first go

							that as to any loss of patronage to the University, which might result
							from offence taken at the appointment, it ought not to be allowed any
							weight whatever. After some debate however, a Committee of three persons
							had been appointed to consider and report upon the whole subject, and
							the board adjourned to this day fortnight. The Committee, appointed by
							the President were Quincy, as Chairman, Judge Story, and <persRef

							brother and his family and of <persRef ref="adams-john">my

							was drawn by Quincy, and of which he was made with me joint Executor; he
							has been acquainted with all the painful occurrences in the career of my

							Condition; and with him I could consult freely upon what; is in this
							emergency to be done. He gave it me as his opinion that it was <pb
								type="ms" n="171"/>indispensably necessary to provide that my
							brother should not return to dwell in my father’s house— He explicitly
							declared that he thought my father’s life depended upon it; and that it
							was my duty to make the necessary arrangements to prevent it. He
							suggested that if some provision could be made with my brothers consent
							for his going abroad, to sea, either in a public or a private ship, for
							one or two years, or if I could give him any place, at Washington, or
							elsewhere, out of my father’s presence, it would be the most desirable
							thing to be effected. I explained the insuperable objections against
							giving him any public employment; but declared my readiness to make any
							disposition in my power to place him where he might be usefully
							occupied, and remote from my father. As his own consent is the first
							that must be obtained for carrying into effect any project of this kind,
							we agreed to suspend further consideration of the subject till I shall
							have had an opportunity of seeing him— <persRef ref="bainbridge-william"
								>Captain Bainbridge</persRef> and <persRef ref="gray-william">M<hi

							as persons to whom it might be proper to apply, if he should consent to
							go abroad, though difficulties of the most serious kind were anticipated
							rendering very doubtful the practicability of either plan. Should they
							be found invincible, I determined to offer him again the use of my house
							from which he removed last April— While I was absent from home an

						<p><date>19. VI:30.</date> The agitation of the distressing Circumstances

							devolve upon me, in relation to <persRef ref="adams-john">my

							emergency absorbs my faculties, and leaves me only the despairing
							thought of my incompetency to meet it. This Morning while I was seeking
							the aid of my own Meditations, <persRef ref="otis-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> G. A. Otis</persRef> came to tell me a
							tale of misery of his own— He has applied for the Consulate of
							Liverpool, which is not vacant, nor likely soon to be so, and he came to
							enquire what prospect he had of obtaining that, or any other Office,
							that will maintain him, <persRef ref="otis-lucinda">his wife</persRef>
							and a family of children. He told me that when he came with us from
							England two years ago, he had a clear property of between 40 and 50,000
							dollars, the whole of which has been sunk, by unfortunate commercial
							speculations— He has assigned all that remained to <persRef
								ref="williams-s">S. Williams</persRef> for the benefit of his
							Creditors, and bitterly complained that his father in Law, <persRef
								ref="smith-barney">Barney Smith</persRef>, who had taken security,
							more than sufficient to cover a debt of 22000 dollars due to him, had
							refused to give up that security, and come in for his proportion with
							the other creditors. He gave me a full history of his transactions in a
							former partnership with B. Smith; and in a recent partnership with
							another person; and said he felt an obligation to disclose
							confidentially to me all these facts, because if misfortune was a
							disqualification for Office, he was certainly disqualified. I told him
							it certainly was not: that on the contrary, I was sure misfortune such
							as that which he had detailed would be to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> a recommendation. But there
							was no vacancy nor immediate prospect of vacancy at Liverpool; and if
							there should be, the applications for the Office would be so numerous,
							and the recommendations and pretensions in many cases so strong, that it
							would be impossible for me to foretell upon whom the President’s choice
							would fall. That the selection from among the Candidates was always made
							by the President himself, and that whatever my own partialities or
							preferences might be, I could never know before hand, whether his would
							concur with them— He thanked me for the candour of this Communication,
							and left me, as the Meeting-Bell was tolling— We heard <persRef
								ref="white-john7">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White</persRef>
							of Dedham, both parts of the day. His Morning discourse was said to be
							remarkably excellent, but I was unable to controul the wandering of my
							thoughts, and lost the recollection, even of the text. His afternoon
							sermon was from Psalm 348. “O taste, and see that the Lord is good” the
							Subject was the practice, as contrasted with the mere profession of
							Religion— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="clark-susanna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Clark</persRef>, and <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa
								Smith</persRef> went in the afternoon to the episcopal Church <pb
								type="ms" n="172"/>where they heard a <persRef ref="wolcott-unknown"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wolcott</persRef>. I heard
							nothing from my brother this day, and concluded that he had changed his
							purpose of writing to me, and appointing a time and place for meeting
							me— I found it therefore necessary to think of measures to be taken in
							consequence of this state of things. Until now my idea had been that he
							should have undertaken the management of the Mount Wollaston-farm, and
							thereby have provided for the support of his family— He being now gone
							the great object recurs of relieving my father from the burthen of that
							farm— One ninth part of it is already conveyed to me subject to his life
							Estate in it. He has given me the remainder of it, by his Will— It
							occurred to me this day to propose to him to give me a deed in fee of it
							now, and that I should pay him one thousand dollars a year in quarter
							payments during his life— I asked <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2"
								>Quincy</persRef> to walk home with me after the afternoon service,
							and consulted him upon it. He approved highly of the plan, and undertook
							to rent the place for me during my absence, and to watch over its
							management by the tenant. He accepted indeed this proposal at first,
							without hesitation or qualification; but afterwards manifested doubts
							and scruples; asked for time to think of it— Said he would undertake it
							at least for one year; but finally agreed to take the charge upon him
							and do his best. Quincy’s temperament is sanguine but his second
							thoughts make his character indecisive— I had already communicated my
							plan to my wife, who had also approved it— I finally mentioned it this
							Evening to my father, who said the first impression of it was very
							agreeable to him; but that he would sleep upon it, and give me his
							answer— There were Evening visitors, <persRef ref="artiguenave-joseph"

							printing— He promised me the statement— I called at <persRef
								ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Parkman’s</persRef>, without finding him at home— But I met <persRef
								ref="parkman-francis">his brother</persRef> the Clergyman, and

								ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Quincy</persRef>, which he said he would if after certain particulars
							which he would explain to me on Wednesday, I should still think it

								<persRef ref="haywood-unknown">Haywood</persRef> the Agent for the

							the Tailor’s, <persRef ref="savile-john">Savile</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="phippen-joshua">Phippen</persRef>. As I came out of Town I
							called again at James H. Foster’s. He, and my Son John, had both been
							making enquiries after <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef>—
							He was at <persRef ref="niles-ebenezer">Niles’s</persRef> Livery Stable,
							on Friday where he put up his horse and Chaise for about an hour, and
							then proceeded, probably to Medford. <persRef ref="whitcomb-tilly"

							his old partner Everett, at Billerica, where he now resides. That
							Everett, on returning from Meeting in the afternoon, told him he had
							seen my brother there— Billerica, is about fifteen Miles from Haverhill.
							Niles told Foster that he thought my brother would be found at
							Haverhill. I returned with John to my father’s house to dinner; and
							employed the afternoon in writing. My father accepted my proposal
							concerning the Mount Wollaston farm, and directed me to prepare a deed
							of conveyance, and a Bond accordingly. He said he would give me the
							deeds to him, to take from them the description of the boundaries
							to-morrow Morning.— <persRef ref="adams-ann">My brother’s wife</persRef>

								type="multi">six Children</persRef>, and no earthly support but my
							father. And unfortunately her own character and temper are not suited to
							the terrible crisis which has befallen her. Much of her Conversation
							with me, I would wish for her sake to forget— She has been endeavouring
							to excite the idea, that he should be followed, and found out, and
							intreated to come back; but her greatest terror is that she should be
							required to follow him herself. She is quite unwilling to believe that
							he has gone to Haverhill, which is the residence of <persRef
								ref="harrod-joseph">her father</persRef>. But indeed few are the
							minds capable of enduring such a trial, as that to which she has been
							brought.</p>

						<p><date>25. V:</date><persRef ref="adams-john">My father</persRef> gave me
							by Deed of 23. April 1804 two pieces of Land, about 17 and 16 Acres
							known by the names of the Penn’s Hill Orchard, and Atherton’s pasture
							which form part of my old Quincy Farm. There was lying in common with
							the Atherton pasture a spot of seventeen Acres which about the year 1770
							my father had taken a lease of from <persRef ref="verchild-francis"
								>Francis Verchild</persRef> to whom it belonged— Under this lease he
							held it till the American Revolution came on, when Verchild left the
							Country and never came back. Rent was paid for some years to <persRef
								ref="russell-thomas">Thomas Russell</persRef> of Boston who had been
							left as Verchild’s Agent; but who after his death declined receiving it
							any longer— It was thus held by my father till 1804. and the possession
							of it was then transferred to me, with Atherton’s pasture— It has been
							ever since in my possession; but was not included in either of the Deeds
							which he gave me— I have now asked him to give me a Release and
							Quit-claim deed of his title to it, which he readily agreed to do. I
							prepared the Deed, and also a deed of gift of his manuscript, Letter and
							Account-Books and Papers— The Equinoctial Storm came on afresh this day—
							It rained most of the forenoon, and prevented me from going into Boston
							as I had intended— Employed the morning in revising the Accounts of
								<persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef>— We rectified some
							mistakes which had occurred in our former settlement; and I made him an
							additional allowance; we agreed upon the principles of a new Settlement
							now; and he is to make out the account balanced. The rain having held up
							after dinner, I went into Boston alone. Found <persRef
								ref="adams-charles">Charles</persRef> already in the Quincy Stage,
							which was at the Stage-house door, ready to start. I called him out and
							he came home with me. I went to <persRef ref="waite-thomas"
								>Wait’s</persRef>— He was gone out of town, and had no more proof
							sheets of the Convention Journals ready— To <persRef
								ref="sanderson-isaac">Sanderson</persRef>, and bespoke more paper;
							of which I took samples. Sanderson himself was there, &amp; <pb
								type="ms" n="175"/>told me that he hoped Congress would do something
							for the paper-manufacturers— Who were ruined by the competition of Dutch
							and Italian paper— It was imported at $1:25 per Ream of a quality which
							could not be manufactured here, for less than three Dollars— At <persRef
								ref="savile-john">Savile</persRef> and <persRef ref="phippen-joshua"
								>Phippen</persRef>, Tailors, I bespoke the materials for Coat of
							home manufacture, to be sent out to Quincy by the Stage on Monday—
							Returning home, I called at <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2"
								>Quincy’s</persRef> House. He was absent, and I left a message
							requesting him to call at my father’s house, tomorrow immediately after
							the afternoon’s service at Church.</p>
