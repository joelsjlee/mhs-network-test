						<p><date>2. VII:30.</date><persRef ref="sanford-nathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanford</persRef> a member of the
							Senate of the United States from the State of New-York, came this
							morning to my house, with a view to converse with me upon two or three
							subjects. One was to recommend a young man named <persRef
								ref="griswold-unknown">Griswold</persRef> for any appointment of
							agent which might be contemplated to any part of South-America— There is
							only the appointment of Consul at Buenos-Ayres, of that description, now
							vacant, and that being without a Salary. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Sanford did not think would suit the young Man’s views— I asked him to
							send me a line in writing, containing the name of the person, the Office
							that he desired, and his recommendation— He then asked if I had any book
							or public document shewing the manner in which the value of articles
							imported and exported was estimated in England. He thinks ours
							wretchedly imperfect and that it leads to erroneous results; because it
							values both the imported and exported Articles according to their prices
							here; while that is only the simple value of the export, but is the
							compound value of the import, and of all the charges and profits of
							trade upon it— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanford of the
							Books and papers belonging to the Department, now in the hands of
								<persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">N. Biddle</persRef>, which might give
							him the information that he wanted; that I expected M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddle would shortly return them; after
							which they should be for his use— He said there was nothing urgent— His
							last topic was to inform me that he had heard <pb type="ms" n="2"/>from
							good authority that <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> had determined to
							return, to this Country the next Spring or Summer, from his Mission to
							France— In which Event, he Sanford wished me to say to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> that he himself was willing
							to go as Minister to France— I promised him that I would not fail to
							mention him to the President, but observed that for all Offices of that
							Class, the President had hitherto made his own Selection. I finished my
							draft of a despatch to R. Rush, and took it to the President— It was to
							instruct Rush to inform <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef> that the President intended before long to
							recognize the Government of Buenos-Ayres, as Independent. The President
							had expressly directed me to say as much in a Note to <persRef
								ref="deforest-david">De Forrest</persRef>, and I thought it would be
							safest when holding out this expectation to him to give full notice of
							our intention to the British Government. When I read my draft of the
							President, he thought it best to consult the cabinet upon it, and asked
							me to give notice to the members to call at his house at two O’Clock.
								<persRef ref="macon-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Macon</persRef> had been with him when I first went. <persRef
								ref="bland-theoderick">Judge Bland</persRef> came while I was there;
							and <persRef ref="roberts-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Roberts</persRef> went in as I came out. I gave notice to <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>,
							and sent it to <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="pederson-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pederson</persRef> the Danish Minister came to my Office, to have
							some further conversation upon the project of a Treaty of Commerce
							between the United States and Denmark— I repeated to him what I had said
							in our former Conversation. In substance that we were willing to
							equalize all duties of tonnage or upon merchandize with Denmark, as we
							had done with England; and even to extend it, with Denmark to all the
							productions of the Baltic Countries, for an equivalent; which might be
							the reduction of the duties paid at the passage of the Sound. We should
							certainly expect to be placed in that respect upon a footing equally
							advantageous with that which other Nations having Treaties with Denmark
							enjoyed. He asked me again for a copy of the new Edition of the Laws,
							and for a set of <persRef ref="waite-thomas">Wait’s</persRef> State
							Papers; but I had none to distribute at discretion— Such public
							documents were given to each of the foreign Ministers residing here. But
							of late this custom has been laid aside. I returned after two, with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun to the President’s. Crawford and
							Wirt were already there. My draft of a despatch to R. Rush was read;
							they were all startled at the paragraph announcing it as the President’s
								<hi rend="italic">intention</hi>, at no remote period to recognize
							the Government of Buenos-Ayres— Yet he had expressly directed me to say
							as much to De Forrest— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt enquired
							whether it would not be a departure without cause from the course
							hitherto pursued: an inconsistency with the refusal to recognize Buenos
							Ayres last winter, and with the President’s Message, even at the
							commencement of the present Session of Congress. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford answered that the reasons given for deferring the
							acknowledgment last Winter were that Commissioners had been sent to
							obtain information— That reason now no longer existed— The Commissioners
							had returned home; and the information they had collected was in our
							possession— I added that I had always considered and declared the
							question of acknowledging the South American Governments as a question
							of time. That besides the return of our Commissioners other great
							changes had occurred in that question since the last year. The time
							itself that had elapsed had given additional proof of the stability of
							the Government of Buenos-Ayres— The victory of Maipu had strongly
							confirmed their capacity to maintain their Independence— Even since the
							President’s Message of this Session it had become ascertained by public
							notoriety that the European allies would take no part in favour of Spain
							and against the colonies. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun said
							the views of Great-Britain had also been more distinctly ascertained,
							and more clearly pronounced since last winter— But he thought it would
							be safer to press Great-Britain, to go along with us in the recognition,
							than to give her notice that we will grant it without her. If we take
							the step in concert with her, it will be perfectly safe. If we take it
							against her will, it will be in her power to embarrass us exceedingly
							with the consequences, by stimulating Spain to War with us for it, or by
							embroiling us with other European Powers, through it. The trade to the
							Havanna alone, was now almost the only resource we had for procuring
							Specie, and if it should be cut off it would greatly <pb type="ms" n="3"
							/>increase the embarrassments of our circulating medium. The President
							himself on the first reading of my draft had thought the intention of
							recognizing Buenos-Ayres was too strongly expressed, and proposed to me
							to say it is contemplated unless any material change of events Should
							occur; in stead of declaring it as a positive intention— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford now said that if the
							acknowledgment was to take place he should prefer making it in another
							form; not by granting an exequatur to a Consul; but by sending a
							Minister there— Because the Senate must then act upon the nomination,
							which would give their sanction to the measure— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Wirt added that the House of Representatives must also
							concur, by assenting to an Act of Appropriation— And the President,
							laughing said that as those bodies had the power of impeachment over us,
							it would be quite convenient to have them thus pledged before hand. I
							said my impressions were altogether different. I would make the
							acknowledgment as simple and unostentatious as possible— With as little
							change in the actual state of things as could be. I thought it not
							consistent with our National dignity to be the first in sending a
							Minister to a new Power— It had not been done by any European Power to
							ourselves; if an exchange of Ministers was to take place, the first
							should come from them. As to impeachment, I was willing to take my share
							of risque of it for this measure whenever the Executive should deem it
							proper. And instead of admitting the Senate or House of Representatives
							to any share in the act of recognition, I would expressly avoid that
							form of doing it, which would require the concurrence of those bodies.
							It was, I had no doubt, by our Constitution, an act of the executive
							authority. <persRef ref="washington-george">General Washington</persRef>
							had exercised it in recognizing the French Republic, by the reception of
								<persRef ref="genet-edmund">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Genet</persRef><persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Madison</persRef> had exercised it, by declining several
							years to receive, and by finally receiving <persRef ref="onis-luis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis</persRef>, and in this instance I
							thought the Executive ought carefully to preserve entire the authority
							given him by the Constitution; and not weaken it by setting the
							precedent of making either house of Congress a party to an act which it
							was his exclusive right and duty to perform. Crawford said he did not
							think there was any thing in the objection to sending a Minister on the
							score of national dignity, and that there was a difference between the
							recognition of a change of Government in a Nation already acknowledged
							as Sovereign, and the recognition of a new Nation itself. He did not
							however deny, but admitted that the recognition was strictly within the
							powers of the Executive alone, and I did not press the discussion
							further—it may perhaps be resumed hereafter. Crawford asked whether De
							Forrest the man appointed as Consul General from Buenos-Ayres was not a
							Citizen of the United States— He is— But as we now receive our own
							Citizens as Consuls from other Governments, no objection can be made
							against receiving him on that account— But he has made his fortune by
							privateering under the Buenos-Ayres flag and is now here giving out
							Commissions to privateers, although we have no direct proof of the fact—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt said his case was worse than
							that— For by papers produced upon the late trials at Baltimore it
							appeared he had not only been part owner of the privateer which took the
							Triton, with a Cargo worth 700.000 dollars; but that he had defrauded
							the Captain of his portion of the prize— I thought this last affair no
							concern of ours—However, it was generally agreed that no determination
							should be taken as to receiving him, and that my draft should be altered
							so as to avoid the assertion of a fixed intention to recognize the
							Government of Buenos-Ayres. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun
							expressed the most earnestness to avoid acting unless in concert with
							England; I observed that I thought this deference to the British
							Government should not be carried too far— That we should not have the
							appearance of pinning ourselves too closely upon her sleeve. That we
							should carefully preserve the advantage of taking the lead in advancing
							to the recognition of the South American Governments, and while using
							persuasion with England to move in concert with us take care to let her
							know that we shall ultimately act independently for ourselves. Calhoun
							admitted the correctness of all this in principle, but urged that the
							real importance of the concurrence of Great Britain to this measure was
							so great that we ought to act with the greatest circumspection to obtain
							it.— Passing from this subject the President put the question, whether
							it would be proper for the Executive to suggest to Congress the
							expediency of passing an Act, authorizing him on certain contingencies
							to hold possession of <pb type="ms" n="4"/>Pensacola and S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Marks, or any other part of Spanish
							Florida— I was desirous that such an act, should pass, and that it
							should extend to the power of taking possession again if the places
							should be restored; and of taking and holding all the Province, in the
							Event of any further failure on the part of Spain to fulfil her
							engagement of restraining by force the Indians within her Territory from
							hostilities against the United States. Formal notice having been given
							her that such would be the result, I thought it necessary that an act of
							Congress authorizing the Executive to carry it into effect should shew
							that it was not a mere brutum fulmen, or empty menace. But M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Calhoun both declared against asking for such an authority—
							Crawford thought it would give the Nation the appearance of acting with
							bad faith, and lose the credit that we had obtained by the measure of
							restoring the places taken by <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef>. Calhoun thought there was no necessity for the
							measure sufficiently urgent for asking of Congress the Power— That to
							suppose Spain would be unable or unwilling to fulfil the engagement of
							her Treaty would be insulting to her. That Congress ought to pass Laws
							only upon existing facts and not upon speculative anticipations— That
							there would probably be no more Seminole hostilities, and if there
							should be, it would then be time enough for Congress to give the power.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt said if it were res integra,
							perhaps it might be insulting to Spain to expect that she would not
							fulfil her Treaty— But it had happened to our great injury, and it was
							no wrong to Spain, to apprehend that it might happen again— And he cited
							the Act of 1811 as a proof that Congress did legislate upon speculation
							as well as upon fact. He asked if all prospect was hopeless of obtaining
							Florida, by an arrangement with Spain— I said certainly; unless such a
							Law should pass. That might bring Spain to it— Nothing else would— No
							determination upon this point was taken. The President reserving it for
							further Consideration— The last question put by the President was, how
								<persRef ref="dashkov-andrei">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Daschkoff</persRef> was to be received and treated here; after what
							had passed between him and this Government— And after we had received
							official notice of the appointment of two persons to succeed him. There
							were some reasons for supposing that he had received a reappointment—
							And how and in what manner was he to be received and treated. After some
							discussion it was concluded that he was still entitled to Diplomatic
							privileges, and to courtesies of form; as appendages to his situation.
							His misconduct has been gross, and might have produced the most
							important and mischievous consequences— His private character is not in
							good repute; and he is considered as having held improper correspondence
							with the British Squadron in the Chesapeake during the late War— It was
							however finally settled, that I should return his visit; and that he
							should be treated without positive repulsion— This conference at the
							President’s continued until five, and from it I returned immediately
							home— I was all the Evening, writing.</p>

						<p><date>3. VII:30.</date> Snow all the Morning. I intended to have gone to
							church, at the Hall of the House of Representatives, but was prevented,
							partly by the weather, and then by a visit from <persRef
								ref="harris-john">John Levett Harris</persRef> the Consul at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg, who has returned from thence
							upon an intimation sent him by his <persRef ref="harris-levett"
								>uncle</persRef> that it would be expedient for him to resign his
							Office— The story of his quarrel with <persRef ref="lewis-william"
								>William D. Lewis</persRef> presents a multitude of circumstances in
							his conduct so perfectly fatuitous that contempt itself is swallowed up
							by compassion in reflecting upon them. He comes now however with the
							hope of being reinstated in the good opinion of the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> and in his Office, which he
							has not yet explicitly resigned. As he recurred to the incidents of his
							quarrel with Lewis I slightly hinted at the particulars in his own
							conduct which had been most pointedly obnoxious; he said scarcely any
							thing in defence of them, but hoped all his errors would be attributed
							to his inexperience— He also shewed me three certificates of persons to
							whom he had applied to cut as his seconds in what they term an affair of
							honour; all of whom declined owing to the peculiarity of their
							situations. He brought me a report of the American trade at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg during the present year; and
							asked me for my good will— I told him that so far as my personal
							intercourse with him extended it could have excited only good-will on my
							part, and advised him to call upon the President— <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D. Brent</persRef>
							called with my two Notes prepared for <persRef ref="deforest-david">De
								Forrest</persRef>— One of them however needed an alteration, which
							will require the making out of another copy— I had a second Morning
							visit from <persRef ref="dashkov-andrei">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Daschkoff</persRef> before I had returned the first— As the Snow
							held up about 2. O’Clock I went out to take an hour’s walk— In the
							Pennsylvania Avenue, nearly opposite my Office <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef>, the French Minister met me in his Carriage,
							stopped and told me he wished to have some conversation with me— I came
							home therefore <pb type="ms" n="5"/>with him in his Carriage, and he
							came in and conversed with me upwards of an hour, He told me that
								<persRef ref="onis-luis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Onis</persRef> had received yesterday fresh Instructions from his
							Government. That the <persRef ref="irujo-carlos">new Prime Minister, the
								Marquis of Casa-Yrujo</persRef> was very pacifically disposed—much
							more so than his predecessor <persRef ref="pizarro-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pizarro</persRef>. That he had been
							well satisfied with his, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de
							Neuville’s interference last Summer— That he had got over what had
							hitherto been insurmountable, and was willing that the boundary line
							with the United States should extend to the South Sea. But there were
							two points upon which he hoped we should not be inflexible. One was the
							boundary West of the Mississippi, and the other related to
							South-America. He urged both with extreme earnestness— that we would
							yield—something of the Western line we had proposed, which went within
							four or five leagues of Santa Fe— That we would take the line of
							Latitude 43. instead of 41. That we would take an inner chain of
							Mountains, instead of Snow Mountains, and that we would leave to Spain
							the immense plains of sand east of the line we had proposed, that she
							might have a barrier for Santa Fe— Then as to South America, would we
							give him a guarantee, that if Spain should come to terms with us, we
							would force nothing in South America by premature recognitions?— I told
							him that we could give no guarantee whatever in relation to
							South-America. That we could not admit the principle of any connection
							between the question of recognition and our own controversies with
							Spain— We could not make our conduct in respect to one of those objects
							conditional upon the result of the other. That we had communicated both
							to him and to <persRef key="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bagot</persRef> our views in relation to South America;
							that if the French Government should suggest to us, just and reasonable
							motives for postponing further a recognition of the South-American
							revolutionary Governments, all due consideration would be given to their
							advice, and if it was accompanied with a satisfactory adjustment of our
							differences with Spain, it would have great additional weight— This was
							all I could say, and that no guarantee verbal or written, express or
							implied could be given— As to the Western boundary we had offered a line
							as our ultimatum; and we had offered to sign a Treaty upon other points
							leaving that unsettled— It was a question of 140 years standing, upon
							which we had only succeeded to the claims of France. We had made great
							sacrifices to settle it; but if Spain had come to the determination of
							agreeing to begin the line at the Sabine on the gulph of Mexico, and to
							carry it to the South-Sea, we would not consent to discuss with her
							questions about inches of ground, and if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Onis was not prepared to agree to our ultimatum, I hoped he would
							intreat him not to write me a word more about it, for I could not
							express the disgust with which I was forced to carry on a correspondence
							with him, upon subjects which it was ascertained that we could not
							adjust. All this was gone over five or six times, for De Neuville never
							takes one, two, or three repulses for a defeat but returns to the
							charge, usque ad fastidium. He left me as usual without coming to any
							conclusion, but told me that Onis would very soon make me some further
							proposals, under his new instructions, and urged most earnestly that we
							should defer the acknowledgment of any of the South American
							Governments. He had before told me that De Forrest had paid him a visit,
							and <persRef ref="deforest-julia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> De
								Forrest</persRef> had visited <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-ann"
								>Madame de Neuville</persRef>. He did not know why— They must be
							sensible that neither he nor Madame de Neuville could return their
							visits. I told him there was no occasion for it. De Forrest was a
							Citizen of the United States, and as such had been received at the
							President’s— But he was not recognized as Consul from Buenos-Ayres and I
							myself had not returned his visit— In the Evening <persRef
								ref="holmes-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes</persRef>,
							Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Relations called here, and I gave

								ref="arbuthnot-alexander">Arbuthnott</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="ambrister-robert">Armbrister</persRef>; for the use of the

							upon him— He will come out with views of his own, very independent, but
							by no means harmonizing <pb type="ms" n="6"/>with ours. Holmes told me
							what he intended in substance to propose to the Committee to report a
							general review of the transactions of the Seminole War; an approbation
							of the course pursued by the Executive, and a Bill authorizing him to

							forward in the House of Representatives next week. Clay has already
							commenced his attack, upon it, in convivial companies out of doors— Last
							Winter Clay’s principal attack was levelled against the President
							himself, but finding that this only injured himself he has this winter
							confined his hostilities to me. My Letter to Erving has been so well

							partizans of half a dozen Candidates for the next Presidency (including
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

							injure me—and as I am not there to defend myself, Clay has a free swing
							to assault me, which <pb type="ms" n="7"/>he does, both in his public

								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> the new Secretary of the Navy was there, and the
							Meeting fully attended. The President proposed again for consideration
							the question whether it would be proper to submit to Congress the
							expediency of their passing an Act, authorizing the Executive to hold
							possession of Pensacola, if Spain should not send any person authorized
							to receive it; and also under certain contingencies to take possession
							of Spanish Florida. The subject was discussed with much earnestness till
							near five O’Clock— <persRef ref="holmes-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Holmes</persRef> the Chairman of the Committee of
							Foreign Relations proposed to report a general review of the Seminole
							War, and to close with presenting a Bill authorizing the Executive to
							hold the places taken in Spanish Florida, until Spain shall resume
							possession of conformably to the terms prescribed in my Letters to
								<persRef ref="onis-luis">Onis</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="erving-george">Erving</persRef>, and to take possession again,
							in case of the future failure of Spain to restrain the hostilities of
							her Indians; and if taken again, to hold, subject to the adjustment of
							all our differences with Spain, by negotiation. <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> and <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>, were averse to
							proposing any measure to be adopted by Congress at present— In
							preference to any measure of Congress, Crawford proposed that notice
							should be immediately given to Onis the Spanish Minister, that if within
							a given time, possession of Pensacola should not be resumed; orders
							would be given to the American garrison to withdraw and abandon it. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun thought that with such notice to
							the Spanish Minister, a message might be sent to Congress, informing
							them of it, and leaving any further legislative measure to their
							discretion— In the course of the discussion Crawford betrayed his
							inveteracy against <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef>, more than he had ever done before, and even let
							out as a justification for the very extraordinary proposal of abandoning
							Pensacola, even if not redemanded by Spain, that it would shew to the
							world that it had been taken <hi rend="italic">contrary to orders</hi>—
							That Crawford has been all along deeply inveterate against Jackson, as
							is asserted in a letter from Nashville lately published in the Aurora. I
							have not seen adequate proof— But since the publication of that Letter
							it is impossible to avoid perceiving that he is so. <pb type="ms" n="8"
							/>It happens unfortunately that Crawford’s interest and stimulus of
							personal ambition prematurely roused by his having been started as a
							Candidate for the Presidency against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe at the late election; now pushes him, not only to contribute in
							running down Jackson, as a formidable rival; but even to counteract as
							much as is in his power, the general success of the Administration; and
							particularly that of the Department of State. He occasionally interferes
							with the proper business of the Department; and not to the advantage of
							the public business. <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">De
								Neuville</persRef>, the French Minister often insinuates to me that
							Crawford expresses to him sentiments upon subjects of diplomatic
							discussion, different from those maintained by me— To specify— He
							intimates that Crawford countenances the claim of France to special
							commercial privileges in Louisiana—and that he encourages indirectly
							Onis, in insisting upon a boundary West of the Mississippi, more
							favourable to Spain than that which I have offered— The first of these
							suggestions I have no doubt is true; for Crawford has repeatedly said
							some thing of the same kind to me— But that he should spur Onis to hold
							out upon the Western boundary, can arise from no other source than the
							fear that an arrangement of our differences with Spain, which should be
							satisfactory to this Nation, would redound to the credit of a Department
							other than his own. Oh! the windings of the human heart! Possibly
							Crawford is not himself conscious of his real motives for this conduct—
							But in this day’s discussion it was abundantly apparent that his object
							is to disgrace Jackson, and that he is now confident of success— Calhoun
							so far coincides with him, that although there was this day no decision
							it is clear to me that the President will not ask for any new power from
							Congress; and consequently that we shall do nothing with Spain. <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>
							entered little into the debate, but rather manifested the wish that an
							Act of Congress should pass. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson,
							the Secretary of the Navy did the same, and made several very judicious
							observations. The President inclined the same way. But the apprehension
							of the temper shewn in Congress and in the public at the proceedings of
							Jackson in Florida, will prevent any thing from being done— After
							breaking up at the President’s I went to my Office and found four
							despatches from <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">A. Gallatin</persRef>;
							two of which were long, and in cypher— I took them home, and with the
							exception of a couple of hours of the Evening that <persRef

							was employed till past midnight in decyphering without getting through

							against <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">general Jackson</persRef>, in the
							discussion of his conduct now so warmly carried on, both in and out of
							Congress. He complained that he found himself alone in defending him;
							and that he found it a heavy task— He asked me some questions about
							Jackson’s authority to set aside the sentence of the Court-Martial, in
							the case <pb type="ms" n="9"/>of <persRef ref="ambrister-robert"
								>Armbrister</persRef>— I told him that I thought the second Sentence

							both of sense and Spirit, arose from transactions in which he was

							difficult for any person to have behaved exactly right. His very

							been so obsequious in his personal deportment, and even now asked my
							good will with such an intense appearance of needing it, that I had

							three thousand for the expence and trouble of his journey from

							proper; but that the only further allowance would be the actual expence
							of the Journey to Chili and of the Voyage home. To this M<hi

							Instructions lately sent to <persRef ref="rush-richard">R.
								Rush</persRef>, and to which he assented, without however expressing
							any opinion that would have committed his own Government upon the
							question— The <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French

								Hauterive</persRef>, who while the <persRef ref="richelieu-armand"

							This is another Spanish contrivance to waste time without coming to a

								>Onis</persRef> would now very shortly receive enlarged powers,
							which will enable us to strike a bargain— He read me passages from the
							despatches and Letters, which manifested much earnestness to dissuade
							our recognition of the South-American Governments— But the principal
							subject of the Letters was the Affairs of France, the Congress of Aix La

							left the same Night; upon which M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Hauterive is in raptures at his delicatesse— I received a Note from

						<p><date>12. VII:</date> Morning calls from <persRef ref="lowndes-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. Lowndes</persRef>, Member of
							Congress from South Carolina, from <persRef ref="jackson-william">Major
								Jackson</persRef> and from <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef> of the Department—
							Major Jackson’s visit was to mention that he is a Candidate for the
							Office of Marshal for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and to ask
							my influence in his favour. I received a Note asking me to attend a
							Cabinet meeting at the President’s at Noon— I found all the other Heads
							of Department there. The <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>
							submitted two questions for their Consideration— One was upon a Report
							from the Secretary of War, <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
							>Calhoun</persRef>; prepared in obedience to a resolution of the House
							of Representatives passed at the last Session of Congress, for the
							application of the means within the power of Congress, for making roads
							and Canals, for Military purposes— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun read the report. The President’s question was, whether it could
							be made to the house consistently with his declaration in the Message at
							the commencement of the last Session, that in his opinion Congress had
							not the power by the Constitution to make Laws, and <pb type="ms" n="11"
							/>to incur expence for purposes of internal improvement— The President
							expressed an opinion that the call of the House, directly upon the
							Secretary of War for this Report was itself irregular and not
							conformable to the Spirit of the Constitution of the United States, the
							principle of which was a single executive. The Laws constituting the
							Departments were also founded upon the same principle, with the
							exception of the Treasury Department, the Law to establish which was
							drawn up by <persRef ref="hamilton-alexander">A. Hamilton</persRef>, who
							was himself to be the Secretary, and whose object was to establish a
							direct intercourse between the members of the Legislature and himself
							for his own purposes— The practice of calling directly from either house
							of Congress upon the other Heads of Departments for Reports was
							irregular and had grown up, within these few years. And as the Heads of
							Departments were Executive Officers under the President, it was to be
							considered whether the President himself was not responsible for the
							substance of their Reports— I thought there would be an obvious
							incongruity and indecency that a Head of Department should make a Report
							to either House of Congress, which the President should disapprove; but
							observed that the practice of direct Calls from either House of Congress
							upon all the Heads of Departments for Reports was not of recent origin,
							having existed ever since the establishment of the Government—of which I
							gave <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson’s</persRef> Report upon Weights and Measures, and <persRef
								ref="knox-henry2">General Knox’s</persRef> Report upon a Militia
							system as instances. It was said that the Senate were very scrupulous
							about direct Calls, but I remarked that I had now a Report, upon Weights
							and Measures to make, upon such a Call from the Senate, passed on the
								3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March 1817— In this case the
							difficulty is that the Secretary of War, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Calhoun, is of opinion that Congress have by the Constitution the power
							of appropriating money for internal improvement, and of making roads and
							canals for that purpose. He was an ardent supporter of this doctrine in
							Congress, and in his Report had introduced strong expressions of the <hi
								rend="italic">duty</hi> of Congress to apply all the means in their
							power to the object. The majority of both Houses of Congress declared
							his opinion to the contrary, and the real object of this call upon
							Calhoun was to embarrass the President, and excite division in his
							Councils. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun however at the close of
							his report had expressly stated, that he did not enter into the question
							of the Constitutional right, and he readily agreed to omit the passages
							in which there were intimations of a duty in Congress to make internal
							improvements. The second question proposed by the President was upon the
							appointment of Marshal for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Who
							should be the man? Four Candidates—Major Jackson, a revolutionary
							Officer, who served through the whole War—with strong testimonials from
								<persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lincoln-benjamin">Lincoln</persRef>—but a federalist; high
							toned, and somewhat obnoxious, to the other side. <persRef
								ref="etting-rueben">Reuben Etting</persRef>; with many respectable
							recommendations, but chiefly from Baltimore— <persRef
								ref="kearsley-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kearsley</persRef>; most earnestly, and anxiously recommended by the
								<persRef ref="lacock-abner;roberts-jonathan" type="multi">two
								Senators from Pennsylvania</persRef>; an Officer in the late War,
							mutilated by the loss of a leg, at Chippeway—but an active federalist,
							and ardent opponent of the present <persRef ref="findlay-william"
								>Governor of Pennsylvania</persRef> and <persRef ref="moore-daniel"
								>Daniel Moore</persRef>; recommended by the late <persRef
								ref="smith-john3">Marshal Smith</persRef>— By the late and present
								<persRef ref="snyder-simon">Governors of the State</persRef>, by
							many other respectable persons, and by many members of the State
							Legislature— The President said his own inclination was in favour of
							Major Jackson; but he could not indulge it— <persRef ref="forsyth-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>, who was very
							friendly to the Major, had written to Philadelphia to enquire how the
							appointment of him would be received. He was answered that it would not
							be acceptable— So said the late and present Governor, the Secretary
								(<persRef ref="sergeant-thomas">T. Sergeant</persRef>) and many
							members of the Legislature— The parties in Pennsylvania are breaking all
							to pieces. <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>
							said that the present Governor who was not popular when chosen, had lost
							and was now losing popularity; so that he would not be re-elected. A
							late transaction of the Secretary, T. Sergeant, he said had very much
							injured the Governor, and would yet still more affect his popularity.
							The parties in the State of New-York are also breaking up. <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">Governor Clinton’s</persRef> influence is
							waning, and compelling him to a full and undisguised Coalition with the
							federalists. It was finally determined this day that D. Moore should be
							the person to be nominated as Marshal; and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford was requested to see the Pennsylvania Senators, and
							reconcile them to the measure; and I was charged with the same mission
							to Major Jackson. It was said to be a <pb type="ms" n="12"/>general rule
							of the Senate to reject every nomination that is opposed by both the
							Senators from the State in which the appointment is made— I was only a
							few minutes at the Office, as we had company to dine with us at home—

							enquire and answer him when he calls again— At the Presidents I met
								<persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> the Secretary of the Navy. It was determined that
							the John Adams, now at New York should be the vessel fixed upon to go to
							the Havanna and Campeachy for the Prisoners, and the President said that
							as far as he recollected <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">C.
								Hughes</persRef> who went to Carthagena, upon a similar agency,
							besides the allowance of all his expences, had pay equivalent to that of
							a Member of Congress— At the Office <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> D. Brent</persRef> was absent, his
							brother <persRef ref="brent-robert2">Robert</persRef> being very
							dangerously ill— <persRef ref="forbes-john">Forbes</persRef> came to
							present himself as a Candidate, if there should be a vacancy in R.
							Brent’s Office. He said he could obtain recommendations from the whole
							Massachusetts Delegation in Congress if necessary which I advised him to
							do. <persRef ref="onis-luis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Onis</persRef> the Spanish Minister came by appointment at 2. and I
							had further Conversation with him upon the new Instructions received by
							him from his Government— He says he is authorized to agree to a line
							from the Missouri to the Mouth of Columbia river on the South Sea. That
							it was at his earnest solicitation agreed to, in the Spanish Cabinet. He
							had written that it was essential to the completion of a great plan
							formed here, of internal communication, from the Atlantic to the Pacific
							Ocean; and that there was no prospect of our agreeing to any arrangement
							without it— He insisted much upon the infinite pains he has taken to
							prevail upon his Government to come to terms of accommodation with us;
							but the king’s Council was composed of such ignorant, and stupid <hi
								rend="italic">nigauds</hi> Grandees of Spain, and Priests, that I
							could have no conception of their obstinacy and imbecility. For this
							reason he had always inflexibly refused to be a member of the Council—
							He spoke much of a publication in the Washington City Gazette, of the
								9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 11<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of this Month, purporting to be a history of the
							negotiation for the purchase of Louisiana; referring to many unpublished
							Letters, and secret documents and transactions of the time, and aiming
							to shew that neither the Eastern, nor the Western Boundaries now claimed
							by us under the cession entered into the thoughts of our negotiators
							then— That all our pretensions are after-thoughts and particularly that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe has held at different times on
							the subject language irreconcilable with itself. These pieces were
							mentioned at the President’s last Tuesday, and Crawford said he thought
							they were written by <persRef ref="armstrong-john">Armstrong</persRef>.
							I then observed that my only reason to question was that they were in a
							contemptuous tone with respect to his brother in Law, <persRef
								ref="livingston-robert">Livingston</persRef>— <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> said that was no
							objection, and told a story of Armstrong’s having upon some occasion
							published a better and virulent attack upon Livingston; (anonymous) it
							was so violent, that there was a family council held, to settle what was
							to be done upon it, and to ascertain who was the author. At this meeting
							Armstrong attended; told the family that the author of the offensive
							piece must be <persRef ref="jay-john">Jay</persRef>—that the true policy
							was, not to defend the Chancellor, but to attack Jay himself in return.
							He offered himself for that service, and actually performed it by a
							furious attack upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jay, as the author of
							the piece, which he, Armstrong had himself written. Armstrong is at
							irreconcilable enmity with the President, and I have no doubt that the
							publication of these pieces at this time and place, it expressly
							intended to answer the purpose of injuring the personal character of the
							President, and of interposing an obstacle to the conclusion of the
							present Negotiation with Spain; the ultimate object of this object being
							the same as the first— Onis is excessively delighted at these
							publications, and hinted that they overthrew all our pretensions both to
							the Eastern and Western Boundary of Louisiana. They do not however
							really affect the question at-all— The utmost that they can shew, so far
							as they are supported by facts is, that <persRef
								ref="livingston-robert;monroe-james" type="multi">our
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef> took the Article in which the boundaries
							were designated, as copied from the Treaty by which Spain had made the
							Cession to France; and that was a designation, not geographical, but
							political and possessory—as actually possessed by Spain at the cession,
							as <hi rend="italic">formerly</hi> (without reference to date) possessed
							by France, and as, subsequently modified by Treaties with other Powers.
							I have no doubt that the Article was drawn with the express intention on
							the part of France to take possession of the whole original Colony of
							Louisiana, as granted in <persRef ref="crozat-antoine"
								>Crozet’s</persRef> Charter. Whether Spain meant the same thing, or
							understood the Article as importing so much may be questioned— But both
							parties knew that if a question of Construction upon the Article should
							arise between <pb type="ms" n="14"/>them, the effective Construction
							would be that of France— It appears even from these publications in the
							City Gazette, that <persRef ref="barbemarbois-francois"
								>Marbois</persRef>, the man who concluded the Treaty with our
							Plenipotentiaries, had once said that Mobile was part of Louisiana; and
							at the time when the Louisiana Convention was ratified by the Senate in
							1803 <persRef ref="dayton-jonathan">Jonathan Dayton</persRef> stated in
							his place that <persRef ref="laussat-pierre">Laussat</persRef> had told
							him at New-Orleans, that when the troops then expected out from France,
							and which were actually embarked at Helvoetsluys under <persRef
								ref="charles-xivjohn">Bernadotte</persRef>, to go to Louisiana, when
							the war broke out between France and England, and prevented their
							sailing should arrive, they would take possession to the Perdido,
							without asking any questions of Spain. But when France had sold her
							bargain to us, and wanted to sell it to us a second time, she changed
							her tone, first equivocated and evaded, and finally declared herself
							point blank against us upon the Eastern limit, and more feebly and
							ambiguously upon the Wesern— I told Onis that we could not agree to the
							proposal of drawing the line from the Missouri to Columbia river; but
							that if he would send me a written Note, his propositions would be
							considered. I said this because he himself seemed reluctant at writing,
							unless we were ready to accept his offer— I therefore thought it best to
							make him write— I also told him we were about sending a vessel to the
							Havanna, to apply for the release of a number of American Prisoners
							confined there including <persRef ref="robinson-william">W. D.
								Robinson</persRef>; and that I should ask him for a Letter to the
								<persRef ref="cienfuegos-jose">Governor General of the
								Havanna</persRef> to provide the object of the demand. That some of
							these prisoners, claimed the benefit of the king’s <hi rend="italic"
								>Indulto</hi>, and others were in circumstances precisely similar to
							British Subjects who had been delivered upon demand, by the Commanders
							of British ships of War— He said if that was the case the Americans
							ought undoubtedly to be given up also. But Robinson was a very bad man,
							and had been guilty of extreme misconduct in Caraccas. He would very
							readily give the Letter which I should ask, for the Governor General,
							but I was aware the Spanish Government had publicly determined that all
							foreigners serving with the rebel subjects should be treated like the
							rebels themselves— I was employed at home all the Evening, but had not
							time to write. While I was at the President’s this Morning there came a
							Committee of two Members from the House of Representatives, with a
							Resolution passed yesterday, calling upon the President for information,
							whether any application has been made from any of the Independent
							Governments of South-America, for any person to be accredited as
							Minister or Consul General and what answer has been returned. I suppose
							the object is to worry the President, and especially the Secretary of
							State, with the great South-American witchery.</p>

						<p><date>20. VI:</date> I began the draft of a Report, on the Call from the

							applications for reception as Minister or Consul-General. I at first
							intended to have made a very short report; but the papers which must be
							communicated require a commentary— In this affair, every thing is

							Administration, and especially of fastening upon the Secretary of State
							the odium, of refusing to receive South-American Ministers and
							Consuls-General— I am walking on a Rope, with a precipice on each side
							of me; and without human aid beyond myself upon which to rely— The
							papers to be disclosed on this Call, will probably lead to another. The
							policy pursued by the Administration, in South American Affairs, is in
							the general opinion of the Public fixed exclusively upon the Secretary
							of State; and as the popular sentiment is much divided about it, no
							effort is omitted to render it obnoxious. <persRef ref="deforest-david"
								>De Forrest’s</persRef> notes are cunning and deceptive— To the last
							and longest of them, I have not replied— It must be sent in under the

							will be taken of it, to censure the course of the Executive, and perhaps
							even to force a recognition of the Southern Independents. I must
							therefore demolish the arguments in De Forrest’s last Note, which is
							indeed not a difficult task, but which must take time, and many words.
							The Call for information concerning Pensacola, S<hi rend="superscript"

							remarked to him, that it was from the <pb type="ms" n="16"/>Departments

							to make a written statement of all his views in this respect, and

							it, but it did not suit his republican stomach. I told him we thought it
							a mere formality not worth a contest; and which by the universality of

								Adams</persRef> had a very indifferent Night, and in the course of
							this day was again twice extremely ill. I was both times absent from
							home. They sent for <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hunt</persRef>, who came and made two attempts to bleed
							her, but without effect. She was indeed exceedingly weak and exhausted.
							I finished the draft of a Report to the <persRef ref="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> on South-American Diplomatics. <persRef
								ref="deforest-david">De Forrest</persRef> came to the Office, and
							told me that he should leave the City in a few days for New-York. I then
							mentioned to him, as he asked me whether I had received his last Note,
							that I had; but that it was not thought necessary that the discussion
							should be pursued any further with him. He said he had not expected any
							Answer to his last Note. I said there had been a Call from the House of
							Representatives; in compliance with which, all my Correspondence with
							him would be communicated; together with a Report from me to the
							President, containing some remarks in reply to the argument in his Note.
							I reminded him of his having told me, when he first came last May to
							apply for his exequatur, that he was a Native Citizen of the United
							States; and that he had now definitively returned to this Country,
							without intending ever to go back to Buenos-Ayres. I noticed it now,
							because in his Notes he spoke of himself as a Citizen of Buenos-Ayres;
							and of that as <hi rend="italic">his</hi><hi rend="italic"
								>Government</hi>; while under his circumstances, I thought the Laws
							of the United States would recognize him as one of their Citizens,
							entitled to the rights, and bound by the obligations of that character.
							And if he should be recognized as Consul General from Buenos-Ayres, he
							would not be acknowledged as a citizen of that Country. He seemed to be
							somewhat alarmed; and said that when he had informed me that he had no
							intention of returning to Buenos Ayres, but had come finally to settle
							here, he had not expected the information would ever be used against
							him—and asked whether he would by Law be considered as a Citizen of the
							United States, while he was at Buenos-Ayres— I replied that it was
							unnecessary for me to give an opinion upon that point. He had better
							consult a lawyer upon it— I did not mean to assert that he would.
							Neither was it my intention to make any use to his disadvantage of any
							thing that he had said to me— Although the information he had given me
							was voluntary, under no injunction of secrecy of intimation of
							Confidence, I had never mentioned it to any other person than the
							President, and should never notice it publicly, unless it should be
							necessary in the discharge of my public duties. But it was in candour
							due to him, to let him know that the recognition of him as Consul
							General of Buenos-Ayres, should it hereafter be granted, would in no
							wise divest him of his character, as a Citizen of the United States. He
							said that for the last seventeen years he had resided principally at
							Buenos-Ayres, and had become a Citizen of that Country— In their
							revolutionary struggle with Spain he had taken a very decided and active
							part—particularly in the business of privateering. He had now returned
							to this Country with the view of remaining here, and was building a
							House at New-Haven; but if Spanish Subjects could molest him here for
							what he did while an inhabitant of Buenos-Ayres, his situation would be
							very perilous— With regard to the Call from the House of
							Representatives, it was made without his privity; or even his knowledge—
							He had told various persons that he had made application to be
							acknowledged as Consul-General from Buenos-Ayres, and had been refused;
							but without any intention or idea that the subject would stirred in
							Congress. When the Call for this information was made, he had enquired
							whether it was brought forward by one of the members who had been last
							Winter in favour of the acknowledgment of South-American Independence,
							and had been informed that it was. When he came to this Country he
							brought with him a Letter of Introduction from <persRef
								ref="graham-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>, which he had delivered. He had some Conversation
							with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, who told him he was sorry to
							find, by the Report of <persRef ref="bland-theoderick">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bland</persRef>, and from other
							sources, that there was not so much public virtue among the
							South-Americans as he had given them credit for. De Forrest added that
							since his arrival in this Country he had become perfectly convinced that
							the proceedings of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and his
							supporters in Congress last Winter had injured instead of aiding the
							Cause of the South-Americans, and he was entirely satisfied with the
							friendly disposition of the executive of the United States towards them—
							I was at the Offices of the Secretaries of War, and the Navy, and we
							examined the applications and recommendations for the place of
							Superintendent <pb type="ms" n="18"/>of the Building in which the three
							Offices are kept, instead of <persRef ref="dougherty-joseph">Joseph
								Dougherty</persRef>, whom we have dismissed, for assaulting and
							beating <persRef ref="lane-samuel">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Lane</persRef>. We finally fixed upon a person named <persRef
								ref="thorpe-thomas">Thomas Thorpe</persRef>. I dined at <persRef
								ref="pleasonton-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pleasonton’s</persRef>, with a mixed company—<persRef
								ref="barbour-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour</persRef>
							a Senator from Virginia with his <persRef ref="barbour-lucy"
								>wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="barbour-unknown2"
								>daughter</persRef> were there. He is a man of affected pomposity of
							Speech; handsome of person; full of prejudices and dogmatism; and of
							common place exaggeration of Republicanism— Through some remark of
								<persRef ref="tayloe-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Tayloe’s</persRef> I became entangled with him in a conversation, in
							which he maintained that an American Minister at European Courts, ought
							to present himself in a plain frock coat, with metal buttons, (he was
							thinking of the one he had on) and demand admission; and if they would
							not let him in, go away; renounce all his attendance at Court, and
							transact all his business in writing. He made a Speech about it, as if
							he was in the Senate, but luckily his Carriage was called and I had not
							the opportunity to reply to him: for I should have put him in anger to
							no purpose, and have made him at once ridiculous and implacable— I came
							home and found <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> W. S. Smith</persRef> here— <persRef
								ref="buchanan-mary">Mary Buchanan</persRef> was already gone to the

								Gales’s</persRef>. I followed her there. The company was
							numerous—perhaps 150. There had been an alarm of fire in the house, from
							a chimney, which burnt for half an hour. <persRef ref="otis-harrison"
								>Otis</persRef> applied to me in behalf of <persRef
								ref="foster-william">W. Foster jun<hi rend="superscript"

							suspended at the late Negotiation of a Convention with England, now
							before the Senate for consideration, may be accepted—but <persRef
								ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King</persRef> is

						<p><date>23. V:30.</date> I slept in the small bed, and had a very restless
							Night, through the whole of which my wife was very ill; suffering severe

							well as in my own room below. <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef>, brought me the copy

								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> with his Suite were
							going out. The President called him and <persRef ref="butler-robert"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Butler</persRef> back, and
							introduced them to me— The General had arrived this Morning, from his
							residence at Nashville, Tennessee, and had already called at my Office—
							Among the rumours which have been circulated by the cabal, now

							whispered that <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Jefferson</persRef>, and <persRef ref="madison-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef>, had declared

							a few days since to the President, who told me that he was convinced
							there was no foundation for it. This morning he shewed me, in Confidence
							a Letter which he had just received from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jefferson— It not only expresses full satisfaction with the course
							pursued by the administration, but mentions my Letters of 12 March last
							to <persRef ref="onis-luis">Onis</persRef>, and of 28 November to
								<persRef ref="erving-george">Erving</persRef>, in terms which it
							would not become me to repeat. He advises that they, with others of my
							Letters to Onis should be translated into French, and communicated to
							every Government in Europe, as a thorough vindication of the conduct and
							policy of this Government. He also suggests a question whether Onis’s
							Letters in which he gives the President the title of His Excellency,
							ought not to be returned to him, as insulting the President by a title
							beneath his dignity— The President told me that some of these attacks
							upon the Administration through General Jackson, had been ascribed to
								<persRef ref="roane-spencer">Judge Roane</persRef>, but that he had
							utterly disavowed them. He said that <persRef ref="ritchie-thomas"
								>Ritchie</persRef>, the Editor of the Richmond Enquirer was a vain
							and presumptuous Man, affecting to have great influence and
							inconsiderately committing himself upon important political subjects,
							without waiting to understand them thoroughly, and thus getting into
							perplexities without knowing afterwards how to get out of them. <persRef
								ref="forbes-john">Forbes</persRef> came to the Office to renew his
							solicitations for office— His wants are very urgent, and he expressed
							the wish of obtaining the appointment of Marshal for the District of
							Massachusetts at the expiration of <persRef ref="prince-james"
								>Prince’s</persRef> present term, even though Prince should wish to
							have his Commission renewed. I told him, I thought that would be
							impossible— <persRef ref="roberts-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Roberts</persRef> the Senator from Pennsylvania came to
							enquire if <persRef ref="jones-r">R. B. Jones</persRef> now Consul at

								<persRef ref="pizarro-joseph">Pizarro’s</persRef> Note to Erving of
							29. August. He also enquired if General Jackson had the power to appoint
							a Court Martial. I shewed him the Act of Congress establishing the
							Articles of War. He repeated to me what he had already said the other

						<p><date>25. V:30.</date> Successive visits at my house from <persRef
								ref="holmes-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes</persRef>,
							Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Relations, <persRef
								ref="robertson-george">Robertson</persRef>, Member of the House from
							Kentucky, <persRef ref="onis-luis">de Onis</persRef> the Spanish, and
								<persRef ref="dashkov-andrei">Daschkoff</persRef> the Russian
							Minister. Holmes came to make an extract from <persRef
								ref="niles-hezekiah">Niles’s</persRef> Register of a passage that he
							had quoted in his Speech on the Seminole War. Robertson brought a Letter
							from <persRef ref="pope-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Pope</persRef>, to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Adams</persRef>, and had some
							Conversation with me upon the local politics of Kentucky. That State is
							divided between two parties, with <persRef ref="clay-henry"
								>Clay</persRef> as the head of one of them and Pope of the other.
							Clay, by the superiority of his talents, by a more artful management of
							popular feelings, and by the chances of good Fortune, notwithstanding
							the more correct moral character of his antagonist, has acquired a great
							ascendancy over him, and not only keeps him depressed in public
							estimation, but uses every possible means of the most rancorous &amp;
							malignant enmity to ruin him. Robertson thought some time since that
							Clay intended to offer himself at the next Election of Governor of the
							State, as a candidate, and it is well understood that his object is to
							organize and embody a systematic opposition of the whole Western
							Country, against the present Administration, the operation of which is
							to take effect, at the end of <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s</persRef> eight years.
							Robertson and <persRef ref="trimble-david">Trimble</persRef> were until
							now desirous of supporting <persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M. Johnson</persRef> against Clay—
							But Robertson now says, that Clay will not be a candidate— That he and
							his party will support Johnson; and Pope proposes that <persRef
								ref="mckee-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kee</persRef>, a
							brother in Law of Robertson’s, should be supported as the candidate in
							opposition to Johnson— Robertson spoke handsomely of Johnson, as an
							honourable and independent man; but said that he had lately lost the
							election as Senator of the United States, by the choice of a <persRef
								ref="logan-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Logan</persRef>,
							a constant and ardent supporter of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe’s Administration; and who had particularly sided with it, in
							respect to South-American Affairs. That election was a test of the
							strength of parties in the Kentucky Legislature, and if M’Kee should be
							a candidate it was probable he would be elected in opposition to
							Johnson— They were friends, and M’Kee was very unwilling to stand
							against Johnson, knowing that it would be an election warmly contested—
							It was apprehended that Johnson had been irritated by the loss of his
							Election as Senator; and if he should be carried as Governor by the
							other party, even though <pb type="ms" n="20"/>with the concurrence of
							the others he might retain resentments against them and become a
							promoter of all their views— Robertson read me a part of a Letter from
							M’Kee, in which these ideas were disclosed, and he was desired to have
							some communication with the Administration here and ascertain whether if
							he should be elected as Governor he might rely that recommendations from
							him and his friends of persons for official appointments by the
							President would meet with equal favour, supposing the candidates equally
							well qualified, as those recommended by their adversaries. This Letter
							also fully set forth M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s project of
							combining the whole Western Country for the Election at the close of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s second term, and asserted
							positively that a positive Coalition for that purpose was formed and
							completed last year— I told Robertson that without having any authority
							to speak for the President in this case, I was confident he would take
							no part in the interior politics of Kentucky. I knew he had a high
							regard and esteem for Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson, of whom
							I had heard him speak always in respectful terms. He also knew M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kee who was several years a member of
							the House of Representatives— But he would avoid from principle all
							interference in the Election of Governor in any of the States. He would
							no doubt be gratified by the Election of a person who would harmonize
							with the general Administration, and with regard to recommendations for
							Offices, would undoubtedly give equal weight to those from his friends,
							as to others— I added that I would report to the President the substance
							of this Conversation, or withhold it, at his option— He left it to my
							discretion. He said it was expected there would shortly be a vacancy in
							the Office of District Attorney in Kentucky, and he wished the
							appointment might be given to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pope; to
							whom the Office itself was no object, but who would value it, as a mark
							of Confidence in the Administration— I told him that I had every
							possible feeling of good-will towards M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Pope, but having made it a principle to avoid recommending to the
							President any of my family Relations, if it was desirable that the name
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pope, who had married <persRef
								ref="pope-eliza">my wife’s Sister</persRef>, should be presented to
							the President, either for the Office of District Attorney, or for a
							foreign Mission. I should wish it might be through some other channel
							than me. I had in no instance recommended to the President a Relation of
							mine, for any Office, and I found it necessary to adhere to the rule,
							that I had prescribed to myself to avoid making any such Recommendation—
							Robertson approved of these Sentiments, and said he had already been
							convinced that the President would avoid all interference in the local
							elections of Kentucky— A course which he perfectly approved— Pope’s
							Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams was more explicit
							electioneering than Robertson’s. These overtures would afford
							opportunities, and hold out temptations to intrigue, of which there is
							much in this Government, and without which the Prospects of a public
							man, are desperate— Caballing with Members of Congress for future
							contingency has become so interwoven with the practical course of our
							Government, and so inevitably flows from the practice of caucusing by
							the Members to fix on Candidates for President and Vice-President, that
							to decline it is to pass upon myself a sentence of total exclusion— Be
							it so!— Whatever talents I possess, that of intrigues is not among them—
							And instead of toiling for a future election as Pope recommends, my only
							wisdom is to prepare myself for voluntary, or for unwilling retirement.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis came to urge me to answer his
							last Note, and to protest his extreme earnestness to conclude a Treaty
							with me, before the close of the present Session of Congress. I told him
							that if he insisted upon it I would answer his note, but I was so
							wearied out with the discussion, that it had become nauseous— I really
							could discuss no longer— I had given it up in despair— He said that he
							did not wish for any further discussion, but wanted an answer. I told
							him the utmost that I could possibly do, would be to review, for the
							Western Boundary the proposals I had last made to him— He protested he
							was not authorized to accept them, but he hoped I should modify them;
							and then glided into his usual argument in support of Spanish Rights— I
							promised him at all events, an answer. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Daschkoff came to tell me that he had at length received his Letters of
							recredence— He meant of Recall— This is a mistake so common that there
							is a confusion of ideas prevalent among three fourths of the diplomatic
							characters whom I know. Letters of Recall are received by a Minister,
							from his own Government— Letters of Recredence, are from the Government
							to which he is accredited, to his own—recommending him back to his own
							Master— Daschkoff told me that he expected the arrival of his Successor
								<persRef ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poletica</persRef>, very shortly, and proposed to withhold the
							delivery of his Letters until Poletica could at the same time deliver
							his credentials; so that there might be no interval of time during which
							his Sovereign would be not represented— He then protested that he
							rejoiced at the good understanding between the <pb type="ms" n="21"
							/>United States and the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>,
							and that notwithstanding the unpleasant occurrences that had happened he
							had always been the fast friend of this Country, and entertained the
							highest respect for all those who administered the Government. He should
							return home, and whether in public own private life hereafter should to
							the utmost of his power promote sentiments favourable to this Country
							there; and as I had resided so long in Russia, and knew the friendly
							dispositions of the Emperor towards the United States, he hoped I should
							always feel an interest in cultivating them— He spoke under so much
							embarrassment and apparent mortification, with awkwardness, hesitation
							and confusion of face, that I felt compassion for him— No Public
							Minister ever accredited in the United States, has more grossly insulted
							the Government, or more wantonly attempted to kindle discord between his
							Sovereign and them— It is by forbearance unexampled that he has been
							permitted so long to remain here— The result to himself is that he is
							recalled in disgrace, and now his object is to appease the President,
							and obtain a gracious dismission— I told him I should immediately report
							to the President the purport of his communication, that in the meantime
							I could assure him that every friendly sentiment of the Emperor towards
							the United States was most cordially reciprocated by this Government.
							That my own personal feelings were in perfect unison with them, and that
							so far as it might be in my power I should always be happy in promoting
							to the utmost the harmony between the two Countries— That with regard to
							his delivering his Letters of recall, he would take the time that would
							be most suitable to his own convenience, if M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Poletica should arrive before his own departure, it would be
							most convenient that his Letters of recall and the credentials of his
							successor should be delivered at the same time— I avoided saying any
							thing as to his former conduct and his quarrel with this Government.
							These visitors detained me at home till near two O’Clock. M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams who was so much recovered as to
							leave her bed, but not her chamber, sent Cards of invitation to General
							Jackson and his family to dine with us next Monday— He answered that he
							had determined to decline all personal attentions of this kind, while
							his case was pending before Congress— At the President’s I met <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>— I had received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="connell-john">J. Connell</persRef> who is a Director of the
							Bank of the United States, asking whether it would be agreeable to the
							Administration generally that <persRef ref="cheves-langdon">Langdon
								Cheves</persRef> of South Carolina should be chosen President of the
							Bank in the room of <persRef ref="jones-william">W. Jones</persRef> who
							has resigned. The President had a Letter from <persRef
								ref="dallas-george">Dallas</persRef>, proposing <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>.
							Crawford said that was very wild—Forsyth had no faculty or fitness for
							such a place and had been all his life spending money rather than making
							it. As to Cheves (whom I do not know) they agreed that he was a man of
							integrity, talents, and indefatigable industry— But they said he was a
							stubborn and testy man, who had gone out of public life discontented and
							soured, because things were not managed precisely as he would have
							prescribed— But his reputation stood so high, that no appointment,
							Crawford said would have so great a tendency to soothe and soften the
							prejudices against the Bank, and unless something to that end should be
							done, some harsh measure would be adopted be one of the Houses of
							Congress against the Bank. <persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi

							authorized to say in confidence to him that we would agree to a
							modification of the Western line proposed in my Letter of 31. October,
							so as to avoid the difficulty objected against it that it would pass
							within four or five leagues of Santa Fe. The offer is to take a line due
							North from the Panee bend of the red river to the Arkansas, and follow
							the course of that to its source in latitude 41. <pb type="ms" n="23"
							/>and thence by that parallel to the South Sea— But on condition that
							the Spaniards are to form no settlement North of the Chain of Snowy
							Mountains. I accordingly sent to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De
							Neuville requesting him to call at the Office this day— He came at 4
							O’Clock, and I stated to him this new proposal, in confidence— He
							promised to see Onis and without letting him know that we are prepared
							for this arrangement, ascertain whether he is prepared to agree to it—
							And he will see me again to-morrow. He pleaded for more and
							particularly, that the engagement of Spain not to form settlements North
							of the Snowy Mountains, might be limited, say to ten years, and that the
							line might stop at the Source of the Arkansas, or be left to range
							according to circumstances, between the 41<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> and 43<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> parallel of Latitude:
							leaving it to be settled by Commissioners. I told him that the People of
							this Country, were disgusted with Commissions to settle boundaries, that
							we have now two going on with the British Government whose proceedings
							were so slow and expensive that they had given great dissatisfaction and
							excited prejudices against all such Commissions. That if we touched at
							all upon the Western boundary it would be the clear interest of both
							parties to settle it definitively. That nothing could so effectually
							secure that object in a wilderness the geography of which is unknown, as
							a parallel of Latitude, and the Northern boundary had been thus settled
							more than a century, by the assumption of the 49<hi rend="superscript"

							which is in Longitude between 96 and 97. it was the bend in Longitude

							extreme importance, had it not been so soon discovered— It was the

							which I always understand a superintending Providence, has redeemed the

							immediately to de Neuville, requesting him to call at three O’Clock. In
							the meantime, <persRef key="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bagot</persRef> came with <persRef ref="antrobus-gibbs"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Antrobus</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hughes-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hughes</persRef>, and we exchanged the Ratifications of the
							Convention of 20. October last. He agreed to substitute in the
							certificate of exchange, the terms sealed with our Seals, instead of
							“our arms.” I read their ratified copy, while he held ours, <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef>
							holding at the same time one of the original copies of the Convention,
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Antrobus the other. The four copies
							all agreed in the word Rameau, as applied to certain Islands on the
							Coast of Newfoundland— In our instructions, and the Protocol’s of the
							Conferences, they were called Ramean Islands—on the maps they are marked
							as Ramea Islands. We had some hesitation, whether in the copies of the
							Convention there had not been a mistake of an <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
							for an <hi rend="italic">u</hi>—but on looking into <persRef
								ref="thompson-george">Thompson’s</persRef><persRef
								ref="alcedo-antonio">Alcedo</persRef> we found them Ramaus Islands,
							and marked as being opposite the Baie des Vieillards—on recurring to the
							Cabotia map, we found Old man’s bay directly opposite to them, so that
							we concluded to have them printed as in the copies—Ramean Islands. We
							executed four copies of the Certificate, one of which I kept, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot took the other three. After we had
							finished, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot, expressed his great
							satisfaction at the share that he had taken, in accomplishing this good
							work, and said he <pb type="ms" n="24"/>should now avail himself of a
							leave of absence which he had received last Summer. He proposed to
							embark at New-York in April, and would leave M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Antrobus here as Charge d’Affaires. I asked him how long he
							should expect to be absent—he said there was not time limited; so that
							he has evidently no expectation of coming back. I told him we should be
							sorry to lose him, but so far as his return to his own Country would be
							convenient or advantageous to himself, we should cheerfully acquiesce in
							it. When he left me, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de Neuville
							immediately came in. I began by rectifying the mistake, I had made
							yesterday, which was done without difficulty; for according to our
							agreement, he said he had spoken with <persRef ref="onis-luis"
								>Onis</persRef>, not as having been authorized by me, but simply as
							of himself, and as offering to use his influence to prevail upon us to
							yield more or less, and had not even suggested to him the idea of asking
							for the line from the Panee bend; but had spoken of a range between
							Longitude 102 and 98. So that this difficulty was entirely removed. He
							then said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis had ample Powers
							which he had seen— That he had prepared a Note to me, which I should
							receive this Evening or to morrow, that it would contain some further
							concession upon the part of Spain, but the labouring point would be the
							line to the South Sea— Onis would now proposed the Southern branch of
							Columbia River so that the line may yet terminate at its mouth— I told
							him that Spain having yielded the point of admitting us to the South
							Sea, it was impossible that she should have any interest in chaffering
							for four or five degrees of wilderness which never will or can be of any
							value to her— To us they may be hereafter important, because the
							boundary for us, will be not only with Spain but with her successors—
							This he admitted— He said he would see me again after I shall have
							received Onis’s Note— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
