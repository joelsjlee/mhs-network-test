								Smith</persRef> called early this morning; wanting as usual,

								>Purviance</persRef> will be back in July, when of course Forbes’s
							service at the Office will cease, I advised him to postpone his journey
							till then— I found that the maggot in his brain was to go, and get
							himself elected as representative for Milton in the State Legislature—
							Forbes’s life has been bound in shallows and in Miseries; because he
							never understood the doctrine of proportions, between designs, ends, and

							To accomplish great ends with small means, is the most unequivocal
							characteristic of great and extraordinary powers; but however small a
							design may be, if the means of effecting it are grossly inadequate, to

						<p><date>3: IV:30.</date> Wrote a private Letter to <persRef
								key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>, in answer to four received
							from him— At the Office I began a despatch to him, but found it would be
							necessary to write him at least two. The first is upon the Article taken
							for reference to this Government, at the negotiation of the Commercial
							Convention last October— To give the necessary Instructions concerning
							it, I was obliged to review, and compare together eight or ten papers of
							some length. I made therefore small progress with this Instruction— This
							evening I accompanied <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> to her <persRef
								key="smith-catherine-johnson">Sister Smith’s</persRef>; where she
							spent the Evening. <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de Neuville</persRef> the French
							Minister called to see me. I was desirous of having some particular
							Conversation with him; and he came with that intention; but we were
							interrupted. <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bailey</persRef> came and introduced <persRef ref="law-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Law</persRef>— Bailey goes to
							Baltimore to-morrow; to an Ordination of <persRef ref="sparks-jared"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparks</persRef>. Soon <pb
								type="ms" n="103"/>after Bailey and Law went away, my wife came
							home. De Neuville told me that he had received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="demun-unknown">De Mun</persRef>, at Bordeaux, the 47<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> day after he left this City. And he has
							despatches from his Government of a date, as late as the 16<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March— He came to propose the renewal
							of our old commercial Convention with France, under certain
							modifications; and to ask if I had any other proposals to offer, for a
							Commercial Treaty— This is a subject almost new to me, and upon which I
							must give much time and study before I can be prepared to act. Yet it is
							one of the urgent duties to which I ought to give immediate and deep
							attention. De Neuville said he was determined to return to France, and
							go into retirement— He should indeed have been mortified if he had been
							recalled upon the late change of Ministers in France; but he wishes to
							go out of Office in a creditable manner— Then, if the <persRef
								ref="richelieu-armand">Duke de Richelieu</persRef> or <persRef
								ref="laine-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> L’Ainé</persRef>
							should come into office again; he may be employed elsewhere, or return
							to his Post here— I was endeavouring to dissuade him from going to
							France this year; for if he goes, as his party are entirely down, he
							will stand a great chance of being displaced; and of getting into
							difficulty and trouble on account of his party—while by remaining here,
							he will be aloof from all party contention; and be serving faithfully
							his own Country, in whose hands soever its Government may be— He seems
							to think it a point of honour to go, and share the fortunes of his
							party; but I shall resume this Conversation with him hereafter. He spoke
							of the former French Ministers who have been in the United States and by
							his account the Archives of the Legation from the time of the first
							Minister accredited here, <persRef ref="gerard-conrad">Girard</persRef>,
							to this time, are complete— He says those of the <persRef
								ref="luzerne-ann">Chevalier de la Luzerne</persRef> are in the most
							perfect order, and the most valuable—better than when <persRef
								ref="barbemarbois-francois">Marbois</persRef> was here alone as
							Chargé d’Affaires— That la Luzerne was of a very good but not a great
							family— That in France no families were considered <hi rend="italic"
								>great</hi>, but such as could number among their ancestors a
							Marshal of France, a Cardinal, or an Ambassador— The family of La
							Luzerne, had neither till he himself and <persRef ref="luzerne-cesar"
								>his brother</persRef> were Ambassadors, and now, one of their
							kinsmen was a Cardinal— But it was a very respectable family, <hi
								rend="italic">de Robe</hi>— Marbois, whom <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Bonaparte</persRef> had made a Count, was
							now a Marquis. An intelligent, industrious and honest man. <persRef
								ref="moustier-elenor">Dumoustier</persRef> was a great fool— There
							was a long despatch from him, giving an account of his first
							presentation to <persRef ref="washington-george">President
								Washington</persRef>, in which he describes in great detail the
							President’s dress; and his own; down to their very Stockings— <persRef
								ref="genet-edmund">Genet’s</persRef> despatches are disgusting—full
							of raving Jacobinism—base intrigues; and <hi rend="italic">la
								propagande</hi>— But he enraged <persRef
								ref="robespierre-maximilien">Robespierre</persRef> so much by
							publishing part of his Instructions, that if they could have got him
							back to France, they certainly would have guillotined him— His successor
							not only had orders to demand that he should be delivered, up, which he
							did, but was refused; but he had other orders to seize and send him off
							secretly; which was not accomplished— <persRef ref="turreau-louis"
								>Turreau</persRef> was a man of understanding; but a very worthless
							man, and although here several years knew no more of this Country than
							of China.— This custom of keeping Archives and Records of a Legation is
							a very good one, thought it would be more difficult for American
							Missions than for those of Europe.</p>

						<p><date>6. V:30.</date> Thermometer this morning at 84. <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> had summoned a meeting of the Commissioners of
							the sinking fund, at one O’Clock; which I attended; with the <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Attorney General M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef>. Two Resolutions were past; one to redeem 27 per Cent
							of the Louisiana Loan, and to apply the residue of the ten Millions of
							Dollars appropriated by Law for the annual redemption of the Public
							Debt, after provision for the interest payable in the year, to the
							purchase of three per Cent Stocks— There was a desultory discussion of
							various questions relating to these payments; and conversation upon
							various other topics; a violent thunder gust having detained us there, a
							half an hour, after the business of the Meeting was finished. Wirt was
							groaning about the pressure of the Banks upon the People; and from the
							manner in which he spoke I conjectured that he had feeling of his own in
							the affair— The transactions of the Baltimore Branch Bank, are still in
							confusion, and not likely to be soon adjusted. Crawford had a National
							Advocate which he was reading, and he remarked with great apparent
							satisfaction, that the recent Elections in the State of New York, had,
							as he said blown up <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt
								Clinton</persRef>. The Election of Governor in that State will not
							take place till the next year; but the elections to the Legislature
							appear to be going against his friends and supporters. Crawford and Wirt
							both gave it as their opinion that this would put Clinton down, never to
							rise again—which will depend very much upon circumstances. De Witt
							Clinton’s political fortunes have been more marked with starts of good
							and evil Fortune than those of any other man in the Union. He has been
							taken up, and lain aside, at least half a dozen times; and was never
							more low and discredited in public opinion than immediately before he
							was elected Governor of New-York without Opposition. He is in fact a man
							of great talents, and has magnificent purposes of public service— He has
							comprehensive views, and great designs— But with these high and
							honourable materials of ambition he employs those of a baser sort; the
							Charlatanery of popular enticement— He affects to be a man of universal
							science; and smatters in agriculture, the arts, manufactures,
							antiquities, and every thing that smacks of combination, and
							vote-making— He has been labouring all his life, in combinations and
							Coalitions; and political intriguing with individuals and with parties.
							He began his political life as a furious republican, and rose with the
							downfall of the federal party in New-York.— He then made common cause
							with <persRef ref="burr-aaron">Burr</persRef> and his partizans,
							afterwards quarreled with them and then coalesced with them again— Till
							the commencement of the late War with England he had continued however
							through all his changes an ardent republican; but no sooner was that War
							declared than he veered about, thrust himself forward as head of a Peace
							party— Negotiated for and obtained the support of the federalists, as a
							Candidate for the Presidency in opposition to the re-election of
								<persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Madison</persRef> in 1812 and had agents travelling about the
							Country, and bargaining with individuals of influence, to obtain their
							support to secure his election— <persRef ref="blake-george">George
								Blake</persRef> the District Attorney at Boston, told me last
							September, that in 1812 Clinton’s Ambassador, came to him, and
							explicitly assured him that as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton
							was a Candidate for the <pb type="ms" n="105"/>Presidency with a fair
							prospect of being elected, his, Blake’s continuance in his Office, would
							depend upon the part he should take in the Election— That if M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton should succeed he would of course
							favour those who favoured him— He did the same with others; and the
							New-England federalists actually gave him their support. This manoeuvre
							however did not succeed. His forecast failed him, in regard to the
							effect and result of the War; and his versatility threw him back instead
							of advancing him in the progress of his ambition. At the close of the
							War he was so unpopular that he was removed from the Office of Mayor of
							New York, and turned over to private life: but only two years afterwards
								<persRef ref="tompkins-daniel">Tompkins</persRef> the Governor of
							New-York, being transferred to the Vice-Presidency of the Union, a
							sudden and unaccountable coalition of all the parties in New-York, fixed
							upon De Witt Clinton, and he was elected Governor without opposition.
							Since then his public measures have been generally good; and his
							Speeches to the Legislature of the State have been much admired; but his
							appointments to office have not given satisfaction. The last year he
							lost much of his influence in the Legislature; and he will probably lose
							more by the issue of those now made. The chance is against him for his
							own re-election the next year— But ups and downs are the natural
							characters of such a man’s history. His abilities rank him among the
							first men in the Union—he is the most eminent though not the ablest man
							in the State of New-York; and as he is yet not more than fifty years
							old, another fall will by no means be decisive of his fate for life.
							Crawford however, obviously considers him now, as a rival removed; and
							evidently reckons upon the support of New-York for himself at the proper
							time. That he had electioneering intelligences with some of the New-York
							Members of the late Congress, at the last Session was manifest; and he
							spoke this day of the men of political consideration in New-York, with
							an intimate knowledge of all their party views, bearings and
							connections. He spoke too in a tone, that shewed a confidence that all
							Clinton’s losses in that State would be his gains. I returned to my
							Office after the meeting was over, and finished at last the draft of a
							despatch to <persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef> upon the
							suspended Article— In the Evening <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi

						<p><date>8. VI:</date> I called at <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"

							free from the payment of duties of certain articles arrived at

									>r</hi> Anderson</persRef> the Comptroller to whom Antrobus
							applied, answered him in writing that the privilege of importing goods
							free of duty was confined to Public Ministers, and there was no example

							and left the papers with <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> renewing verbally the
							application for exemption from the payment of the duties. I thought it
							impossible that any objection should seriously be made; but I found it
							had been countenanced by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford
							himself, because he said there was no precedent for it at the Treasury—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Anderson came in while I was with
							Crawford. I said there was no distinction of principle, and I had never
							heard any made in practice between the right of a minister, and that of
							a Chargé d’Affaires, to exemption from duties. Crawford spoke of the
							limitation which in most of the European Countries, had been set to the
							privilege, and of the graduated limitation lately announced by the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef>; in which the
							amount allowed to a Chargé d’Affaires, is much less than that to a
							Minister. There is a limitation almost every where— But none any where
							that allows the privilege to the Minister, and denies it entirely to the
							Charge d’Affaires— We finally agreed that Antrobus should be required to
							make a written application to the Department of State with a statement
							of the Articles, that he wishes to be admitted; upon which I am to write
							to the Secretary of the Treasury requesting the order for their free
							admission.— I mentioned to Crawford the complaints against <persRef
								ref="biddle-james">Captain Biddle</persRef>, which he thought with
							me, ought to be reported to the <persRef ref="thompson-smith">Secretary
								of the Navy</persRef>. Crawford had again the New-York newspapers,
							before him with the returns of the Elections to the State Legislature;
							but he was not quite so sanguine as he was the other day—that the
							Tammanies would outnumber both the Federalists and the Clintonians. The
							prospect is quite the reverse. At my Office I commenced the draft of a
							paper, for Instructions to <persRef ref="perry-oliver">Captain O. H.
								Perry</persRef>, on a Mission to Venezuela and Buenos-Ayres— There
							was this day a cold easterly Storm, which obliged us to resume our

							Office. Painful Letter from <persRef ref="adams-john2">my Son

						<p><date>10. VI:</date> I attended this Morning the Office at eleven

							package of books which I have been expecting from Boston. The <persRef

							of mine which they had to print their Cicero from. I cannot indulge
							myself in the luxury of giving two hours a day to these writers, but to
								<pb type="ms" n="107"/>live without having a Cicero and a Tacitus at
							hand, seems to me, as if it was a privation of one of my limbs. This
							Edition of Wells and Lilly, is a very handsome one. I opened a volume of
							the Tacitus, and by a kind of sors Tacitina, fell upon the passage. “<hi
								rend="italic">Fidem</hi>, <hi rend="italic">libertatem</hi>, <hi
								rend="italic">amicitiam</hi>, praecipua humani animi bona, tu quidem
							eadem constantia retinebis”— (Hist: Lib. 1. Cap. 15.) More than thirty

							for a motto; and I have had them these 25 years as the motto upon my

						<p><date>11. IV:</date> Four is the hour at which, if I had vigour of mind
							and body to carry my wishes into Execution, I would rise every Morning
							throughout the year. But I have never been able to carry it steadily
							into effect. With a more determined and persevering Resolution, I might
							make my average rising hour five— But ill health, fatigue, a broken
							night’s rest, a protracted hour of going to bed, an over-copious dinner,
							and the thousand accidents of daily occurrence over which my will has no
							controul, have perhaps as much effect as the imbecility of my will, in
							robbing me of the second hour. This morning I rose at my theoretic hour,
							and immediately resumed the examination of the papers relating to the
							Journals of the Convention of 1787. to prepare them for publication— I
							was engaged upon them without intermission till nine, when the Ladies
							came down to Breakfast— <persRef ref="clark-susanna">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Clark</persRef> took leave of us, and
							returned with <persRef ref="clark-susan">her child</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="addison-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Addison’s</persRef> at Georgetown. At the Office, I attended in the
							hope of making progress in the draught of Instructions for <persRef
								ref="perry-oliver">Captain Perry</persRef>, but the day was absorbed
							by other business, which required immediate attention— There were two
							Notes from <persRef ref="antrobus-gibbs">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Antrobus</persRef> the British Charge d’Affaires; one requesting the
							admission, free of duty, of his furniture and wine arrived at
							Philadelphia, and the other asking the delivery up of three British
							Subjects, Seamen, on board a Piratical privateer called the Louisa,
								<persRef ref="almeda-joseph">Captain Alméda</persRef>, fitted out at
							Baltimore, and which has committed so many outrages that the Lords of
							the British Admiralty sent out an armed ship, the Lee, <persRef
								ref="blacker-f">Captain Blacker</persRef>, expressly to take her—
							Blacker arrived at Charleston while the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> was there; and learning that several of the
							crew of the Louisa, among whom the three British Seamen were included,
							were in prison at Charleston, upon a charge of Piracy, he applied by
							Letter, first to the <persRef ref="geddes-john">Governor of South
								Carolina</persRef>, and afterwards to the President; asking to have
							the men delivered up to him, to be carried to England for trial. The
							Governor answered Blacker, that he had no authority in the case, the men
							being in prison, under the authority of the United States— <persRef
								ref="gouverneur-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gouverneur</persRef>, the President’s private Secretary, referred
							Blacker to the Secretary of State through the British Charge d’Affaires.
							Antrobus’s Note requests that the men may be delivered up, and sends
							copies of Blacker’s correspondence— I had received other copies of it
							the day before yesterday from the President, with a Letter from him, in
							which he says the men cannot be delivered up; but thinks we may offer to
							have the trial delayed, if desired, for the attendance of witnesses from
							England. But the Supreme Court of the United States by a decision
							founded upon captious subtleties, in <persRef ref="palmer-john"
								>Palmer’s</persRef> case (3. <persRef ref="wheaton-henry"
								>Wheaton’s</persRef> Reports p. 631) cast away the Jurisdiction
							which a Law of Congress had given to the Circuit Courts in cases of
							Piracy, committed by foreigners by construing the words “any person or
							persons” to mean only Citizens of the United States— Their reasoning is
							a sample of judicial logic—disingenuous, false, and hollow— A Logic so
							abhorrent to my nature, that it gave me an early disgust to the practice
							of the Law, and led me to the unalterable determination never to accept
							a judicial Office. In this case, if human language means anything;
							Congress had made general Piracy, by whomsoever, and wheresoever upon
							the high Seas committed, cognizable by the Circuit Courts—the Law has
							been in force, from the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April 1790.
							Foreign Pirates, for piracies committed in foreign vessels have been
							tried and hung, by its authority, and now, the Supreme Court have <pb
								type="ms" n="108"/>discovered that any person or persons means only
							Citizens of the United States, and that Piracy committed by foreigners
							in foreign vessels is not punishable by the Laws of the United States—
							At the last Session of Congress a new Act was passed to patch over this
							enormous hole in the moral garment of this Nation made by this desperate
							thrust of the Supreme Court, and general piracy was made expressly
							punishable by the Circuit Court; but the exploits of the Louisa and her
							Crew were achieved before the passage of this Act, and cannot be tried
							under it— The charges upon which the men of her crew are in prison at
							Charleston, must therefore be for piracies committed against Citizens of
							the United States, and it is scarcely probable that the witnesses in
							England can testify to them— I wrote however to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Antrobus, coming as near to the President’s ideas as I
							could. And I wrote to the <persRef ref="thompson-smith">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef>, requesting an order to the <persRef
								ref="steele-john">Collector at Philadelphia</persRef>, for the free
							admission of the goods. <persRef ref="nourse-joseph">M<hi

							be obtained, one from the Department of State— I told them I would have

						<p><date>16. V:</date> The rain continued all this morning; when it held up
							I walked to the Potowmack Bridge, and viewed the spot where I frequently
							bathed last Summer. After dinner I took another half hour’s walk with
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"

							to <persRef ref="smith-john">John A. Smith</persRef>, and in delving
							into the Convention Journals and papers. They are to be printed by
								<persRef ref="waite-thomas">T. Wait</persRef> at Boston, which I now
							find to be cause of some inconvenience— From the examination of all the
							papers that I have collected, it is apparent that the usefulness of the
							publication will depend altogether upon their arrangement— When the
							Convention adjourned they passed a Resolution that their Journals and
							papers, which had been kept by <persRef ref="jackson-william">Major
								William Jackson</persRef> their Secretary; should be delivered to
							their <persRef ref="washington-george">President, Washington</persRef>,
							to be kept by him, subject to the future order of Congress, after the
							Constitution should go into operation— Washington kept them till the
								19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March 1796. when he deposited
							them in the Department of State; where they have remained till this
							time— A Resolution of Congress of 27. March 1818. directed that they,
							together with the secret Journals of the old Congress and their foreign
							Correspondence, to the Peace of 1783. except such parts of it as the
							President, may think it improper now to publish, should be printed under
							the direction of the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>— He
							devolved this duty upon me; but the Books and papers deposited by
							President Washington, were so imperfect, and in such disorder, that to
							have published them as they were, would have given to the public a Book
							useless, and in many respects inexplicable— It happened that <persRef
								ref="bloomfield-joseph">General Bloomfield</persRef>, a member of
							Congress from New Jersey, as Executor of the Will of <persRef
								ref="brearley-david">David Brearley</persRef>, one of the members of
							the Convention, had come to the possession of his papers; among which
							were several very important ones, relating to the proceedings of the
							Convention— He sent them all to me— The Journal itself was imperfect,
							and the Journal of the last two days was wanting. I wrote to <persRef
								ref="madison-james">President Madison</persRef>, and obtained from
							him the means of completing it. There was a plan of Constitution,
							mentioned on the Journals as having been proposed by <persRef
								ref="pinckney-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								Pinckney</persRef> of South-Carolina— I wrote to him, and <pb
								type="ms" n="111"/>obtained a copy of that— With all these papers
							suitably arranged, a correct and tolerably clear view of the proceedings
							of the Convention may be presented, but there is one great and
							irreparable defect. In the printed Journals of the old Congress the yeas
							and nays appear nominally as well as by States, although the votes were
							taken by States— So they were in the Convention; but the yeas and nays
							shew only the votes of States, and not of the individual members— Copies
							of the Journals, and of most of the papers were sent last Autumn to
							Wait, at Boston; but I had not time to examine and collate the whole;
							and I did not dare trust the task to any one else; I have now nearly
							gone through it, and have settled the mode of publication; but to carry
							it into effect I must have again all the papers that have been sent to
							Wait— There is also one paper wanting; to be collected from the
							Resolutions scattered over the Journal from 19. June to 23. July 1787. I
							began this day to prepare it.</p>

							returning from Charleston where he saw the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> to Portsmouth, at which place he is stationed.
							He said the President had spoken to him of the intended mission of a
							naval Officer to South America. I said when the President had given
							directions for the mission he had in the first instance thought of
							offering it to him: but thinking that from the state of his health he
							would not be able to go, the <persRef ref="thompson-smith">Secretary of
								the Navy</persRef>, when he went to New-York, had been directed to
							propose it to Captain Perry who had accepted. He said the President had
							told him the same; except that he did not know of the acceptance of
								<persRef ref="perry-oliver">Captain Perry</persRef>. Morris added
							that if Perry should not go, he should be willing to undertake it, as
							the state of his health was improved, and the climate of Buenos-Ayres,
							might be serviceable to it— He goes to morrow for Portsmouth. <persRef
								ref="way-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Way</persRef> came,
							and I agreed with him for the purchase of his house in F. Street, if I
							find the title satisfactory. He is to send me his Deed to-morrow, and we
							agreed upon the terms— <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> D. Brent</persRef> offered also to
							sell me his house in which I now live— I proceeded in the examination of
							the accounts of the Department for contingent expences. They have been
							kept in a very loose and slovenly manner—a deficiency in the
							appropriations has hence arisen every year, principally from an
							inadequate appropriation every year for publishing the Laws in the
							Newspapers. I directed <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef> to procure an Account
							Book, and beginning with the year 1817. when I entered the Department,
							open an account for every separate appropriation placed under the
							direction of the Department of State. Marking—first the amount of every
							annual or occasional appropriation— Secondly, every receipt, under such
							appropriation by the Letters from the Secretary of State to the <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>,
							requesting warrants to issue upon the appropriation—and thirdly every
							payment made to balance these receipts— Thus the receipts the payments
							and the appropriations must all balance one another; and in case of any
							excess or deficiency its cause will immediately be seen— I also directed
								<persRef ref="colvin-john">Colvin</persRef> who has the publication
							of the Laws in the Newspapers under his direction, to insert a paragraph
							in the next circular Letter of Appointment; directing each printer as
							soon as he has completed the publication of the Laws and Treaties of the
							Session, to give notice of it in the Paper, and with that paper to send
							his account for Settlement— It seems to me that a regular system for
							keeping the accounts of expenditures under the direction of the
							Department may be easily established, and made extremely simple; but for
							want of it, I have been groping nearly two years, without knowing the
							State of the Accounts, or the causes of the confusion in them— I made

							preparing a Letter and Documents for <persRef ref="fromentin-eligius">E.

								Perry</persRef>. Finished the first sketches of both; but the latter
							must be revised, and I am not satisfied with my work upon it— There is
							want of method and great diffuseness, with many repetitions in it. In
							writing State Papers at present, I constantly feel like the Grecian
							Orator, who said he had not time to make his Speech short— The pen
							always overflows, with the first tide of a copious subject; and then to
							organize and arrange, to add a little and to erase much, which is
							necessary for all correct and polished composition, consumes more time
							than to write the first draught. With the pressure of business at the
							Office, I have not now that time to spare. I must strike off all my
							papers at <pb type="ms" n="113"/>a heat— They are therefore redundant
							and at the same time deficient; a fault aggravated in this case of the
							draught for Perry, because he is to go to two places, with the same
							errand to both, but with differences of detail. And as the nature of the
							case required an argumentative despatch, I was obliged to put half the
							reasoning, in one part of it, and half in the other— The argument was
							thus weakened both by division and by repetitions. In a second draught I
							could compress the matter, strike-out the repetitions, and concentrate
							in one, all the scattered fragments of argument; but I have not time to
							make it— The Journal and the Ledger of mercantile accounts, present the
							analogy of the process of elaborate composition— I also pursued further
							the investigation of the Department accounts, for the last four or five
							years. The French Minister <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef>, called upon me to enquire what foundation there
							was for a rumour circulated and repeated in the Newspapers, of a cession
							by Spain of the Island of Cuba to Great-Britain. I did not believe it,
							and thought the Report merely a political or a commercial speculation,
							or both— Yet there has been some mysterious Negotiation between Spain
							and England, about Cuba, the secret of which is not yet unfolded— De
							Neuville had written to me, to enquire the cause of the imprisonment of
							a Frenchman, at Fort Washington— I referred his Letter to the War
							Department, and <persRef ref="parker-daniel">General Parker</persRef>,
							the Inspector General answered that the man had enlisted in the army,
							and was in prison to be tried by a Court-Martial for desertion. De
							Neuville said <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef> had promised him that no more Frenchman should be
							enlisted in our military service— He spoke again about the project of a
							consular Convention, or a Commercial Treaty. I am as soon as possible to
							examine this subject— We spent the Evening, at a tea-party at <persRef
								ref="carroll-unknown2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							without fire in my writing room; but suffered much for the want of

							Journal: days of continual and unexpected interruptions, by persons
							successively calling at the Office; and by a multitude of Letters and
							voluminous despatches, received from various quarters— It is <hi
								rend="italic">distraction</hi>, of the character which <persRef
								ref="rush-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> in
							his work upon the mind, describes as naturally leading to madness. It is
							a distressing state, which always reminds me of that Scene in <persRef
								ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear’s</persRef> Henry the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> where the Prince and Poins amuse
							themselves in bewildering Francis, the Drawer— When I came to the Office
							this morning, I found there <persRef ref="williamson-jonathan"
								>Lieutenant Williamson</persRef>, of the frigate United States,
							which has just arrived at Norfolk from the Mediterranean. He brought me
							a despatch from <persRef ref="shaler-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Shaler</persRef>, the Consul-General to Barbary, who was
							at Gibraltar, when the Frigate left that place 31. March. With Shaler’s
							Letters there was one from <persRef ref="folsom-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Folsom</persRef>, whom he has placed
							as Chargé d’Affaires at Tunis during the absence of the late Consul
							there, <persRef ref="anderson-thomas">Anderson</persRef>; and several
							enclosures— Lieutenant Williamson sat with me an hour; giving me
							accounts of the state of the Squadron in the Mediterranean, and of the
							Frigate United States and her voyage home. She has had a passage of 50.
							days, while a merchant vessel which sailed from Gibraltar, with her,
							arrived at Boston, in 29. He says it was owing to the difference of
							being bound to a Southern instead of an Eastern Port. A remarkable, and
							perhaps not uncommon fact— The United States, is commanded by <persRef
								ref="crane-william">Captain Crane</persRef>, who Williamson says, is
							so much liked by his crew, that although they must now be discharged the
							term of their service being expired, he is persuaded more than two
							thirds of them, after having their frolic would engage with him again— I
							asked him what number of foreigners there were among them—he said from
							45 to 50. but he did not reckon the Englishmen among the foreigners, for
							they all swore they were born in some part of the United States, and
							they could not be distinguished by their language, though the Irishmen
							might— The frigate is much decayed, and will want a thorough repair—
							When the Lieutenant left me, <persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pleasonton</persRef> came in, and gave
							me some further information respecting the state of the Department
							Accounts— He is to call again for the same purpose to-morrow— Then came
								<persRef ref="homans-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Homans</persRef>, about my Letter to the <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>; which though
							finished, I had no time to revise, and despatch for the mail of
							to-morrow Morning— The papers for <persRef ref="fromentin-eligius">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fromentin</persRef> were however
							prepared— <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef>, came to ask my advice what to do—he is summoned as a
							witness, to the Court of the United-States at Richmond, which is to sit
							next week— But he is the <pb type="ms" n="114"/>Chief Clerk in the
							Office of the Pay-master General <persRef ref="brent-robert">Robert
								Brent</persRef>, who has been nearly a year Paralytick, and Frye has
							been doing all the business of his Principal, as well as his own— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent is utterly incapable of attending to
							any business; and if Frye goes, all the important business of the pay
							office will be suspended for a week— He said it would also be very
							inconvenient also for him to leave home, on account of the situation of
							his family— I advised him, if possible to put the current business of
							the pay office in a way that the routine might be performed for a short
							time without him—and if not, to write a short Letter to the <persRef
								ref="stanard-robert">District Attorney</persRef>, and one to the
							Court, stating the Circumstances which will prevent his attendance; and
							transmit an affidavit of the facts concerning which his testimony is
							wanted. <persRef ref="lee-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								William Lee</persRef> came, upon no special business, but for
							conversation— I had despatches from <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, from <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">A. H. Everett</persRef>, and from the
							Bankers at Amsterdam, with accounts— With the interruptions of the
							visitors, I scarcely got through the reading of the Letters, when five
							O’Clock came, and I had written nothing. This is a picture of perhaps
							half the days that I pass at the Office— I went with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> to an Evening party at <persRef ref="peter-thomas"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. Peter’s</persRef> at
							Georgetown, or what they call Tudor-Place— The party consisted
							principally of Georgetown People—and the Diplomats— There was dancing of
							Cotillions— We came home about eleven O’Clock.</p>

						<p><date>24. VI:30.</date> Another wasted day; by which I understand those
							days, consumed by interruptions of visitors, and by necessary reading,
							so that I write little or nothing. As soon as I reached my Office,
								<persRef ref="homans-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Homans</persRef> came and introduced to me, <persRef
								ref="perry-oliver">Captain Oliver H. Perry</persRef>, who is to go
							upon a mixed naval and political mission to South-America. He arrived
							this morning; and is to sail from Annapolis in the John Adams; to be
							followed afterwards by the Constellation Frigate— I had a conversation
							of an hour with him upon the objects of his mission, and gave him a copy
							of my Letter to the Secretary of the Navy, upon which Perry’s
							Instructions are to be founded; and which with all the accompanying
							documents was despatched yesterday morning to <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef>, also the paper written by the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, which formed the basis of
							the Instructions— Perry mentioned several other points, upon which
							perhaps a supplementary Instruction for him may be necessary— <persRef
								ref="forbes-john">Forbes</persRef> came in from Baltimore with the
							news that the houses of <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">Smith</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="buchanan-james">Buchanan</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="hollins-john">Hollins</persRef> and <persRef

								>Didier</persRef> and <persRef ref="darcy-john">D’Arcy</persRef>,
							four Williams’s and many others this day failed— Smith and Buchanan have
							been for many years the greatest commercial house in Baltimore; the
							others have all been in immense business, but Bank Speculation is what
							has broken them down— They will undoubtedly drown numberless others with
							them— In truth the Commercial, manufacturing and agricultural interests
							of this Country are in a very distressed situation; and their prospects
							are still worse— The revenue and even the tranquility of the Union will
							be most seriously affected by it, and as always happens, the disorder of
							things will produce discord of opinions, and bitterness of political
							oppositions. The <pb type="ms" n="115"/>greatest danger is of the
							application of remedies worse than the disease— Paper money; and
							prohibitions— The political empyrics are already as busy as Spiders in
							weaving their tangles for Congress and the National Executive; I
							received this day a printed copy of the Seventh Address from the Society
							at Philadelphia, for the promotion of domestic Industry, urging a
							petition to the President, for an immediate call of Congress, to change
							the tariff and pass prohibitory Laws. It was enclosed in a printed
							letter, requesting me to peruse it very attentively which I did. I have
							read carefully all the addresses, which contain some true information;
							and some sound reasoning; mixed with misrepresentations, and
							sophistications; with obscure hints at paper money and a tempest of
							outcry for prohibitory duties, and protection to manufactures. The
							process of these publications has been artful and insidious; with after
							thoughts in every paper, successively disclosed— With elaborate
							calculation to produce impression upon the public mind. I suppose
								<persRef ref="coxe-tench">Tench Coxe</persRef> to be the author of
							the Papers, and they bear the stamp of his wily, winding, subtle and
							insidious character— Of this Petition for the Call of Congress, and the
							Call itself, we shall certainly hear more— I received a long despatch
							with enclosures from <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">Jonathan
								Russell</persRef> at Florence; and another half pamphlet from
								<persRef ref="irvine-baptis">Baptis Irvine</persRef> at Port of
							Spain, Island of Trinidad— I had barely finished reading these Papers
							when the dinner hour summoned me home— Immediately after dinner,
								<persRef ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poletica</persRef>, who arrived this day came and paid a visit to
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef>— At Noon I had received a Note from
							him, announcing his arrival and asking when I would receive him; for
							which I had appointed to-morrow at one O’Clock— He was this Evening soon
							followed by <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hyde de Neuville</persRef>, and with these visits the
							Evening passed away— Poletica says, that he has nothing to trouble us
							with—that he is charged only with the most cordial and earnest
							assurances of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperors</persRef> regard
							and friendship for the United States— That the Emperor was extremely
							solicitous to be on the best terms with us, and said to him just before
							he left him at Aix la Chapelle,—“Je crains que nous n’ayons perdu un peu
							de terrain la-bas”— I assured him; that we retained all our respect, and
							friendly disposition for the Emperor, and should do every thing in our
							power to promote the best Harmony with his Government— We had much
							conversation upon the general state of European Politics; and upon the
							Affairs of France. Both Poletica and De Neuville discovered their
							principles— De Neuville’s hobby horse is a democratic-royale—universal
							suffrage and the Charter— Poletica’s is a Gouvernement paternel— A wise
							and good absolute Sovereign and a happy and submissive people—“Tout pour
							le Peuple; et rien par le Peuple,” is his maxim— Such are the
							compromises which the partizans of despotism, are compelled to make with
							the prevailing Spirit of the age. Poletica says the new Ministers in
							France, are well pleased with de Neuville, and wish him to remain here—
							I urged him again, not to go this year; but he said he must persist in
							his resolution—chiefly on account of personal and family affairs—</p>

						<p><date>26. V:15.</date> Finished the first draught of an advertisement to
							be prefixed to the publication of the Journals of the Convention of
							1787. and the list of the members— On the way to the office I met
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef>, the Attorney General, who made some enquiries, as to
							the state of our Negotiation with Spain— Paragraphs are creeping into
							the newspapers, hinting that the Government of the United States, were
							imposed upon in the Florida-Treaty; that after it was signed, it was
							discovered that eight Millions of Acres of Lands had been granted by the
							king of Spain, which were confirmed by the Treaty— That after the
							discovery I called upon <persRef ref="onis-luis">Don Onis</persRef>, for
							an explanation of such conduct; when the crafty Don answered that a
							bargain was a bargain—that all the grants were confirmed by the Treaty;
							and that the grantees did not let him into their Secrets— That this was
							the cause of despatching the special Messenger immediately after the
							bearer of the Treaty, and that the Government at Washington hope, the
							Treaty will not be ratified in Spain— This first appeared, about this
							day last week in the Boston Centinel, and is now circulating in the
							newspapers throughout the Continent— The real facts, of which this is a
							malignant distortion, have been known to so many persons, nearly three
							Months, that I have been surprized to see nothing about it in the
							newspapers before— Where it came from now, I cannot tell. I told Wirt
							the facts, as they are— I have little apprehension with regard to the
							ultimate result; and am not without hope it will eventually prove more
							advantageous to my Country, than if no such incident had occurred. But
							in the mean time, I expect it will prove extremely troublesome, and
							especially to me— I spoke to Wirt about the acquittal at Baltimore of
							the <persRef ref="danel-john">Pirate Daniels</persRef>— His case went
							off upon a legal quibble— Wirt says it is because the Judges are two
							weak, though very good old men; who suffer themselves to be bullied and
							brow-beaten by <persRef ref="pinkney-william">Pinkney</persRef>. I told
							him, that I thought it was Law-Logic—an artificial system of reasoning,
							exclusively used in Courts of Justice, but good for nothing any where
							else— This acquittal of Daniels is a notable sample of it— He was
							indicted under an act of Congress to preserve the neutral relations of
							the United States, of 3. March 1817. which act was on its face, limited
							to two years duration— By an act of 20. April 1818. it was with several
							others repealed, by a general Law substituted instead of them all—with a
							proviso that prosecutions might be commenced and carried on for offences
							committed against it, as if it had not been repealed— Now Pinckney’s
							quibble was that if it had not been repealed, it would have expired by
							its limitation— If it had expired, no prosecution could now have been
							commenced or continued now, for any offence committed under it— The
							Court admitted this as sound reasoning; considered it a plain case; and
							discharged Daniels— The source of all this pettifogging is that out of
							judicial Courts, the end of human reasoning is truth, or justice; but in
							them it is <hi rend="italic">Law</hi>.— Ita lex scripta est, and there
							is no reply— Hence it is my firm belief that if instead of the long
							robes of Judges, and the long speeches of lawyers, the suitors of every
							question debated in the Courts between individuals, were led blindfold
							up to a Lottery Wheel, and there bidden to draw, each of them one of two
							tickets, one marked RIGHT and the other WRONG, and Execution should
							issue according to the sentence of the wheel, more substantial Justice
							would be done, than is now dispensed by Courts of Law. In criminal
							cases, by the humanity of the Law, which is indeed its best and most
							amiable feature, the chances in favour of the culprit are multiplied,
							and when the subtlety and the Passions of the judges combine in their
							favour, no criminal can be brought to Justice and punishment— At the
							office, I had a visit from <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Poletica</persRef>, who told me that
							he was about writing to his Government, and should be glad to give any
							information that I should be willing to com-<pb type="ms" n="117"
							/>communicate respecting our Treaty with Spain— He said that his
							Instructions were to promote to the utmost of his power a friendly
							arrangement of the differences which subsisted between this Country and
							Spain; and from the general acquaintance that he had with the substance
							of the Treaty, he considered it as satisfactory and advantageous to both
							Countries— But he understood there had been some question concerning
							certain grants of Land in Florida by the king of Spain; upon which there
							had been an explanation given subsequently to the signature of the
							Treaty— I told him the circumstances relating to the eighth Article of
							the Treaty as they have occurred; and observed that the Treaty was
							highly advantageous to both parties, and I trusted would prove
							satisfactory to both. That one of the views in which I considered it
							most important was its tendency to confirm the tranquility of all
							Europe; as it was impossible things should remain, in the state in which
							they were between the United States; and Spain— The Treaty or a Rupture,
							were the only alternatives. If a rupture had ensued, England could not
							have been long neutral, and England would have drawn all Europe, pro or
							con into the quarrel. He said that was exactly his own impression— He
							then said that he should wait until the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef> return, to present his Credential Letter— I
							told him that if in the meantime he had any business to transact, I
							should be happy to attend to it, as if he was already accredited. He
							said he would furnish a list of the persons attached to his Legation;
							and asked if there would be any objection to his inserting in it the
							names of <persRef ref="ivanoff-theodore">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ivanof</persRef> the Russian Consul at<space/>and of <persRef
								ref="eustaphieve-alexei">Eustaphieff</persRef> the Consul at Boston.
							As the British Government had allowed the insertion of the name of the
							Russian Consul General at London, <persRef ref="dubachevsky-andrei"
								>Dubachefsky</persRef>— I told him that in the absence of the
							President, I could not answer him positively; but as I apprehended we
							could not by law, extend the diplomatic privileges to Consuls, I thought
							it most candid to tell him so now. He said that since the affair of
								<persRef ref="kosloff-nicholas">Kosloff</persRef>, the Russian
							Consuls had in fact been attached to the Department of foreign Affairs,
							and wore the same uniform that he did— That by this insertion of their
							names, on the list of his Legation, he should make himself responsible
							for their conduct; which he could safely do, for M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Ivanof—though as to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Eustaphieff, he was <hi rend="italic">an author</hi>— I told him that
							besides the inconvenience of allowing a precedent, which all the other
							foreign Consuls would immediately claim for themselves, there was a
							difficulty in our double jurisdictions; the exclusive authority of the
							General Government being confined to the District of Columbia. I
							promised however to submit the point to the consideration of the
							President after his return— I received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="vanness-cornelius">C. P. Van Ness</persRef> the Commissioner
							under the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Article of the Treaty of
							Ghent, with nine or ten enclosures— He has quarreled with <persRef
								ref="hassler-ferdinand">Hassler</persRef> the Astronomer, just at
							the moment when the operations for the year are to commence, about his
							Salary, and now writes to ask me what he is to do? I had thus again at

						<p><date>27. IV:30.</date> I called this morning at <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford’s</persRef> Office, to consult with him, upon what is to be
							done, to obtain an astronomer for the Commission, under the fifth
							Article of the Treaty of Ghent in the room of <persRef
								ref="hassler-ferdinand">Hassler</persRef>— Crawford’s opinion of
							Hassler is, that although a man of Mathematical and Astronomical
							Science, he is practically a very inefficient man; a mere mill-clapper
							of babbling, enormously extravagant in his demands, and troublesome by
							his indiscretions; and tiresome by his Correspondence— His conduct on
							this occasion has been so provoking, his demands so exorbitant, his tone
							so dictatorial, and his procedure withal so crafty, that I could not
							think of submitting to his terms. After full conversation with Crawford,
							I determined to write to <persRef ref="ellicott-andrew">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellicott</persRef> at West-Point,
							requesting him to undertake the business, and to <persRef
								ref="thayer-sylvanus">Major Thayer</persRef>, the commanding Officer
							at the Academy, asking his assent that Ellicott should go. I wrote to
							them accordingly, and enclosed the Letters open, with my Answer to the
								<persRef ref="vanness-cornelius">Commissioner Van Ness</persRef>— I
							had also some Conversation with Crawford on the present situation and
							prospects of the Country, which are alarming— The banking bubbles are
							breaking— The staple productions of the soil, constituting our principal
							articles of export are falling to half and less than half the prices
							which they have lately borne; the merchants are crumbling to ruin, the
							manufactures perishing, Agriculture stagnating, and distress universal
							in every part of the Country— The revenue has not yet been, but must
							very sensibly and <pb type="ms" n="118"/>very soon be affected by this
							state of things; for which there seems to be no remedy but time and
							patience; and the changes of events which time effects. Crawford shewed
							me his last Bank returns, which are as large as usual, and the condition
							of the Treasury, is daily improving— But there will be a great falling
							off in the revenue of the next year. At the Office, <persRef
								ref="perry-oliver">Captain Perry</persRef> called again, but I have
							not yet received his Papers, back from the <persRef ref="thompson-smith"
								>Secretary of the Navy</persRef>. <persRef ref="levy-n">M<hi

							have refused to receive, has lately returned to this Country, and came
							this day to the Office— He says that S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Thomas is the focus of smuggling of the Slave-trade, and of piratical
							privateers— He is nevertheless anxious to go back, if the Danish
							Government will recognize him, even as the deputy of <persRef

						<p><date>28. V:</date> I resumed this morning the examination of papers, for
							the preparation of a Report to the Senate, upon Weights and measures. At
							this Season of the year, if at any, I might expect to have leisure, or
							at least some controul of my own time— But I look forward from day to
							day for it, with almost constant disappointment— I called this day upon
								<persRef ref="anderson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Anderson</persRef>, the Comptroller of the Treasury, and asked him
							to attend to the adjustment of my Accounts during my last Missions in
							Europe— He said he had hitherto been prevented from taking them up by
							the pressure of other business, but promised to begin upon them as soon
							as possible. At the Office <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Poletica</persRef> came, and
							introduced <persRef ref="lomonosoff-sergie">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lomonossof</persRef>, as attached to the Legation. He
							made some further enquiries, concerning the late Treaty with Spain; and
							also what explanations had taken place between this Government and that
							of Great-Britain, concerning the execution of <persRef
								ref="arbuthnot-alexander">Arbuthnott</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="ambrister-robert">Ambrister</persRef>. He said that since his
							conversations with <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> de Neuville</persRef> and me here, he
							had corrected some particulars of what he had written to his Government,
							from Philadelphia about the Treaty. He had understood that <persRef
								ref="onis-luis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis</persRef> had
							given the impression, that by the letter of the Treaty, the grants of
							Lands to the <persRef ref="alagon-unknown">Duke of Alagon</persRef>, and
							others were confirmed—though Onis added it was his wish that his
							Government should ratify it with the explanation— I told him that I
							would in strict confidence shew him the Treaty itself, and gave him one
							of the original copies of it, with permission to take a copy of it,
							solely for the purpose of communicating it to his Government. He took it
							accordingly, and will return it, in a day or two. I told him also, all
							that had taken place between us and the British Government with regard
							to the execution of the two Englishmen; till the last Declaration of
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> to
								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef>, that the British Cabinet, upon full Consideration
							had come to the determination to make no representation to the
							Government of the United States upon the subject— I gave him a copy of
							the pamphlet containing my Letter of 28. November last to <persRef
								ref="erving-george">G. W. Erving</persRef>, and the documents
							supporting it; and promised him another— He said it was formerly the
							custom to give three copies of all the documents to each of the foreign
							Ministers— But now we have not copies of a tenth part of the documents
							of the two houses of Congress for the use of the Department itself. In
							allowing him to take a copy of the Treaty, I have shewn him an unusual
							mark of confidence, with a view to its effect upon himself, but still
							more upon the Emperor. It is only a slight anticipation, for whether
							ratified in Spain or not, the Treaty must be published here, at least
							upon the next Meeting of Congress. As the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef> has evidently taken considerable interest, in the
							late events of our Relations with Spain, and wished that they might be
							amicably settled, it is important to satisfy him as early as possible of
							the fairness and Justice of our proceedings, and that if Spain now
							refuses the ratification of the Treaty, it will be in her own wrong.
							There is no doubt great delicacy, and sometimes danger in bestowing
							diplomatic Confidence; but crafty and fraudulent, as the trade has the
							reputation of being, I give it as the result of all my experience, that
							Confidence judiciously and cautiously bestowed, is one of the most
							powerful and efficacious instruments of negotiation. My prepossessions
							are not favourable to Poletica; but yet I think it good and safe policy
							to attempt in the first instance to win him by kindness; and
							particularly as while it will tend to recommend him to his own
							Sovereign, it will also tend to cultivate the friendly disposition of
							his Sovereign towards us— Another visitor this day was <persRef
								ref="almeida-joseph">Captain José Almeida</persRef>, Captain of the
							late Baltimore piratical privateer Louisa— He is now Captain of another
							Louisa Carseras, a Spanish Brig which he took, in the other Louisa;
							carried into the Island of Margarita; there took a clearance as a
							merchant vessel, armed with ten guns, and came to Baltimore with a
							Cargo, which he sold. He is now ready to sail, and has been libelled in
							the district Court, as fitting out for a cruize under <persRef
								ref="artigas-jose">Artigas</persRef> Colours against Spanish <pb
								type="ms" n="119"/>and Portuguese Property. He came here to obtain
							an order to the <persRef ref="glenn-elias">District Attorney</persRef>,
							to enter a nolle prosequi, and let him go. He went first to the <persRef
								ref="anderson-joseph">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, who
							referred him to me— He is a native of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Michael’s one of the Azore Islands; consequently born a subject of
							Portugal, and is very indignant at the charge of intending to take
							Portuguese Property, and among his papers brought a certificate from
								<persRef ref="swift-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Swift</persRef> the Portuguese Consul at Baltimore that he had never
							heard of Almeida’s having taken any such— He is a rough, open-looking,
							jovial Jack-tar, who can neither write nor read, but says that he lived
							sixteen years in Baltimore before our late War with England; during
							which he commanded one or more privateers out of Baltimore, and took
							many British vessels, which gave him a taste for privateering—but that
							after the Peace he went in a merchant vessel to Carthagena, where he was
							taken by the Spanish. They confiscated his property, and cruelly abused
							and maltreated his person—even to beating him— That he determined to
							have satisfaction of them, and so made himself a South-American. Went
							and commanded a Buenos-Ayrean brig of War of which he shewed me the
							Commission; and then fitted out his privateer Louisa at Buenos-Ayres;
							and with her on the Ocean took this Spanish vessel, which he now
							commands— He went himself on board the prize, leaving the privateer,
							commanded by his first Officer— It was from him that the crew took the
							vessel; turned pirates, and went and plundered the Isle of May, and many
							foreign vessels; after which they stranded and burnt her, off Charleston
							South Carolina. He with his prize, cleared her out from Margarita as a
							merchant vessel and came to Baltimore— Here at the instigation of the
							Spanish Consul she was seized, and he was obliged to give bail for
							himself and bonds for the vessel—and now just as he is ready to sail
							without any additional armament, and only eleven men, the vessel is
							libelled again, upon the information of the same man named <persRef
								ref="southerland-unknown">Southerland</persRef>, who had informed
							against him before— He had no doubt if I would give him a line to the
							district Attorney M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Glenn, he would let him
							go; but otherwise he should have to give a thousand dollars to a lawyer
							to get him off; and he did not like to do that, as he was now rather
							short of money. I told him I was sorry I could not help him; as I could
							not possibly judge of the evidence upon which the vessel had been
							libelled— He went off saying without any appearance of ill humour, that
							he must then go back as he came. He did not appear to be conscious in
							the slightest degree that he had been doing any thing wrong— Just so it
							is with the Slave traders— <persRef ref="homans-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Homans</persRef> brought me the papers
							for <persRef ref="perry-oliver">Captain Perry</persRef>, which have been
							sent back by the <persRef ref="thompson-smith">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef>, with scarcely an additional line. Perry will now be
							despatched in two days. I received also, from <persRef
								ref="waite-thomas">Wait</persRef> at Boston, all the Manuscript
							which had been sent to him relating to the Convention Journals—likewise
							a long despatch of 4. March with several voluminous documents from G. W.
							Erving— Very unpromising for the fate of the Treaty— Thus was another
							day eroded and I wrote nothing— With <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> I attended an evening
							party at <persRef ref="middleton-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Middleton’s</persRef>— Poletica told me that the <persRef
									ref="annapavlovna">Grand Duchess Anne</persRef> was to have married
							the <persRef ref="artois-charles2">Duke de Berry</persRef> in 1814. but
							the match broke off, on the refusal to allow her a private Greek church
							chapel. She has since married the <persRef ref="william-ii">Prince of
								Orange</persRef>, a Protestant—much to the mortification, says
							Poletica, of the Bourbons.</p>

						<p><date>29. VI:</date> Despatches from Mogadore, from Tripoli, and from the
							Island of Bermuda— <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Poletica</persRef>, brought back the
							copy of the Treaty, which I had lent him, and also copies of some of his
							Instructions; and one of the Protocols of the Congress at Aix-La
							Chapelle— It simply establishes the principle that the allied Powers
							will hereafter consider a Resident, as an intermediate rank in
							diplomatic etiquette, between Ministers of the second order, and chargés
							d’Affaires; and that they will communicate to one another, their
							respective regulations upon the subject of Salutes by Ships of War, in
							order to agree upon some definitive general rule to be observed by all.
							Poletica observed that he had communicated this Protocol, to <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef>; who had heard nothing of it— But he observed
							that as <persRef ref="greuhm-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Greuhm</persRef> is here with the character of Minister Resident
							from Prussia, and had not been officially informed of this new
							regulation, if he should feel any reluctance to complying with it, he
							Poletica would very cheerfully yield the precedence to him— One of the
							Instructions that he gave me to read was from the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef> himself— It was in the
							nature of a circular upon leaving Aix La Chapelle to all his Ministers
							in foreign Countries, and its principal object was to direct them every
							where to discountenance the idea, the <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was the
							founder of the system of the European Alliance, which he says the
							enemies of the system <pb type="ms" n="120"/>industriously circulate
							with bad intentions. He says that the system arose from the course of
							Events, and the necessities of the times: that all were parties and all
							the allied Sovereigns equally entitled to the credit of it— In this
							instruction there is something of the Emperor’s sagacity; something of
							his humility, and something of his vanity; for Alexander’s humility is
							politic—and he is not a little vain of it— The instruction which he
							takes the pains of writing with his own hands, relates entirely to his
							own person; and his Ministers in complying with it, could not fail to
							set forth by a due commentary upon this wonderful self denial, and
							lowly-mindedness of their master the transcendent excellence of his
							character. The other Instructions were from the Russian Ministry, and
							related to various topics—one the affairs of Spain and South America;
							and another concerning those of the United States and Spain— Poletica is
							charged by all the means in his power, to promote an amicable
							arrangement of the latter; but no opinion is given as to the merits of
							the controversy— Some apprehension is expressed that the Government of
							the United States, yielding to popular clamours will have recognized the
							Independence of some of the South-American Colonies, before he arrives
							here; but if not, his orders are to use all his endeavours, with every
							suitable deference to this Government, to dissuade them from such an act
							of hostility to Spain— He is also instructed to use his powers of
							persuasion to prevail upon the Government of the United States, not to
							associate itself with the European Alliance, but to pursue a course of
							policy in harmony with them; hinting that a contrary course of policy
							could not be carried into effect; and that the United States whether
							willing or not, must follow the impulse of Europe combined— All this he
							communicated to me, not officially, but in perfect confidence, in return
							for that with which I had communicated to him the copy of the Treaty
							with Spain— I entered into a long conversation with him upon these
							various topics which is to be resumed hereafter. I assured him again of
							the unabated friendly disposition of this Government towards the
							Emperor; and of our earnest desire without being associated with the
							European Alliance, to pursue a course of policy entirely in harmony with
							theirs— That we were deeply penetrated with the importance of preserving
							the general tranquility of the World, and had contributed our earnest
							efforts to it so far, as it depended upon ourselves. That as to our
							differences with Spain, he had upon his arrival here found them amicably
							adjusted; subject only to the ratification of the <persRef
								ref="ferdinand-vii">King of Spain</persRef>. That in agreeing to
							that Treaty we had made very important sacrifices of our own claims, for
							the sake of an amicable arrangement— Things had come to such a pass,
							that the only alternative was a Treaty or a rupture. If the king of
							Spain should ratify the Treaty, with the explanation to be given by
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Forsyth</persRef> at the Exchange of the Ratifications, there was no
							prospect of any interruption to the general tranquility by any relations
							of ours; but it was my private opinion, that if the king of Spain should
							decline or delay the ratification of the Treaty, Congress would at their
							next Session, authorize the occupation of the Florida’s, and probably
							there would be a recognition, at least of the Government of
							Buenos-Ayres— I wished him to give this information to his Government— I
							related to him all that has been done by us concerning the
							South-American question— Told him we were convinced that Buenos-Ayres at
							least would maintain her Independence of Spain— That sooner or later
							they must be recognized as an Independent power— That we had thought the
							time would before now have arrived when they might justly claim this as
							a right, but that from the time when we learnt that the allies had
							determined whatever might be the event of their mediation, not to use
							force against the South-Americans, the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> had concluded that we might also forbear to
							take an immediate decisive part in their favour. He said there was
							doubtless a difference of opinion between us, on this matter— That
							possibly Buenos-Ayres might in the end be able totally to throw off the
							yoke of Spain, but that they were not competent to establish a regular
							and independent Government of their own. However he declared in the most
							positive and solemn manner, that Russia had no special alliance, or
							peculiarly intimate connection with Spain— That the Emperor was utterly
							averse to all exclusive or partial alliances, and he had no particular
							engagements with Spain— The ships sent to Cadix had been merely sold—a
							dear bargain; and without any intention of the Emperor to take side with
							Spain in her quarrel with the Colonies. Though he, Poletica, had not
							approved of that transaction— He promised hereafter to shew me all the
							Protocols that he had, of the Conferences at Aix La Chapelle— The hour
							of five stole upon our Conversation, which we agreed to resume at a
							future day— There was a heavy thunder shower, and I rode home— We had an
							Evening tea-party and dancing of Cotillions, at our house; about sixty
							persons came, and as many more were <pb type="ms" n="121"/>prevented
							from coming, by the weather. Poletica asked me this Evening, what style
							of address he should use, in writing official Notes or Letters— I told
							him, without giving any titles of honour, either to the President, or
							the Secretary of State— He said he had always been aware that the title
							of His Excellency was not suitable to the President; but he had observed
							it was given here to the Governors of the States, and it was every where
							given in Europe to the Officers corresponding to our Heads of
							Departments— I told him the Governors of the States were Excellencies,
							by the State Constitutions, but that the Constitution of the United
							States recognized no titles of honour, in the Officers appointed under
							it; and that our point of honour consisted in the exclusion of all such
							titles— “Praefulgebant Cassius atque Brutus, eo ipso, quod effigies
							eorum non visebantur.”</p>

							at Chess with <persRef ref="lomonosoff-sergie">Lomonossof</persRef>— I
							had some conversation with Crawford upon the state of Affairs, and the
							late Events in Baltimore— The House of <persRef ref="smith-samuel2"
								>Smith</persRef> and <persRef ref="buchanan-james"
								>Buchanan</persRef>, which has been these thirty years one of the
							greatest commercial Establishments in the United States, broke last
							week, with a crash which staggered the whole City of Baltimore, and will
							extend, no one knows how far— Buchanan, one of the partners, was
							President, and <persRef ref="mcculloch-james">M’Culloh</persRef> a
							creature of the house Cashier of the United States Branch Bank there.
							The affairs of the House appear to have been desperate for many years—
							But they were Tyrian Merchants—Princes—and princely expedients have they
							taken to save themselves from sinking— Their speculations in the United
							States Bank were to the amount of several hundreds of thousands of
							dollars, and have proved ruinous— But Buchanan and M’Culloh have used
							the funds of the Bank, as if they were their own— The Congressional Bank
							Committee of the last Session made a partial discovery of this state of
							Affairs, and it was found that the debts of the house to the Bank were
							enormous— <persRef ref="cheves-langdon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cheves</persRef> the new President of the Bank, pursued the research
							and found there were immense debts of the President and Cashier, not
							secured— He obtained such security as he could, and then the Board of
							Directors at Philadelphia, removed M’Culloh the cashier at Baltimore.
							For a day or two there was great blustering in the Baltimore newspapers,
							as if the grossest injustice had been done to M’Culloh; but the mine was
							blown up— Buchanan the President of the Branch resigned, and a debt of
							nine hundred thousand dollars, appears against the connection, little
							more than one half of which is even supposed to be effectually secured.
							General Smith is reported to have gone distracted, and to be confined
							dangerously ill in bed. This explosion has brought on others—the
							failures are numerous, and for heavy sums— The Presidents and Cashiers
							of other Banks have been playing the same game as Buchanan and M’Culloh—
							One Bank has suspended its payments; but is paying off its Bill of less
							than five dollars— The Cashier of another has been removed, and there
							have been runs upon several, more or less severe which they have
							hitherto been able to meet. The moral, political and commercial
							character of this City of Baltimore, has for twenty five years been
							formed, controuled and modified almost entirely by this House of Smith
							and Buchanan, their connections and dependents— It may be added that
							there is not a city in the Union, which has had so much apparent
							prosperity; or within which there has been such complication of
							profligacy.</p>

							plan of Constitution, proposed by <persRef ref="hamilton-alexander"
								>Alexander Hamilton</persRef> of New-York. At the time when the

							Magistrate, and of the members of the Senate should be during good
							behaviour, which of course in ordinary cases is a tenure for life— It
							seems Hamilton did not formally propose this as a plan for discussion,
							but read it; as part of a Speech— I wrote this Evening to <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef>
							and enquired on what debate and when the Speech was delivered—with a
							view to print the paper, immediately after the Journal of the day. At
							the Office, <persRef ref="perry-oliver">Commodore Perry</persRef>
							called, and I had a further long Conversation with him, upon his
							contemplated voyage to Venezuela, and Buenos-Ayres. I saw by the
							Newspapers this Evening that <persRef ref="irvine-baptis">B.
								Irvine</persRef> who was sent to Angostura has returned, and arrived
							at Philadelphia. I suppose this will make a new set of Instructions
							necessary for Perry. I was writing to <persRef ref="campbell-george">G.
								W. Campbell</persRef>, and to <persRef ref="pederson-peter"
								>Pedersen</persRef> the Danish Minister here; and as they must both
							be long Letters, I finished neither— There was a long and heavy thunder
							shower this Evening; the third, in three successive days. I received a
							remarkable Letter from <persRef ref="noah-mordecai">M. M.
							Noah</persRef>, enclosing one to him, dated 12 March last at Madrid from
								<persRef ref="keene-richard">Richard Raynal Keene</persRef>.</p>

						<!-- This is a summary entry without a date.-->
						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> Generally the same as the last Month— The diary, being
							of little comparative importance has been abridged, but not enough— No
							arrears have been suffered to encroach upon it; but it has occupied too
							large a portion of time. I should have risen at the average hour of
							five; perhaps even earlier, had not a new fit of giving evening parties
							seized upon the people here, and they consider it as a sort of affront,
							if I do not attend them when invited. The average rising hour has
							nevertheless been as early as half past five. From this to Noon is the
							time which I employ most to my own satisfaction; for that from Noon till
							five in the Evening which I spend at my Office, is hurly-burly; that is
							I can never determine before-hand what I shall attend to: the mail and
							visitors of each day usually absorbing all its Office-hours— The
							newspapers now engross the Evening when I spend it at home, and I have
							entirely ceased writing after dinner, for the Season— My progress in all
							important business is excessively slow, and arrears of correspondence
							accumulate till the correspondent is forgotten, and never answered— I
							have many projects of reform in the organization of the Department and
							the arrangement of business, which arise and flit across my mind like
							the shadows of a phantasmagoria; but I foresee that not one of them will
							ever be executed, and that I shall leave the Office as I found it—a
							Chaos of Confusion— My will would do better—but the flesh is weak.</p>
