						<p><date>1. V:30. Friday.</date> I have much inconvenience in writing when
							at Boston; but rise with the first day-light, and this Morning wrote
							till breakfast time; which is between seven and eight O’Clock. After
							breakfast, I called, at the U.S. Branch Bank, the State Bank; and the
							Mutual Fire Insurance Company; where I took minutes of the payments on
							the former renewals of my policies, and made proposals for insurance of
							my houses in Court Street and Hancock Street— I met <persRef
								ref="parker-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Parker</persRef>, who shewed me a Letter from Baltimore, containing
							a statement of the Indictments pending there for Bank swindling, to the
							amount of three Millions of Dollars— Between eleven and twelve O’Clock,
							I went with my <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">wife</persRef>, to
							the chamber of our Sons <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> at Cambridge. They have
							the same chamber that George and <persRef ref="motte-mellish"
								>Motte</persRef> had last year— I told John what I proposed to do
							with the medal and chain given him by his <persRef ref="adams-john"
								>Grandfather</persRef>— Which is to keep the medal as a memorial of
							the giver, and to send the chain to the Mint, and have its proceeds
							vested in Stocks yielding interest, till he shall come of age: with this
							arrangement, John said he should be satisfied— We paid a wedding visit
							to <persRef ref="waterhouse-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Waterhouse</persRef>, who was married last week to <persRef
								ref="waterhouse-louisa">Miss Louisa Lee</persRef>; a Lady of
							apparently forty-five— We also visited at <persRef ref="fuller-timothy"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Timothy Fuller’s</persRef>;
							living at Cambridge-port— He is the member of Congress from the
							Middlesex District— He was confined to his bed by illness; but we saw
								<persRef ref="fuller-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Fuller</persRef>. I left the mortgage of my <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas">brother’s</persRef> Medford Place with the
							Register of Deeds <persRef ref="bartlett-unknown2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bartlett</persRef>, to be recorded— We
							returned to Boston, and dined at <persRef ref="welsh-abigail">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Welsh’s</persRef>— Her son <persRef
								ref="welsh-thomas2">Thomas</persRef> also dined <pb type="ms"
								n="177"/>there. As we sat down to dinner, I was called out by
								<persRef ref="eustis-jacob">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jacob
								Eustis</persRef>, the <persRef ref="eustis-william"
								>Doctor’s</persRef> brother, who had been in search of me all the
							Morning, and who came to ask me to enquire at Washington, why his
							Accounts, as Commissary of Supplies during the late War, were not
							settled. He said he would detain me only a moment, but kept me a full
							half-hour, talking of every thing, flying from subject to subject
							without connection or transition, and speaking in broken sentences,
							which he never gave himself time to finish— After dinner <persRef
								ref="hinckley-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hinckley</persRef> came in— He has also been in search of me these
							ten days— He had a Letter from the ex-consul <persRef
								ref="obrien-richard">O’Brien</persRef>, with whom he says he was a
							fellow prisoner at Tripoli. O’Brien had desired him to make some enquiry
							of me concerning his claims. I told him as I had often told O’Brien
							himself that Congress alone could allow them. It seems that Hinckley has
							similar claims of his own; but he said nothing to me about them— I went
							to the Athenaeum, and until dark examined the Journals of Congress, to
							complete the Supplement for the publication of the Convention Journals.
							In the Evening I passed an hour at <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman’s</persRef>, and returned for
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams at <persRef ref="welsh-thomas"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Welsh’s</persRef>— There was a
							thunder shower this Evening.</p>

							of Philadelphia, but differing entirely from the invention of <persRef
								ref="konig-fredrich">König</persRef>— As the Press was not this day
							at work, I am to see it again next Wednesday— With General Sumner, I
							inspected at Wait’s an ordinary printing Press and at the Centinel
							Office one of Clymer’s; upon the view of which Treadwell’s appeared
							manifestly an improvement upon them— My Sons <persRef ref="adams-john2"

							came into town and they, with my <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"

						<p><date>3. IV:</date> I rise an hour before day-break; yet find more

								>brother</persRef>, in consultation, for the building of a Barn, at
							the Mount Wollaston Farm— The lumber for it has been bespoken already;
							but the time and mode of completing it are objects of consideration— I
							become daily more and more aware of the necessity which is approaching
							for me, to provide for myself some permanent employment, to be
							substituted for the public duties which now absorb my time. Some
							employment which may engage my feelings, and excite a constant interest;
							leaving as few hours as possible for listlessness, repining or
							discontented broodings. Farming may perhaps answer the purpose; but my
							ignorance of it, and of every thing connected with it will prove a
							great, if not an insuperable obstacle to my success in this plan—
							Meanwhile I must leave all such things to be managed by others; my
							brother in particular, with the advice of my <persRef ref="adams-john"

						<p><date>4. V:15.</date> I had devoted this Morning to visiting my woodlots
							on my old Penn’s Hill farm; and started with my <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas">brother</persRef>, at eight O’Clock immediately
							after breakfast— We crossed the Hill, called Mount Ararat, and beyond it
							met <persRef ref="french-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Josiah
								French</persRef> who then went with us. We visited the three
							woodlots numbered 3. 5. and 6 in <pb type="ms" n="178"/>my <persRef
								ref="adams-john">father’s</persRef> deed to me of 8. August 1803.
							French pointed out to me the boundaries of them, which have never been
							well known to myself. I marked a couple of trees with an A for
							remembrance hereafter. There were on the lot N. 3, twelve trees, cedar
							and hemlock, each from 30 to 40 feet long, which had been cut down, and
							drawn together after the gale of September 1816, and have been lying
							there ever since— French and my brother think they will be good for
							timber to build the Barn; and if upon advisement with <persRef
								ref="glover-unknown">Glover</persRef> this shall be found so, French
							is to draw out the trees and take them down to the farm, as soon as the
							winter sledding shall come on. We returned by the way of my Rocky-run
							and <persRef ref="atherton-unknown">Atherton’s</persRef> pasture, after
							a walk of nearly five hours. Immediately after dinner we attended the
							examination of the children at the Quincy Grammar School; which is kept
							by <persRef ref="sever-unknown2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sever</persRef>. There were fifty two boys, and forty-nine girls—the
							examination was in reading, writing, grammar, arithmetic and Geography,
							and it was a very good exhibition of the kind— The children were all
							decently dressed; under good discipline; and answered as well upon the
							examination, as I have ever heard upon any similar occasion— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sever the teacher had promised two prizes
							for the best specimens of writing by the girls— The School-committee
							were to decide upon inspection to whom the prizes should be given. They
							found six of the copies so nearly equal in merit, that they declined
							pronouncing between them; but decided that lots should be drawn for the
							prizes, by the six— The first prize fell by the lots, which were
							prepared by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sever, and drawn by the girls
							themselves, to a <persRef ref="field-lucy">daughter</persRef> of
								<persRef ref="field-joseph">Joseph Field</persRef>, and the second

						<p><date>5. IV:30.</date> Boston. We had fixed upon this day, to take leave
							at my <persRef ref="adams-john">father’s</persRef> house in Quincy, and
							come to Boston, preparatory to our departure on our return to
							Washington— The circumstances of my private affairs, have so greatly
							changed since I made my Will on the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of
							July 1809. and particularly since I have now been here that it became in
							my own opinion indispensable to cancel that Will; and quite advisable to
							make another— But I have had so little controul of my time here that
							until this day, I had been able only to begin the draught of it, which I
							completed this Morning. I then made out a fair copy of it, ready to be
							signed sealed and witnessed; which occupied all the leisure of the day.
							It was still done in haste, and some important dispositions which
							occurred to me after the draft was finished, and which I inserted into
							the copy, led me to the reflection, that a Will should be made at a time
							of leisure; and with full deliberation; and especially that it should
							not be deferred to a death-bed— The thought which I had suggested to my
							father, and which he did not approve seemed however to me so proper for
							my own use that I resolved to prepare a schedule of all my property to
							be filed with my Will, and serve as an immediate and full indication of
							it to my Executors, in case my decease should be sudden— But I had not
							time to prepare the schedule this day. As one reflection naturally leads
							to another, some further precautions suggested themselves to me as
							proper for every person possessing a considerable Estate; and having a
							family to whom it should pass, after his death.— By the blessing of
							divine Providence, for which my heart can never be sufficiently
							grateful, my condition is now affluent; but my property is much
							scattered; much of it is very precarious and fluctuating; and it is
							burthened with a heavy debt. It will require steady attention and cool
							judgment, to be advantageously managed; and it should be put into such
							order as may prepare it for an easy settlement and distribution, when I
							shall be gone— These remarks have brought to my remembrance, that there
							is no catalogue of the library, which in 1809. I deposited at the
							Athenaeum; and no inventory of the household furniture that I have at
							Washington— <persRef ref="shaw-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Shaw</persRef> promised to have a complete Catalogue of my Books at
							the Athenaeum made out, but it never has been done— These are
							deficiencies which I must take care to have supplied— <persRef
								ref="forbes-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. M.
								Forbes</persRef> and <persRef ref="tudor-william2">W.

								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">wife</persRef>, and my son
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> I came into Boston.
							Charles went to <persRef ref="welsh-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript"

							and of a project that he has for opening one of his Schools in Boston;

							went out to my father’s house to thank him, for a Letter in his favour,

								<persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							recorded. I went with <persRef ref="sumner-william">General
								Sumner</persRef>, and saw again <persRef ref="treadwell-daniel"
								>Treadwell’s</persRef> printing Press; it was at work, and confirmed
							me in the opinion of its superiority to the ordinary presses and even to
								<persRef ref="clymer-george">Clymer’s</persRef> that I had formed
							last Saturday— <persRef ref="davis-john">Judge Davis</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="kirkland-john">President Kirkland</persRef> were
							there— At <persRef ref="waite-thomas">Wait’s</persRef> I revised two or
							three proof-sheets of the Convention Journals, and gave him the minutes
							I had drafted for the Supplement. I called at the Mutual Fire Insurance
							Office, and agreed to take the two Policies on my houses in Court
							Street, and Hancock Street, on the terms proposed by the Company— At the
							State Bank I took the Certificate of Stock, 5. Shares, which had been
							transferred to me last week by my <persRef ref="adams-thomas"
								>brother</persRef>— Dined at our lodgings, the only time since I
							have been in Boston; immediately after dinner, <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">Degrand</persRef> came, and kept me about two
							hours, in conversation, chiefly upon his own Affairs. He wants an
							appointment as Consul at some Port in France. <persRef
								ref="humphreys-anne">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Humphreys</persRef> had sent me by <persRef ref="artiguenave-joseph"
								>Artiguenave</persRef> a Message requesting me to call upon her,
							which I did this afternoon. Her object was to speak with me concerning
							the Establishment at Humphreysville, near New-Haven, Connecticut; and
							extensive Woollen Manufacture, upon which her late husband <persRef
								ref="humphreys-david">General Humphreys</persRef> expended much
							money, and made as she says heavy losses— He had connected with it;
							large farms of Merino Sheep; a village, and a school for the children
							who worked at the manufactory— It was a project upon a large scale;
							mingling purposes of benevolence, of patriotism, and of speculation for
							profit— But according to Yorick’s sarcastic remark upon the French
							character, it was better conceived than combined. Plans so gigantic and
							complicated, are not suited to the simplicity and mediocrity of Fortune
							prevailing in this Country. While the late War lasted the manufacture
							might thrive sufficiently to defray its own expences, but when Peace
							came, Humphreysville soon became a burden to its owner, which no one
							person could, and no company would take from his shoulders— M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Humphreys put into my hands several
							drafts or copies of Letters found among his papers after his decease;
							from their contents they appear to have been addressed to <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>,
							between the time of his election and inauguration as President of the
							U.S. and to another person, a member of Congress, about the same time—
							They proposed that the Government of the United States should purchase
							the whole Establishment of Humphreysville, which they represent to be
							excellently well suited for a military school or academy. This is also
							now the object of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Humphreys, who has
							been obliged to stop entirely the work at the manufactory, and to whom
							the whole establishment is a mere dead weight of expence, with the
							exception of a grist-mill and a paper-mill, which yet work— I took the
							papers with me and perused them; and soon came to the conclusion that
							this was one of the cases almost numberless, in which I can only regret
							my inability to render any essential service— In the Evening I called,
							first at <persRef ref="cruft-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cruft’s</persRef> and afterwards at <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> James H. Foster’s</persRef>— <persRef

								<persRef ref="smith-thomas">Thomas Smith</persRef>, brother of
								<persRef ref="cruft-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Cruft</persRef> were there, and went to the Circus— While I was at
							Foster’s there was a cry of fire; he immediately went out with me in
							search of it— We soon found it was at the rope-walk belonging to
								<persRef ref="lewis-winslow">Winslow Lewis</persRef>, at the bottom
							of the Common— The whole building, near 600 feet long was burnt down—
							Although erected on the Marsh, the tide being out there was no water to
							be had— There was little wind; but the fire itself, and the smoke of the
							burning tar created a draft, which raised and floated burning coals
							entirely across the Common— One of them as big as a pigeons egg fell
							close at our feet on the Common, and near its upper end— Foster went off
							to take care of his Store in Marlborough Street, which he thought was in
							danger, and I <pb type="ms" n="180"/>went to the fire. There was a great
							crowd of people, and several Engines, but only one pump from which Water
							could be drawn. There were three other Ropewalks, close by the side of
							one another; but the wind blowing from them they were all saved; with
							some damage to the one next the fire. I met <persRef ref="welsh-john"
								>John Welsh</persRef> there, and after waiting some time, and
							perceiving that we could render no service, I went with him to <persRef
								ref="welsh-thomas">his father’s</persRef> house. M<hi

						<p><date>8. IV:15.</date> A person by the name of <persRef
								ref="eayers-unknown">Eayres</persRef> came to me yesterday and again
							this morning, to request the interposition of the Government to obtain
							the liberation of <persRef ref="eayers-unknown2">his Son</persRef>, who
							is a prisoner in some of the Spanish dominions in South-America, where
							he has been these six or seven years confined. The father had two

							1817. but they did not expressly state that he was a prisoner; nor even
							distinctly where he was. I took a written minute of his case, to be
							remembered on my return to Washington. A <persRef
								ref="blanchard-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Blanchard</persRef> came with a very affecting complaint of his
							poverty and distress; to remedy which he began by asking for an office,
							and concluded with asking for a dollar. <persRef ref="hewes-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert Hewes</persRef>, sometime
							fencing master and butcher, and always a bone-setter came to inform me
							of his extraordinary talents in this last capacity. <persRef

							bone-setter, and who actually did set my Son <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George’s</persRef> shoulder when it was dislocated in 1808 Robert
							says was his uncle or cousin, and learnt from him all that he knew. It
							is a family faculty, and Robert says, a secret which will perish with
							him, unless he should publish it in a book, with plates, which would
							discover it to all the world. He came to propose that the Government of
							the United States should buy his secret of him; and also, if I should
							fall in with <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">Governor Clinton</persRef> at
							New-York, who met with an accident last year, and broke or dislocated
							his knee-pan I should tell him that Robert Hewes of Boston could make
							him whole. These visitors, detained me at home until noon, when I went
							with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and bathed, at the
							floating Sea water baths by the side of <persRef ref="craigie-andrew"
								>Craigie’s</persRef> Bridge—thence to the Athenaeum to pack up a
							chest of Books and other Articles to send to Washington— At one, I went
							with <persRef ref="hall-joseph">Joseph Hall</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="sumner-william">General Sumner</persRef>, and dined with
								<persRef ref="brooks-john">Governor Brooks</persRef> at Medford.
							There was no other Company— Soon after dinner Hall and Sumner left the
							table, to go and pay a visit to <persRef ref="bigelow-timothy">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow</persRef>, the Speaker of the
							House of Representatives of the Commonwealth. The Governor, when we were
							left tete a tete, began by asking my opinion with regard to the
							separation <pb type="ms" n="181"/>of the District of Maine from the
							State; I gave it to him without reserve: that it was an event much to be
							lamented, as affecting the importance of the State as a member of the
							Union; but quite unavoidable from the moment that it became the wish of
							a majority of the People in the District. Massachusetts has been
							hitherto in point of population and wealth one of the first States in
							the Union— It will henceforth scarcely be the tenth— The additional
							weight of two votes in the Senate of the United States is a very
							inadequate compensation for this loss of comparative importance— It
							appears to be the general opinion here, that this event will render
							necessary a Convention to revise the Constitution of Massachusetts— The
							Governor did not dwell much upon this topic; but passed very soon to a
							claim of this State upon the Union, for a million or twelve hundred
							thousand dollars expended during the late war, in defensive measures by
							the Militia. In the career of opposition to the General Government,
							which that of Massachusetts then pursued they refused to place the
							Militia under the command of an Officer of the United States; upon a
							Construction of the Constitution of the United States, by the judges of
							the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth, for which nothing but
							the depraving and stupefying influence of faction can account— The
							immediate consequence of which was that the expence as well as the
							command fell upon the State— And now, after the war is over, the State
							calls upon the Union to defray the charge, which has of course hitherto
							been declined. The expenditures are of the same kind with those which
							have been paid by the Union in all the other States; even in
							Connecticut, a State the temper and conduct of which during the War,
							were quite as refractory against the General Government, as those of
							Massachusetts, but which when called upon to place the Militia, under
							the command of an Officer of the United States was too wary to incur the
							consequences of a refusal and complied— The federal party by which the
							opposition to that of the Union was managed have lost the controul of
							Connecticut and of all the other New-England States, but still retain
							their ascendancy in Massachusetts. They are now claiming to be refunded
							the expenses, which in the wantonness of their pride and obstinacy they
							assumed upon themselves, and with their usual political discernment they
							expect to obtain it, without disavowing the defiance of the Union, which
							released them from all obligation to bear the burthen— I told Governor
							Brooks, that as a native of Massachusetts, it would give me the greatest
							pleasure to serve the State, and I would on my return to Washington
							consult the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, to
							ascertain if any satisfactory arrangement of this affair could be made—
							But it must ultimately depend upon Congress; and the difficulty there
							would be that the Union cannot assume those expenses, without
							sanctioning the principle of it own dissolution; involved in the opinion
							of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, upon which the State acted. The
							Governor gave me to understand that he had always disapproved that
							opinion of the Supreme Court— That there had been almost a
							misunderstanding upon the subject between him and the late <persRef
								ref="strong-caleb">Governor Strong</persRef>, who was entirely
							swayed by the then <persRef ref="parsons-theophilus">Chief Justice
								Parsons</persRef>; the identical man whom the State of Massachusetts
							has to thank for being in this trouble. He was an eminent lawyer; a man
							of extraordinary intellectual powers—of deep research and extensive
							learning; of brilliant and ever ready, though coarse and vulgar wit; and
							in his domestic and private relations amiable, benevolent and upright—
							But he was a cunning man. His wisdom was left handed— He was not only
							addicted to finessing and trick, but he had the weakness to be vain of
							his artifices, and was always telling of the persons whom he had duped,
							and sometimes boasting of it in cases when he had in reality been duped
							himself— The pride of his heart was to overreach: and in this as in many
							other instances less important, he overreached himself. He was withal a
							timid man; ready enough to push others into danger, but easily
							frightened to shrink from it himself— In this very case, after leading
							the Commonwealth into this quagmire, before his death he disavowed the
							opinion, which had involved the State in this contest, and acknowledged
							that it was erroneous— Brooks says, that practically the opinion was
							very soon done away; and by means of a general order which he insisted
							upon Strong’s issuing; but I know not exactly what he means. The Militia
							were not placed under the command of Officers of the United States; the
							Legislature of the State have never disavowed the principle, of Governor
							Strong’s refusal to comply with the requisition from the <persRef
								ref="unknown14">Secretary of War</persRef> to that effect; and when
							Resolutions importing such a disavowal were introduced last Winter into
							the Senate <pb type="ms" n="182"/>of the State they were rejected, and
							all the principles of resistance to the General Government were
							reasserted with as much ardour and stubbornness as if the War were yet
							raging. In this state of things; it is waste of time and of temper for
							the State of Massachusetts to apply to have that money refunded— When
							Hall and Sumner returned from the Speaker’s we came back to Boston— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> and <persRef ref="hall-sarah">M<hi

						<p><date>11. V:</date><persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My
								wife</persRef> was very ill for a couple of hours this morning; but
							recovered so as to be able to proceed on our Voyage— We embarked in the
							Steam-Boat Fulton, <persRef ref="law-unknown2">Captain Law</persRef>,
							and left New-London, precisely at eight O’Clock— <persRef
								ref="channing-henry2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry
								Channing</persRef> came on board to take leave of us, and introduced
							to me <persRef ref="lee-unknown2">Captain Lee</persRef> of the revenue
							Cutter. The day was one of the autumnal beauties of this climate; clear
							Sunshine; but cool; and with a brisk breeze. <persRef
								ref="lancaster-joseph">Joseph Lancaster</persRef>, who was on board
							soon introduced himself to me; and I had much conversation with him upon
							his system of Instruction. As I had never heard his Lectures, and as we
							had all, leisure on board the Boats, he proposed to deliver two Lectures
							there one in the Morning and one in the Evening, to those of the
							passengers who might be disposed to attend; which was readily accepted—
							He gave the first on board the Fulton before dinner; and the second in
							the Evening, on board of the Connecticut, <persRef ref="bunker-thomas"
								>Captain Bunker</persRef>— He was about an hour and a half each
							time, and gave great satisfaction to his auditory— He is, as far as he
							has any education, self-educated—gifted with very extraordinary natural
							powers of eloquence, but so ignorant of the pronunciation of his native
							language, that he speaks with all the cockney vulgarities, of the
							labours in which he is involved; of the harmies of enemies with whom he
							has to contend, and of the works of his ands. There is too much of the
							jobber and speculator, in his zeal for the propagation of his system.
								<pb type="ms" n="183"/>There is inordinate vanity and self-conceit
							in the opinions of himself which he discloses. He is continually
							thrusting upon you his pretensions to be considered as a benefactor of
							mankind. His first Lecture contained a development of his system of
							Instruction, by means of Monitors selected from among the Scholars; and
							he exhibited several drawings, painted in Water Colours, representing
							the boys as engaged in their different lessons of reading, writing, and
							arithmetic, which drawings he said were made by one of his first pupils.
							He expatiated upon the effects of emulation in children, when
							judiciously managed; and the uses of extending it from individual to
							social emulation, by setting two classes in competition with each other—
							The advantages of arranging the forms of a School so as to accommodate
							the greatest possible number of Scholars, and keeping them all under the
							teacher’s eye. The accommodation of the voice to three different keys of
							low, intermediate and high tone, proportioned to the distances between
							the Speaker, and the hearer, and the facility of introducing perfect
							order and discipline, by a few simple rules firmly adhered to, without
							using the scourge at all. By placing the Monitors alternately in
							situations of authority and of obedience, he said they had the
							importance of good discipline brought immediately and practically home
							to their own feelings. The same boy, who for one hour was a teacher, the
							next hour became a learner, and was thus taught at once the lesson
							indispensable to all good discipline; to command, and to obey. The
							second Lecture contained a historical review of the extent in which the
							arts of writing and reading in different ages of the world,
								<unclear>have</unclear> been diffused, and of the various systems of
							instruction which have prevailed— Of the prejudices, passions and
							interests which have counteracted and are still counteracting the
							progress of improvement; and of the various inventions and discoveries
							which have promoted it. He considered the great object to be
							accomplished was to make the knowledge of reading, writing and the four
							rules of Arithmetic, universal; and that every new devise tending to
							facilitate the acquisition of it to greater multitudes of people was a
							service rendered to the great cause of humanity. His own system he
							considered as among the most efficacious of those means; and in his
							second Lecture he alluded to its origin about the year 1797. when he
							said, he being only eighteen years of age, <persRef
								ref="lancaster-richard">his father</persRef> had permitted him to
							fit up one small chamber of his house as a School-room—and he surveyed
							with some exultation the interval to this time, when in his fortieth
							year <hi rend="strikethrough">when</hi> he has the satisfaction of
							knowing that many schools founded upon his system, are in full operation
							in every quarter of the globe— He would not anticipate the extent to
							which the progressive development might and he hoped would be carried—
							It would no doubt be susceptible of improvements many of which would not
							be discovered till he should be in a better world— His Lectures are
							desultory and unmethodical, and his historical illustrations, though
							well applied and ingenious, manifested a very partial knowledge of his
							subject. His materials are exceedingly scanty, and at every moment you
							have occasion to regret the penury of his Stores of knowledge, and to
							see what an admirable use he would make of them if they were more
							copious— His quaker garb hangs heavy upon him; and nothing but pride and
							shame deter him from casting it away— There is too much wit and humour
							in his character for a Quaker. Too much worldliness in his
							disposition—too much asperity towards his adversaries; and too much
							suppleness to those whom he thinks or wishes to be his friends— He spoke
							to me about the rival pretensions of <persRef ref="bell-andrew">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef>, formerly of Madras, to
							the invention of his system, and introduced the subject in a way
							peculiar to himself— Didst thou ever hear, said he, of a Quaker’s
							bearing Arms?—and without waiting for an answer, took from his pocket
							and shewed me a Card, on which was drawn a Bell, with the Inscription
							upon it “Lancaster me fecit”— There, said he, are my arms; and they were
							given to me, by a friend of mine a Clergyman of the Church of England;
							and thus an official brother of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell— I
							then enquired what had really been the practice of D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell’s school at Madras, and he gave me
							some account of it; and of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell himself;
							who from a Scotch Presbyterian Parson had become a convert to the
							dignities of the Church of England, and is now a prebendary, under the
								<persRef ref="barrington-shute">Bishop of Durham</persRef> with whom
							he is in controversy about the payment of a commutation for an ox, or an
							ox in kind; as rent or tythe upon a living given him by the bishop— He
							had while chaplain to the East-India Company service, kept a school at
								<pb type="ms" n="184"/>Madras, into which he had introduced a
							practice of writing upon sand, which was a custom in the Schools of the
							Country; among the Hindoos; and to supply the place of ushers he had
							employed some of the larger boys to teach the younger ones, and after
							Lancaster’s publications had made his system known, had imitated its
							details— Still he had required the assistance of four ushers for a
							School of 300 boys, and had never been able to dispense with their
							services. But being of the established English Church, and teaching the
							Prayer Book, as well as reading and writing, all the Church Clergymen
							took up his cause, and would not hear of Joseph Lancaster the Sectarian.
							Lancaster is now engaged in the attempt to organize by subscription one
							of his Schools in Boston— But his success is doubtful— We arrived at
							New-Haven about three in the afternoon; and as we had three hours to
							wait for the arrival of the Boat from New-York, we took a Carriage with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Goodhue, and rode into the City of New-Haven. We were

							access to the Cabinet of Mineralogy, which belongs not to the College,
							but to <persRef ref="gibbs-george">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Gibbs</persRef> of Newport. There is not much in it worth seeing. We
							returned about Sunset to our Boat, and half an hour after, the

							with Hall, who accompanied me to the Athenaeum, an establishment similar
							to, but more recent than the one at Boston— Among the periodical works
							on the Table, Hall shewed me the last number received of the British
							Review, containing an Article Upon American Literature, in which is the
							first notice taken by any foreign Journal, of my Lectures upon Rhetoric—
							The notice is superficial, and though not flattering, as favourable, as
							I can ever expect from an English Critic— Hall took me also into an
							adjoining chamber, where <persRef ref="sully-thomas">Sully</persRef> the
							Painter is engaged upon a large picture of the passage of the Delaware
							by <persRef ref="washington-george">General Washington</persRef>, in

								ref="trumbull-john">Trumbull’s</persRef> picture of the Declaration
							of Independence— The principal figure is not even a likeness of
							Washington, and there is no character in the whole composition— The
							large picture is however as yet barely in chalk— We went into the United
							States Circuit Court, where Judges <persRef ref="washington-bushrod"
								>Washington</persRef> and <persRef ref="peters-richard"
								>Peters</persRef> were sitting— Judge Peters came down from the
							Bench, and spoke to me; and <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J.
								Ingersoll</persRef> claimed of me a promise to dine with him— We
							went into one of the City Courts where Ewing was engaged in a Cause then
							before the Court. I returned to my lodgings, whither Ingersoll whom I
							had met on coming out of Court accompanied me, and sat with me perhaps
							an hour. I then went and paid a visit to <persRef ref="connell-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell</persRef> whom I found
							in great dejection and distress— From the tenor of his Conversation when
							I was here in August I had apprehended that he was embarrassed in his
							affairs— He now told me that he had been obliged about three weeks since
							to suspend his payments, and to assign over all his property to his
							Creditors. The causes of his misfortune were two—an attempt to establish
							a commercial house, connected with a large land speculation at Blakeley
							in the State of Alabama; and a purchase of 500 shares of United States
							Bank Stock at 30 per Cent advance— All his creditors he says will be
							paid the full amount of their debts, and he determined to stop while he
							knew this could be effected, rather than resort to ruinous expedients of
							momentary relief, which would have disabled him in the end to do Justice
							to all. He was deeply affected in telling me this, and I sympathised
							heartily with him, convinced as I am of his integrity, industry and
							frugality— There is no man of whom I have in these respects a more
							favourable opinion. I endeavoured to encourage him by the hopes of more
							prosperous times, and lament that it is not in my power to make them
							certain to him. Before going to dinner I called again upon Ewing, who
							was just rising from his. He went with me to the Mint, but we found none
							of its officers there— He then accompanied me to the public City
							Library, where he left me, being obliged to attend again at the Court— I
							viewed the Logan Library; a donation from <persRef ref="logan-james">the
								Grandfather</persRef> of the present <persRef ref="logan-george"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Logan</persRef>; and the Clock
							said to have been made for <persRef ref="cromwell-oliver">Oliver
								Cromwell</persRef>, and to have some time belonged to him— And which
							is now one of the most accurate time pieces in Philadelphia— Between
							three and four I went and dined with Ingersoll— Besides <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-mary">his wife</persRef> the only company present
							were <persRef ref="harris-levett">Levitt Harris</persRef> and <persRef

							discreet nor conciliatory in his Conversation— At seven I went again by
							appointment to Ewing’s, who took me to a tavern in Sixth Street, where
							we spent the Evening and had a delicious supper. The whole company
							consisted of <persRef ref="sergeant-john">John

						<p><date>16. V.</date> Washington. We arrived at Baltimore between four and
							five this Morning. I had quietly slept out the whole passage, and was
							surprized to learn that there had been a heavy swell in the Bay;
							insomuch that my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> had

							by <persRef ref="evans-william">Evans</persRef>; where we breakfasted.
							At seven O’Clock we left Baltimore in the Stage; and at two in the
							afternoon, arrived all safe and in good health at our own house in
							Washington. Half an hour after we got in, our arrival was announced in
							the Washington City Gazette; <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi

									>rs</hi> W. S. Smith</persRef> in the Evening. <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary Hellen</persRef> who has been living with
							them during our absence, returned to our house— I took possession of my
							new writing chamber, and began upon the ever recurring task of redeeming
							the arrears of this Journal; which have again accumulated from the first
							of the Month— It is but this day week that we left Boston, and in the
							interval we have performed without losing one Night’s rest a Journey of
							five hundred Miles. The Steam-Boats have effected a change in the
							convenience and expedition of this Journey, the value of which is
							inestimable— A week, was an ordinary period of time for a passage by the
							Packets from Providence to New-York; and it was not uncommon to be two
							Nights out upon Chesapeake Bay between French town and Baltimore. The
							time too was anxiously passed; depending upon the changes of wind and
							wave—dreading alike a calm or a storm; and subject to all the vexations
							and disappointments of a veering weathercock— We have now a single, or a
							two days ride from Boston to Norwich or New-London at our option— One
							Night on board the Steam-Boat, upon the passage through Long-Island
							Sound; a days Journey to Philadelphia, varied by alternate Steam-boat
							and stage, and one short Night upon Chesapeake Bay— In the Steam-boats,
							the provisions of the day and the beds for the Night are equal to those
							of a very good Inn— You meet with a great variety of company with whom
							you can associate, or from whom you can keep aloof, at your pleasure.
							You can employ yourself in reading or writing, if so inclined. A rule
							established in all the boats, and from which I have never witnessed an
							exception, prohibits all card-playing; this also is a great improvement
							upon the Packets of former times; where I have known gambling and its
							filthy appendages smoking and drinking, the whole night long— The
							behaviour of the passengers in the Steamboats, is almost universally
							decent— The women have a cabin to themselves; into which no man is
							admitted— The smoking is banished or confined to the forecastle cabin.
							The intrusion of dogs is forbidden; and other rules for the preservation
							of cleanliness, good order and punctual payment are prescribed, by
							printed notices hung up in the Cabins, and are very generally observed.
							Religious Tracts and printed Sermons are scattered about the cabins to
							attract the attention of the idle, and here and there you lay your hand
							upon a Book, which upon opening it, you find to be a Bible. There is a
							sort of spasmodic, and tremulous motion in the Boat very disagreeable to
								<pb type="ms" n="187"/>many persons, particularly Ladies; and the
							noise of the Steam-Engine, of the paddles in the water, and of the
							Steam, when the valves are opened to let it escape are unpleasant, and
							sometimes to weak nerves alarming. But these inconveniences are trifling
							compared to those of any other mode of traveling; and the Steam Boat is
							to be considered altogether as one of the greatest and most beneficent
							inventions of modern ages.</p>

						<p><date>20. VI:30.</date> The Races this day made a Holiday at <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> School— <persRef
								ref="ecky-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ecky</persRef> came
							to the Office, and brought a number of papers relating to the claims
							upon the Swedish Government; for which he was an Agent. Of all the
							robberies which were committed upon the property of Citizens of the
							United States, by the various Governments under the controul of <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef> at the time of his
							power, those of the Swedish authorities in Pomerania, are the most
							shameless and inexcusable. For although the seizures there, as elsewhere
							were made at his requisition; they were actually released and discharged
							by his orders—but were still detained, and appropriated by the Swedish
							Officers themselves. <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">Hughes</persRef>
							has written, that he was informed from very respectable authority
								(<persRef ref="vonrehausen-gotthard">Baron Rehausen</persRef>) that
							according to the universal impression, the whole money proceeding from
							this pillage of Americans went in to the private pockets or purses of
								<persRef ref="engstrom-lars">Count Engeström</persRef>, the Minister
							of foreign Affairs; and of <persRef ref="wetterstedt-gustaf">Baron
								Wettersted</persRef> the Chancellor. There has been more shuffling
							and equivocation too by the Swedish Government, in the discussions upon
							these claims than by any of the other Governments upon claims of a
							similar character. Wettersted invariably admitted with Ecky the Justice
							of the claims, and the obligation of the Swedish Government to discharge
							them. They offered Ecky to pay him in Cannon or Articles for which he
							could have no use, and of which he could not dispose; but when <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef> came to present the claim with the sanction of
							this Government, they answered by false allegations which they knew to
							be false; and by denying their obligation to indemnify the sufferers
							which they had before, time after time recognized— I read to Ecky the
							Letter from Hughes which unfolds the tale so creditable to Count
							Engeström and Baron Wettersted; at which he was much astonished— He said
							however he should not yet despair of ultimately obtaining something;
							were it but cannon balls, lead, or <pb type="ms" n="189"/>saltpetre— I
							took this day a survey of the chambers occupied for the use of the
							Department, in the new Building to which we have removed; and also of

							experienced for want of room; and as no single person has been
							responsible for the Books many of them are lost. There is now a spacious
							chamber allotted to the library; and it will be my duty to prescribe
							some regulations for the order of the Office— I wrote to the <persRef

							Thomas. There is a promise now that he shall be admitted, of which I had

							case of a War with Spain, and still more with England, there would be
							great numbers of distressed American Seamen; and considerable advances
							of money for them would be necessary— What was he to do, for
							reimbursement—as Bills upon this Country could not be negotiated— This
							was a barefaced trick, to hear what I should say, in relation to the
							prospects of Peace and War— I told him that when the case should occur
							it would be time enough to provide for it; and I was so displeased at
							the insidious nature and pertness of this question, that I treated M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Levy in a frosty manner for which he will
							hate and traduce me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cathcart came again
							with his antediluvian claims upon the Government; claims which I have

							he besieges me with perseverance stronger than Love, and with iteration
							for which <persRef ref="falstaff-john">Falstaff</persRef> epithet to the

						<p><date>29. VI:</date> I awoke as I found by striking my repeater at half
							past three this morning; which being too early an hour to rise, I
							returned to bed, and without much repose lay till six which is an hour
							too late. At the Office, <persRef ref="lane-samuel">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Lane</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="mason-john">General Mason</persRef> called— Lane’s object was
							to speak of the Capitol, and the new buildings for the public Offices.
							He asked me to go and view the Halls as they are now finished at the
							Capitol, and particularly the painting of the Cielings, of which he said
							he was himself no judge, and of which he wished to take my opinion. I
							asked him concerning the fire engines— He said he expected to receive
							them in a few days from Philadelphia— He told me that the owners of the
							temporary building in which the two houses of Congress have for several
							years held their Sessions were taking great pains and using much address
							to excite apprehensions in the members, that the walls of the new Halls
							would not be sufficiently dry for the Houses to occupy them— It was very
							ridiculous, but quite probable that they would succeed. General Mason
							came with a Letter from <persRef ref="niles-hezekiah">Niles</persRef>,
							the Editor of the Register, recommending <persRef ref="bland-theoderick"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bland</persRef>, for the
							appointment of District Judge in Maryland— It was to <persRef
								ref="williams-nathaniel">N. F. Williams</persRef> and forwarded by
							him to Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Mason, who renewed and pressed
							again his own recommendation of Bland. He went over all the old ground,
							which I did not think it necessary to discuss; being very sure that
							Bland will be appointed. Mason glanced at his own situation, and said
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> had informed him they were
							endeavouring to trace something against him for his transactions with
								<persRef ref="aguirre-manuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Aguirre</persRef>. He was a Cannon founder— He sold his Cannon to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Aguirre, as he sold them to any one
							else. Very possibly some of the Cannon of the privateers fitted out at
							Baltimore had been purchased him; and he had no doubt he had sold
							Cannon, on one and the same day to an Agent of the <persRef
								ref="ferdinand-vii">king of Spain</persRef>, and an agent of the
							Patriots. He was at least impartial and there was no disguise in
							transactions which he had considered as being in the regular way of his
							business— He also repeated Bland’s insinuations against the <persRef
								ref="correa-joseph">Abbe Correa</persRef>; charging him with having
							suborned witnesses to testify against Bland. He said Correa acted by
							other persons— To see him work you must look at three or four men off,
							from him; they were channels through which he operated, and they had
							given <persRef ref="sands-unknown">Sands</persRef> money to testify
							against others— I observed that there could be no credit attached to
							Sands’s testimony, for his own story began by charging himself with
							perjury. I was not disposed to defend the conduct of the Spanish or
							Portuguese Ministers. But their official duty was to defend the property
							of their Countrymen; although the facts were perfectly notorious, it was
							difficult to prove them; all who could be witnesses, being participators
							of the crime: and as to the fact of money’s being given to a witness;
							that would not be conclusive evidence of subornation— If in his zeal for
							the service of his Country, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Correa, had
							transcended the line of his obligations to this, and had wronged any
							individual, complaint against him <pb type="ms" n="193"/>might be
							received, and addressed to his own Government; but as to his exertions
							to save or to redeem the property of Portuguese Merchants, robbed by the
							Baltimore piratical privateers, I considered it as so vigorously his
							duty to use them, that without approving any departure from the straight
							courses, I should look with indulgence even upon indiscretions in the
							discharge of his duty— The General was as usual very courtly, and
							pleasant in his deportment— I took home with me the Maryland Laws to
							take from them an abstract of the Statutes upon Weights and Measures;
							but instead of that I got involved, in certain arithmetical calculations
							which absorbed the whole Evening— <persRef ref="cardelli-pietro"
								>Cardelli</persRef> gave a lesson of drawing to <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2;hellen-mary" type="multi">the
							children</persRef>— Received a satisfactory answer from <persRef
								ref="mceuen-thomas">M’Ewen</persRef>, <persRef ref="hale-thomas"
								>Hale</persRef> and <persRef ref="davidson-william"
								>Davidson</persRef>.</p>

						<p><date>30. V:</date> The calculations seized hold of me again this
							Morning, and consumed two or three hours of my time; so that I had
							barely enough left to make the abstract from the Maryland Laws which I
							had intended. At the Office I called upon <persRef
								ref="pleasonton-stephen">Pleasonton</persRef> who was not at his but
							afterwards came to me— He furnished me two or three papers, which I
							wanted for the further elucidation of my public accounts on the foreign
							Missions. He also gave me some papers relating to <persRef
								ref="cathcart-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cathcart’s</persRef> claim— <persRef ref="thierry-fb">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thierry</persRef>, the French Charge
							d’Affaires called, and brought me a Letter from <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef> the Minister; mentioning that on receipt of my
							Letter he had immediately concluded, although he was just going on board
							the vessel in which he had engaged his passage for France, to have his
							baggage relanded, and come back to Washington. Thierry said this was
							quite unexpected to him—and he looked as if it did not exactly suit him
							to be shorn of his honours and emoluments as Charge d’Affaires— I could
							not find it in my heart to congratulate him upon M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> de Neuville’s return— <persRef ref="antrobus-gibbs">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Antrobus</persRef> the British Charge
							d’Affaires, came and said he had heard that I had received information
							of <persRef ref="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bagot’s</persRef> having been appointed Ambassador to Russia; and
							enquired if it was so. I said <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef> had told <persRef ref="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush </persRef>that the appointment of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot to Russia, though not actually
							made had been determined upon in the Cabinet— Antrobus said he was
							expecting his despatches by the Packet; which was longer coming from
							Halifax to New-York than it had been from Falmouth to Halifax— He asked
							also when the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> was
							expected to return to the City— He said he had a Letter from the
								<persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef> to present— I told
							him the President was to come next Tuesday— <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2;hellen-mary" type="multi">The children</persRef>
							dined at <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">W. S. Smith’s</persRef>,
							and my <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">wife</persRef> spent the
							Evening there. There was a fire this Evening at the Navy yard— Two or
							three small frame houses— I went out to go to it; but before I reached
							the place it was subdued— I met the people returning from it, and came
							back myself.— Evening engaged on my Journal.</p>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Cormick’s</persRef> Church,
							and heard him read Prayers for the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi>
							Sunday after Trinity, and preach from 1. Corinthians 11.29. [“]For he
							that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to
							himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.” It was a Sermon preparatory to
							the communion which he gave notice would be administered next Sunday,
							when as usual on that occasion a collection would be made. It was a very
							earnest exhortation to join in the communion; which most of the
							Christian Churches consider as a duty of the most indispensable
							obligation— Our Independents, especially the Unitarians, are more
							indifferent about it than any others; for I do not recollect having ever
							heard from one of their pulpits a recommendation of it. They are not
							discerning of the Lord’s body.— As I was returning home I met <persRef
								ref="lane-samuel">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Lane</persRef>,
							with whom I went and viewed the Halls of the Senate and House of
							Representatives at the Capitol— They are yet both unfinished; and there
							will barely be time to have them finished before the Meeting of
							Congress— They are both too small; but particularly the Senate chamber—
							The Hall of the House of Representatives will be magnificent, but not
							convenient, nor in a good taste. Lane says the Stone of which the
							Capitol is built is too soft, and before many years will crumble into
							sand— We had evening visits successively from <persRef ref="bailey-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef> and from
								<persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<!-- This is a summary entry without a date.-->
						<p><pb type="ms" n="194"/><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> I rise irregularly from four to
							seven O’Clock in the Morning—making an average of about half past five—
							An irregularity which notwithstanding all the pains I have taken to
							correct it, still continues— I believe it owing to a complaint with
							which I am afflicted, which disturbs my repose in the Night, and makes
							my sleep irregular— On rising, I kindle the fire, in the chamber to
							which my cabinet is removed, and write till between 8 and 9 when we
							breakfast, that <persRef ref="adams-charles2;hellen-mary" type="multi"
								>the children</persRef> may go betimes to school— After breakfast a
							cursory glance at the newspapers, and occasional family concerns occupy
							me till near noon when I repair to my Office— Thence I return home at
							four P.M— Write in my chamber till half past five when we dine— Allowing
							for this an hour and a half I then pass from seven till ten of the
							Evening in my chamber, writing, except when interrupted by visitors,
							which happens from two to three times a week— Early rising and restless
							nights make me a dull and drowsy Evening companion— The only remedy for
							which, extreme temperance, not only of eating, but of drinking I do not
							always observe— Drowsiness is the first consequence of repletion. I
							waste as usual much of my time upon trifles. I suppose it irradicable
							from my character— I would if possible devote every moment of my time to
							useful employment, but my nature shrinks from the perfection of the
							theory.</p>
