						<p><pb type="ms" n="137"/><date>2. IV:30.</date> A person by the name of
								<persRef ref="hillman-henry">Henry Hillman</persRef> came to me this
							morning, and complained that he had been dismissed without sufficient
							Cause from the Office of Overseer to the Stone cutters at the Capitol;
							and a foreigner and single man, put in his place. That he had been to
								<persRef ref="lane-samuel">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

							authority to <persRef ref="blagden-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Blagden</persRef>, the man who had displaced Hillman;
							who had a personal pique against him—was a foreigner, and invariably
							partial to foreigners, against native Americans. I told him that I had
							no controul over the Commissioner, but if he would make a statement in
							writing of his complaint, and procure certificates of his good conduct
							and character, which he said he could, numerous and respectable, I would
							present them to the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, on
							his return— Sat to <persRef ref="king-charles2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> King</persRef>. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> accompanied me
							to his house, but did not like the picture so that he changed its
							attitude— At the Office came <persRef ref="anderson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> T. D. Anderson</persRef> late Consul
							at Tunis, and now appointed to Tripoli— He came for Instructions, a
							Credential Letter, and upon an old claim for compensation as a bearer of
							despatches to Madrid. This claim must be settled by the President, it
							having arisen while he was Secretary of State. <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef> came to enquire if I had received late Letters
							from France; and he spoke again of his project of a Consular Convention—
							I told him as I had no Powers to treat, it would be necessary for me to
							wait till the President’s return, to give him an answer, and that
							probably he would prefer arranging a general Commercial Treaty, at the
							same time with the Consular Convention— He has this deeply at heart, and
							it has invariably been an object of high importance to the French
							Government under the Bourbons ever since their first Connection with the
							United States— It is all political machinery in the guise of Consular
							Regulations. <persRef ref="jay-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jay’s</persRef> Report upon the first Consular Convention, which I
							have read since de Neuville sent me his project, has disclosed to me the
							whole system. But de Neuville says unless there be a Consular
							Convention, it will be best for France to keep no Consuls here; as it
							occasions expence, and the Consuls have no powers— He asked also whether
							he and <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-ann">Madame de Neuville</persRef>
							should call upon <persRef ref="monroe-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs.</hi> Monroe</persRef> to take leave— As I could not answer
							him upon this subject, he said the foreign Ministers were placed in an
							unpleasant predicament, by not knowing whether their visits would be
							received, and yet being unwilling to omit any mark of respect to the
							President’s family which might be expected. I told him I would make some
							enquiry, and let him know the result— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

						<p><date>5. IV:45.</date> Morning Bath in the river. The Night and morning
							cool— At eleven O’Clock there was a procession from the Washington
							Hotel, to the Congress Hall on the Capitol Hill, where the Declaration
							of Independence was read by <persRef ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Anderson</persRef>, the Comptroller of
							the Treasury, and an Oration delivered by <persRef ref="lee-richard"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richard Bland Lee</persRef>,
							formerly a Member of Congress— The procession was very small, and the
							Oration reasonably dull— At four O’Clock, I went to the Hotel on the
							Capitol Hill, where there was a subscription dinner, at which the late
							Mayor of the City, <persRef ref="orr-benjamin">B. G. Orr</persRef>
							presided. The dinner and management were very bad; and the company very
							small— Less than forty persons including the invited guests, the old
							revolutionary Officers— There were twenty-one toasts, but the State of
							Alabama being now the twenty-second State, I gave it as a volunteer;
							upon which <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> who
							seems to have thought I was encroaching upon his territories, gave—“the
							admission of new States on the principles of the federal
							Constitution—that they should be <hi rend="italic">Republican</hi>.”—
							This toast glanced at the failure of the Territory of Missouri, to
							become a State, at the last Session of Congress, owing to a restriction
							introduced by the House of Representatives, excluding Slavery from the
							State and declaring free all persons to be born there after a certain
							period— The Senate struck out the provision, and the Bill failed by the
							disagreement between the two Houses. The attempt to introduce the
							restriction introduced a violent agitation among the Members from the
							Slave-holding States, and it has been communicated to the States
							themselves; and to the Territory of Missouri. The Slave drivers, as
							usual, whenever this topic is brought up, bluster and bully, talk of the
							white Slaves of the Eastern States, and the dissolution of the Union,
							and Ocean’s of blood— And the Northern men, as usual pocket all this
							Hectoring; sit down in quiet, and submit to the Slave-scourging
							Republicanism of the Planters. Crawford who sees how this affair will
							ultimately go, and who relies on the support of the Slave Drivers, is
							determined to shew them that he is on their side; and gave this toast to
							exhibit himself as their champion— On this particular question I did not
							approve of the attempted restriction upon the State of Missouri, because
							I believed it not compatible either with the Constitution of the United
							States or with the Louisiana Treaty— But I think Crawford’s toast not
							remarkable for delicacy towards the Legislature; while the question is
							pending before them; and he an Officer of the Executive Government.— As
							he also flatters himself with support from New-York and Pennsylvania, I
							doubted a little whether this Toast was altogether judicious, in
							reference to its possible effect upon them— It may however pass
							unnoticed in that quarter. I was diverted at perceiving how it was
							brought out by my Toast of Alabama; the simplest thing in the world;
							originating in the oversight of the Managers, in preparing only
							twenty-one toasts— I withdrew immediately after these volunteers were
							given— <persRef ref="smith-william-steuben;smith-catherine-johnson"

						<p><date>9. V:</date> Morning bath. I received a Summons to attend the
							Circuit Court of the District, this morning, upon the trial of <persRef
								ref="braconnier-mark">Mark</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="braconnier-francis">Francis Braconnier</persRef>, two young
							Frenchmen living here, and exercising the trade of Silver-Smiths. They
							were indicted upon two charges; one of having counterfeited the current
							silver coin; and the other for having uttered counterfeit coin. I was
							summoned on their part to testify to their characters. I knew nothing of
							them personally; but <persRef ref="giusta-antoine">Antoine</persRef> had
							occasionally employed them for work, and was well acquainted with them.
							Their character as far as I had heard any thing of it was good— I
							attended the Court and took Antoine with me. It was past Noon before the
							trial came on. The eivdence against them was that they had passed to
							several persons about one dollar’s worth of counterfeit 16<hi
								rend="superscript">ths. </hi>of a dollar, commonly called here five
							penny bits: but there was no evidence of their having made them. The
							Story that they told was that a foreigner came some time since to their
							shop, with a handful of these five-penny bits, and ordered them to make
							waistcoat buttons of those with the best impressions, and to take the
							rest for their pay. He had also ordered them to procure other five penny
							bits, and make buttons of them. They produced a witness who swore that
							he was at their shop, when this man came, and gave them the order and
							the five-penny bits.— The strongest circumstances against them were that
							being Silver-Smiths they should have received and passed off these
							pieces for genuine money; the bare inspection of them being sufficient
							to shew that they were not of good silver. The only explanation of
							which, consistent with their innocence was that coming from a country
							where genuine small coins are made of debased metal and being foreigners
							here, they might know these pieces to be bad silver, and yet believe
							them to be genuine coins. They had also requested the attendance of the
								<persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French Minister</persRef>, who
							did not come, but sent <persRef ref="thierry-fb">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thierry</persRef>, with a certificate
							in their favour, and of the <persRef ref="goupydequabeck-alexander"
								>Viscount de Quabeck</persRef> who neither came nor sent. The trial
							lasted till past two O’Clock, although the arguments of Counsel, both
							for the prosecution and for the defendant’s were very short. There was a
							Silversmith upon the Jury, who was sworn, and testified that he should
							have known by bare inspection <pb type="ms" n="140"/>that the pieces
							which were produced in Court, and which they had passed, were
							counterfeit— <persRef ref="jones-walter">Walter Jones</persRef> the

							the <persRef ref="stuart-charles">English Ambassador</persRef>,
							declaimed against it, even in an indecent manner, from which he

							returning from a Summer excursion, with them into the State of Ohio. He
							told me the course of his adventures, after I gave him the Letter until
							he returned to the United States, and he recollected the particulars of
							his transactions with me, at that time, more circumstantially than I
							did— I found upon recurring to my diary that he remembered them
							correctly— <persRef ref="cardelli-pietro">Cardelli</persRef> came to ask

							something better. He said money was not his object, and he would offer
							to work at his proper business, for the same wages now given him for
							making eggs— I brought up my old Accounts in my Waste-Book, and Journal
							to the close of the last year. My transactions of private pecuniary
							business have been to an amount sufficiently important, and sufficiently
							complicated to require that the accounts of them should have been kept
							by the mode of double entry. I ought to have begun keeping them thus in
							1790. when I commenced life in the practice of Law. But Book-keeping is
							not taught as a part of Classical Education, which is a great oversight,
							and I had neither learnt it, nor was aware of its importance. I had
							indeed no property, and for two or three years very little business to
							book; yet of that little, and of all my expences I did keep accounts,
							though not in a regular system of Books. When I went to Holland in 1794.
							I commenced in the Book which I have since used as a Ledger, a regular
							account of my receipts and payments on public account, and also of all
							my expences; but none of other pecuniary transactions. I found the want
							of it by experience; and upon resuming the practice of the Law, after my
							return from Europe in 1801. I began to keep regular Books— A Waste-Book
							and Journal in one; and a Ledger— My own agency, for <persRef

							House of <persRef ref="bird-robert">Bird</persRef><persRef

							the great variety of affairs in which I have been concerned, have not
							only produced some confusion in the formal part <pb type="ms" n="142"
							/>of my Account Books, but some confusion in my ideas as to the mode of
							keeping them. I have made no entries in the Ledger since 1814. and never
							attempted the experiment of making out a Trial-Balance. I have but very
							imperfect catalogues of my Library, and no proper Inventory either of my
							household Furniture, or of my Real Estate— On my last return to this
							Country, I suspended making entries, in my Waste-Book and Journal, till
							I could enter upon it a summary of my brother’s agency Accounts during
							my absence in Europe. Last Summer I went through a partial examination
							of them, which I have now resumed and completed— In the mean time, my
							entries upon loose papers, had run up to nearly three sheets; which I
							have at length transferred to the Waste-Book and Journal; and in
							scrutinizing the modes of making the entries, I have ascertained the
							sources of most of the errors in my former entries. It remains for me
							still to revise and correct them; for which I must wait, if it is
							destined to me another period of leisure— I Sat to <persRef
