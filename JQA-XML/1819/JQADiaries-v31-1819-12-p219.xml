							a new member of Congress from New Jersey, and <persRef

							October from <persRef ref="onis-luis">Onis</persRef>, who expected to be
							appointed Minister to the Netherlands; but who, he said, complained of
							his brother in Law, <persRef ref="salmon-unknown">Salmon</persRef>, the
							late Minister ad interim of foreign Affairs. He expressed a wish to be
							presented to the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>—
							Stackelberg wished to have the exequatur revoked of a Swedish Consul at
							Baltimore— I was twice at the President’s, and the last time found him
							at home— He appointed a Meeting of the Members of the Administration
							to-morrow at Noon; and said he had made some alteration in his draft of
							the Message, concerning the South-Americans, in consequence of my
							suggestion— He said <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Wirt</persRef> had undertaken to state the particulars,
							in which the organization of the Laws against piracy was defective— I
							said that with the recommendation to revise them the expression of a
							strong sentiment, disapproving the practice, would be perhaps equally
							useful. By our Constitution, the Chief Magistrate is the first guardian
							of the public morals; and the influence of his approbation or censure,
							solemnly communicated to the legislature is perhaps as important and
							efficacious as any exercise of his positive authority. He said that he
							would introduce such a sentiment into the message, as he had already
							done with regard to the Slave trade— He seemed to doubt whether it would
							be proper for him to say anything of the part taken by the principal
							European Powers in relation to the ratification of the Florida Treaty by
							Spain— I said I thought it quite expedient with respect to Great
							Britain; because there is a general impression that the British
							Government have interfered to prevent it; which they have not only
							utterly disavowed; but they have actually interposed by advising Spain
							to the Ratification— He said if Great-Britain was mentioned, it would
							also be necessary to take notice of the good offices of France; which I
							thought would be very proper— He asked how far any thing might be <pb
								type="ms" n="220"/>said of Russia— We have nothing positive direct
							from the Government— <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Poletica</persRef> here, has professed
							perfectly friendly dispositions; and the Russian Ambassador at Paris had
							done the same— But from the latest despatch received from <persRef

								Gallatin</persRef>, it would appear that <persRef
								ref="tatischeff-dimitry">Tatischeff’s</persRef> conduct had not been
							equally friendly at Madrid— The President desired me to see Poletica
							to-morrow Morning, and ascertain from him whether a paragraph announcing
							the good disposition of Russia, in connection with that of France and
							England upon this subject would be acceptable to the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor,</persRef> and to draw up such a
							paragraph, as I should think it would be proper to insert in the
							message— He read me one which he has prepared as a tribute to the memory
							of <persRef ref="perry-oliver">Commodore Perry</persRef>— He said he
							would recommend that some provision should be made for <persRef
								ref="perry-elizabeth;perry-christopher2;perry-christopher;perry-oliver2;perry-elizabeth2"

						<p><date>3. VI:30.</date> Immediately on going to the office this morning I
							sent and requested <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Poletica</persRef>, the Russian
							Minister to call there before Noon— He came, and I told him that I had
							asked to see him by the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef> direction. It was his intention, in the
							Message to Congress, when speaking of the refusal of Spain to ratify the
							Florida Treaty, to state that France and Great Britain had both
							manifested wishes favourable to the ratification— He wished to say the
							same of the Russian Government, if Poletica thought that it might be
							positively stated. He said it certainly might— He had written altogether
							in that Spirit to <persRef ref="tatischeff-dimitry"
							>Tatischeff</persRef>, and was confident it would be entirely approved
							by his government— I said we knew that <persRef ref="lieven-christopher"
								>Count Lieven</persRef> and <persRef ref="pozzodiborgo-carlo">Pozzo
								di Borgo</persRef>, the Russian Ambassador’s at London and Paris,
							had expressed such sentiments; but we had received intimations that
							Tatischeff’s conduct had not been equally friendly— He said he was not
							surprized at that— He had been suspicious it would be so. But he knew
							Tatischeff perfectly well; and if he had taken that part, it was to be
							in opposition to everything done by the British Ambassador; and to
							strengthen his own influence by shewing zeal for those to whom he was
							accredited— I went to the President’s at Noon, where there was a Cabinet
							Meeting— <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="thompson-smith">Thompson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef> were present. The President read
							the draft of his Message, which is nearly prepared— It is less pleasing,
							and will I think be more criticised, than either of his former Messages,
							at the Commencement of the Sessions of Congress— It presents a situation
							of public affairs less auspicious, and a variety of topics, upon which
							there will probably be vehement debates. The question with Spain is
							drawn out more into detail, and yet is not shewn in so clear a light as
							I could have wished it might be. The recommendation is however as I had
							suggested that Congress should pass an act authorising the Executive to
							carry the Treaty into effect as if it had been ratified by Spain; but
							the authority to be contingent, and to be used at the discretion of the
							Executive, in case there should be no satisfactory result to the
							Negotiation, during the Session of Congress. The paragraphs respecting
							the South Americans, which the President told me he had drawn with
							modifications of the first draft were still so strongly expressed and so
							partial in their favour, that I was strongly apprehensive that they
							would produce effects not only in Spain, but throughout Europe— As I was
							aware that the only way to obtain any mitigation of the passage, was to
							make at once an objection to the whole, I asked after it had been read,
							whether it would not be advisable to omit the whole; in this, as I had
							expected I was opposed from all quarters; particularly from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson, the Secretary of the Navy. He
							said if the Message should not express favourable sentiments of the
							South-Americans, the administration would be charged with having become
							hostile to them, and with insincerity towards them— I observed that this
							charge had already been made, and urged with all the ability and all the
							animation that the enemies of the administration could bring to it— That
							they had been harping upon it two years without intermission, and I
							thought there never was a topic upon which the strings of popular
							feeling had been touched with less success— A disposition sufficiently
							favourable to the South-Americans had been manifested in the Messages of
							the two preceding years. It was useless to repeat now what had been said
							before—it was not yet proposed to recognize their independence; and as
							we knew this to be the precise point upon which the obstacle to the
							ratification of the Treaty turned, I thought it highly inexpedient that
							anything should be said in the Message, upon which <pb type="ms" n="221"
							/>Spain could fasten, as a departure from neutrality, and which France
							and Russia might consider as at least tending to justify Spain in
							persisting to withhold ratification— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt
							asked if the expression of opinions and wishes could be considered as a
							departure from neutrality— I said that in a Message from the chief
							magistrate to the Legislature, if not a positive breach of neutrality it
							was a very near approximation to it; and asked him how it would be
							viewed, if sentiments and wishes equally strong were expressed against
							the Colonies, and in favour of Spain— The President said we had made to
							Great-Britain and France, the proposal for a joint acknowledgment of
							Buenos-Ayres; which neither of them had accepted. But Britain had
							immediately made it known to Spain, and to all the rest of Europe, while
							it was not known to our own People. He thought it would be proper to
							avow it in the face of the world, and to assign reasons in justification
							of it, which could only drawn from exhibiting the Colonies, as having
							just claims to be recognised as independent— At the same time he wished
							by shewing to the People of this Country what had been done for the
							South-Americans, to take away from the enemies of the administration the
							pretence that it was not friendly to the Independent cause. Crawford
							said that all the rest of the world knew we had made this proposal to
							the French and English Governments; our own People did not know it. He
							thought it would be proper to inform them of it— I did not press the
							total omission of the paragraph; but then objected successively to its
							details, urging the general objection, to each part of a sentence, and
							making special question upon the principal statements contained in it—
							The President consented to strike out several of the strongest
							expressions, and softened down the whole as much as the other members
							would approve, and when it was brought to the point which they all
							thought acceptable, the President asked me again what I thought of it— I
							said in a tone of good humour which produced a general laugh—[“]Sir, to
							be quite candid with you, I have brought my mind to the conclusion, that
							the less there is said in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Message, upon
							South-America, the better it will be— Whatever therefore you will
							consent to strike out will in my judgment be an improvement; and
							whatever you conclude to retain, I must put up with, and make the best
							of it that I can— I have no ill will to the cause of the
							South-Americans— I have no doubt they will ultimately maintain their
							Independence; and that at a proper time it ought to be acknowledged— But
							at this moment I think we should avoid any thing, of which Spain might
							make a handle, and which would dispose France and Russia against us”—
							The paragraph was in fact expurgated, until I hope it will be harmless;
							unless the President should restore the obnoxious passages, or at least
							some of them, as I apprehend he may— I had as he desired drawn a short
							sentence, stating that France, Great-Britain and Russia were favourable
							to the Ratification of the Treaty— He had been promised by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt a draft of a paragraph recommending a
							revision of the Laws against Piracy; but it was not produced— He adopted
							mine with some alteration— The statements respecting the Survey and
							Fortifications the Yellow-Stone expedition, the condition of the Navy,
							and the Finances drew forth few observations— On the pecuniary
							embarrassments of the Country, the distressed and decayed state of the
							manufactures, and the aspect of the Treasury Department, little was
							said, and I think the Message will be found meagre, by the Public— There
							was an introductory paragraph speaking of the reassembling of Congress
							at the Capitol, as an Event more important than it deserves. Crawford
							advised to let it down to a very brief and unassuming notice, or even to
							strike it out altogether— In the allusion to the State of the Treasury,
							the sums were announced in Millions of Dollars and so many <hi
								rend="italic">Cents</hi>— Crawford proposed to strike out the Cents,
							and the dollars under hundreds of thousands; justly observing that round
							numbers, and general expressions were more suitable to an Executive
							Message; and that units and fractions of dollars might be left to the
							Report from the Treasury Department— When the rest of the Message, a
							very long one, was gone through, the President said, that was all,
							except one subject, which as this was a new <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>subject</hi> Congress he thought it his duty to recommend to their
							consideration— He then produced a manuscript long enough itself for two
							moderate Messages, recommending the proposal by Congress of an Amendment
							to the Constitution, authorizing them to make internal improvements by
							Roads and Canals; with an elaborate argument to prove that the authority
							has not been given by the <pb type="ms" n="222"/>Constitution— It is a
							paper which he drew up last winter, and was then anxious to communicate
							in some way to Congress— He then read it at a Cabinet Meeting—but
							finally postponed producing it to the public at that time. After he had
							now read it through, a general silence ensued, until I remarked that
							when the Message at the commencement of the first Session of the last
							Congress was prepared I had taken the Liberty of suggesting some
							considerations upon which it appeared to me desirable that the whole
							paragraph should be omitted— I now retained the same opinion, and the
							course pursued by Congress on that subject since the former Message, had
							in my mind added new motives for the omission of it at present— The
							debates in the House of Representatives on that part of the former
							message had been full of imitation and not altogether respectful to the
							Executive— It had been asserted that the expression of his opinion had
							not been given the proper time, a large portion, perhaps a majority of
							the House of Representatives had voted for Resolutions in opposition to
							that opinion— There is a moral certainty that if the President now
							recommends the proposal of an amendment to the Constitution, it will be
							without effect— The argument will be encountered by argument, and a
							conflict between the Executive and the Legislative, always to be
							deprecated in the administration of this Government will not only be
							established, but appear to have been invited and provoked by the
							President, and under circumstances in which no useful purpose could be
							effected by it— I was however on this as on the former occasion without
							support from any other member of the Administration— The President
							admitted as usual that there was great weight in my suggestions, but
							said as this was a new Congress whose opinions might be supposed not
							pre-occupied on the question he thought it his duty to give them
							explicitly his opinions on the subject— Crawford was more wary than
							candid in his remarks— He balanced the reasons pro and con; admitted
							that it was an affair of great delicacy, and that this part of the
							message would be sharply criticised; but still flattered the President
							with the hope that there might be a majority of Congress agreeing in
							opinion with him, sufficient to carry an Amendment to the Constitution,
							which a competent number of the State Legislatures would ratify—
							Crawford knows better— But dans les malheurs de nos meilleurs amis nous
							trouvons toujours quelque chose qu’ne nous déplait pas— Crawford is not
							unwilling to see this disagreement between the President and Congress,
							fester and inflame— It will all turn to his account— Wirt hinged much
							upon the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> of the President to recommend an
							amendment to the Constitution; and said <persRef ref="clay-henry"
								>Clay</persRef> last winter had denied it— Crawford said Clay was
							heated— But that he was very likely to start such an objection— I
							observed that I had no doubt of the right; though as by the
							Constitution, Amendments are the only acts of the Legislature in which
							the President has no participation there may be some colour for the
							question; but it was upon the expediency of the recommendation that my
							doubts were founded. However, the President had determined, I have no
							doubt upon long determination, to send it; and he has probably motives
							for this measure which he has not disclosed— It is to all apparent
							purposes so injudicious, that the President who is a man of strong
							judgment, and great discretion would certainly not produce it, without
							objects to answer, adequate to balance the ill effects which he cannot
							but see it will be attended with in Congress— He has been brought into
							mortifying dilemma’s, by his declaration of faith on the internal
							improvement question; for Congress have passed acts to all appearance in
							the face of his opinions, which acts, he has with great reluctance
							approved— This has given the appearance of inconsistency between his
							doctrine and his conduct which he has severely felt, and he draws nice
							distinctions to reconcile them together, which will be sharply sifted in
							Congress and by the public— The Cabinet Meeting broke up between four
							and five O’Clock— Poletica called at my house this Evening, and shewed
							me three Letters which he had received since he had been with me in the
							Morning— One was from <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl">Count
								Nesselrode</persRef>, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs; dated
							at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg in September; it is in
							answer to Poletica’s first despatches after he arrived here, and
							expresses great satisfaction at the frankness and confidence of my
							communications with him; and a hope that they would be continued in the
							same Spirit— The second was from Pozzo di Borgo, the Russian Ambassador
							at Paris, and expresses great concern at the refusal of Spain to ratify
							the Treaty; and great apprehensions that we shall resort to force to
							take possession of Florida; by which it says we shall lose the good will
							of the European Powers which is now with us— The third was from
							Tatischeff—Russian Ambassador in Spain, but written at Paris; where he
							was on his way to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg, on a leave
							of absence nine months— It was in answer to a Letter from Poletica to
							him, which was sent by the Hornet, and in which he <pb type="ms" n="223"
							/>urged him to use his influence with the Spanish Government in favour
							of the ratification of the Treaty, and recommends <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef> to him— Tatischeff answer that
							he should have taken great satisfaction in promoting the ratification,
							but that Forsyth’s character was said to be unsocial (peu liant) and as
							he spoke none of the languages of the Continent of Europe, they could
							not converse together— Poletica said that he had brought those Letters
							to shew them to me; immediately after receiving them, to confirm, what
							he had told me this Morning.</p>

							and <persRef ref="silsbee-nathaniel">Silsbee</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lincoln-enoch">Lincoln</persRef> of the House of

									>r</hi> Hersant</persRef> came to me from <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef>; to enquire when he could see me at my Office,
							for which I appointed one O’Clock. He came and told me that he had
							received very recent despatches from his Government, by a young man
							attached to the Consulate— That <persRef ref="lesseps-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lesseps</persRef>, whom I had known as
							French Consul in Russia, had arrived at Philadelphia, with a Commission
							as Consul there and <persRef ref="petry-jean">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Petry</persRef> was appointed Consul General to reside
							at this City. He also said he was informed that the Spanish Minister who
							is to come for explanations is on his way; and it was supposed would
							have arrived before the Hornet— He did not know with what Instructions
							he would come; but the French Government supposed the principal subject
							upon which he would have to ask explanations would be the Affairs of
							South-America— Something might be said upon the subject of the grants,
							but they would not ultimately make a difficulty, if we would give a
							pledge not to recognize any of the South-American Insurgents— A positive
							stipulation might perhaps be asked, but he knew perfectly well that
							would not be granted— But an implied engagement might be given,
							altogether secret which would be satisfactory to Spain, and it might
							amount to no more than to say that the United States would not recognize
							the Independence of South America, unless in concert with France. I told
							him that if that was the proposal with which <persRef ref="vives-don"
								>General Vives</persRef> was coming, the best thing he could do,
							would be the moment he should land in the United States, to embark again
							and return home— It would be of no use for him to come here. As to the
							affair of the grants, we would give him every explanation that he could
							reasonably require. But as to any thing out of the Treaty, we shall
							declare ourselves also ready to give any explanation that Spain can
							require, after the exchange of the Ratifications of the Treaty. He
							appeared to be somewhat discomposed at this, but kept his good humour
							better than I did mine— I told him that from Consideration for the
							earnest wishes of France the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> would ask of Congress only a contingent
							authority to occupy Florida, not to be used without necessity; and he
							would yet give Spain a last opportunity to terminate amicably her
							differences with us— She should have one more warning to do us Justice;
							but I intreated him to urge his Court, if they had any influence with
							Spain, to use it there, to avoid extremities— If M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Vives should not bring a ratification, we should consider
							negotiations as exhausted— He told me that his Government had sent him
							copies of <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Forsyth’s</persRef> note to the <persRef ref="melgarejo-joaquin"
								>Duke of San Fernando</persRef> and the Duke’s answer. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth’s Note was very harsh— I said the
							conduct of Spain was still more so— He asked how it was possible for us
							to know that <persRef ref="onis-luis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Onis</persRef> had not transcended his instructions? I said he, de
							Neuville himself had told me so— Onis had told me that by his
							Instructions he could have ceded the kingdom of Mexico— The <persRef
								ref="casairujo-carlos">Marquis of Casa-Yrujo</persRef> had told
								<persRef ref="erving-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Erving</persRef> ten times that Onis had Carte Blanche— The Duke of
							San Fernando did not pretend that Onis had transcended his
							Instructions—and how could he? what was the grand Cross of Isabella
							given for to him de Neuville; but for the part he had taken in the
							Negotiation. Why was every individual, down to copying Clerks who had
							been employed upon the Treaty, decorated with orders. He said all that
							was very true; but this South American question was all important to
							Spain, and if we refused to give them the pledge they asked what motive
							would the king of Spain have to ratify the Treaty?—what motive said I—to
							fulfil this engagements—to perform his plighted word—to do justice to
							those whom he acknowledges Spain has wronged. For us it is enough; it
							ought to be enough for him that his Minister duly authorised, and with
							unlimited full powers had signed the Treaty in his name and he was bound
							to ratify it. We cannot buy his ratification— He must give it, or we
							must do ourselves justice. We would give explanations of any thing,
							after the Ratification; and in the meantime I could tell him <pb
								type="ms" n="224"/>him the explanation we should give him upon any
							proposal to stipulate or promise not to acknowledge the Independence of
							South-America; it would be a direct and positive refusal; and if the
							Minister wished to have it given in due diplomatic form it should be
							given, in the most authentic manner— He said he did not see then, but
							that it would be quite as well for Spain, to let us occupy Florida, and
							retain her claim upon it— I thought the difference would be that by
							ratifying the Treaty she will have arranged everything with us amicably,
							leaving no root of bitterness behind; while in the other she will have
							made the same sacrifice of indemnity without giving satisfaction— This

							with regard to the Slaves carried away by the British Officers after the
							War, and sent them to him.</p>

								>President</persRef>— <persRef ref="tayloe-john">General

								ref="laserna-mateo">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> La
								Serna</persRef>; and also M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Antrobus,
							with Sir Charles Saxton— I found <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> with the President; who
							was discussing with him the question about the part of his proposed
							Message to Congress recommending an Amendment of the Constitution giving
							Congress the power to make internal improvements by Roads and Canals— He
							said he had deliberately considered the objections which I had suggested
							the other day, and they had determined him to strike out all the
							argumentative part, and to retain if anything only the passage in which
							he enumerates all the <pb type="ms" n="225"/>advantages which the Union
							would derive from the investment of such a power in Congress; and his
							opinion that the power is not given by the Constitution— I renewed and
							repeated all the arguments which I had before used, to prevail upon him
							to leave it out altogether— There was as I had supposed a motive which
							he had not mentioned till now for saying something upon the subject in
							this message— When he was upon his tour last Summer, and passed through
							Lexington Kentucky, Clay who lives there, was absent from home, at
							New-Orleans, and was supposed to have absented himself on purpose— An
							attempt was made by some of his partizans to make the inhabitants of the
							town pass a slight upon the President, by omitting to shew him
							attentions similar to those with which he had been received elsewhere.
							The effect of it was that the respect shewn him there was rather more
							strongly marked than in almost any other place— A Committee from the
							town went out fifteen Miles from it to meet him, and accompanied by a
							numerous cavalcade escorted him in. They presented him a very respectful
							address; in which however they said something about internal
							improvements— He answered by declaring that he was deeply impressed with
							the importance and necessity of them; but believing that the Power to
							make them had not been granted to Congress by the Constitution, he was
							anxious that it should be given to them by amendment. With this they
							professed to be entirely satisfied— It was to make known to the Nation
							that his objections to the making of internal improvements by the
							authority of Congress was neither to the improvements themselves, nor to
							the necessity that Congress should possess the power of making them; but
							simply that the power has not been given by the Constitution; that he
							had thought of introducing this part of his Message— He finally asked
							me, what I thought would be the impression in the Eastern States if he
							should insert it— I said that as far as I knew any thing of the
							sentiments of the Eastern States, the general impression there was of
							satisfaction with his administration; and although there was there, as
							elsewhere great division of opinion, upon the Constitutional power of
							Congress to make internal improvements, yet all were disposed to
							acquiesce in his opinion so far as not to wish to have the subject
							agitated for the present— M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Wirt said, that
							unless such an amendment should pass, here was a great and important
							power of Government which must remain inert— And if the President
							thought its exercise necessary, was it not his duty to say so, even if
							it was probable that it would produce no immediate effect— I replied
							that the President, if it was a duty, had already discharged it. The
							power must remain inert; if it were possible, which it certainly is not
							to obtain two thirds of both Houses of Congress to vote for such an
							Amendment, it would be utterly hopeless that three fourths of the State
							Legislatures would ratify it. The Legislatures of all the large States
							would be adverse to the grant; and if the President would permit me to
							say so, none more than the Legislature of Virginia itself— I could not
							pretend however to the knowledge of their sentiments which he must
							possess— He said he thought they would ratify it; but Wirt told me was
							of a different opinion— That <persRef ref="roane-spencer">judge
								Roane</persRef>, who was himself a host would be against such a
							grant of power with all his weight and influence— After a long and
							earnest discussion Wirt told the President that he believed it would be
							better to omit the whole paragraph; and the President determined that he
							would— This Resolution, importing as I know it does, a sacrifice both of
							opinion and of feeling, affords a very strong proof of his magnanimity,
							and of his disposition to listen to counsel—a disposition which in so
							high a place is an infallible test of a great mind. The advice that I
							have given him on this occasion was dictated by a pure regard for
							himself, and a deep conviction that if he had introduced the subject
							into the message at-all, it would have injured him and much increased
							the disquietude of his future public service— Wirt intimated an
							apprehension that New-York would make a handle of the President’s
							opposition to internal improvements, to get up a party against his
							re-election, and in favour of <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt
								Clinton</persRef>— I told him Clinton had enough to do to maintain
							himself as Governor of New-York, and would certainly have no party to
							make him President at the next Election— The President turned to another
							part of the Message, and read the paragraph that Wirt had drawn,
							recommending a particular amendment to the Laws for preserving
							neutrality— It was long, and dwelt entirely upon a matter of detail. The
							President <pb type="ms" n="226"/>said he had read it yesterday to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour the Senator, who had told him that
							even that would excite some unfavourable feeling— I said I thought a
							recommendation in more general terms, with a strong expression of
							sentiment would be better, and the President drew a short paragraph to
							that effect, which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt preferred as a
							substitute for his own. While we were there the Committee from the two
							Houses, <persRef ref="macon-nathaniel">Macon</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="burrill-james">Burrill</persRef> of the Senate, <persRef
								ref="nelson-hugh">Hugh Nelson</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="storrs-henry">Storrs</persRef> of the House came to inform the
							President that a Quorum of both was formed, and that they were ready to
							receive any communication from him— He received and answered that he
							should send them a Message to-morrow, and then they came with him into
							his Cabinet— I gave my hand to all of them— Storrs seemed for a moment
							to hesitate whether he would take it, but it was an involuntary movement
							which he subdued, and took it freely. He attacked me last Winter with
							great violence in a Speech on the Seminole War debate, and since then
							has seemed to avoid speaking to me, as if supposing I had taken offence
							at it. But I had no such feeling— The President told me that several
							members had come to him yesterday, and asked him whether it would be
							advisable to displace Clay, as Speaker. He had advised against it— First
							because it would be giving M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay more
							consequence than belongs to him. Secondly, because M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, in the course which he has pursued
							and is pursuing against the administration has injured his own influence
							more than theirs— If it should be necessary to put him down, let it be
							done by his Constituents— Thirdly, because there is no member of the
							Administration from the Western Country— It is gratifying to them to
							have one of their members, Speaker of the House— There is no other
							person from the Western Section, sufficiently eminent to put in
							competition with him— If he should be dismissed they would feel hurt in
							their pride, and be stimulated to take part with him— It would be best
							to leave him his chair— In all this I think the President has acted and
							spoken wisely— It was near five when I left the President’s— Evening at
							the Journal.</p>

							they had spoken of it. I had not seen the French Minister, and although
							I met M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torres yesterday at dinner, he said
							nothing to me of the Message. The President appeared to be uneasy on the
							subject of South-America, and said he understood <persRef
								ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> had
							given notice that he intended to bring forward again in the house the
							question for the acknowledgment of Buenos-Ayres— And excepting that he
							said he did not know that there was anything upon which a systematic and
							organized effort against the Administration could be made in Congress— I
							observed that the great battery opened upon the Administration at the
							Session before last, was South-America. That of the last Session was the
							Seminole War— It was perhaps not possible to foretell where the enemies
							of the administration would think they could discern its weak side, to
							direct their attack against it. I thought the South-American question
							was too much worn out; and although M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							would certainly bring it up <pb type="ms" n="227"/>again, there would be
							members enough in the house, able and willing to maintain the argument
							against him, and I questioned whether he could now get a stronger final
							vote than he had obtained two years ago, on that topic— The President
							replied that last year and the year before, <persRef
								ref="pazos-vincente">Pazos</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="clemente-lino">Clemente</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="aguirre-manuel">Aguirre</persRef> had been used as tools
							against the Administration; the course they had taken was in concert
							with and dictated by Clay— He had suspected so at the time, but had
							lately received information strongly confirming the suspicion— In fact
							Torres himself had told him as much; and assured him that the authority
							upon which he was acting, was founded on principles entirely different.
							His instructions were to press nothing upon this Government contrary to
							its wishes or its policy; and he should act accordingly— I observed that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torres had made the same professions
							to me; but so had <persRef ref="deforest-david">De Forest</persRef> last
							Winter, and yet had been one of the most troublesome of the South
							American Agents— I added that there would be before the Congress, all
							the monied embarrassments of the Country— The affairs of the Bank—the
							Manufacturing claims, and the Missouri Slave question, which might
							excite ardent debates— He said the Executive had nothing to do with
							either of them; which is true so far, that the Executive is not yet at
							issue upon either of them— If he ultimately escapes them all, he will be
							more fortunate than I anticipate— I said I had received a Letter from
								<persRef ref="pope-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Pope</persRef> of Kentucky, in which without much further
							explanation he had written “let the administration be prepared to be
							attacked about the Yellow Stone expedition”; and I heard here, and even
							in Boston obscure intimations of complaint against that expectation, and
							surmises against <persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Richard M. Johnson</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="johnson-james3">his brother</persRef>, who are the
							contractors for supplies to the troops employed upon it. The honesty of
							the Johnson’s is deeply implicated, and rumours are afloat that advances
							have been made to them by the Government, which will eventuate in a loss
							of public money. And that the whole Estate of the late <persRef
								ref="brent-robert">Pay-master General Robert Brent</persRef> was in
							jeopardy for such advances which cannot be accounted for according to
							Law— He said that <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Daniel Brent</persRef> after the death of his brother
							Robert had come to him, and mentioned that the Estate was made
							responsible for certain advances made during the late War, by an order
							from him M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, while he was acting
							Secretary at War, of which he had no recollection whatever;—but that he
							did not suppose that those advances had been made to Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson— He had heard that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had censured the <hi rend="italic"
								>cost</hi> of the Yellow-Stone expedition; but there was no measure
							of the Administration which had given so general satisfaction in the
							Western Country as that— While he was in Kentucky, a paper expressing
							the highest approbation of it, and recommending earnestly the Johnson’s
							as contractors for it was presented to him, signed by <persRef
								ref="shelby-isaac">Governor Shelby</persRef>, by <persRef
								ref="jackson-general">General Jackson</persRef> as an individual,
							and by <persRef ref="morrison-james2">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Morrison</persRef> and many others persons of the highest character
							and consideration— And as to the advances made, <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							declares that the Government are amply secured against loss— But
								<persRef ref="mason-john3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mason</persRef>, brother of <persRef ref="mason-armistead">him
								who</persRef> was killed here last winter in a duel, and who is now
							Marshal of Kentucky told the President that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay was desirous of withdrawing from his situation here, by
							being elected Governor of Kentucky; and his friends were confident of
							his success, if Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Richard M. Johnson,
							who would be his competitor, should withdraw from the contest— Johnson
							had been applied to for that purpose by some of Clay’s friends; but
							after consulting some friends of his own had declined to withdraw— If
							Clay therefore should make a formal attack upon the Yellow-Stone
							expedition, its object probably be to cripple Johnson’s character, so
							that he might not be in his way as a Candidate for the Governors Office.
							This may be—but I doubt much of Clay’s wish to be Governor of Kentucky
							at present— I also doubt whether he will make any public complaint about
							the Yellow-Stone expedition— I spoke to the President as to the time
							when <persRef ref="graham-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Graham’s</persRef> Salary should commence, upon which he came to no
							final determination; and read him a draft of an answer to Antrobus, on
							the case of the <persRef ref="crooks-unknown">Crooks’s</persRef> claim,
							which he approved— He directed me also to see <persRef
								ref="jackson-william">Major W. Jackson</persRef>, and propose to him
							to go upon this agency to Chili— <persRef ref="parkman-samuel">M<hi

						<p><pb type="ms" n="228"/><date>9. VI:30.</date> There came to the Office a
								<persRef ref="kendrick-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kenrick</persRef>, inventor of a machine for removing the Bars of
							Rivers by deepening the Water— He brought a drawing and a model of the
							machine; which is a complicated plough, to be drawn by a Steam boat— He
							supposes that by breaking up the ground at the bottom of the river;
							where the current is strong it will carry away the clods and deepen the
							channel to any desired extent— He brought with him several
							recommendatory certificates, and I had sometime since a Letter from
								<persRef ref="brooks-john">Governor Brooks</persRef> recommending
							him. His object is to petition Congress to supply funds necessary for
							making the experiment; and he asked me to apply to the <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">President</persRef> for permission to exhibit his
							model, and explain his plan to him— The President himself called at the
							Office, to give some directions concerning the agent who is going to the
							Coast of Africa to receive the Africans who are to be sent there. To my
							great surprize I found that he was to be furnished with a credit of
							twenty thousand Dollars upon the <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander;baring-thomas" type="multi">House of
								Barings</persRef> in London to be expended for the support of blacks
							in Africa, who are to be sent there from the United States— I asked the
							President if it was clear that the Executive was authorised to incur
							this expence by the Act of the last Session— He thought so; but said he
							would have a general consultation of the administration upon it, at his
							house at twelve O’Clock to-morrow— He also spoke of instructing <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> to apply to the French Government soliciting
							their interposition with Spain to induce the ratification of the Treaty,
							without compelling us to do Justice to ourselves— I said I thought it
							would be better to press this upon <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de Neuville</persRef> here, than
							to make it a subject of direct instruction to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin. By urging it through the French Minister here, the
							motives to be suggested will be of a general nature; applying as much to
							the interests of France, as to those of this Union— But a direct
							instruction to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin to apply to the
							French Government might have the appearance of soliciting their
							interposition— I had already impressed upon M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> De Neuville the importance of France’s using all her
							influence with Spain for the preservation of Peace; and as soon as
							Congress shall have acted on the subject. I proposed to instruct M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin as well as <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>,
							&amp; <persRef ref="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> to make known the intentions of this Government, in
							the course they pursue— I spoke to the President of the necessity of
							fixing upon some person as a Minister to Russia instead of <persRef
								ref="campbell-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Campbell</persRef>, who if not already on his way to return, will
							come home in the Spring— He said he had not thought of anyone, but
							observed that at the time of the appointment of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Campbell, <persRef ref="harrison-william">General
								Harrison</persRef> had been mentioned— I named <persRef
								ref="middleton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Middleton</persRef>, as a person peculiarly fitted for this Mission,
							as being from a state the inhabitants of which had suffered most by the
							loss of Slaves; and as being by his great fortune able to bear the
							expence of residing as a Public Minister, without starving upon the
							Salary allowed— The President said he did not know but M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton would be as good an appointment
							as could be made, and asked if he would accept—which I did not know— He
							said that in South Carolina there was also <persRef ref="poinsett-joel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Poinsett</persRef>— From all
							this I conclude that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton is quite
							out of the question— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> had this Evening a
							party at tea of nearly a hundred persons, about one third of which were
							Ladies. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de Neuville told me, he was
							entirely satisfied with the President’s Message— <persRef
								ref="poletica-pierre">Poletica</persRef> spoke to me of the
							appointment of a Minister to Russia, and said that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Poinsett would be extremely acceptable to
							the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>— This coincidence shews
							that there has already been intriguing with the President for this

									>r</hi> de Mun</persRef> came to my Office this Morning with a
							Note from the French Minister <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Hyde
								de Neuville</persRef> expressing surprize and regret at learning
							this morning that his notes connected with the Florida Negotiation were
							to be published with the documents annexed to the message. His objection
							however is only to a passage in my Observations of 24. July last
							addressed to him, in which he was reminded of having said to me while we
							were discussing the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article of the
							Florida Treaty that <persRef ref="onis-luis">Onis</persRef> had a
							special motive for having it so drawn as to annul the grants, for the
							vindication of his character from aspersions in our newspapers which had
							asserted that he had a personal interest in them— When I saw M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> de Neuville at New-York, he objected to a
							particular expression that I had used in the Note of 24. July, importing
							that he had told me Onis made it a <hi rend="italic">point of
								honour</hi> to annul the grants—he had not used those words; but he
							had very distinctly conveyed the idea— However <pb type="ms" n="229"/>as
							de Neuville was extremely unwilling to have the remark itself go to the
							Public, and as he hinged his objection upon the words Point of honour,
							the whole passage was omitted in the copy of the observations
							communicated to Congress—which I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							de Mun to tell him— There was a Cabinet Meeting at the President’s at
							Noon. Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi><persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">Thompson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef>, present. The Act of Congress
							against the Slave trade of the last Session, and the questions of
							Construction arising from it were under consideration. The Colonization
							Society are indefatigable in their efforts to get hold of the funds
							appropriated by that act; and having got the ear of the President, and
							Crawford for purposes of his own being one of them, they have already
							got their fingers into the purse; the Government is to pay 1500 dollars
							for half the freight of a vessel they are about sending to Africa— Their
							Colony is to be formed at the Island of Sherbro on the Coast of Guinea,
							about five degrees North of the Line; so perfect a desert, that they are
							to send out even the timber to build the huts in which their Colonists
							are to dwell. And with all the multitudes of their members and auxiliary
							Societies, and newspaper puff’s, they have no funds, and they are
							ravenous as Panthers for the appropriation of 100000 dollars of the last
							Session. Crawford’s construction of the Law, would deliver up to them
							the whole of it, without reserve, though he professes to be very much
							upon his guard against them, and to have no belief in their success—
								<persRef ref="ayers-eli">This agent</persRef> with a discretionary
							credit of twenty thousand dollars upon London is a clear forecast of
							what is to follow— Wirt in the first instance construed the Law, still
							more strictly than I did— He was brought over, by the arguments of
							Crawford, who is ready to make a Colony, out of the Law of the last
							Session; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson, who thinks the law
							very loosely worded and that it ought to be explained, still thinks it
							will admit of a liberal construction, to give effect to the President’s
							power of spending the money. Crawford urges the most liberal
							construction, because the object of the act is beneficent, and affects
							no rights. I objected that there was no authority given by the Law to
							spend money to maintain the blacks in Africa at all. That if the
							authority is to be assumed constructively I see no limit to it but the
							amount of the appropriation, which will be soon expended if we are to
							maintain the Colony, and which will plunge us deep enough, into the plan
							to bind the honour of the Nation to further appropriations. The money is
							to be entrusted to the discretion of an Agent under little
							responsibility; and from the tendency of all such expenditures, to
							swell, exemplified in the application of similar funds to the relief of
							distressed American Seamen, and in the army pensioner Law, this would
							soon become a drain upon the Nation— Then would come complaints of
							extravagance and waste— Then enquiries in Congress how the money has
							been spent, and then by what authority. Then too would come the temper,
							not so well disposed to construe the law liberally, or to regard it as
							exclusively beneficent— And the time for the Executive to think of all
							this is now— The President finally concluded to pay half the freight of
							this ship now, and then to send a Message to Congress, informing them
							how the Law has been understood and acted upon; and then if Congress do
							nothing to explain the Law, it will give the function of their tacit
							assent to the liberal construction, and the discretionary expenditure—
							There was little time for doing any thing at the Meeting, at my Office—

							to reply to that objection, the Salaries of our Ministers abroad being
							so excessively inadequate to their necessary expences that they could
							not remain long in Europe without drawing upon their private resources—
							But as I expected more from him than from any other man living, to the
							benefit of the public service of this Nation, I wished from purely
							public motives that he could go and spend some time in Europe, because I
							was convinced it would much enlarge his sphere of usefulness, by
							familiarizing him with facts and a description of knowledge, which could
							in no other way be acquired— He said he was well aware that a long and
							familiar practical acquaintance with Europe, was indispensable to
							complete the Education of an American Statesman; and regretted that his
							Fortune would not bear the cost of it. We had not time to continue the
							discussion, but I told him I should speak to him about it again. As I

							produced a Letter from B. Oden to authorise the transfer of so much of

							Swedish Government for indemnity on account of the seizure of a number
							of vessels and Cargoes, at Stralsund in the year 1810— The memorial was

							told Burrill that Negotiation had been exhausted upon this subject, and
							that the Memorialists had better apply to Congress.— I mentioned to him
							what had been done, by <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi

							that the Correspondence had not been altogether temperate on our <pb

							with Spain, it might not be altogether politic to shew ourselves to all

							and said he should advise the claimants to petition to Congress. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Buck came upon the claim of the owners of
							the Cargo of the Brig Hendrick who were Hamburgers— This affair was

							approved the draft of an answer to the Question of the Committee; and
							shewed me the Message he had prepared upon the Slave-trade Act of the

							the Act, and the authority to spend money to the amount of twenty five
							thousand dollars, in Africa, to support the exported Slaves there; and
							then left Congress to decide whether this was or was not the correct
							construction of the Act— If not, Congress are to pass an explanatory or

							the Construction, or to appear in opposition to the Construction of the

							saying that the whole is still under the Consideration of Congress, and
							subject to their controul. The President also spoke to me, on the
							subject of the etiquette of visits— It would seem that some of the
							Senators have been to him to complain that the Secretary of State
							refuses to pay them the first visit— He mentioned it with much delicacy,
							but observed that it occasioned uneasiness, heart burnings, and severe

							President’s to consider the important question of etiquette in visiting—
							The members of the Senate it seems, not content with their rule that
							they will pay no first visit, but to the President, take it in dudgeon
							that the heads of Departments do not always pay the first visit to them—
							And it has come to the point of a complaint to the President, who
							inclined to think it would be well for the heads of Departments to
							indulge this humour of the Senators; and then, to avoid an invidious
							discrimination between the two Houses, to do the same thing by the
							Members of the House, and at the commencement of every Session of
							Congress to send round to all the lodging houses in the City about two
							hundred and thirty cards for each head of department. This however did
							not suit the views of any of us— We found however that we had no uniform
							practice, and each one was much disposed to adhere to his own. After
							discussing the matter about two hours, we could come to no other
							conclusion, than that each one should follow his own course— There are
							so many adverse pretensions that it is not possible to avoid giving
							offence to some—and it is equally ineffectual to defy or indulge the
							pretensions of the proud— The rule that I proposed was to separate
							entirely the official character from the practice of personal
							visiting—to pay no visits but for sake of friendship or acquaintance,
							and then without enquiring which is first or which is last and that
							their wives should practice the same— <persRef

							insists upon adhering to this system, though it gives offence to all the
							stranger Ladies who come here without happening to be the wives of
							Congressmen—and are therefore not honoured with <persRef
								ref="crawford-susanna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

									>r</hi> Mark Langdon Hill</persRef>, a Representative in

							this morning at my house to enquire concerning the papers relative to

							between the United States, and the British Colonies in the West-Indies
							and in North-America. I had directed that all the papers should be <pb

								>r</hi> Hill appeared to incline to a total prohibition of

								<persRef ref="king-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								King</persRef>, and <persRef ref="gray-william">William
								Gray</persRef> of Boston expressing the same opinion— He was very
							desirous of knowing what were the views of the Executive Government on
							this subject; and I promised to mention it to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>— I had much conversation with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hill upon various topics;
							particularly upon our commercial relations with Russia, and the
							political transactions while I was there— He also shewed me a Letter
							from <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef> to the late <persRef ref="langdon-john">John
								Langdon</persRef> of New-Hampshire, written in the year 1810. full
							of his political Shandyism; a mixture of profound and sagacious
							observation with strong prejudices, and irritated passions. It is a sort
							of epitome of his political opinions and feelings— Jefferson is one of
							the Great Men whom this Country has produced, one of the men, who has
							contributed largely to the formation of our national character—to much
							that is good, and to not a little that is evil in our sentiments and
							manners— His Declaration of Independence is an abridged Alcoran of
							political doctrine; laying open the first foundations of civil
							Society—but he does not appear to have been aware that is also laid open
							a precipice into which the Slave-holding Planters of his Country, sooner
							or later must fall— With the Declaration of Independence on their lips
							and the merciless Scourge of Slavery in their hands, a more flagrant
							image of human inconsistency can scarcely be conceived than one of our
							Southern Slave-holding Republicans— Jefferson has been himself all his
							life a Slave-holder; but he has published opinions so blasting to the
							very existence of Slavery, that however creditable they may be to his
							candour and humanity, they speak not much for his prudence or his
							forecast as a Virginian Planter— The seeds of the Declaration of
							Independence are yet maturing— The Harvest will be what <persRef
								ref="west-benjamin">West the Painter</persRef> calls the terrible
							sublime— <persRef ref="woodbridge-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Woodbridge</persRef> the Delegate from the Michigan
							Territory; and who is also the Secretary of the Territory, came with
								<persRef ref="cook-daniel">Daniel Pope Cook</persRef>, Member from
							Illinois. Woodbridge said he had heard, that application had been made
							to the President, for the appointment of Secretary to the Territory, as
							if it were vacated by his election as a Delegate— But that this had not
							been his understanding, nor the intention of those who had elected him—
							They did not consider the Offices of Secretary and Delegate for the
							Territory as incompatible; and if they should be thought so by Congress
							of the President, he should resign his seat, and wish to be considered a
							candidate for re-appointment as Secretary— I said I would mention it to
							the President, but I had not heard of any application for the Office—
							Cook told me that the District Attorney in Illinois held an Office under
							the State, which by the Constitution of the State was incompatible with
							it— Which he wished might be known to the President— I promised to
							mention it, but said I thought the President would be of opinion that as
							the incompatibility was by the State Constitution, it would be for the
							State Authorities to apply the remedy— He said he had supposed that this
							would be the President’s conclusion; but as the fact was that the
							Governor of the State would not carry the Constitutional prohibition
							into effect, he had thought it best that the Circumstance should be
							communicated to the President— The <persRef ref="tompkins-daniel"
								>Vice-President, Tompkins</persRef>, called and returned my visit. I
							spoke to him on the affair of etiquette visiting; and told him I should
							write him a private Letter concerning it, and should request him to shew
							it to the members of the Senate, which he said he would. He observed
							that <persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef>, the Secretary of the Navy had spoken of it to
							him; that he thought our principle was correct, but that some of the
							Southern Members, and especially <persRef ref="brown-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown</persRef> of Louisiana and
								<persRef ref="gaillard-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gaillard</persRef> of South-Carolina, were peculiarly tenacious in
							their claim to a first visit. And the principle upon which they rested
							their claim was that the Senate being by their concurrence to
							appointments a component part of the Supreme Executive, therefore
							Senators ought to be first visited by Heads of Departments— I said I
							thought the conclusion not logical; and if it was it would require that
							Senators at home should visit every member of the Legislatures by which
							they were chosen, a practice which certainly existed no where. He said
							it would apply still more strongly to the members of the Council of
							Appointment in New-York, who not only voted on appointments but had a
							right of <hi rend="italic">nominating</hi>, concurrent with the
							Governor— He says the same question of the first visit is made with
							these Senators by Members of the House of Representatives, and that
							there are many Members of the House with whom M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Brown will not associate, because they refuse to pay him a
							first visit— So that this question of <pb type="ms" n="238"/>etiquette
							visiting is becoming quite an affair of State— The calls of so many
							persons at my house made me very late this Morning at my Office; where I
							had a long visit from <persRef ref="obrien-richard">Captain
								O’Brien</persRef>; who came for a Passport to the fifth Auditor,
								<persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">Pleasonton</persRef> for a budget

							right to attend the Drawing Room, had not only come himself, but brought
							another person still more improper with him, who had abused and

								>Antrobus’s</persRef> to force his way into the Hall of entrance— Of
							these petty untoward incidents there will always be more or less, where

						<!-- This is a summary entry without a date.-->
						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> Congress having been in Session the greater part of
							this Month, my occupations, and the distribution of my time have been in
							some measure influenced by them— As the longest nights, and the severity
							of Winter have come on, my rising hour has grown later— Dining and
							Evening parties are also frequently recurring, and absorb many precious
							hours— My personal acquaintance among the members of Congress, becomes
							more extensive, and more burdensome. Visiting has taken up more time—
							The necessary consequence of which is that little real and important
							business is effected— The prolixity of the Diary is yet unabated.</p>
						<p>And thus closes another year upon the irredeemable ages of time past. In
							the political annals of my life, it has been distinguished as a year of
							great promise and great disappointment— The Florida Treaty if ratified
							would have been an important event— It has proved a magnificent
							abortion— Events of a painful nature have occurred in my private and
							domestic relations— Nothing has prospered in the course of the year; but
							my life and health, and the nearest and dearest of my friends and
							relatives have been preserved— My worldly concerns though not favoured
							with any instances of success have suffered no severe shock; and
							innumerable mercies have called for numberless streams of gratitude from
							my heart to the Fountain of all Good— With unbounded thankfulness for
							the past, let me unite fervent supplications for the future. May the God
							of Mercy and of Consolation, still guide my steps, support my weakness;
							forgive my errors, and preserve me from crimes— May the blessings of an
							approving Conscience be mine, through the remnant of my days and at my
							latest breath; and may they be deserved and enjoyed by my children after
							me— May all my Passions be under the controul of my Judgment, and may my
							soul be elevated equally above the miseries and the enjoyments of this
							World. Prepare me Heavenly father for all the allotments of Earth; and
							purify me for all the felicities of Heaven.</p>
