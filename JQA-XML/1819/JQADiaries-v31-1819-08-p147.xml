							There was a Cabinet Meeting at the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef> from noon till four O’Clock. He proposed two
							Questions for consideration—1. Whether in the Event of the
							Non-ratification of the Spanish Treaty, at the Meeting of Congress next
							December, it will be proper for the President to recommend to Congress
							that authority should be given to the Executive to take possession of
							Florida—and 2. Whether a special Messenger should be sent immediately
							with Instructions to <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>, and what those Instructions should
							be. Upon the first there was no diversity of opinion. The obligation of
							the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">King of Spain</persRef> to ratify the
							Treaty was by all present considered as perfect— His full power to
								<persRef ref="onis-luis">Onis</persRef> being unlimited, and
							containing <hi rend="strikethrough">without reserve</hi> the promise,
							without reserve to ratify whatever he should sign and conclude. It was
							unanimously agreed that it would be proper for the Executive to
							recommend to Congress the measure of taking possession, and it was
							observed that from the experience in the case of the late war with
							England, Congress would not adopt the measure without such
							Recommendation. It was also agreed that a Messenger should be despatched
							with Instructions to Forsyth— The President inclined to the opinion that
							he should be ordered to declare that the Ratification of Spain would be
							accepted, even after the lapse of the stipulated six Months, if received
							here before the Meeting of Congress in December; but that if refused or
							delayed until that time, a full communication would be made to Congress
							of all the transactions relating to the Treaty, with a recommendation
							that they should immediately authorize the occupation of Florida; not as
							an act of hostility to Spain; but as an assertion of our own right,
							rendered necessary by the breach of faith on the part of Spain— <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> thought Forsyth should be instructed to demand
							the immediate ratification, and in the event of non-compliance to ask
							for his Passports.— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> on the
							contrary thought he should be instructed to remain at Madrid; and not
							even come away upon leave of absence, leaving <persRef
								ref="brent-thomas">T. Brent</persRef> as Chargé <pb type="ms"
								n="150"/>d’Affaires, as he is authorised to do, and intended— The
							President embraced this opinion also. He thought that to order Forsyth
							to demand his Passports would be equivalent to a declaration of War,
							which would not be advisable; as his intention to limit measures of
							force entirely to the assertion of our rights, explicitly disclaiming at
							the same time all intentions of general hostility— Crawford adhered
							steadily to his idea of instructing Forsyth to ask for his Passports and
							come away. He thought it could not be taken as a declaration of War, but
							that it would intimidate the Spanish Cabinet and compel them to an
							immediate ratification— He was however alone in his opinion, upon which
							I said very little, leaving the discussion to Crawford and Calhoun— I
							thought Forsyth’s Instructions should be, offering still to receive and
							transmit the Spanish Ratification, to state that, if not given, the
							President would make a full communication to Congress on the Subject,
							without saying that he should recommend the immediate occupation of
							Florida, but leaving that to be inferred by the Spaniards themselves. I
							thought a direct menace would be less dignified as regards Spain, and
							would leave the matter more free for debate in Congress—where umbrage
							might be taken, if the executive held out a threat to a foreign Nation,
							of that which it could not without express authority from Congress carry
							into Execution. This view was finally approved by the President, and I
							was charged to prepare the draft of an Instruction to Forsyth, and also
							Letters to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">A. Gallatin</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>, and <persRef

								>Poletica</persRef> and <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">de
								Neuville</persRef> on the subject— There was very little debate, and

							the only members of the Administration present besides myself. <persRef

							There are several appointments to be made— The Office of Register of
							Wills for the County of Washington is one— A list of all the Candidates
							and their recommendations were sent to the President. He named and
							remarked upon several of them; but came to no decision. <persRef

							Paymaster General— <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">Frye</persRef>, who

							Pennsylvania, who hashed up last Winter the Crambe bis cecta of

							bolstered by Senatorial influence, I conclude he will before long get
							into some office, where he may intrigue with members of Congress, if
							even he should fail at present. As the President did not directly ask my
							opinion upon the case I did not give one. As to the Office of District
							Judge for the District of Maryland, I found he appeared to have made up

								Brackenridge</persRef> offering his services in the Office.
							Brackenridge himself had been this Morning to my house, and had also
							called at the President’s and seen him, but had not asked for the
							appointment. I told the President of the objections made against Bland,
							and of the Deposition, which implicated him as personally interested in
							the Baltimore privateering Pirates. He directed me to send it over to
							him— He also gave me a Letter from the Selectmen of Boston to the
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Secretary of War</persRef>, complaining
							of an insulting Letter from a <persRef ref="scallan-james">Lieutenant

							where he is to be found—and another Letter from Scallan to the Selectmen
							disclaiming any intention of giving offence to any of those of Dexter’s
							hearers, who approved the Sentiment which had irritated him, were with
							the Letter— The President said the subject involved a variety of very
							delicate Considerations, and asked me to take and peruse the Papers, and
							give him my opinion upon what was to be done— At the Office, <persRef

							of the Hornet, called at my house: he wishes to return to Spain, and to
							be himself the bearer of the despatches to <persRef ref="forsyth-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>. I called at
							the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> and there met
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef>. We spoke of the complaint of the Selectmen of
							Boston against <persRef ref="scallan-james">Scallan</persRef>, and the
							President asked my opinion— I said I had found a difficulty in settling
							principles in the case— Scallan, of whom I have no other knowledge than
							from this affair, had rashly and foolishly written an insulting Letter,
							for a Sentiment uttered on a public occasion, in an official capacity,
							under the corporate authority of the town of Boston, for which, it <pb
								type="ms" n="152"/>being the place of my own residence, I had a
							peculiar regard, and respect. It was impossible for any one more
							strongly to disapprove this act, than I did; but a serious question with
							me was whether it was punishable by the President of the United States—
							The view taken of it in the Letter of the Selectmen, was a partial
							one—as a military offence against the civil authority— It was not a
							military Offence, merely because committed by a man holding a military
							commission— If punishable at all, it was as a breach of discipline, for
							which he should be tried by a Court Martial; but there was a Precedent,
							under the administration of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>, which shewed his opinion that the President of the
							United States could not with propriety take cognizance of it. I alluded
							to the complaint of <persRef ref="randolph-john">John
							Randolph</persRef>, against <persRef ref="reynolds-unknown2"
								>Reynolds</persRef>, an Officer who insulted him at the Theatre, for
							a Speech in the House of Representatives in which he had insulted the
							army. Randolph complained of it as a breach of the privileges of the
							House; and the President sent the complaint to the House as the judges
							of their own privileges— Calhoun said his impression was that the
							President should instantly dismiss Scallan from the Service, without
							trial or further enquiry. There was no question about the facts— They
							were admitted by Scallans own Letters. It was not a case for trial by a
							Court martial, for it was a military offence against the civil
							authority—a case in which a Court Martial, had too much of their own
							feeling involved to be a competent tribunal, and which the President
							ought in the most summary and decisive manner to punish— The President’s
							authority to dismiss an Officer from the army was absolute, and he was
							not obliged to assign any reason for exercising it, and as to the
							Precedent, it did not apply; because the House of Representatives had
							the power to punish breaches of its privileges; but the Town of Boston
							had not— I then insisted upon the equity of the principle of hearing the
							other side— Admitted the absolute power of the President to dismiss an
							Officer, but insisted that it ought to be exercised with great
							discretion, and only for just and powerful reasons— That the Act of
							Scallan was punishable at Law or it was not— If it was, there was no
							occasion for the interposition of the President— If it was not, the
							President was required to punish without hearing him, a man who had
							violated no Law— And if the President was to assume a censorial power,
							without regard to the Law, over every man holding a military Commission,
							what would be the Condition of the army?— I referred to the publication
							last Spring in the National Intelligencer by <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, or some of the
							Officers in his suite, against <persRef ref="lacock-abner"
								>Lacock</persRef>, and the report of the Committee of the Senate,
							and asked upon what principle they could have been overlooked, if
							Scallan was to be cashiered— The President then said that the subject
							was of so very delicate a nature that as a Precedent was to be settled
							he would take the opinion of the whole Cabinet and he directed me to
							pass the Papers over to <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Forsyth, and that <persRef ref="dodge-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Dodge</persRef> should be appointed Consul at

							But as his character had been assailed, he thought himself entitled to

							the substance of all that had been charged against him; and particularly
							of the deposition, in the President’s possession— He utterly denied
							having had any interest in any of the Baltimore privateers, explained

							a copy of it— He brought me Letters from <persRef ref="rodney-caesar"

							to him, about his going to Chili. Pinkney called upon me, ostensibly

							the draft of a despatch to <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi

							introducing some such matter into every important draft; to absorb that
							portion of the objecting Spirit, which must find exercise upon
							something; and which if alloy be not provided for it to cast off, is apt
							to fall upon the pure metal itself. He desired me to pass the draft over

								W. Pinkney</persRef> came to speak about the settlement of his
							Accounts— The questions relating to them, are for contingent expenses,
							at Naples, Vienna, and S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg; and
							also of the time, when his Salary was to commence—7. March 1810. the
							date of his Commission; or 15 May of the same year, when he was about to
							sail upon his Mission— I told him I would submit the questions to the
							determination of the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>. He
							says that although he was very kindly and generously treated by the
							Government in those Missions, he has been more than ten thousand dollars
							out of pocket, by them— There was a Cabinet Meeting at the President’s,
							attended by Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi><persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef>— <persRef ref="thompson-smith"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson</persRef> was too
							unwell to attend, and this Evening left the City to return to New-York.
							My despatch to <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef> was read,
							and scrutinized— The passages which I had foreseen would be objected to
							were expunged, and two or three other slight alterations were suggested
							and adopted— This sifting, and revising of every important paper that I
							write, is not flattering, nor very agreeable; but the President submits
							his Messages to the same process.— There was little discussion upon the
							principles maintained in my despatch; though M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt started
							objections to the stress of my argument upon the unqualified promise of
							the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">King of Spain</persRef> in <persRef
								ref="onis-luis">Onis’s</persRef> full-power to ratify whatever he
							should sign. There is no difference of opinion in the Cabinet, with
							regard to what is to be done, in the event of the Treaty’s not being
							ratified by Spain before the Meeting of Congress: but the field for
							diversities and oppositions will then arise— When the examination of the
							draft had been gone through, and the amendments made, the President
							directed that it should be copied, and despatched as soon as possible—
							The President referred also the subject of the complaint against
								<persRef ref="scallan-james">Lieutenant Scallan</persRef> by the
							Selectmen of Boston for Consideration— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford gave no opinion upon it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt
							took stronger ground against the complaint than either M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson or I had taken— He said that the
							passage of <persRef ref="dexter-franklin">Dexter’s</persRef> Oration,
							which gave rise to the quarrel was a gross and outrageous insult upon
							the President and his Administration, as well as upon <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> and the army— That
							Scallan having been an Officer serving in that Campaign, felt it as a
							personal insult to himself, as every man of honour and sensibility would
							have felt it under the same circumstances. That he was perhaps wrong to
							notice it, precisely as he did; but it was under such provocation that
							the Selectmen should have considered it, as a personal affair between
							Dexter and Scallan with which they had nothing to do. That if the
							President of the United States, should make himself the judge and
							punisher of every fourth of July brawl, he would soon find occupation
							enough upon his hands without attending to any thing else— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun made no further observations upon
							the subject; nor did the President come to any determination concerning
							it— He proposed that a Proclamation should issue against an unlawful
							military expedition lately organized, and now in full operation against
							the Spanish Province of Texas bordering upon the Southern boundary of
							the United States— This was unanimously agreed to; and without
							discussion. I mentioned <persRef ref="bland-theoderick">Judge
								Bland’s</persRef><pb type="ms" n="155"/>request to see and have a
							copy of <persRef ref="sands-unknown">Sands’s</persRef> deposition,
							affecting his character. This and several other depositions were
							communicated to the Government in Confidence— They were obtained, not
							for any purpose or with any view affecting M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bland, but generally for information concerning the
							Baltimore piratical privateers— But when I saw the influence at work to
							get Bland appointed precisely to this Office—the Judge to try those very
							offenders, I felt it a paramount duty to submit the deposition to the
							President— Within 24. hours M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bland was
							informed of it, and Post he comes, from Baltimore, with W. Pinkney the
							Counsel of all the Pirates, and the dictator of the Maryland Bar, from
							Annapolis, to carry the Office by Storm. On the question whether Bland
							should have a copy of the Deposition, Crawford volunteered an opinion
							that he should have it, and argued rather sophistically that there could
							be no breach of confidence in letting him have it. The President without
							deciding the point gave the Deposition to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wirt, to examine and give his opinion— All the discussions were smooth,
							and perfectly amicable— We all dined at the President’s. W. Pinkney, T.
							Morris and <persRef ref="swartwout-robert">R. Swartwout</persRef> were
							there. <persRef ref="monroe-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Monroe</persRef> was unwell, and did not appear— <persRef
								ref="hay-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. Hay</persRef>
							spoke of various things, and among the rest of the complaint of the
							Selectmen of Boston against Scallan. Hay married the <persRef
								ref="hay-eliza">President’s eldest daughter,</persRef> and is one of
							his most confidential friends and extra-Constitutional advisers— He is
							in outward form a Republican of the sternest Virginian stamp; but in
							inward substance, a man of virtue sufficiently accommodating to ask
							favours and use flattery, with a deportment not absolutely rude. He has
							twice applied to me in writing to appoint his <persRef ref="hay-charles"
								>Son</persRef> to Office in the Department, which I could not
							possibly give him, without gross injustice to the Clerks now in it— He
							is a lawyer of eminent talents and a Member of the Senate of Virginia.
							He is a most useful friend to the President, and devoted to him with
							unbounded zeal. He has been lately publishing in the Richmond Enquirer
							three elaborate numbers signed Hortensius, canvassing the decision of
							the Supreme Court of the United States, given last Winter, that the
							Legislatures of the separate States have not a Constitutional right to
							tax the Bank of the United States— His argument is that the decision of
							the Court was right, and the reasoning upon which they gave it was
							wrong— The object is to produce acquiescence in the decision, and to
							guard against the application of the reasoning to the controverted right
							of Congress to appropriate money for internal improvements— He asked
							Calhoun to day, what he thought of Hortensius N. 3. and complained that
							it had not excited much public attention— Calhoun told him he did not
							concur with the opinions of Hortensius. I walked home from the
							President’s with Calhoun— Weather very sultry, with thunder and rain—

							and Bland afterwards again at my Office. I read to him the parts of
								<persRef ref="sands-unknown">Sands’s</persRef> deposition which
							related to himself. Sands was one of the owners of the privateer which
							perhaps of all others has committed the greatest excesses— His
							deposition names all the owners; charges Bland with having frequently
							been at their Meetings, held at his, Sands’s house where <persRef
								ref="taylor-thomas2">Taylor</persRef> lived, and declares the
							opinion, founded on a variety of facts, that Bland had a pecuniary
							interest in the privateer, covered under the name of <persRef
								ref="wright-w">W. Wright</persRef>— It relates particulars of an
							occurrence at <persRef ref="skinner-john2">Skinner’s</persRef>, which if
							true would not leave a doubt of his knowledge at least of the
							privateering transactions— It states also that Commodore Taylor (the man
							who first commanded the Privateer) had told Sands, that Bland, at Buenos
							Ayres had offered Taylor, a passage in the Congress Frigate— But that
							another of the Commissioners had objected, and Taylor had been obliged
							to take out his baggage, which was already on board— Bland declared that
							it was all slander; that there was not a particle of truth in the
							charges; that he never had any interest, in any shipping concern
							whatever, that he never knew where Taylor lived, at Baltimore; that
							Skinner, <persRef ref="karrick-joseph">Karrick</persRef> and Wright,
							would all deny the fact of his having been at their meetings, and that
							he had left the Congress Frigate, at Montevideo, and never returned to
							her— He was exceedingly agitated and distressed— The workings of <pb
								type="ms" n="156"/>Passion upon his Countenance, were stronger than
							I ever witnessed on a human face, not tortured with Physical pain— It
							alternately flushed and turned pale, while his lip quivered, and his eye
							turned as if instinctively away from the scrutiny of inspection. My own
							feelings were deeply harrowed in sympathy for him; and yet from the mode
							of his denials, the impression left upon my mind was that if not
							interested in the privateer he knew more of all the transactions than he
							was willing to avow— It seemed as if there was mental reservation, in
							all that he said— His general denial was positive and explicit enough;
							but his denials of specific facts were faint, and rather evasive— It was
							rather an assertion of other facts, which seemed incompatible with the
							fact charged, than the denial of the fact itself. I told him before
							reading to him the extract of Sands’s deposition, that although the
							witness’s name could not be mentioned to him, the very facts charged in
							his testimony, might probably disclose who he was— And after I had read,
							though he declared he never knew where Taylor lived, he did not deny
							that he knew who it was, that made the deposition— In the morning at my
							house, he urged with extreme earnestness that as his name had been
							brought forward as a Candidate, if he should not be appointed the
							general impression of the public would be that the Executive considered
							him guilty, which would be ruin to his good name. Now this conclusion
							was not sound, and I reasoned with him against, it, but without effect—
							At my house he intreated that the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> would suspend the appointment, until the trials
							shall be gone through, and he, could have time and opportunity to
							vindicate his character— I made the proposal to the President; but he
							said that to suspend the appointment, would be in some sort to give a
							pledge, that if the mere fact of personal interest in the privateers
							should be disproved, Bland should be appointed; which pledge it would be
							improper to give— In the midst of Bland’s exasperation he broke out in
							an invective against the <persRef ref="benabeo-juan">Spanish Consul at
								Baltimore</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="correa-joseph">Abbe
								Correa</persRef> the Portuguese Minister, for their activity, in the
							prosecution of these Privateers, and said he had reason to believe they
							had used subornation of perjury against him— I told him that as to their
							activity, it was not only to be expected from them on this occasion, but
							was enjoined upon them as a duty— But what motive could they have for
							fixing a groundless charge upon him? And I asked him whether
							entertaining such opinions of them, he thought himself an impartial
							Judge, between them and their adversaries? He said he did not think he
							should be— He finally left me in the deepest dejection; and saying that
							he knew not what he could do. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Worthington
							came to ask answers, upon certain extraordinary claims for the
							settlement of his Accounts and upon a direct question, which since his
							return from South-America he has put; in a Letter to me; whether it is
							the President’s intention to employ him in public office again— With
							regard to the Accounts the President said he would examine the claim,
							and I directed the papers to be looked up and sent to him— As to the
							further employment of Worthington, he said he stood upon the footing of
							other citizens, but was not fit for any appointment, which required the
							exercise of discretion— A quality in which Worthington, by his
							pretension of making a Treaty at Buenos-Ayres and by his conduct
							generally had proved himself to be remarkably deficient. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hogan came to press for the appointment of
							Commercial Agent at the Havanna. The President had not remarked that
							there was a prior application with strong recommendations, which it was
							therefore necessary to lay before him— I directed the papers to be sent
							to him— Hogan to strengthen his claim, puffed himself to me, by
							pretences of having great and powerful political friends and
							connections; which will never be of the value of a straw to the United
							States— And he assured me that he was the cause of the Treaty of Ghent’s
							being made, by writing a Letter to a friend of his in England, which was
							laid before the British Cabinet, and produced a total Revolution in
							their views and opinions— And they said it contained more important and
							correct information concerning this Country, than all the despatches of
							all the Ministers they had ever had here. The President spoke again
							about <persRef ref="lacock-abner">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lacock</persRef> as a Candidate for the Office of Pay-Master
							General, and asked my opinion whether the considerations which he had
							enumerated <pb type="ms" n="157"/>the other day against his appointment,
							ought not to prevail— I told him that they appeared to me decisive; and
							I thought it even strange that under such Circumstances, he should even
							suffer his name to be mentioned— The President said he did not know that
							he had—but a friend of his had mentioned him— Tis probably <persRef

							filled gave him claims to further employment not common to other
							citizens in general— That there seemed to be some fatality attending our
							affairs with South-America. He would wish to know whether his conduct
							had not given satisfaction to the Government. I told him that the
							President wished to pass no censure upon him— None had been passed; nor
							would any disapprobation have been expressed to him had he not asked
							this question— But I could not in candour withhold an answer. The
							President had not been pleased with his assuming to make a Treaty at
							Buenos-Ayres, for which he had no authority, and had thus compromitted
							this Government in its foreign relations. He said he had not pretended
							to be authorised to make a Treaty. That I had so stated in my
							Correspondence with <persRef ref="deforest-david">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> de Forrest</persRef>, and he had
							supposed his conduct on that occasion had been fully explained to the
							satisfaction of the Government— And he had thought of an appointment to
							Constantinople, as one for which the Government might have occasion and
							which would suit him— He concluded by saying he would call again upon
							the President. Hogan came to make another push for his appointment. A
								<persRef ref="morrison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Morrison</persRef> brought me a Letter of Introduction from <persRef
								ref="pope-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathaniel

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bland</persRef> of <persRef

							in Brazil, and of any of the Consulates on the Barbary Coast, as objects
							which would be agreeable to him. <persRef ref="bland-theoderick">Judge
								Bland</persRef> came with a number of papers which he has procured
							at Baltimore, to discredit the reputation of <persRef
								ref="sands-unknown">Sands</persRef> and his deposition against him.
							They do entirely discredit him. I firmly believe that Sands’s deposition
							is false in every particular that he states, respecting Bland; yet my
							opinion is unimpaired that Bland is one of the last men in the United
							States fit to be appointed as the Judge of those very persons and crimes
							with which he has been thus charged with participating. Bland said his
							only object in procuring these papers was to restore himself in the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> good opinion and
							mine. I took the papers to the President, with whom I found <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>. He was proposing the appointment of a Captain
							for the Revenue Cutter at Baltimore, for which several persons were
							recommended, and among the rest a man named <persRef
								ref="webster-john2">Webster</persRef>, who not three Months ago
							was a Lieutenant of a Buenos Ayres privateer— This man too is now here
							to drive his own appointment in person— Crawford himself very manifestly
							leaned towards appointing him, though he was wary as a Jesuit in his
							mode of recommending him; for he alternately mentioned the
							recommendations of a competitor, with so much force and candour, that it
							had every semblance of impartiality. The President wavered a long time,
							and repeatedly made so very light of the man’s connection with the
							piratical privateers that I strongly apprehended he would decide in his
							favour— As this appointment was not of the resort of my Department, I
							said nothing— The President did not ask my opinion, though both he and
							Crawford continued long the Conversation, it appeared to me, with an
							anxiety to elicit some remark from me. I was determined not to speak
							unless required, and the President finally though somewhat irresolutely
							said he thought it would be safest to appoint the other man. Crawford
							acquiesced; and yet I shall wait to see who will at last get the
							Commission. Baltimore, upon privateering and Banking is rotten to the
							heart. The Revenue Cutter, is the only check upon the movements of the
							Pirates in our waters— Beard the late Captain, connived at them and
							favoured them in gross violation of his duty— He has been removed, and
							now one of the Pirates is thrust forward to take his place; recommended
							by almost every one whose recommendation has any influence, that is by
							the whole gang of Pirates, and their abettors— The President had also a
							Letter just received from <persRef ref="pinkney-william">W.
								Pinkney</persRef> since his return to Annapolis, pushing again for
							the appointment of Bland, in a manner which I consider as very
							indelicate. Pinkney, the standing Counsel for all the Pirates; who by
							brow-beating and domineering over the Courts, and by paltry pettifogging
							law-quibbles has saved all their necks from the richly merited halter,
							palms upon the President for their future judge, a man strongly though I
							believe falsely charged with being their accomplice, but whose
							connections with them have been so close, intimate and notorious, that
							it is as impossible he should be an impartial judge upon them, as that
							he should have escaped the suspicion of being privy to their misdeeds. I
							left Bland’s papers with the President, who will send them back to me
							to-morrow. At the Office I prepared the despatches for <persRef

							their cause. He said that he had always entirely disapproved of the

								<persRef ref="skinner-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>23. V:30.</date><persRef ref="obrien-richard">Captain
								O’Brien</persRef> came this Morning to my house, to enquire if the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> had decided upon his
							claim of remuneration for making a Peace for the United States with
							Tripoli, near twenty-five years ago: because he said he understood I was
							clearing out, to steer to the North East, and was to get under weigh
							to-morrow-Morning. <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="allison-burgess">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Allison</persRef> also called upon me, to ask if the President had
							come to a determination, upon their project; which is that Thornton
							should be appointed an agent to South-America, and that Allison should
							be superintendent of the Patent Office, in his stead— Thornton has long
							set his heart upon this agency to South-America.— He is a man of some
							learning, and much ingenuity; of quick conception and lively wit;
							entirely destitute of Judgment, discretion and common sense. He has been
							nearly twenty years Superintendent of the Patent Office; a place
							principally made by <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Madison</persRef> to put him in it, and there has
							scarcely issued from it during the whole time a Patent, for any
							invention, but the Doctor had a counter claim, as the inventor of the
							same thing himself. He has a fine taste in Architecture, and a real turn
							for mechanical invention; but no steadiness to pursue any thing to a
							useful result— He has very foolishly made himself a fanatical partizan
							for the revolutionary South-Americans; and has committed the grossest
							indiscretions in pursuit of this ignis fatuus—to the extent of
							pretending to negotiate between <persRef ref="macgregor-gregor"
								>M’Gregor</persRef> and the Government of the United States; and
							publishing under a fictitious signature in the National Intelligencer
							the substance of the Negotiation— The Doctor is a Horse-racer too, and
							often boasts that the South-Americans have repeatedly offered to appoint
							him a Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> of Cavalry in their service. He
							considers himself as the principal author of the South-American
							Revolution, and that all the principal measures of the Patriots have
							been adopted at his suggestion— In the course of my life I have met with
							very few men of minds at once so active, intelligent, and weak. Yet he
							is withal a man of good intentions, and generally harmless deportment.
							As Superintendent of the Patent Office, he is useful; and fully
							competent to the place— Though by his interfering pretensions he gives
							great offence to many of the Patentees. As for the agency to
							South-America, the President considers him utterly unfit for any such
							office, and will never appoint him to it; but with him as with other
							claimants for preposterous things, it is one of the duties of my Office
							to temper refusal with politeness: the inconvenience of which is that
							tenacious applicants, return to the attack like flies in dog days; and
							never will take no, for an answer. Allison is an old Clergyman, who was
							a chaplain in our army during the Revolutionary War, and has been
							several years Chaplain to the House of Representatives in Congress— He
							is also an inventor and patentee; and has a competent knowledge of
							mechanics, and is almost as zealous in favour of the South-American
							Patriots, as Thornton himself. I told them that I believed the President
							did not contemplate sending any Agent to South-America, at present. At
							the President’s I found <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="webster-john2">Webster</persRef> was again on the
							tapis for the appointment of Captain of the Revenue Cutter at Baltimore;
							and Crawford was taking a second decision of the President— I collected
							from what was said that the President adhered to his determination of
							Saturday. When he takes his bias he is seldom to be moved from it; and
							yet I am not confident of the result of this appointment. I read <pb
								type="ms" n="160"/>the draft of a circular Letter to the Ministers
							of the United States in Europe, concerning the new Instructions just
							despatched to <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Forsyth</persRef>— The draft was approved. At the Office <persRef
								ref="bland-theoderick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bland
							</persRef>came and took his papers; and by the President’s direction I
							wrote him a Letter, declaring the President’s full persuasion, that the
							imputations against Bland, of having had a personal interest in the
							piratical privateers were utterly without foundation. <persRef
								ref="worthington-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Worthington</persRef> came for the settlement of his Accounts, and
							to insist upon what he considered as in some sort his right, of having
							another appointment— This man, who is a shallow, prating, vain and silly
							fellow, to give himself an air of consequence at Buenos-Ayres, without a
							shadow of authority undertook to make a Treaty with <persRef
								ref="pueyrredon-juan">Pueyrredon’s</persRef> Government, in which
							there was a stipulation for the mutual admission of Consul’s— In
							consequence of which Pueyrredon sent <persRef ref="deforest-david">De
								Forest</persRef> here as Consul General— And when in Chili,
							Worthington became part owner of the Lautaro a ship of War, manned
							chiefly by desertions from American vessels; commanded by an American
							Captain, and very successful in war against the Spaniards. All this he
							now considers as quite justifiable; says he sees nothing in his conduct
							to disapprove, and thinks it quite extraordinary that he should be
							dismissed from the public service, as if he had not been faithful to his
							trust— I heard him with composure, upon these topics, about half an
							hour, and he closed by observing that he must either return to the
							practice of Law, for which he had no relish, or go and bury himself in
							Kentucky; intimating that he was not disposed, however great his
							provocation, to take part with any malcontents against the
							administration— I took no notice of this hint, but said I had readily
							heard all his remarks in defence of his own conduct; thought it would be
							useless for me to enter upon a discussion with him concerning it— I
							would remind him however that no censure had been passed upon him; and
							that in this Country, service in public Office gave no claim to further
							employment. I mentioned to him the case of many persons employed as
							Ministers of the United States abroad, who after returning home, were in
							private life, though nothing in their conduct had been liable to
							censure— He made no reply; though my doctrine was apparently too
							unpalateable to obtain his assent. On going away he gave me his hand
							with much assumed cordiality and a smiling countenance; and will now go,
							and as often as he can, abuse the administration in the newspapers;
							occasionally renewing his applications for a new appointment. I was
							engaged at the Office in preparations for departure till near seven in
							the Evening— <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel;frye-carolina" type="multi"

								<persRef ref="cheves-langdon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cheves</persRef> the President of the Bank, with whom I had some

								Cadwalader</persRef> sent by the Bank to London and Paris, as their
							Agent to make a loan for three years of the money which is to be paid of
							the Louisiana Loan. He has succeeded in effecting the loan. Cheves said
							that it was the Bank of the United States alone which could preserve
							this Country from a paper Currency, and they could certainly accomplish
							it by persevering in the system of restriction upon the issues of Bank
							paper which he has established, and if it has the support of the
							Government. He wished particularly that the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> should introduce a paragraph, favourable to the
							Bank in his Message to Congress, at the opening of their next Session,
							and that the <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> should take a similar notice of it in his annual
							Report on the finances— I called at <persRef ref="ewing-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ewing’s</persRef>, and met <persRef
								ref="connell-john">Connell</persRef> and afterwards <persRef
								ref="meredith-william">Meredith</persRef> in the Street— Connell
							came and spent two or three hours with me after dinner— He is a Director
							of the Bank of the United States, and I found him extremely dissatisfied
							with its present management, and particularly with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cheves, who he says has an overwhelming
							power of words; but is not a practical man, and is ridiculously ignorant
							of some of the most common principles of Banking. Full of
							self-importance, overbearing, impatient of contradiction, and
							construeing every the slightest opposition to any of his measures into
							personal enmity against him— His measures had been of no service to the
							Bank— They were to be sure safe, and might perhaps be convenient to the
							Government; but they were ruinous to the interest of the Stockholders;
							and if persisted in, there would be no dividend, for three years to
							come. He gave me a great variety of details concerning the affairs of
							the Bank, and said there were a majority of the Directors against
							Cheves, but scarcely any of them knew anything about Banking, and none
							of them would assume the responsibility of opposing him— There is to be
							a general meeting of the Stockholders in November, when Connell thinks
							there will be warm debating among them; and a strong opposition to the
							re-election of Cheves as President. <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas"
								>Biddle</persRef> he says is the only one of the Directors, who
							supports Cheves in all his views, but Cheves himself treats the

							effect. Every thing is prepared for them, and discussion scarcely
							tolerated. Indeed if this system was to be persevered in, it would be
							the interest of the Stockholders to surrender their Charter and take
							back their capital— Ewing came and spent an hour with me this Evening— I
							engaged passage for us in the Steam-boats and stages by the way of
							Bordentown, and Amboy, to New-York.</p>

								<persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hyde de Neuville</persRef> came in to my apartments at the City
							Hotel. The <persRef ref="despinville-charles">Count d’Espinville the
								Consul</persRef>, had sent an Express for him into the Country, in
							the Night, and he came immediately to the City. It was however already
							too late for us to go in the Steam Boat for New-Haven this morning; and
							I persisted in the determination to wait till Monday. I had an hour’s
							Conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de Neuville, and a
							second, when he came again at one O’Clock— He shewed me a Letter from
								<persRef ref="onis-luis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Onis</persRef>, dated 6. June at Liverpool, immediately after his
							arrival there. He had nothing however very recent from Europe. He is
							undoubtingly confident that the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">king of
								Spain</persRef> will ratify the Treaty of 22. February last; an
							opinion in which I do not concur. De Neuville himself had the Grand
							Cross and Ribband of the order of Isabella, which includes the title of
							Excellency, bestowed upon him by the King of Spain, for his services in
							the Negotiation; but this was at the first moment when the Treaty was
							received as an advantageous bargain to Spain; and before the party
							against it had obtained the ascendancy. I told M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> de Neuville the measures which the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> has determined to recommend
							to Congress in this case; and the substance of the Instructions just
							despatched to <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Forsyth</persRef>. The Hornet, <persRef ref="read-george">Captain
								Read</persRef>, sailed with them from this place on the 24<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi>— De Neuville said he had concluded what
							the course of this Government, in the Event of the Non-ratification of
							the Treaty would be; and had written more than a month since to his
							Government, that Florida, would be occupied— He spoke also of the
							observations upon the eighth Article of the Treaty, which I lately sent
							him, and expressed the wish that the part of them referring to his
							telling me that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis made it a point of
							honour that the Article should be so drawn as to annul the grants,
							because he had been charged with being interested in them, might not be
							published— He admitted that he had said something like it, but said the
							expression of Onis’s having made it a point of honour was too strong—
							That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis certainly knew, that the grants
							were annulled; but that he should make a point of honour of annulling
							them, would have been a violation of his Instructions, which no personal
							purpose of vindicating his character could have warranted. That much of
							what he had said to me had been confidential, and rather as from man to
							man; than as from a Minister to the Secretary of State; and that it
							would be extremely painful to him to see anything published as coming
							from him which would tend to injure M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis,
							and compromise him with his own Government. I told him that those
							observations would probably not be published, and I would endeavour to
							preserve from publication, everything which might be disagreeable to
							him. That the observation, to the publication of which he objected had
							been of some importance, in reconciling us to a modification of the
							Article; because its tendency was to convince us that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis had no design to protect those grants
							or to raise any question concerning them. That throughout the whole
							transaction, his, de Neuville’s conduct had been candid and honourable;
							but that of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis had been far otherwise—
							And the colouring which he had attempted to give to the Article of the
							Treaty in question, to <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Poletica</persRef>, and others in
							Philadelphia, could be designated by no other terms than as positive
							falsehood. Statements which he not only knew to be false, but which
							would be contradicted by his own written declarations. De Neuville said
							that perhaps Poletica ought not to have told what Onis had said to him;
							and that we ought to make some allowances for Onis’s situation. He saw
							that <persRef ref="casairujo-carlos">Casa-Yrujo</persRef> the Minister
							under whose Instructions he had concluded had been disgraced— He was
							going home himself, under no small anxiety what his own reception would
							be— He wished therefore to secure some possible retreat for himself, and
							seized hold of this, to say to the king, that it was a point upon which
							he might if he pleased refuse the ratification of the Treaty, but then
							he will point out the consequences in such a manner, that the king will
							see there is no other safe alternative, and I might rely upon it, the
							Treaty would be ratified. <pb type="ms" n="163"/>I said I wished it
							might, but had no expectation that it would. So far as related to the
							benefits derived by the United States from the Treaty, I felt little
							concern; being satisfied, that we shall get more without the Treaty than
							with it. But what I wanted was mutual satisfaction, good humour, and
							harmony of purpose, with Spain and France— And I was not desirous that
							the king of Spain, and kingly Government in general should be held up to
							the world in that odious and detestable light in which this affair would
							expose them if the Treaty should not be ratified— De Neuville also spoke
							to me about his project for a Consular Convention; and the claim of the
							French Consul at Philadelphia, to take possession of the property of a
							Frenchman lately deceased there— He says that Letters of Administration
							had been granted in opposition to this claim to an American Citizen; but
							there was yet time for the Consul to appeal. I told him I had begun an
							answer to his Letter enquiring what were the Powers of foreign Consuls
							in this Country; but had left it unfinished, on receiving accounts of a
							Judgment by a mere tribunal of Commerce against <persRef
								ref="beasley-reuben">R. G. Beasley</persRef>, our Consul at Havre,
							in direct opposition, to a Letter from the late Minister of the
							Interior, <persRef ref="laine-joseph">L’Ainé</persRef>, and also
							contrary to that abstract, from the Instructions to the French Consuls,
							which he had sent me; describing the privileges which French Consuls
							might claim in foreign Countries, on the principle that they are allowed
							to foreign Consuls in France. It had immediately occurred to me that if
							in France a judicial Court of the very lowest order a mere Tribunal of
							Commerce, could adjudicate in direct opposition to the decisions of a
							Minister of State, on a point of consular privileges, I could certainly
							give no general definition of such privileges, as of right belonging to
							foreign Consuls here, which would not in like manner be liable to
							reversal by the sentence of a judicial tribunal— And caution was the
							more incumbent upon me, as besides the general privileges, attributed to
							Consuls, by the Laws of Nations, which were very indefinite and
							unsettled, I could only state that foreign Consuls enjoyed here, the
							same rights which the Laws of the United States authorized our Consuls
							to exercise in foreign Countries— But even this would only be an
							inference of mine, which our judicial Courts might contradict, as those
