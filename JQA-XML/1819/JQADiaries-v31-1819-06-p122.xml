						<p><date>1. IV:30. Tuesday.</date> It has been established as a usage since
								<persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef> came to the Department of State, that the Heads of
							Department return the first visit, and no others of the foreign
							Ministers— This usage differs from that of Great-Britain, and the
							European Nations where the Ministers of States return no visits of
							foreign Ministers, except Ambassadors— I returned this morning the visit
							of the new <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">Russian Envoy
								Poletica</persRef>— I called first at <persRef ref="oneal-william"
								>O’Neal’s</persRef> hotel, where he had lodged, but found him at his
							house, to which he removed last Friday. It is that which was occupied by
								<persRef ref="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bagot</persRef>— He soon afterwards sent <persRef
								ref="lomonosoff-sergie">Lomonossof</persRef> to me at the Office
							with Copies of Protocols at Aix la Chapelle; chiefly relating to the
							Slave trade; and an opinion concerning the treatment of <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon Bonaparte</persRef> at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Helena, written as Poletica says by
								<persRef ref="pozzodiborgo-carlo">Pozzo di Borgo</persRef>, and
							presented to the Congress. It has been published in the Newspapers that
							the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef> had made a
							proposal at the Congress that the harsh treatment and imprisonment of
							Napoleon should be mitigated— It is exactly the contrary— This memoir
							insists that he should be treated with more rigour, harassed with more
							mortifications; and forced to submit to more daily and hourly insults—
							Napoleon said lately “ils me tuent à coups d’epingles”— The Russian
							memoir thinks there are not pins enough employed, and throws in a paper
							morè. I have some question why Poletica communicated this paper to me—
							Whether it is merely to sound the opinion of this Government, or to take
							away the opinion that the Emperor Alexander has any feelings of
							generosity or of Compassion for Napoleon— The memoir <pb type="ms"
								n="123"/>considers Napoleon as an outlaw, the common prisoner of all
							the allied powers, and whom they consider as having forfeited all the
							rights both of a sovereign and an individual— It pretends to a common
							Jurisdiction of the allies, not only over him, but over all the members
							of his family, and insists that they should be compelled to reside at
							the places assigned to them— As <persRef ref="bonaparte-joseph"
								>Joseph</persRef> resides in this Country, perhaps they intend to
							make the attempt of dictating to him some other place of abode— Napoleon
							has concentrated upon his individual person more of the hatred of
							mankind than any other individual of the age— He has perhaps done more
							evil than any man living— He attained greater power than any one has
							exercised since the days of <persRef ref="charlemagne"
								>Charlemagne</persRef>, and his abuse of power was in proportion to
							its extent— His fall was, as punishment to him, the consummation of
							Justice. No agony of sufferance can be too exquisite, no prolongation of
							torture too excruciating for the depth and magnitude of his offences
							against his species—but he is punished by instruments in a moral point
							of view no better than himself—base and ignoble instruments, who with
							all his depravity, have none of his redeeming greatness— <persRef
								ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>
							called at the Office— He returned Sunday morning from Richmond, where he
							was summoned as a witness to the execution of a Bond to the United
							States, by the sureties of a certain officer now deceased— To get rid of
							the bond, they pretend it was executed in Blank; and afterwards filled
							up— Frye, who filled it up, testified that it was not; but the two
							defendants and two witnesses of kin, and perhaps co-interested with
							them, swore that it was— The jury could not agree and were
							discharged—nine for the United States and three for the defendants— Frye
							was deeply affected, at having his character for veracity thus
							unexpectedly brought into controversy, without the slightest foundation,
							and there must have been great profligacy on the other side— I wrote
							little at the Office, and left my Letters to <persRef
								ref="campbell-george">G. W. Campbell</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="pederson-peter">Pedersen</persRef>, unfinished— Walk round the
							Capitol Hill, after dinner— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> spent the Evening at
							her sister <persRef ref="frye-carolina">Frye’s</persRef>, and came home
							quite ill; having heard of the death of <persRef ref="hellen-unknown"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hellen</persRef>.</p>

						<p><date>2. IV:30.</date> After the Journal of yesterday, I resumed the
							arrangement and preparation of the Convention Journals for the Press. It
							is truly “in tenui labor”— The longer I brood upon it, the more
							protracted and unprofitable the toil becomes— The Journals and papers
							were very loosely and imperfectly kept. They were no better than the
							daily minutes from which the regular Journal ought to have been, but
							never was made out— I find on close inspection a great number of
							questions, some of them important, entered on the loose-sheets of yeas
							and nays, and not entered at all in the Journal. I intend to have them
							all inserted at their respective places on the Journal— There was one
							loose page of yeas and nays, of which I had been able to make nothing
							until this Morning, when I found it must have been the Secretary’s first
							expedient for taking down the yeas and nays. The page is divided into
							thirteen columns, with the initials of the names of the States, from
							New-Hampshire to Georgia, numbered from 1. to 13. at the head of the
							page; but no space is left on the page, either to enter the question
							upon which the yeas and nays were taken, or the sum of the votes on
							either side— There are five successive sets of the yeas and nays taken,
							not summed up; and with nothing to indicate upon what question they were
							taken— After these, the New-Hampshire column is divided into two, upon
							which the sum of the yeas and nays on each question is entered, to the
							bottom of the page; and in eight instances, at intervals, the question
							upon which the question was taken is crowded into the square of the
							Rhode-Island column— New-Hampshire and Rhode-Island, were the two
							States, not then represented, and their columns of course remained in
							blank, after the yeas and nays were taken, and entered— There are
							twenty-eight questions the result of which appears upon this page; on
							the other side of which is the name of <persRef ref="gorham-nathaniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gorham</persRef> with seven
							strokes of the pen, and that of <persRef ref="rutledge-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rutledge</persRef> with one by their
							side— This is obviously the noting down of the vote by ballot for a
							Chairman to the Committee of the whole. The vote for Rutledge was
							probably Gorham’s— He was at that time President of the old Congress—
							Before <persRef ref="jackson-william">Jackson</persRef> the Secretary
							had got half down this page he found the want of spaces to enter the
							questions upon which the votes were taken, and the sums of the yeas nays
							&amp; divided votes. <pb type="ms" n="124"/>The sheets that he
							afterwards used were divided accordingly; but he entered upon them only
							a part of the questions that he had already taken down on the first
							experimental page— He began with the question of a “Single
							Executive”—which is the seventeenth on the experimental page— He entered
							it the first, on his book of yeas and nays, and then resorted again to
							loose sheets; after filling two of which he returned to his Book,
							leaving blank pages, apparently to have the contents of the loose sheets
							copied upon them. The single executive question, being the first entered
							on the book, was the first with which I found the corresponding question
							in the Journal of the Committee of the whole; and from that time I
							traced the questions in the Journals, and collated them with the
							questions on the sheets of yeas and nays— This left however a number of
							questions on the Journal of the Committee of the whole, taken before
							that of the single Executive, but not noted either on the book, or on
							the loose sheets of yeas and nays, and the yeas and nays upon which I
							had hitherto been unable to trace— This morning I first noticed the
							coincidence of the “Single Executive” question, the first entered upon
							the Book, and the seventeenth upon the experimental page; and
							immediately inferred that the sixteen preceeding votes entered on the
							page, must have been upon the Questions taken in the Committee of the
							whole, before that upon the single executive— But to which question each
							set of the yeas and nays applied was yet to be traced out; the ninth and
							fifteenth of the questions, being the only two, entered upon the
							Rhode-Island square— I traced the questions on the Journal to the first
							taken in the Committee of the whole, apparently by yeas and nays, and
							was collating it with the first vote on the experimental page of yeas
							and nays, when the consumption of time in this petty research brought it
							to past noon, and I was obliged to break if off, and go to my Office—
								<persRef ref="perry-oliver">Commodore Perry</persRef> called at my
							house, and took leave; going to Baltimore; and thence, to Annapolis to
							sail in the John Adams, upon his cruize and mission to South-America— At

							despatches to 12. April from <persRef ref="rush-richard">R.

						<p><date>4. IV:</date> A man by the name of <persRef ref="jenkins-unknown"
								>Jenkins</persRef>, a writing master, who said he originally came
							from Dorchester, but belonged now to New-York came this morning with a
							printed sheet of texts of Scripture, prayers, verses and pious
							admonitions against duelling, which he had the project of having
							reprinted— He had also a printed certificate signed by all the Clergymen
							of this place, and some others recommending this device as exceedingly
							useful. He came to obtain my approbation and signature to the same
							certificate— I declined signing it, and told him I made it a general
							rule not to give certificates of recommendation, for any thing which if
							useful must carry its recommendation with itself. He then entered into a
							long argument to convince me that it was the duty of men whom Providence
							had placed in high situations, to patronize and recommend poor and
							ingenious persons, who for want of countenance in the world, were often
							robbed of their most useful inventions, as to his knowledge a <persRef
								ref="smith-unknown5">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef>
							had been, and was consequently starving with a large family of children,
							and as indeed he himself had been, of his system of handwriting— I gave
							him, I thought very temperately my reasons for declining generally to
							give certificates of recommendation, and he went away— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> who was present
							thought I had treated him harshly and no doubt he thought so still more
							himself— I thought the man’s anti-duelling printed sheet of bible texts
							and prayers, a devise worse than useless—liable to the derision of
							Scoffers, and utterly inadequate ever to prevent a single duel— To have
							recommended it, would with my opinions have been to countenance an <pb
								type="ms" n="125"/>imposition upon the public— I felt it an
							impertinence in a man a total stranger to me, to come and ask my
							certificate of recommendation to such mummery, and still more to open
							upon me a lecture of half an hour upon the duty of a man in high office
							to patronize and recommend poor and ingenious persons like him. I bore
							all this with composure—answered his allegations upon the duty of
							Patronage; and said nothing passionate, or personally offensive to him:
							but my wife says that I looked all the ill temper that I suppressed in
							words— The result is that I am a man of reserved, cold austere and
							forbidding manners; my political adversaries say a gloomy misanthropist,
							and my personal enemies, an unsocial savage— With a knowledge of the
							actual defect in my character, I have not the pliability to reform it—
							At the Office came <persRef ref="irvine-baptis">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Baptis Irvine</persRef>, and gave me some further
							particulars from Venezuela— He is a fanatic to the South-American cause,
							and sees every thing through the medium of his prejudices— Such a person
							is always a bad observer— He, and <persRef ref="worthington-william"
								>Worthington</persRef> and <persRef ref="rodney-caesar"
								>Rodney</persRef> and <persRef ref="brackenridge-henry"
								>Brackenridge</persRef>, all stand looking in extatic gaze at
							South-America; foretelling liberty, to South-America, as the Jews
							foretell the Messiah— <persRef ref="graham-john">Graham</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Poinsett</persRef> have not only seen
							more clearly, but in secret Reports, which they are afraid of having
							published, have told the Government much of the naked truth— <persRef
								ref="bland-theoderick">Bland</persRef> alone, though he went out
							perhaps as great an enthusiast as any of the rest, saw the whole truth,
							and did not shrink from telling it out. His report contained more solid
							information, and more deep and comprehensive reflection than all the
							rest, put together; but he is now attacked for it— Irvine was desirous
							of going to Annapolis to see and converse with <persRef
								ref="perry-oliver">Commodore Perry</persRef>, to whom I gave him
							accordingly a Letter— As from various symptoms I perceive that the late
							Treaty with Spain, will probably not be ratified at Madrid, and as the
							refusal will produce a reacting explosion here, I this day selected all
							the papers of the negotiation relating to the subject, and directed
							copies of them to be made to have them ready for the meeting of
							Congress. <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poletica</persRef>, and <persRef ref="lomonosoff-sergie">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lomonossoff</persRef> called here,
							after dinner, but we were going out and did not receive them— With M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams, I attended a tea and Evening party
							at <persRef ref="weightman-roger">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Weightman’s</persRef>. Had some Conversation with <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef>, who says the Spanish Government will not and
							cannot delay the Ratification of the Treaty on account of the grants.
							That he has proofs not only that <persRef ref="onis-luis">Onis</persRef>
							intended and understood that the three great Grants were null and void;
							but that the Spanish Government knew that such was the intention and
							understanding. But these proofs he said he could only communicate to his
							own Government— He admitted however that Onis had been disingenuous, and
							had spoken indiscreetly upon these points, after the questions arose;
							but he thought it was only for the sake of giving his Court the
							opportunity of making a merit of waving any objection to the
							ratification.— The weather is at full summer heat.</p>

							Slave-trade; to communicate the former to the Governments of Venezuela,
							and of Buenos-Ayres, and at the same time to make Representations to
							those same Governments against the privateering piracies carried on in
							their names, and under their Commissions— He said this would be
							rendering a real service to some of the commercial Nations of Europe— He
							asked me, if I had read the Protocols that he had sent me— I had only
							read part of them. He asked if I had noticed Lord <pb type="ms" n="126"
								/><persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Castlereagh’s</persRef> Memoir,
							proposing the adoption of the principle of a right of mutual search for
							the suppression of the Slave trade— I had— He said it was a remarkable
							proposal and had been resisted by the Russian Ministers. I said I hoped
							they would persevere in their resistance; for the British Government had
							made the same proposal to us, and were very urgent in pressing us to its
							adoption. And I had observed that notwithstanding the answer of Russia
							to the Memoir to which he had alluded, and notwithstanding the still
							more decisive opposition of France at Aix La Chapelle, Lord Castlereagh
							after having been subsequently to the termination of the Congress at
							Paris had written to his Government, that there was reason to expect
							that both France and Russia would ultimately yield the right of mutual
							search. He said he did not know upon what grounds Lord Castlereagh could
							have entertained this expectation. He knew that both <persRef
								ref="nesselrode-karl">Nesselrode</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="kapodistrias-john">Capo d’Istria</persRef>, but most especially
							the latter were determined against acceding to any such principle; and
							he knew that <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count Lieven</persRef>
							had received a reprimand in a nexript, or despatch signed by the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> himself, for having
							received a Memoir of the same kind, and only answered that he would
							forward it to his Court without undertaking to refute it— He said that
							Russia, had no disposition to indulge Great-Britain in her encroachments
							upon maritime Law— That even at Vienna England had made a jealous
							alliance with Austria, against Russia; whom she considered as the
							preponderating power in Europe, and as having taken the place of France—
							At Aix la Chapelle they had even drawn Prussia into their system, and
							every day as long as the Congress lasted, the Russian Ministers on
							arriving at the Conferences invariably found England, Austria and
							Prussia arrayed in opposition against them. France had indeed handsomely
							supported Russia in opposing this principle of mutual search; but
							Austria and Prussia would have acceded to it— As to the British
							allegation that this right of search would be reciprocal, it would be a
							mere sport upon words, while Russia had neither slave traders, nor armed
							vessels employed to capture them. I told him that when the <persRef

							thermometer was about 75 all this day, which was generally cloudy; but
							it did not effectually restore an aptitude to labour; but I was
							overpowered the greater part of the day, with a lethargic drowsiness,
							which continued the disqualification. Yet I was much of the morning
							grubbing into the yeas and nays of the federal Convention of 1787. At
							the Office, I found <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef>, the Secretary of
							the Treasury, had been there, with a Letter from <persRef
								ref="mcculloch-james">M’Culloh</persRef> the Collector of Baltimore
							to him, and a list of the Cargo, of a vessel now sitting out there, to
							be sent to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Thomas, and sold for a Slave
							trader, or privateer— She was originally a prize to one of the
							South-American privateers— Sold to a Baltimore Merchant who is now
							fitting her out for this laudable purpose— One hundred sets of manacles
							and fetters form a part of the Cargo. M’Culloh under these Circumstances
							refused to clear out the vessel, until he could receive the orders of
							the Secretary <pb type="ms" n="128"/>of the Treasury, to whom he wrote
							this statement of the facts; and Crawford as he has done in many other
							cases involving an invidious responsibility, referred the papers to me,
							though the Department of State had no more to do with them than the
							Land-Office. A <persRef ref="murray-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Murray</persRef>, sent by the owner of the vessel to
							hurry an immediate answer, came and Crawford referred him to me— I went
							over to Crawford’s Office, returned him the papers, and gave him my
							opinion upon them; which was that the equipment of the vessel was
							without doubt in violation of the Law of 1818. Upon which Crawford asked
							me to write to the <persRef ref="glenn-elias">District
								Attorney</persRef>, and direct him to commence a Prosecution. This I
							declined, because the Law contemplates no such interference by the
							Department of State, and I see no reason for volunteering it. Crawford
							is enormously sensitive to this two edged responsibility, which brings
							invective, whichever side the decision is made— I find no fault with him
							for that; and when the responsibility falls properly to my own
							Department, I never shrink from it. But Crawford’s attempts to shift off
							his proper share of it upon me are not so well; and he has repeated them
							till they are as transparent as crystal. I advised him to write to the
							Collector, that as the Law did not make it his official duty to seize
							and prosecute vessels in this situation, he must act upon his own
							responsibility, and prosecute or clear the vessel as he should think
							proper— Crawford also told me much of the information which he is
							receiving with respect to the operations of the Banks, and the gigantic
							frauds practising upon the People by means of those Institutions— The
							Banks are breaking all over the Country; some in a sneaking, and some in
							an impudent manner, some with sophisticating evasions, and others with
							the front of highwaymen. Our greatest real evil, is the question between
							debtor and creditor, into which the banks have plunged us deeper than
							would have been possible without them— The Bank debtors, are every where
							so numerous and powerful, that they controul the Newspapers, throughout
							the Union, and give the discussion a turn extremely erroneous, and
							prostrate every principle of true political economy. Crawford has
							labours and perils enough before him in the management of the finances
							for the three succeeding years— My time was so absorbed with this
							interview, that I had none left to write at my Office; if I had been
							otherwise adequate to it. After dinner we had Evening visits from
								<persRef key="smith-william-steuben">W. S. Smith</persRef> and

								ref="adams-george;adams-john2;adams-charles2" type="multi">of her
								sons</persRef>, and I this morning finished the revisal of it; in
							which I have made very little alteration— I read the first Alcibiades at
							Auteuil, in the year 1784 at the age of seventeen. The folly of that
							presumption, which would rush to the management of public affairs,
							without a stock of knowledge concerning them; the meanness of setting up
							as the standard of our own acquirements, those of our associates—the
							indissoluble union of moral beauty and goodness, the indispensable duty
							of seeking self knowledge and self-improvement; and the exalted doctrine
							which considers the body as merely the mortal instrument of the Soul;
							and the Soul alone as man, made a deep and lasting impression upon my
							mind— The beauties of the composition did not then so much affect me—
							The dramatic character of the dialogue, though remarked by Dacier— The
							transitions from grave to gay; the playful, but cutting Irony, mingled
							with the deep Pathos of the appeals of Socrates to the sense of shame in
							his vain, and thoughtless, yet ambitious disciple, struck me less than
							the pure and glorious moral sentiments inculcated in his discourse— The
							lessons of <persRef ref="socrates">Socrates</persRef> were lost upon
							Alcibiades; they were not entirely so upon me. Neither from them; nor
							from the moral principles that I gathered from other sources, have I
							derived all the benefit that I might have done. My conduct in life has
							been occasionally warped by the passions of my nature; by the frailty of
							my Constitution; by the weakness of my head and of my heart— But it has
							always been my will, and generally my endeavour to discharge all my
							duties in life, to God, to my fellow creatures and to my own Soul. I
							wish my Sons to read, and to be penetrated as deeply as I have been with
							the lessons of the first Alcibiades. George is now at the same <pb

							and sent to Spain a long memoir, urging that the late Treaty should on
							no consideration be ratified; as the object of the Americans is to
							overrun the Province of Texas and Mexico— He was a mischievous
							intriguer, but it was to be hoped his memoir would arrive after the
							ratification of the Treaty, or that it would have no influence. De
							Neuville was also very inquisitive this Evening, about the return of the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>; whether he had been
							sent for as was pretended in the Newspapers, and whether it was likely
							there would be an extra Session of Congress this Summer. I told him
							there was no foundation for the stories that have been circulated; that
							the President had not been sent for, and there was no prospect of an
							extra Session of Congress— And so according to present appearances it
							is— But how the collection of the revenue will stand through the Summer,
							is problematical; and if as there are strong grounds for expecting there
							should even be a delay to the ratification of the Spanish Treaty, there
							may be a call of Congress to meet before the regular period in December—

								<persRef ref="obrien-richard">Captain O’Brien</persRef> some time
							Consul at Algiers, came with old claims of more than twenty years
							standing, and an enormous bundle of vouchers in support of them, which
							he desired me to inspect and examine— O’Brien is a very original and
							eccentric character. I promised him to examine his papers as soon as it
							should be in my power. <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de Neuville</persRef> called to
							enquire if I had any Letters from France, by a vessel just arrived from
							Havre— I had none— He urged again, his project for a Consular
							Convention; but I told him I doubted whether the <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">President</persRef> would be willing to conclude
							a Consular Convention, without a general Treaty of Commerce. He had
							mentioned to me that there was a French Squadron now in the West-Indies,
							and that they had orders to take from any South American privateer with
							which they meet any Frenchman whom they should find on board— I
							remonstrated in the strongest terms with de Neuville against this order,
							as contrary to the Laws of Nations; as utterly useless for the
							suppression of piracy, and as giving pernicious countenance to the
							British practice and doctrine of impressment. After some discussion he
							agreed with me on the principle and promised to write to his Government
							concerning it. I desired him also to urge them to enter so far into
							relations with the South-American Governments as to exercise an
							influence to prevent them from sanctioning the piracies committed under
							their Commissions and flags. I promised to send him the Buenos-Ayres
							privateering ordinance, and told him the substance of the Instructions
							given to <persRef ref="perry-oliver">Commodore Perry</persRef>. He
							appeared well disposed to second this movement, and we must mature this
							subject further— I am yet somewhat unwell, and this Evening took a ride

						<p><date>17. VI:</date> Still engaged upon the Convention Journal, the end
							of which recedes, as I seem to approach it. <persRef
								ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poletica</persRef> called at the Office at one O’Clock— He began by
							inquiring if the squadron under the command of <persRef
								ref="perry-oliver">Commodore Perry</persRef> had been reinforced— It
							had not— An article which has appeared in some of the newspapers
							erroneously stating that the Ontario was to join this squadron gave
							occasion to the question, which with every other <pb type="ms" n="131"
							/>circumstance in the conduct of Poletica, shews the close attention
							given to every incident in which we are employing an armed force. But
							Poletica’s special object this day was to tell me that the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> was earnestly desirous that the
							United States should accede to the Holy Alliance— He said he mentioned
							it now, unofficially and confidentially, that it might be so
							communicated to the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>—
							That if on Consideration of the subject, it should be concluded that on
							account of popular prejudices against this compact, it would probably
							not be agreed to here, I might in a friendly manner let him know it, and
							he would avoid making any official proposal of it. I told him I could
							say nothing positive upon the subject, until after the President’s
							return; but he knew the reason upon which Great Britain had declined,
							acceding to that Alliance— It was an autograph Treaty, concluded by
								<persRef ref="francis-i">three</persRef><persRef
								ref="frederick-william-iii">Sovereigns</persRef>, in person; and not
							by their Ministers— But in Great-Britain the king could make no national
							compact in person— There must be a responsible Minister to sanction
							every thing. The English <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince
								Regent</persRef> therefore, could not sign the Treaty; but declared
							his entire approbation of its principles. The executive power in our
							Country was still much more restricted <hi rend="strikethrough">in our
								Country</hi>, than in England— No Treaty could be concluded, but
							with the concurrence of two thirds of the members of the Senate, before
							whom it must be laid— He said he should be perfectly willing that it
							should be submitted to the consideration of the Senate— That the British
							Government had indeed answered, as I had stated; but the Swiss Republic
							had acceded to the Alliance, and he would send me a copy of their act of
							adhesion— The Treaty was nothing, in specific engagement; it was every
							thing in respect to general influence— It was a league of Peace, and had
							hitherto preserved a universal Peace in Europe. The Emperor wished the
							United States to become Parties to it; because in that case if we had
							any little points of difference with European Powers, with Great-Britain
							for instance, He could interpose his influence in their favour. I said
							it would at all Events be advisable to ascertain what were the
							dispositions of the members of the Senate, before it would be proper to
							lay the Treaty before them; in which he concurred. I received this day a
							very voluminous mail; and among the rest some Letters of no pleasant
							character— The affair of <persRef ref="tencate-j">ten Cate’s</persRef>
							Bills is at last however settled, and the money has been paid— It has
							been altogether a transaction, in which there was on my part a slight
							indiscretion; which consisted in advancing him the money, without having
							the sanction of the President for it. He was at the time in Virginia;
							and I consulted <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, who
							advised making the advance. But if the Dutch Government had been
							tenacious upon ten Cate’s want of authority, it would have proved a
							troublesome, and vexatious affair— A much more troublesome one might
							indeed have arisen from a refusal to make the advance, for ten Cate,
							could not have gone without the money; and might have been arrested, and
							bred a quarrel about his diplomatic privilege— On the whole the
							transaction has resulted well; but it is one of those of which I cannot
							acquit myself of error, from imprudence, in acting without the sanction
							of the President— In the Evening I walked round the Capitol Hill—
								<persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford’s</persRef> Office a Meeting of the Commissioners of the
							Sinking Fund. The object of his calling the meeting was to pass a
							Resolution authorising the purchase of public Stocks generally, the
							Resolution at the last Meeting having limited the authority to the
							purchase of three per Cents— It was therefore now resolved to extend the
							authority with a recommendation to purchase in preference Louisiana
							Stock, upon which a payment of nearly three Millions of dollars is to be
							made on the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of October next, and as
							that payment may be called for in specie, every portion of the Stock
							purchased for the Public reduces the amount which will be payable to
							individuals.— The pressure of embarrassment among the people arising
							from the depreciation in the value of our exports, from the excess of
							our importations, from the extravagant multiplication of Banks, and the
							unprincipled manner in which many of them have been managed; from the
							foolish, facilities which they have furnished, of contracting debts, and
							the necessity now compelling them to demand repayment, is increasing
							from day to day. The failures of Banks in every part of the Country are
							numerous— Those of individual merchants in our principal Sea-Ports are
							still more so— County Meetings have been held in the Western States and
							in some of the Atlantic States—and Petitions for special Calls of their
							Legislatures, and of Congress are in circulation: the object of which is
							to obtain suspensions of Specie payments by Law; and execrable device,
							of which the British Parliament have made the example infectious.
							Hitherto the counter-spirit is so strong that the expedients of
							desperation have not succeeded— The majority of the popular meetings
							have declared themselves against special calls of the Legislatures— The
							petition for the Call of Congress has not met much Countenance; several
							of the great failures, which have happened, were so notoriously
							occasioned by gambling speculations, and have brought to light such
							Scenes of dishonourable conduct, that they have had a tendency to make
							complaint itself disreputable. But the disease is only disclosing its
							first symptoms. New-England scarcely yet feels it— They produce none of
							the great articles of export, which have sunk within a few Months in the
							foreign Markets to half price. Cotton, Tobacco, Rice, Wheat and Flour—on
							the contrary as they import all these Articles for their own
							Consumption, the fall in their prices, operates thus far to their
							advantage. They have been far less licentious, in their banking
							practices, the Banks in Boston never having suspended Specie payments,
							not even during the late War. The Legislatures of all the New-England
							States except Vermont, have recently been in Session, without receiving
							a single petition for the suspension of Specie payments, or indeed any
							particular complaints, of distress. But as commercial and navigating, it
							will reach them by reflection, from the South and West— The profits of
							Commerce and of shipping must fall after the price of the exports has
							been so much reduced as necessarily to reduce in return the quantity of
							importations— The distress in that quarter will therefore come later;
							but it will come, <pb type="ms" n="134"/>and as in the meanwhile, it
							will be continually growing heavier, in the others, the day of desperate
							expedients may finally reach them all, and what I apprehend is that
							paper money with all its numberless evils will be the consequence— Time
							and Chance, that is a superintending Providence, may work out a remedy.
							Would that it were within the means of my intelligence to compass it!
							Crawford said he had a Letter from <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">General
								Smith</persRef> of Baltimore, stating that he was irretrievably
							ruined, and quite unexpectedly to himself; for, that he had implicitly

						<p><date>25. IV:30.</date> In re-examining the Accounts of agency of my
								<persRef ref="adams-thomas">brother</persRef> during my absence in
							Europe, it occurred to me as necessary to enter them in some form, upon
							my own Books, and although they include the management of all my
							property in this Country for eight years, I found they could be reduced
							to a small number of items, the whole amount of the receipts and
							payments upon which could be entered as D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							and C<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> on two pages of my Waste-Book and
							Journal; reserving the transactions relating to the purchase of United
							States Bank Shares for a separate account on another page. I had already
							made a summary, from the Accounts last year, exhibiting on a page the
							receipts and payments of each year, and I was engaged all this morning
							in preparing the compression of the whole. I resumed the work again in
							the Evening, without approaching towards a conclusion— At home I could
							attend to nothing else and the arrears of my Diary still run on. At the
							Office, <persRef ref="worthington-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Worthington</persRef>, late Agent at Buenos-Ayres, and
							in Chili, came to ask for a settlement of his Accounts— But as he claims
							allowances which the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>
							only can make, the Settlement must await his return. I told Worthington
							however that he might in the meantime receive a part of his claims on
							Account.</p>

						<p><date>27. VI:</date> The <persRef ref="goupydequabeck-alexander">Viscount
								de Quabeck</persRef> called and took leave, previous to his intended
							excursion with <persRef ref="greuhm-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Greuhm</persRef>. The heat of the weather kept me
							confined to the house till the Evening. I made out the accounts of my
								<persRef ref="adams-thomas">brothers</persRef> agency for me, from
							1809–to 1817. and of his purchase for me, of U.S. Bank Shares, and
							entered them upon my Waste-Book, and Journal— The examination into which
							I have gone for this purpose has led me to an apprehension that in
							making the Settlement with my brother of 8. September 1817. there was a
							mistake made to his disadvantage of between two and four hundred
							dollars— I therefore wrote him a Letter giving him this information, and
							renewing the request of a joint revision by us together of these
							accounts for the purpose of rectifying that error if it has been
							committed— The investigation of these accounts and of my own, has also
							discovered to me many errors, in the forms of entry upon my Books— My
							Waste-Book and Book of Family Expences contain a full and most exact
							Statement of my property, and of all my transactions relating to it from
							the first of January 1802— But at that time I began the attempt which I
							have ever since continued of keeping my Books in the regular form of
							Merchants Accounts, by double entry according to what is called the
							Italian Method. But never having been taught this system, I merely
							studied it for a short time in <persRef ref="mair-john">Mair’s</persRef>
							Book-keeping, and practiced it without being aware of its difficulties—
							These I have found numerous, and arising from various sources.— Some
							from making the entries at a wrong time— Some from making them to <pb
								type="ms" n="135"/>a wrong Account, or to the wrong side of an
							account, a mistake which would seem scarcely possible at the first view,
							but of which with the system of fictitious accounts, there is continual
							danger— The accounts of cash of profit and loss, of Interest—those of
							Family Expences, Library, Household Furniture, are constantly running
							into one another. In taking or giving Notes or Bonds, I sometimes debit
							or credit the person, and sometimes Bills receivable or payable; and
							what is much worse, I have sometimes debited Bills Receivable for a
							Note, and when the payment was made, perhaps years afterwards, have
							forgotten the original entry, and credited the person who gave the
							Note—the result of which presents the person as my Creditor on my own
							Books, and no debt to balance it— Differences of Exchange, advances or
							discounts upon nominal sums, complications of Accounts with the same
							person in different capacities, all lead to erroneous entries, and
							sometimes I have forgotten to make any entry, when one should have been
							made. Last of all, as I have made a great number of entries in my Book
							of Household or Family Expences, which are also entered to separate
							Accounts in the Journal and Ledger; and as Cash is made the general
							Creditor to Family-Expences, and at the same time the special Creditor
							to the separate charge on the Journal, it receives a double credit to
							the same debt. My Cash Account accordingly very soon got out of order,
							and although I have taken great and repeated pains with it, has never
							been restored to its balance— And as the correctness of all Books thus
							kept, depends upon that of the Cash Account, my Books have got into a
							confusion as yet inextricable to myself— They present a very inaccurate
							picture of my Estate and of my transactions relating to it— This remark
							applies however only to the technical part, the Journal and Ledger
							Entries, in Mercantile form— The Waste-Book and the Book of
							Family-Expences contain an Account as exact and minute of all my
							pecuniary transactions and concerns as perhaps was ever kept by any man.
							I could perhaps now commence Books according to the mode of Merchants
							Accounts and keep them in regular order; where I have stumbled, I should
							now know that there is a stone. And yet without vigilant and
							uninterrupted attention, they would get into the same disorder— This
							notice may serve to explain that in which it is probable my Mercantile
							Journal and Ledger may hereafter be found by my legal Representatives.
							This Evening I took an hour’s walk, and called on <persRef
