						<p>On the 3<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi> day of June 1794. When I returned to my
							lodgings at the close of Evening; upon opening a Letter from <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> which I had just before taken
							from the post-office I found it contained information that <persRef
								ref="randolph-edmund">Edmund Randolph</persRef>, Secretary of State
							of the United States had on the morning of the day, when the Letter was
							dated called on the writer and told him that the <persRef
								ref="washington-george">President</persRef> of the United States had
							determined to nominate me to go to the Hague as Resident Minister from
							the United States.— This intelligence was to me very unexpected and
							indeed surprizing. I had laid down as a principle that I never would
							solicit for any public office whatever, and from this determination no
							necessity has hitherto compelled me to swerve. From the principles of
							the same nature which my father has always rigidly observed, I knew that
							no influence nor even a request of any kind from him could have
							occasioned this intention of the President. And yet I was very sensible,
							that neither my years, my experience my reputation nor my talents could
							entitle me to an office of so much respectability. It is however of no
							service to indulge conjecture upon the subject—</p>

						<p>On the Sunday following the eighth of June my father arrived at Quincy

							never uttered a word upon which a wish on his part could be presumed,
							that a public office should be conferred upon me. His opinion upon the
							subject agrees with my own; but his satisfaction at the appointment is
							much greater than mine.</p>
						<p>I wish I could have been consulted before it was irrevocably made. I
							rather wish it had not been made at-all. My friends on the other hand
							appear to be very much pleased with it, and seem to consider it as a
							subject of pure and simple congratulation. </p>
