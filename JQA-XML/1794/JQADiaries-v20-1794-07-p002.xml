						<p><hi rend="italic">Monday July 7</hi><hi rend="superscript italic">th:</hi> I remained at New-York in order to get a little
							recruited and refreshed. I lodged at my brother in Law <persRef
								ref="smith-william">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> W. S.
								Smith’s</persRef>.— At dinner this day at his house <pb n="3"
								type="ms"/>I met <persRef ref="tallyrand-charles">M.
								Talleyrand</persRef>, the ci-devant bishop of Autun, <persRef
								ref="beaumetz-bon">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Beaumetz</persRef> member
							of the constituent national assembly of France, and <persRef
								ref="colombe-louis">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> De la Colombe</persRef>,
							who was aid de-Camp to <persRef ref="lafayette">M. de la
								Fayette</persRef>, was with him when he left his own army, and made
							his own escape from the Austrians in disguise.</p>
						<p><hi rend="italic">Talleyrand</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Beaumetz</hi>
							have both been Presidents of the constituent assembly in France. the
							former was the intimate friend of <persRef ref="riqueti-honore"
								>Mirabeau</persRef>; great promoters of the revolution and among the
							first victims of it. The former a man of high birth and a bishop, first
							made the motion for the confiscation of the ecclesiastical property.
							They are now here in banishment. Excluded from France, by the prevalence
							of a party, different from that to which they belong: excluded from
							England for the part which they have borne in the french revolution;
							this Country of universal Liberty, this asylum from the most opposite
							descriptions of oppression is the only one in which they can find
							rest.</p>
						<p>Talleyrand is reserved and distant. Beaumetz more sociable and
							communicative. It is natural to look with reverence or at least with
							curiosity upon men who have been so highly and so recently conspicuous
							upon the most splendid theatre of human affairs. If indeed success is
							the criterion of political excellence, not one individual that has been
							hitherto actively engaged in the progress of the french revolutions has
							been equal to the situation in which he has been placed— The parties
							have successively destroyed one another, and in the general wreck it is
							not easy to distinguish between those <pb n="4" type="ms"/>whose fall
							has been the effect of their own incapacity, and those who have been
							only unfortunate.</p>
						<p>Perhaps there never has been a period in the history of mankind, when
							Fortune has sported so wantonly with Reputation, as of late in France.
							The tide of popularity has ebbed and flowed with nearly the same
							frequency as that of the Ocean, though not with the same regularity.

							must be many very undeserving of their worship— Many ordinary characters

						<p><pb n="5" type="ms"/><hi rend="italic">Friday July 11th.
								1794.</hi> The day on which I entered upon the twenty-eighth
							year of my age, I received my Commission from the Secretary of State. At
							the same time I began the reading of six large folio volumes containing
							the dispatches from <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> during
							his negotiations in Europe.— By the invitation of the <persRef
								ref="washington-george">President</persRef> I attended at the
							reception he gave to <persRef ref="piomingo"><hi rend="italic"
									>Piomingo</hi></persRef> and a number of other Chickasaw
							Indians. Five Chiefs, seven warriors, four boys and an interpreter,
							constituted the company.— As soon as the whole were seated the ceremony
							of smoaking began. A large East Indian pipe was placed in the middle of
							the Hall. the tube which appeared to be of leather was twelve or fifteen
							feet in length. The President began, and after two or three whiffs past
							the tube to Piomingo; he to the next chief, and so all round. Whether
							this Ceremony be really of indian origin as is generally supposed, I
							confess I have some doubt. At least these Indians appeared to be quite
							unused to it; and from their manner of going through it looked as if
							they were submitting to a process in compliance with <hi rend="italic"
								>our</hi> custom. Some of them I thought smiled with such an
							expression of countenance as denoted a sense of <hi rend="italic"
								>novelty</hi> &amp; of <hi rend="italic">frivolity</hi>, too; as if
							the ceremony struck them not only as new, but also as ridiculous— When
							it was finished the President address’d them in a speech, which he read;
							stopping at the close of every sentence for the interpreter to translate
							it. I observed that the interpreter at the close of every sentence
							concluded by repeating the same word twice over. The sound was something
							like this, “Tshkyer! Tshkyer!” <pb n="6" type="ms"/>He always repeated
							them very rapidly, and as soon as he had done, the five Chiefs all
							together would utter a sound, importing their approbation. This sound
							was strong or faint in proportion to the degree of satisfaction they had
							in what was said. But I can give no adequate idea of what it was by any
							combination of our Letters. It resembled a horse’s neighing as much as
							any thing, and more than once reminded me of the Houynhms.— Piomingo
							then desired he might be excused from giving his <hi rend="italic"
								>talks</hi> at this Time being very unwell; but promised to give
							them in a few days. They then made several enquiries respecting the
							Cherokees, who have recently been here. Their questions discovered a
							mixture of curiosity and of animosity. These two nations are at war, and
							the Chickasaws spoke of the others as a perfidious people— The <hi
								rend="italic">fides punica</hi> it seems is not confined to
							civilized Nations.</p>
						<p>The informal conversation was held while Wine, punch and cake was
							carrying round. The President told them that the Chickasaws had always
							been distinguished as sincere and faithful friends. And that the United
							States always valued such friends most highly.— They said nothing of
							their own sincerity, and made no answer to the President’s
							compliment.</p>
						<p>These formalities employed about an hour; after which they rose, shook
							hands with us all and departed—</p>
						<p>There was nothing remarkable in their appearance. Some of them were
							dressed in coarse jackets &amp; trowsers, &amp; some in the uniform of
							the United States. Some of them had shirts and some had none. They were
							none of them either painted or scarified and there were four or five who
							had rings in their Noses. One or two had large plates apparently of
							silver hanging upon the breast, and I do not recollect observing any
							other ornaments upon them—</p>
						<p>I dined at <persRef ref="knox-henry2">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Knox’s</persRef>. <persRef ref="griffin-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Griffin</persRef>, a member of Congress from Virginia;
								<persRef ref="maund-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Maund</persRef>,
							an English Gentleman <pb n="7" type="ms"/>settled in that state and a
							member of their Senate, and the ci-devant <persRef ref="noailles-louis"
								>Vicomte de Noailles</persRef> were of the company.— This is another
							illustrious exile from France. Once a President of the Constituent
							Assembly, and the first who moved for the abolition of the feudal rights
							of the nobility, or for some other famous revolutionary measure. He fell
							with the monarchy; but by some good fortune having originally left the
							Country with express permission, he is not included in the full severity
							of the Laws against emigrants. He purposes now to settle for life upon a
							newly cleared place on the Susquehannah called the <hi rend="italic"
								>Asylum</hi> which really serves as such to many frenchmen expelled
							from their own Country, by the violence of their internal feuds.</p>
						<p>We accompanied <persRef ref="knox-lucy">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
								Knox</persRef> to the Theatre, which is spacious and elegant. and
							supplied with a very good Company of performers.— Part of the
							entertainment however we left to go and pay the customary visit to
								<persRef ref="washington-martha">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
								Washington</persRef>. As this was merely a mark of respect we
							retired as early as we could, and returned to the play. The remainder of
							the Evening I was seated next to <persRef ref="fauchet-jean">M.
								Fauchet</persRef> the minister plenipotentiary from the french
							Republic. I found him tolerably conversable; but reserved. he appears to
							be not much beyond thirty. He spoke of the <persRef ref="raynal-guillaume">abbé
								Raynal</persRef> whom he knew: but said he had seldom seen him in
							Latter times, and <hi rend="strikethrough">never</hi> without conversing
							on the subject of the Revolution.— There was another man of Letters,
							much his superior; the <persRef ref="barthelemy-jean">abbé
								Barthelemi</persRef>. I told him, I had great veneration for his
							character, and had heard with great regret that he had lately “<hi
								rend="italic">suffered.</hi>” (I hardly knew now to express <hi
								rend="strikethrough">the</hi> with the delicate ambiguity, which I
							thought necessary, the operation of the Guillotine) he assured me that
							my information was false, and that <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
							<pb n="8" type="ms"/>the abbé Barthelemi, was highly respected by the
							present ruling powers of France— <persRef ref="milton-john"
								>Milton’s</persRef> mask of Comus was one part of the evening’s
							performance.— “It is the work of a great man,” said M. Fauchet. “Ay”
							said I “and of a great Republican.” He wrote a book in defence of the
							people of England for beheading <persRef ref="charles-i">Charles the
									1<hi rend="superscript">st:</hi></persRef> That book said M<hi
										rend="superscript">r.</hi> Fauchet <persRef ref="riqueti-honore">Mirabeau</persRef> boasted of having made known in
							France—and published a translation of it which he pretended was his own;
							but in reality it was an old one, which had been published many years
							ago.— Mirabeau’s reputation said I, [“]has undergone great Revolutions
							since that of France began.”— “He was indisputably said he a Man of
							great Talents, but as to his integrity the fact is not so clearly
							settled.— Was he a Man of courage?— on pretend que non.— Every thing was
							as cautious and guarded as this.— “The accounts of success from the
							french armies are confirmed said he, and it is not improbable that on
							your arrival you will find the Stadtholder’s Court at Breda.— I have
							great hopes of that Country. I think the seeds of a happy Revolution are
							there; and always regretted that the patriots were abandoned and
							sacrificed.— You will arrive at a very critical time. Important
							negotiations must take place, at the close of the present campaign— The
							combined powers, Prussia, Austria, Spain, must surely discover, that
							they are labouring for an object the success of which would be
							destructive to themselves.— France once destroyed; and where will there
							be found a power to balance that of England— They are wrong to abuse
								<persRef ref="pitt-william2"><hi rend="italic">Pitt</hi></persRef>
							as they do. His plan is in my opinion vast and profound; and his
							Execution hitherto has been equally artful. His object is to ruin
							France; to establish beyond controul the power of Britain, and he has
							had the address to employ those nations the most deeply interested
							against the system, to spend their blood and treasure in promoting it.”—
							I was content to be simply an <pb n="9" type="ms"/>hearer of these
							observations, and easily perceived the policy of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Fauchet in advancing these sentiments. For if this be the system of the
							british Government, there is none of the European Nations who ought to
							wish more earnestly for its failure than the United States. As a
							commercial people we must very soon be their most dangerous rivals. As a
							naval power we must in time be their superiors, and France being the
							only Country in Europe, that can pretend to cope with them on the Sea at
							this Time, their claim to the <hi rend="italic">dominion of the
								Ocean</hi> would be established beyond controul by the destruction
							of the French power. In the triumphs of Britain, it would be absurd to
							expect moderation, and if by the ruin of her rival she could effectually
							secure the lordship of the waves, the United States would certainly be
							among the first to feel the insolence of her supremacy. This was not
							said by M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Fauchet, but is an inevitable inference
							from his opinions, and I believe it has too much foundation— I have seen
							however in some of the opposition news-papers a speculation in which the
							system is attacked, and the writer attempts to prove that by the
							destruction of France, England herself would be brought in jeopardy, and
							the power of <hi rend="italic">Russia</hi> only would be so promoted and
							strengthened as to become the Tyrant of Europe.</p>

							now engaged in a controversy which bears a very serious aspect. He spoke
							of the late speech of <persRef ref="adams-samuel">the Governor of

							that I should express not much respect for his character. I did not

							with Respect.— I enquired if he had any further particulars than such as
							were public, relative to the late <pb n="10" type="ms"/>actions in
							Flanders. he said no.— He affected to speak lightly of the <persRef
								ref="frederickaugustus">Duke of York’s</persRef> defeat, as well as
							of the late proceedings in England, and the suspension of the Habeas
							Corpus Act. The Government there he said was infinitely stronger than
							ours and even had fewer opposers. Personally he said he wished well to
							our Government, and hoped it would continue. But he believed that
							two-thirds of the people were opposed to it: whereas in Great-Britain,
							there was not more than one in an hundred hostile to their Government.—
							I told him that for the employment of Force, the observation was just,
							and that our constituted authority could not venture upon measure so
							decisive as were adopted by theirs. But that as to a spirit of real
							hostility I did not think it existed in the proportion of two thirds nor
							even of one in this Country.</p>
