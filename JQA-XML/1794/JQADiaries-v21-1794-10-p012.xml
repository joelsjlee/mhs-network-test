							out the whole of this day as he ever did in war time. Immediately upon
							the discovery of more than one vessel, all hands were summoned upon
							deck, and the ship thrown out of her course, as close to the wind as she
							could steer, in order to run away from these imaginary Algerines. After
							beating about half an hour in this manner, and perceiving that none of

							of the Heavens, and such as would carry us seven or eight knots an hour.
							We came for about 4 hours almost directly North, to get into the path we
							had forsaken, and at length fell into the very same course, which was to
							get the Dutchman into such bad bread.— Very fortunately the wind held
							untill we had well measured back our steps; but had it got round to the
							Northward we should have been altogether prevented from regaining our

								ref="macey-stephen">Captains</persRef> fortnight has proved a short
							one. The wind this morning returned to its favourite corner in the west;
							we soon left Beachy-Head which had been an eye-sore to us for almost
							forty-eight hours; discovered the light-House at Dungeness at about 11.
							passed it, between 12 and 1. soon came a-breast of the white-cliffs so
							celebrated in song, and <hi rend="strikethrough">first</hi> after 3.
							were opposite Dover. A signal was made for a pilot who came immediately
							on board in a small boat. the men in the boat then proposed to carry on
							shore the passengers, and after a little chaffering, whether their
							extortion should amount to a guinea or only half a guinea for each
							passenger they came to the latter price, and took us on board. They <hi
								rend="italic">then</hi> discovered, that the wind and tide had
							already carried us so far below the town, and the swell was so high,
							that we could not get back and that we must land four miles below from
							whence, we should have an agreeable walk to Dover, and we could send our
							baggage forward easily in a caravan. If however we preferred it, for an
							additional guinea, they would carry us on still five miles further <pb
								n="23" type="ms"/>to Deal where we should find an Inn, close upon
							the beach, and carriages for London ready at any hour. . . . .
							Expostulation was useless and as the least of two evils we chose to land
							at Deal.— At 5. P.M. our boat, was brought, broadside towards the shore,
							and was driven up by one breaker after another upon the beach, untill we
							could step on dry land, and we were fortunate that the swell there was
							very small, so that we did not get wet. directly opposite our landing
							place, we found the Royal Exchange Inn, at which with the highest
							satisfaction we found firm footing once more, the twenty-eighth day
							after our departure from Boston.</p>
						<p>The passage has been favourable beyond my most sanguine expectations; and
							considering the flimsy, crazy condition of the old ship; her uncommon
							dulness of sailing, and the <hi rend="italic">mistakes</hi> of our
							Captain, we must confess that our good Fortune has been really
							extraordinary. However the state of constant, uninterrupted anxiety
							which arose from the precarious tenure upon which we held our existence,
							and the alarm which every appearance of foul weather naturally excited,
							on board such a ship will I think induce me to avoid ever embarking in
							an egg-shell again to cross the atlantic. It is the second Time, I have
							been in jeopardy from a <pb n="24" type="ms"/>leaky vessel. It behoves
							me to beware of the third. Yet I cannot answer for the inducement of a
							concurrence of circumstances like that which brought me on board the
							Alfred.</p>
						<p>But the State of the vessel was far from being the only disagreeable
							thing we encountered; our Captain’s intellectual &amp; convivial powers
							were below the level of mediocrity. His knowledge was altogether such as
							experience had given him, and most of his former experience, was
							acquired in whaling voyeages and therefore not wholly suitable to this
							line of trade. His temper was cautious even to timidity, and for the
							most part cheerless and sullen. With all these unaccommodating
							qualities, he was liberally endowed with that self-conceit, and that
							exalted opinion of his own capacity which is so generally allotted to
							those from whom in reason it might be the least expected, and with an
							imperative, not to say an arbitrary tone, which naturally results from a
							station where authority is absolute and submission unqualified.</p>
						<p><persRef ref="u">Our first mate</persRef>, a brother of the Captain, was
							of a much more pleasing and agreeable disposition: always seeing the
							fair side of things <pb n="25" type="ms"/>and ready to make the best of
							every unfavourable aspect.— But his knowledge was even inferior to that
							of the Captain: he had never been in the channel; and from the manner in
							which he kept his journal, was I conclude a novice to the business and
							had never before acted in the station of a mate.</p>
						<p>Of our foremost hands two only were tolerable sea-men, and all the rest,
							were either entirely raw hands, or little better. The management of the
							vessel therefore was always slow &amp; aukward, and in squally times
							became really perilous.</p>
						<p>We had no steward, and were attended only by a <persRef
								ref="burtinet-jack">cabin-boy</persRef>, who was very heedless and
							far from being cleanly. But the quintessence of filth is etherial purity
							in comparison with our Cook; a black fellow of whom before we sailed
								<persRef ref="windship-amos">Doctor Windship</persRef>, spoke in
							terms of almost rapturous encomium. I have not been sea-sick upon the
							passage; but the sight (and I might add another sense) of this creature
							has repeatedly produced the effect to a much greater degree than all the
							tumbling or pitching that we have experienced.— As there is seldom any
							evil, but what is in some way or other connected <pb n="26" type="ms"
							/>connected with good, I attribute the extreme temperance which I have
							observed upon the passage, to the beastliness of this animal.</p>
						<p>Such was the character of our ships crew. And to complete the catalogue
							of conveniences, <persRef ref="whitcomb-tilly">my servant</persRef> has
							been all the passage so sea-sick, as to be of very little use to us, and
							frequently so as to require not a little attendance himself.</p>
						<p>From such a situation it may well be supposed, I rejoyce in being
							delivered: and the moment of landing this day was one of those instants
							of real and perfect satisfaction which <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>seldom</hi> occur <hi rend="strikethrough">but</hi> seldom in the
							course of human life.</p>
						<p>It was equally felt by <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brothe</persRef>r
							and by <persRef ref="walker-dudley2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Walker</persRef> our fellow passenger; who have served in some

							detailing. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Walker is a merchant of Boston of
							quite an amiable disposition, and tolerably clever as a companion. From

						<p>The point of departure is from London bridge, and the distance within the
							City is a separate calculation.</p>
						<p><pb n="28" type="ms"/>We breakfasted at Canterbury at the most
							indifferent house we found on the Road. At Dartford we dined and arrived
							at the Virginia Coffee House just below the Royal Exchange at about half
							past 7 in the Evening. Just before we got to the London Bridge we heard
							a rattling before us and immediately after a sound as of a trunk falling
							from the Carriage. I instantly looked forward and saw that both our
							trunks were gone. One of them contained all the public dispatches which
							I brought for the American Ministers here, and which was my principal
							inducement for coming here. For a moment I felt sensations of the
							severest distress. But my brother immediately alighted, and found the
							trunk of dispatches directly under the carriage. The other trunk was a
							few rods behind, and in half a minute more must have been crushed to
							pieces by the horses hoofs of a carriage which followed hard upon us. We
							secured them both inside of our Chaise for the rest of our way, and our
							driver assured us that the trunks could not have fallen unless the
							straps had been cut away. On reaching our lodgings and bringing our
							trunks to a light, we found the conjecture of our postilion was well
							founded, but whether his sagacity arose from his being privy to the
							villainy, and concerned in it, or not we had no means of determining,
							and as our things were <pb n="29" type="ms"/>saved was of little
							consequence to us to know.</p>
						<p>But for myself I felt the most exquisite satisfaction at this
							hair-breadth escape from a misfortune which to my mind as it respected
							myself personally, would have reduced me to the condition of regretting
							my other escape from the dangers of the seas. Entrusted with dispatches
							of the highest importance, with numerous original documents relative to
							the depredations upon the american Commerce, now a subject of
							negotiation between the two Countries, with papers particularly
							committed to my care, <hi rend="italic">because</hi> they were highly
							confidential, and the ground upon which I was directed by the <persRef
								ref="washington-george">President of the United States</persRef> to
							take my passage first to London in preference to an immediate
							opportunity for Amsterdam, with what a face could I have presented
							myself to <persRef ref="jay-john">the minister</persRef> for whom they
							were intended, to tell him that I had lost them on the way? How could I
							have informed the <persRef ref="randolph-edmund">Secretary of
								State</persRef> of the fate of his papers? what would have been my
							feelings on the reflection that they would probably all be put in the
							possession of the Ministry here? and how could I have supported the
							idea, that the story with a thousand alterations and aggravations would
							be resounded from one end of the United States, to the other? What a
							field for the aspersions of malice? What a fund for the suspicions of
							Jealousy? what an opening for the insinuations of Envy? and what a
							ground-work for the fabric of slander?— Well then might I consider this
								<hi rend="italic">instance</hi>
							<pb n="30" type="ms"/>instance of good fortune as more important to
							myself and to my Country, than my preservation and even that of the
							papers from the perils of the voyage.</p>
						<p>Yet for the mortification of my vanity I can attribute very little if any
							of my luck in avoiding this accident to any precaution of my own. An
							extreme anxiety for the trust committed to me had indeed never left me
							from the moment we landed at Deal, and I had been at the pains of having
							the whole package of two trunks changed there, that I might have my
							treasure under my own eye, rather than leave <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>them</hi> it but for a day in the custody of my servant. We set out
							so early in the morning, in order to reach London before dark; and as
							long as day-light lasted my trunk had been scarcely a moment out of my
							sight.— But we had not succeeded in finishing our Journey, before the
							night set in. The dexterous felony was committed in the shade of night,
							in the bustle of a London street; our carriage rattling over the
							pavements, and the noise of twenty others contributing to confuse our
							sense of hearing, half a minute more and my trust would have been
							irretrievably gone. That I heard the falling trunk early enough to
							defeat the intended theft, I can only consider as one of the most
							fortunate circumstances that ever occurred to me in the course of my
							life.</p>
						<p>Had the misfortune really befallen me, I could not have imputed it
							however to any fault or even to any deficiency of mine. I had neglected
							no possible precaution, for the papers were too voluminous to <pb n="31"
								type="ms"/>be contained in a trunk which could have been carried
							within the carriage. And although the trunks were lashed before the
							chaise, the straps were cut by an invisible hand, when most assuredly
							there was nobody to be seen near them. There is but one method by which
							we can account for the performance of this ingenious trick. About 3
							minutes before it was done, the chaise had stopped to pay the toll of a
							turnpike. A small child might at that moment have crept under the
							carriage between the hind wheels, and fastened himself upon the perch;
							waited there until we were again in motion, then silently sever the
							ropes and straps with a knife or Razor; drop from the perch, mingle with
							the crowd of passengers in the street, and wait with his accomplices to
							pick up the fallen-goods as soon as our carriage should have been a few
							rods further advanced. This I am told is a practice not unusual among
							the skilful thieves of this metropolis, and seems to be the only
							possible means by which the attempt was made which so happily for my
							peace, and the welfare of my Country, failed of success.</p>
						<p>We took a chamber for the night at the Virginia Coffee House, but after
							the accident that had happened I could not think of sleeping with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jay’s dispatches in my possession. I therefore
							immediately took an Hackney Coach, and drove to the Royal Hotel in Pall
							Mall where he lodges. He was ill with a rheumatic complaint, and <pb
								n="32" type="ms"/>has been for several days confined to his chamber,
							but upon informing his servant of my errand, I was admitted, and
							received by him with great cordiality.</p>
						<p>Having delivered my dispatches and had a short desultory conversation of
							about half an hour with him, I took my leave, and returned to my
							lodgings where on going into M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Walker’s chamber I
							found there my old friend <persRef ref="crafts-thomas">Tom
								Crafts</persRef>, and felt the most exquisite satisfaction in taking
							him once more by the hand. We passed an hour very happily in mutual
							congratulations and enquiries, and then severally retired to rest, where
							the pleasing reflection of having so far accomplished my voyage, and of
							having happily steered clear of so many real perils, continued revolving
							in my mind until I fell asleep.</p>
						<p>To a person arriving from a tedious and uncomfortable voyage, the
							appearance of the Country between Deal, &amp; this City is beautiful
							beyond description— The verdure of the fields, the luxuriance of the
							Harvest, the infinite variety of delightful prospects, the apparent
							opulence of the cities, the unrivalled excellence of the roads, of the
							travelling carriages &amp; horses, the neatness and elegance of
							accommodation at the Inns, and the vast numbers of travellers, who seem
							to make the way through the whole distance little different from a
							street of public resort, all combining together, convey an idea of
							perfect inchantment. In every one of these circumstances, the Country
							has very perceptibly improved, since I last travelled this road a little
							more than ten <pb n="33" type="ms"/>years ago. They all serve to
							demonstrate the vast wealth of the kingdom, and the perpetual recurrence
							of calls for money must convince every man that here at least it is
							considered as the supreme if not the only good.</p>
						<p>At the continual succession of objects to admire which presented
							themselves to our view during the course of this day, we might sometimes
							perhaps have gazed ourselves insensibly to stupefaction, had we not with
							equal frequency been called to satisfy the demands of postilions, of
							waiters, of hostlers and of the whole tribe of servants, whose
							subsistance by the custom of the Country, is palmed upon the generosity
							of travellers and guests. It is one of the most troublesome
							inconveniences that are met with in this Country. for as the quantum of
							the gratuity, depends upon the pleasure of the giver, there is no
							standard by which to measure the proper compensation for the services
							performed; and four times in five these insatiable leeches are
							discontented with what is given them and beg for more, which if refused
							they turn away, with an insolence of air and manner, not sufficient to
							warrant resentment, but always enough to be offensive.</p>
						<p>Were I (as <persRef ref="shandy-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Walter
								Shandy</persRef> says) absolute monarch of this island, I certainly
							would make a regulation that servants should be paid by their own
							masters. I would never allow of this priviledged beggary, which will
							neither fix its demand, nor acquiesce in what it receives.— As it is, I
							must submit to the custom; pay well, and hear their subsequent
							importunity with philosophical indifference.</p>

						<p><pb n="34" type="ms"/><date><hi rend="italic">Thursday October 16.
									1794.</hi></date> Before we rose this morning, <persRef
								ref="whitcomb-tilly">Tilly</persRef>, arrived in the Coach from
							Deal. We indulged ourselves indeed beyond the usual hour, and made it
							late before we went to breakfast with <persRef ref="jay-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jay</persRef>. We found there a <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pierpont</persRef> who has just
							arrived from France, and who gave us some account of the state of things
							in Paris, where the moderate party now prevails. Indeed nothing ever was
							more surprizing to me, than when M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Jay, last
							evening asked me whether the Death of <persRef
								ref="robespierre-maximilien">Robespierre</persRef> was known in
							America before I sailed. I repeated with utter astonishment,
							“Robespierre dead,” more times than was perfectly decent; and could
							scarcely believe I had heard right, until he assured me very seriously,
							that about six weeks or two months since, Robespierre, with a
							considerable number of his partizans were accused, tried, condemned and
							executed in less than twenty-four hours by a party of <hi rend="italic"
								>moderates</hi> who had succeeded to his power, and from that day to
							this have loaded his memory with every possible execration, calling him
							by scarce any other name than <hi rend="italic">the Tyrant</hi>, and
							imputing to him and his system, all the horrible cruelties which have
							desolated the Country for the last two years.</p>
						<p>The party which began its career of power, by ridding the Earth of such a
							scourge, cannot fairly on that account be charged with having falsely
							assumed the title of moderates. And their conduct since that time has
							been such as to give them a real claim to the epithet. There have been
							scarcely any public executions since that time; few arrests, and great
							numbers <pb n="35" type="ms"/>of prisoners released, who can attribute
							their present existence only to the fall of Robespierre.</p>
						<p>After breakfast, <persRef ref="trumbull-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Trumbull</persRef>, M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Jay’s secretary went
							with us and introduced us to <persRef ref="pinckney-thomas">M<hi

							Plenipotentiary at this Court. for whom I likewise had dispatches. Our
							visit was short and from thence we returned to our lodgings. Called on
								<persRef ref="crafts-thomas">Crafts</persRef> who has been these six
							weeks confined to his chamber by an accident which he met with in
							alighting from a carriage, by which he dislocated his ankle. Found with
							him <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Cazenove</persRef> a
							gentleman for whom I had a letter of introduction from <persRef
								ref="higginson-stephen2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Higginson</persRef>, which I delivered.— Dined with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Jay, and past the Evening agreeably with Crafts at his
							lodgings. Where we also found several other Gentlemen from America,
								<persRef ref="walker-dudley2">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>

							with these Gentlemen, who lodge at N:5. Castle-Court. Birchin Lane, at a
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Firth’s</persRef>. and
							between 11 and 12 we retired again to our chamber at the Virginia Coffee
							House. Not having been able in the hurry of this day to engage other
							lodgings.</p>
						<p>At about 2 afternoon I called at the New-England Coffee-House for
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gray</persRef>, son of
								<persRef ref="gray-harrison">Harrison Gray Esq<hi rend="superscript"

							Sterling in bank bills of England. I found him and delivered my trust.
								<pb n="36" type="ms"/>He was very sociable, and promised to call and
							see me as soon as I should get into lodgings. He enquired into the
							particulars of the late fire at Boston, and took half an hour, to prove

							would have suffered by it, had it happened twenty years sooner.</p>

						<p>We dined this day with <persRef ref="dickason-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Saturday October 18. 1794</hi>.</date> The former
							part of the day was entirely employed in visiting and delivering
							Letters; and in this immense City the distance from one gentleman’s
							house to another is such a Journey that this business proceeds very
							slowly indeed: I could pay but two or three visits before dinner time,
							which is here postponed till five o’clock in the afternoon. <persRef
								ref="crafts-thomas">Crafts</persRef> dined with us and we sat
							together with much satisfaction remembering the Saturday night’s club in
							Boston, till near 7. when we all went to Drury Lane theatre to see <hi
								rend="italic">Henry the eighth</hi>; with a farce called the <hi
								rend="italic">Glorious 1</hi><hi rend="superscript italic">st:</hi><hi
								rend="italic"> of June</hi>. The house itself has undergone a
							thorough alteration since I was here before, and has been lately
							repaired at the expence, it is said of an hundred thousand pounds. It is
							indeed very elegant; but the form into which the boxes are thrown is not
							convenient, and the house is too large. There are few voices that can be
							heard at all as far as the galleries, and frequently when the occasion
							of the scene requires a feeble utterance from the speaker, three fourths
							of the audience must be ignorant of what is spoken. the pillars between
							the boxes must intercept the sight in some degree, though their
							dimensions are reduced to a very small circumference indeed</p>
						<p><pb n="38" type="ms"/>The house was thin notwithstanding <persRef
								ref="siddons-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Siddons</persRef>
							appeared in the character of <persRef ref="katherine">Queen
								Catherine</persRef>. She is as much as ever, and as deservedly the
							favourite of the public, but the enthusiasm of novelty is past, and her
							appearance alone, no longer crowds the houses, as it was wont, when I
							saw her formerly in the autumn of 1783. She performed the past of
							Catherine to great perfection; much beyond the excellence of <persRef
								ref="yates-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Yates</persRef> whom I
							once saw and admired in the same character. None of the other persons of
							the Drama were better, most of them not so well filled as at the former

								ref="bensley-robert">Bensley</persRef> was a miserable substitute
							indeed, for <persRef ref="henderson-john">Henderson</persRef>, who in
							this character, used to excel himself. <persRef ref="palmer-john2"
								>Palmer’s</persRef> <persRef ref="henry-viii">Henry</persRef> was very good, but all the rest, were
							below the style of mediocrity. The farce or after-piece, was a miserable
							compound of dulness and gasconade upon the subject of their late naval
							Victory; which nothing but the ostrich stomach of national Vanity could
							ever have digested, and for which even the undistinguishing palate of
							their heavy pride was obliged to affect a relish higher than it felt.
							The applause of the Audience was frequent enough; but it was faint, and
							very evidently was bestowed by patriotism at the expence of taste. for
							it is doubtless an unequivocal proof of patriotism, to clap the hands,
							at the stupid fustian, of national adulation, and the puny <pb n="39"

							are rendering important services to their <hi rend="italic">King and

						<p>We soon got tired of this trash and left the house before it was half
							over. Crafts stopped a few minutes at our lodgings, and then left us to

						<p>The House has also undergone a total alteration since I was in it before.

							accommodated as if they were semi-circular.</p>
						<p>In the Interlude between the plays, the music, struck the tune of <hi

							loud applause, burst forth from every part of the house, and the whole
							Audience rose: they continued standing for as much as ten minutes, while
							the tune was played; clapping their <pb n="42" type="ms"/>hands and
							crying <hi rend="italic">bravo! bravo! </hi>with as much enthusiasm as
							they could have done, and they felt all the interest they pretended.
							Pure patriotism again. All for the service of their king and Country. I
							am always averse to an appearance of singularity. I rose with the rest
							of the Company but I was under no Obligation to join in the applause,
							&amp; I could not help disdaining the baseness of their servility.</p>

					<div type="docbody">
						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Wednesday October 22</hi><hi rend="superscript italic"
									>d:</hi><hi rend="italic"> 1794.</hi></date> We pass’d this
							forenoon like the two former, and at length got through the discussion
							of the Treaty. It is far from being satisfactory to those Gentlemen; it
							is much below the standard which I think would be advantageous to the
							Country, but with some alterations, which are marked down, and to which
							it seems there is a probability they will consent it is in the opinion
							of the two plenipotentiaries, preferable to a War: and when <persRef
								ref="jay-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jay</persRef> asked me my
							opinion I answered that I could only acquiesce in that idea.</p>
						<p><pb n="43" type="ms"/>There are three points of view in which this,
							Instrument may be considered. As it respects the Satisfaction to be
							received by the United States; as it relates to the satisfaction to be
							made: and as a permanent Treaty of Commerce.</p>
						<p>In the first place the satisfaction proposed to be made to the United
							States for the recent depredations upon their Commerce, the principal
							object of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jay’s mission, it is provided for in
							as ample a manner as we could expect. That complete indemnification will
							be made to every individual sufferer I fear is impossible; but as the
							evil is done and cannot be recalled, I know not well how we could
							require, more than the stipulations of this Treaty contain. The delivery
							of the Posts is protracted to a more distant period than would be
							desirable; but the compensation made for the past and the future
							detention of them will I think be a sufficient equivalent. The commerce
							with their West-India Islands, partially opened to us will be of great
							importance, and indemnify us for the deprivation of the fur trade since
							the treaty of Peace, as well as for the negroes carried away contrary to
							the engagement of the Treaty; at least as far as it respects the
							Nation.</p>
						<p>As to the satisfaction we are to make, I think it is no more than in
							Justice is due from us. The indemnity promised to british subjects for
							their losses resulting from the non-compliance with the Treaty on our
							part, is to be settled in the same manner with that which our citizens
							are to receive, and in fact is to depend upon the fulfilment of their
							engagement to deliver the Posts. The <hi rend="strikethrough">part</hi>
							article which provides against the future confiscation of <hi
								rend="italic">debts</hi>
							<pb n="44" type="ms"/>debts, and of property in the funds, is useful
							because it is honest. If its operation should turn out more advantageous
							to them, it will be more honourable to us; and I never can object to
							entering formally into an obligation to do that which upon every
							virtuous principle ought to be done without it.</p>
						<p>As a Treaty of Commerce this Treaty will indeed be of little use to us:
							and we never shall obtain any thing more favourable, so long as the
							principles of the Navigation Act, are so obstinately adhered to in this
							Country. This system is so much a favourite with the Nation, that no
							Minister would dare depart from it Indeed I have no idea that we shall
							ever obtain by compact a better footing for our Commerce with this
							Country than that on which it now stands. And therefore the shortness of
							time limited for the operation of this part of this compact, is I think
							beneficial to us.</p>
						<p>The Article proposed by <persRef ref="wedderburn-alexander">Lord
								Loughborough</persRef>, the Chancellor, is certainly extremely
							liberal, although M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jay thinks it best to leave it
							as a subject for future consideration. It is that in either Country the
							subjects or citizens of the other shall be exempted from <hi
								rend="italic">all the disabilities of alienage</hi>. Such an article
							would certainly tend to promote the friendly intercourse between the
							nations; and I do not know that it could produce any material <hi
								rend="strikethrough">intercourse with</hi> inconvenience to
							eith<unclear>er.</unclear> But it would be necessary to have an Act of parliament to
							confirm the stipulation here, which his Lordship says may be obtained
							without difficulty. A more material obstacle arises from the
							Constitution of the <pb n="45" type="ms"/>United States, with one clause
							of which, such an article would certainly militate.</p>
						<p>This nobleman, who during the American contest was so conspicuous in his
							opposition to our principles and pretensions, by the name of
							Wedderburne, has assured M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jay, that at present
							the controversy having been once determined, and the point of separation
							settled, his dispositions are perfectly friendly towards America. That
							he thinks it for the interest of both Countries to assimilate and draw
							together as much as possible, and that his sincere wishes are to
							facilitate the most liberal and amicable intercourse.</p>
						<p>The proposition which I have mentioned, and several others of inferior
							importance but equal liberality, seem to prove that his assurances are
							not disingenuous or false. And I think the intention of every man who
							aims at levelling the barriers which perpetuate the unnecessary
							separation of Nations, and widen the distance between Man and Man, is at
							least deserving of applause.</p>
						<p>We dined with <persRef ref="pinckney-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Pinckney</persRef>. <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Rutledge</persRef>, and a <persRef ref="deas-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Deas</persRef> of Carolina were of the
							Company, as also were <persRef ref="church-john;church-angelica">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							Church</persRef>. There was nothing particular observable in the former
							Gentleman, and Church is the same prating coxcomb that he was ten years
							ago, though not quite so boisterous. He rattled away like a Parrot
							against the Ministry, who he said had no Capacity, and defied the whole
							world to shew one single wise measure they had adopted, since they
							entered into this foolish War.</p>
						<p><pb n="46" type="ms"/>The conversation happening to turn upon the success
							of <persRef ref="cornwallis-charles">Lord Cornwallis</persRef> in India,
							Church affirmed that the Marquis was not entitled to any credit at all
							for what he had done there— It was impossible for him not to succeed. He
							went out with a force infinitely superior to any that had ever been
							employed in that Country before, and the nations he subdued were totally
							unfit for war and unable to contend with European forces. <persRef
								ref="clive-robert">Lord Clive</persRef> had done a thousand times
							more, with means incomparably smaller. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jay told
							him he undervalued the character of the Indians, and said that he had
							always had a regard for <persRef ref="tippoo-saib">Tippoo
							Saïb</persRef>, and his father <persRef ref="hyder-ali">Hyder
								Ali</persRef>. “And for my part (he added) I always wished them
							success.” I was happy that in this respect <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>that</hi> my opinion coincided with that of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Jay notwithstanding Church’s confident assurances.</p>
						<p>His anti-ministerial invectives carried an appearance of affectation as
							if he thought they gave him a kind of importance. In short I can safely
							apply to him the observation which <persRef ref="johnson-samuel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Johnson</persRef> made respecting <persRef
								ref="churchill-charles">Churchill</persRef> upon being told he had
							lampooned him under the name Pomposo. “I always thought him a shallow
							fellow; and I still think him so.”</p>
						<p>When I came home, for the first time since my arrival here I began upon
							my Letters to America.</p>

								ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Ward N.

								>Barnard’s</persRef> Inn, where he kept batchelors hall. <persRef
								ref="mackay-mungo">Captain Mungo Mackay</persRef> junior of Boston,
								<persRef ref="walker-dudley">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Walker</persRef> our fellow passenger in the Alfred, and an English
							gentleman were there. <pb n="48" type="ms"/>Our dinner was properly
							American, consisting of salt-fish and beef-steaks after the manner of
							our Country. Boylston is a little of the virtuoso as usual. Shewed us
							several curiosities in his possession. Gave us some of the genuine Water
							of the Nile, which was clear as crystal, and sweet as if drawn from a
							living spring and bread made of potatoes, which I could not have
							distinguished from the best superfine flour. He was oeconomical of his
							Nile Water, having only part of a bottle left. We all tasted of it
							except Mackay, who found a better relish in the excellent Madeira, on
							the table, and who would not while this could be had have tasted a drop
							of water were it from the fountain of Hippocrene itself.</p>
						<p>Boylston’s conversation is entertaining. He has travelled into the holy
							Land, and gave us quite an amusing account of his pilgrimage. He has
							accumulated a great fund of Anecdote upon every usual topic and favoured
							us with much of it this day. He is very conversible, and talked upon so
							great a variety of subjects, that I should despair of doing Justice to
							him if I attempted to detail his observations</p>
						<p>His uncle <persRef ref="boylston-thomas2">Tom Boylston</persRef> paid me
							a visit this morning. He has lately been liberated from the King’s Bench
							prison, stripped of his fortune of near three hundred thousand pounds
							sterling, and reduced to a modicum, much beyond his wants, but fatal to
							the hopes of his Ambition. He told us of his Will, made before his
							misfortune, and valued <pb n="49" type="ms"/>himself highly upon the
							magnificent things he meant to have done for the Town of Boston, and the
							State of Massachusetts. He seems to think the bare design entitles him
							to all the Gratitude, which could have been due to its execution, and
							wondered exceedingly that <hi rend="italic">after all he had done
							</hi>for my Country I should scruple at giving him a certificate of his
							being a citizen of the United States. I am far from being certain of the
							fact, or I should have complied with his request without hesitation. He
							says that he is generally considered here an as american spy, but I
							imagine his real character is as extensively known as his name— It is
							that of a Man whose habits in his prosperity, might have furnished <hi
								rend="strikethrough">upon amp</hi> a comic poet with ample
							improvement upon the scenes of <persRef ref="plautus-titus"
								>Plautus</persRef> or <persRef ref="moliere">Moliere</persRef>—a man
							in comparison with whom <persRef ref="arpagon">Arpagon</persRef> was
							generous and <persRef ref="harpax">Harpax</persRef> a prodigal.— He was
							however very civil to me, and invited me to dine with him. But our
							immediate departure for the Hague prevented me, from accepting his
							invitation.</p>
						<p><persRef ref="jennings-edmund">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Edmund
								Jennings</persRef> also called on me this day. He looks older than
							when I saw him last, by more than the difference of eleven years; and
							there appears upon his countenance something which I think favours of
							dejection. He thinks that this Nation from the sovereign to the beggar
							have a most inveterate hatred against America. <pb n="50" type="ms"/>I
							can hardly believe this to be the case. But it is nearer the truth than
							another opinion which I have frequently heard advanced since my arrival:
							that this people are uniformly friendly to us, and scarcely consider us
							as a different Nation from themselves. We have abundant reason to be
							convinced to the contrary of this, and I am satisfied they have not yet
							forgiven us the injuries we have suffered at their hands.</p>
						<p>Jennings says that he has it from such authority as is satisfactory to
							his own mind, that during the successes which attended the allied arms
							that last Autumn, when they were feasting their imaginations with the
							immediate conquest of France, <persRef ref="george-iii">the
								king</persRef> expected that as soon as that scheme should be
							accomplished, the force of the same Alliance would be applied to the
							restoration of his dominion in America.</p>
						<p>He spoke of the approaching trials for Treason. [“]Upon these Indictments
							he said it was a violently constructive Treason, but it would do! It
							would do for these Times! He expected many of the prisoners if not all
							of them, would be found guilty and condemned, and perhaps executed. But
								<persRef ref="hambden-john">Hambden</persRef> was found guilty—
								<persRef ref="russell-william2">Russell</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="sidney-algernon">Sidney</persRef> were found guilty. <persRef
								ref="sacheverell-henry">Sacheverell</persRef> was found guilty.— But
							it was remembered— This Government have drawn and still draw the reins
							of power so tight that they will break. There will be an <pb n="51"
								type="ms"/>explosion before long.”— The completion of this
							prediction would not I confess surprize me. The extraordinary agitation
							of the Government; its apparent anxiety and their present recourse to
							these measures of terror, strongly betray their consciousness that there
							is something rotten at the Heart. But how M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Jennings came to mention Sacheverell among his list of patriots
							oppressed I am at a loss to conjecture.</p>

						<p>The Packet from Harwich to Helvoetsluys is to sail on Wednesday in the

							in season on the same day. As the situation of affairs in Holland is at
							this time so very critical, I have determined to lose no time in
							transporting myself thither. I resolved therefore to avoid all risk of
							arriving at Harwich too late for the packet on Wednesday, and for that
							purpose to leave town to-morrow at 2 P.M. and go about 25 miles on the

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Tuesday October 28. 1794.</hi></date> I found
							notwithstanding <pb n="53" type="ms"/>I had taken great pains to be
							ready for this day that I had a great deal of business crowded into the
							last five or six hours.</p>
						<p>I called early this morning upon <persRef ref="jay-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Jay</persRef>. In the first place having received no
							answer to a letter I wrote the American bankers at Amsterdam, on my
							arrival here, for a draught to give me a pecuniary supply here, I found
							myself rather short in the necessary article of cash. I knew of no
							person upon whom I could more confidently venture to call than M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jay, and found myself not disappointed in my
							idea. He very readily gave me the draught I requested, and offered to
							extend his goodness still further. I thought best however to take only a
							supply for my immediate occasion, feeling highly obliged to him for this
							additional instance of his friendship</p>
						<p>I then requested him to favour me with his advice respecting the conduct
							which in my public character it will be proper to hold during the crisis
							in which that Country now stands. He was equally indulgent on that head,
							and I believe I shall derive much benefit from his counsel. He said that
							I should stand in a situation extremely delicate. That the parties which
							so unhappily divide the Country, to which I am sent might very possibly
							press me hard on either side to shew some preference or partiality; That
							I ought very cautiously to avoid it, and take no part whatever in their
							internal dissensions. That as to the possible revolution in Government
							to which <pb n="54" type="ms"/>they are now particularly exposed, in
							case an essential change should take place, the operation of my
							functions would cease of course, and it would not be adviseable for me
							upon any terms whatever to do business with any new power that might
							arise, until I should receive instructions upon the subject. And in the
							meantime I might write as soon as possible for eventual instructions.
							That if the french should obtain complete possession of Holland and the
							Government of the Country be actually dissolved my best way will be to
							stay there if I can with any possible convenience, but if I should be
							under the necessity of quitting the Country, it will be more proper for
							me to retire to Hamburg, as a neutral City, than to come to England or
							go to France, which might give occasion for censure, or at least for
							observations that would be unpleasant. And if the conquest should be so
							thoroughly completed as to extinguish the independence of the Nation
							itself, I may return home rather than wait any great length of time for
							the regular recall.</p>
						<p>I then took my leave of this Gentleman and <persRef ref="jay-peter">his

								n="55" type="ms"/>french would reach Amsterdam; which is certainly
							not his wish.— I returned home, and it was already 3 in the afternoon. I
							found <persRef ref="johnson-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Johnson</persRef> the consul at my lodgings. He told me he had a
							large quantity of tobacco in Amsterdam, belonging to him. It was now in
							the hands of <persRef ref="hope-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Hope</persRef> and Company there, and under the present
							circumstances he was very anxious to provide in some way or other for
							its protection. He requested me to go with him to the other house of our
							Hotel where <persRef ref="hope-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. W.
								Hope</persRef> of the house is now lodged, that we might confer with
							him upon the subject, which we accordingly did. I told M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Johnson, that the proper measures to ascertain his title as
							an american citizen to the property, being a preliminary for which he
							must be responsible, I should consider it a part of my duty to do every
							thing in my power, to secure its safety, under any contingency that
							might happen, and it was then agreed by those two gentlemen, that the
							possession of the tobacco should be transferred from their house, in
							whose hands it might be liable to capture to me, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Johnson is to supply the proof that the property is bona
							fide in him.</p>
						<p>This business being thus settled we parted. I took a slight refreshment
							with <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef>, and just before
							five o’clock we entered the Post-Chaise, having sent <persRef
								ref="whitcomb-tilly">my servant</persRef> to Harwich by the stage
							this morning.</p>
						<p><pb n="56" type="ms"/>We stopped a moment at <persRef ref="crafts-thomas"
								>Crafts’s</persRef> lodgings to leave our packets for America, and
							to bid farewell to our Countrymen there, and by the time we got out of
							the city the night had fairly set in. We reached Romford the first stage
							at about half past seven, and determined by the desire of my brother, to
							go one stage further. We were proof against the solicitations of the
							host and hostess at Romford who assured us they had excellent beds; that
							their horses had all travelled this day and would rather lag, as the
							roads were uncommonly bad. In spite however of all these discouragements
							we persisted in our resolution, and in less than an hour and an half
							were driven to Ingatestone, and could therefore have no reason to
							complain of bad roads or tired horses. Just after nine o’clock therefore
							we found ourselves twenty-seven miles from our departure at <persRef
								ref="osborne-william">Osborne’s</persRef> Hotel, and here took up
							our abode for the night.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Wednesday October 29. 1794.</hi></date> At five
							this morning we ascended once more our Post-Chaise and after a ride of
							fourteen miles, breakfasted at Witham: at a house rather inferior to
							that where we breakfasted at Canterbury on our road to London. We
							immediately after proceeded on our way, and arrived at the three Cups
							Inn, Harwich, just after one. We soon found <persRef
								ref="whitcomb-tilly">Tilly</persRef> who was at another house, and
							were informed that the wind being favourable, the Packet would sail as
							soon as the mail should arrive. <pb n="57" type="ms"/>Just before our
							entry into the borough we past a Camp, where are stationed about fifteen
							hundred men.— We had no sooner alighted than a couple of harpies in the
							shape of Custom House Officers, paid us their visit. They had no sort of
							inclination to examine our baggage, but there was two shillings to pay
							to the Office, and something by way of compliment to them— <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas">My brother</persRef> asked them what was the
							customary compliment, and one of them in all meekness and humility
							answered half a crown a piece. We were glad to be rid of them even upon
							these terms, and sat down to our dinner. We had scarcely finished this
							and given orders for a little basket of provisions to be made up for us,
							when a man bolted into our chamber with a faltering step and a swimming
							eye, and accosted us in the following manner, “G, g, gentlemen, come the
							mail’s arrived. I’m going on b-board myself; and when I once get there,
							I’ll be damned if I’ll wait for arry man in England.”— “You are the
							Captain of the Packet Sir.” “Yes Sir; and them people down there want to
							wait and wait, an hour m-more and an hour more; but when I once ge-get
							on board, I’ll sail by G— passenger or no passenger.” “I am very happy,
							Sir, to hear this is your determination, and we are this moment ready to
							go. Your name Captain if you please.” “<persRef ref="u">Dean</persRef>,
							Sir.— And I know you. Y-your name’s Adams.— there— dont I know you.”— I
							told him he was right tho’ I did not recollect him. After swearing two
							or three times more, that he would not wait for those <pb n="58"
								type="ms"/>people, who only wanted time to drink another bottle
							after dinner, he staggered out of the room again, and my brother
							observed that we had a hopeful prospect before us, to sail with a
							Captain already drunk. I could not persuade him that this circumstance
							was of no consequence, and we immediately left the Inn to embark. The
							packet was about a mile from the landing, anchored at that distance, for
							the sole purpose of accommodating the boat-men of the port, with a large
							fare extorted from the passengers. We were rowed to the vessel, in a
							boat ready to sink under the load of baggage and persons it contained.
							We secured for ourselves a couple of births such as we could get and
							thought ourselves fortunate to get any, for we had not been half an hour
							on board, before the boatloads of passengers more came to join us.</p>
						<p>The road from London to Harwich is not so much travelled as that between
							Dover and the Capital. though it has been very much so for several
							months by the passing to and from the army on the Continent. The roads
							are very little inferior but the Inns though very good are not quite in
							a style of such perfect accomodation. The country is not in such
							exquisite cultivation, but is yet enchantingly beautiful; and the
							delightful prospects, which with endless variety appear in the most
							rapid succession, still exhibit to the admiration of the traveller,
							scenes which almost realize the fictions of a fairy land.</p>

						<p>which with three Miles to the point of departure in London makes the
							seventy-seven we have rode since we left Osborne’s Hotel. The first
							stage is paid at the rate of 13, 14, or 15 pence sterling a mile for a
							Chaise and pair, according to the caprice or extortion of those who let
							them; this extraordinary price is paid only for the first stage <hi
								rend="italic">coming from</hi> London, and is not required to <hi
								rend="italic">going</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">to</hi> it. The regular price throughout the rest of
							the roads is a shilling per mile. The usual <hi rend="italic"
								>compliment</hi> to the driver is from a shilling to half a crown
							according to his expedition; and the expence of turnpikes on the road is
							about three or four shillings more.</p>
						<p>It was about four in the afternoon when we reached the packet, and by
							five we were fairly under weigh, with a small, but favourable wind. The
							vessel was almost as quiet as if we had been on Land. Our passengers are
							twenty-five in number, and every name, language and Country seems to be
							jumbled together in our cabins.</p>
						<p><pb n="60" type="ms"/>For the 25 cabin-passengers, there are only 16 beds

							there is one passage with two beds only, for the accommodation of

							about to return. At about 9 in the Evening I was compelled to seek my
							birth, for it was too cold to remain upon deck, and below, the bed,
							though barely of a size to contain a single person, was at least as
							roomy as any part of the cabin, crowded as it was.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Thursday October 30</hi><hi rend="superscript italic"
									>th:</hi><hi rend="italic"> 1794.</hi></date> A fresh wind
							sprung up in the night, and carried us over with such rapidity that soon
							after day-break, we made the land on the Coast of Holland: but though
							not more than four leagues distant from the shore it was not till
							afternoon that we reached it. The weather had grown extremely chilly and
							rainy. and the Wind early in the morning became adverse. At about noon a
							number of passengers went a shore in boats which came from the land; we
							were beating; and as long as a single passenger remained disposed to go
							in the boats, we could not possibly get into the port. But when all
							those who were in such hurry to get ashore were gone, and those of us
							alone remained who were determined to remain on <pb n="61" type="ms"
							/>board, we got in immediately. But although we were within ten paces of
							the wharf, and it was difficult to avoid reaching it, the anchor was
							dropt so à propos, that we could not land without calling for a boat
							from the shore.— At Helvoetsluys, we found all the miserable taverns so
							full that we found with difficulty an house to give a temporary shelter
							from the rain; for our baggage. The Commissaris rung his bell, and
							immediately half a dozen or more waggoners appeared. The tray and three
							dice were produced, and the boers alternately threw for the lucky chance
							of shewing us his insolence and extortion. Our company of the Packet
							Boat, had by this time considerably dispersed. <persRef ref="u"
								>East</persRef> was already gone forward. Some stopp’d for the night
							at Helvoet; and others got away before us. The waggons were light and
							open, and drawn by four stout horses to each of them. Six of us were
							permitted to take one waggon; but the driver insisted that our baggage
							was too heavy. That we must either take another waggon, between us, or
							walk on foot ourselves. My knowledge of the language was next to nothing
							that of <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef> &amp; <persRef
								ref="whitcomb-tilly">servant</persRef> litterally nothing. We
							abandoned ourselves therefore to the conduct of two Dutch Gentlemen, the
							one named <persRef ref="u">Van den Berg</persRef>, and the other
								<persRef ref="u">Fortus</persRef>.— After the latter had contested
							sometime with the Boer whether the waggon would or would not be too
							heavily loaden with our weight and that of our baggage, he persisted in
							his opinion, and began to ascend the carriage. The boer without ceremony
							unhooks his four horses, and was driving them off. He knew that would
							bring us <pb n="62" type="ms"/>to terms. It is an invariable expedient
							with them. I have seen it often tried, and never fail, because the
							traveller in such cases has no remedy but acquiescence. Fortus therefore
							called back the Boer, and appealed to the Commissaris. But his opinion
							was that the roads being very heavy, the waggons would only go the pace,
							and it would be much more comfortable to go to the Briel on foot; which
							we did accordingly.</p>
						<p>We had only English money about us. Guineas being in great demand a Jew
							offered my brother twelve guilders four stuivers a piece for any he
							might wish to change. Fortus thought it was not enough, and said he
							would change one himself. He accordingly took one of my brother for
							which he gave him twelve guilders; and the next minute, changed it again
							with the Jew, for twelve and six, keeping the odd stuivers I presume as
							compensation for his kindness.</p>
						<p>We walked to the Briel, a distance of about six of our miles. Our company
							again separated here. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fortus conducted us to an
							house kept by an old Scotsman, named <persRef ref="u">Lesley</persRef>.
