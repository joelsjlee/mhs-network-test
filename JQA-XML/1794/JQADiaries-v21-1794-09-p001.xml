								<hi rend="italic">Rewards</hi>.” The pain of separation from my

							these two young men left the ship, as it ever has been at any period of
							my life. It was like the <pb n="2" type="ms"/>severing the last string
							from the Heart. I looked back at their boat as long as it could be seen,
							and when it had got out of sight, I did not, but I could have turned my

							the wind for a moment veered to the East, and we began to apprehend a
							difficulty to clear the Capes; but the western gale finally prevailed a
							slight shower of rain was succeeded by a beautiful Rainbow in the East a
							pledge of fair weather for the morrow, and a livid corner broke forth in
							the west, from whence the clouds were very soon dispelled from the sky,
							and left us for the night a cloudless canopy over our heads and a fresh
							western breeze to waft us on our course.</p>

						<p>Thursday September 18. 1794. Fresh breeze from the Southwest
							through the whole of a perfectly clear day. The vessel rolls not a
							little and our fresh water sailors were most of them sick. the morning
							exhibited a boundless Ocean to our view. And at noon the Captain told me
							he supposed we had reached George’s Bank, which is 35 leagues distant
							from Cape-Cod. On this bank the <persRef ref="macey-stephen"
								>Captain</persRef> says he met with a violent current, when he last
							came from Europe, which prevented his getting across for two or three
							days though with favourable winds. What can be the cause of these <hi
								rend="italic">temporary</hi> currents?— Indeed it appears to me that
							on this Bank there is a <hi rend="italic">constant</hi> current setting
							eastward. the shortness and irregularity of the seas so very
							distinguishable from any thing on either side of it and which I well
							remember to have observed when passing this place heretofore, convince
							me of this fact. <pb n="3" type="ms"/><persRef ref="pownall-thomas"
								>Governor Pownal</persRef> I am told has written a pamphlet on this
							subject. Mem<hi rend="superscript">m:</hi> to consult it.</p>
						<p>We saw this day only two small schooners one of them holding her course
							westward, and the other nearly the same with ourselves; she outsailed us
							however very considerably; &amp; at night had nearly got out of our
							sight a-head. The Alfred among other of her merits is a dull sailor I
							perceive; and with a very fresh breeze goes not more than 6 knots before
							the wind.</p>
						<p>She is moreover old, crazy and leaky; and many of my friends in Boston
							who dissuaded me from taking passage in her prophesied that she would
							never reach her destined port in Europe.— But no other vessel presents
							itself to sail for a considerable length of Time from Boston. To go to
							New-York with all my baggage, would have been tedious, expensive, and
							after all upon an uncertainty whether I should there find a speedier or
							better conveyance. I had from a variety of causes been already detained
							so long since my appointment, as to have given me a great degree of
							anxiety; and I could not justify to my own sense of duty, the omission
							of any opportunity to depart, however indifferent the vehicle: as to the
							ship I was in hopes that her reputation was worse than she deserved; the
							owners protested most solemnly that she was a good ship. The Captain who
							knows her very well, declares he would willingly go in her to any part
							of the world: <persRef ref="wainwright-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Wainwright</persRef>, who went in her the last voyage she made to
							Europe, says she is a good ship, though a little leaky, and in
							opposition to this concurrent tho’ partly interested testimony I had
							nothing but a general <hi rend="italic">opinion</hi> <pb n="4" type="ms"/>opinion among the merchants in Boston, that she was
							a very bad ship to warrant me in incurring a further delay. I therefore
							took my passage in her, though from what I have hitherto observed of her
							I have no reason to think that her character was improperly estimated.
							Her present texture is certainly feeble and frail enough for an atlantic
							voyage, and I place a much greater dependance upon a pleasant passage,
							than upon any merit of hers to land us safely on the other side— But the
							dye is cast, and we are now only to make of our bargain the best we
							can.</p>

						<p>Our weather had been remarkably pleasant the whole day but at night the

							continued with repeated squalls and heavy winds for about six hours. One

							meteor resembling a ball of fire which in these heavy gales sometimes

							the top, which it <pb n="7" type="ms"/>usually does when the gale is at
							its highest pitch; and it afterwards descends again and disappears. I
							asked the Seaman, whether he ever heard that these things were the

							but I am very sure that this phenomenon was in some respect or other

						<p><hi rend="italic">Thursday September 25: 1794.</hi> Our
							breeze continued very fresh, our swell rather high. The water appeared
							to me to have changed its colour, and the Sea irregular or as one of our
							Seamen termed it <hi rend="italic">up in heaps</hi>. I thought we must
							by this time have reached the banks of Newfoundland, and upon examining
							our <persRef ref="macey-stephen">Captain’s</persRef> chart this morning
							found the conclusion strongly corroborated in my mind.— Captain Macey’s
							knowledge is all practical, he has very little theory, and may be termed
								<pb n="8" type="ms"/>illiterate without injury to his reputation. he
							himself says he never was but a fortnight at school. but he has followed
							a sea-faring life these fifteen years. The premises therefore upon which
							he grounds his opinion of approaching the banks, are not his
							calculations, but the sight of fishing schooners and of birds called
							Haglets which are most frequently numerous and are in some measure
							peculiar to this place. We saw no fishing schooners the former part of
							this day; and very few Haglets. The Captain concludes therefore that we
							have not reached the banks.</p>
						<p>This afternoon we saw a ship nearly a-head of us. and as she held her
							course westward we very soon met—about 300 tons, and hoisted american
							colours which we likewise did. we pass’d very near to each other but
							without speaking. Our Captain seems rather averse to speak with any
							thing. The reason may be that he thinks in time of war between the great
							naval powers; the less a neutral vessel is meddled with the better her
							luck.—</p>
						<p>Just as we were going to bed at about 10. this Evening,<persRef ref="u">
								the mate</persRef> who kept the watch came and informed the captain,
							that there was a little fishing schooner laying <hi rend="strikethrough"
