						<p>I resume the Diary in this Book after interruption from the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March, during which it has been kept
							on sheets which I could take with me to and from the house from day to
							day— Perhaps that is the best form in which a Diary can be kept— It is
							certainly the most convenient, at the time of keeping; though not the
							best for preservation— <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef>, the Minister of the
							Congregational Church paid me a morning visit— By agreement with his
							Parishioners he has reduced his Salary from 750 dollars to 500 dollars a
							year, and other persons are engaged to preach for him about half the
							time— A young man by the name of <persRef ref="lunt-william"
								>Lunt</persRef> has been preaching for several weeks till last
							Sunday when <persRef ref="gray-thomas2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gray</persRef> of Jamaica Plains performed the services— I met him
							as he was returning home, on my way from Dedham— There has been erected
							since the last Autumn a new and fourth house of worship in this town of
							Quincy— An Orthodox, or Calvinistic Church— They are now Unitarian,
							Episcopal, Universalist, and Orthodox; and the Universalists have
							dismissed <persRef ref="morse-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Morse</persRef>, who was not sufficiently thorough going to suit
							their taste, and have a <persRef ref="smith-daniel3">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> in his place— There is
							a <persRef ref="leach-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Leach</persRef> at the Episcopal Church— The Calvinists have none
							yet settled.— I wrote Letters to <persRef ref="kingsbury-fisher">Fisher

									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Thomas B. Adams</persRef>— My Son

							This afternoon and Evening were showery with thunder and lightning;
							which confined <hi rend="strikethrough">us</hi> to the House— After
							breakfast this morning, I visited my Garden, and found amidst the
							enormous growth of weeds, a number of seedling plants of the last year,
							and many that have come up the present Season— But a large portion of
							those that I had set out last October, and among them several very fine
							trees are dead— I have much anxiety for the proper disposal of my time,
							until the approach of Winter shall call me again to Washington—and a
							deep, though most fruitless impression of the duties of advancing
							age—</p>

							Mount Wollaston farm to the first of this Month— I spent an hour in the
							garden, and found several seedlings from my last years Plantations. My
							Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, left me this

							five minutes at the Creek wharf, and had an Evening visit from <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Greenleaf</persRef>— I wrote a short Letter to <persRef
								ref="adams-joseph">Midshipman Joseph H. Adams</persRef> covering one
							to him from his Guardian <persRef ref="foster-phineas">Phineas
								Foster</persRef>— But that which absorbed the largest portion of the

								type="ms"/>Correspondence, in the approach of our War for
							Independence— <persRef ref="tucker-george">George Tucker</persRef>
							professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Virginia recently
							wrote me a Letter of enquiry upon this Subject— He is writing the Life
							of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Thomas Jefferson</persRef>, and
							enquires whether any Committees of Correspondence were appointed by the
							Legislature of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay before 1773.— Jefferson
							claims the invention of Committees of Correspondence for Virginia, and
							it has become a controverted point of History. Tucker cites in his
							Letter to me <persRef ref="marshall-john">Marshall’s</persRef> life of

						<p><date>17. IV:45 </date>Thursday— From Quincy to Boston and Medford.</p>
						<p>I wrote this morning a short Letter to <persRef ref="morris-charles"
								>Commodore Morris</persRef>, enclosing my own, and in it that of
								<persRef ref="foster-phineas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Phineas
								Foster</persRef> to <persRef ref="adams-joseph">Midshipman Joseph H.
								Adams</persRef>. Copying my own Letters, and writing part of the
							Diary of yesterday, consumed the early morning. At ten I went with
								<persRef ref="wilson-john8">Wilson</persRef> and the Coach into
							Boston— The first person whom I met in the Street was <persRef
								ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Parkman</persRef>, who invited me to dine with him, but I was
							engaged to go to Medford— I called at my Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> Office and saw him— Then
							went to the State-House, and in the Secretary’s Office. I saw <persRef
								ref="bangs-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bangs</persRef>,
							and extracted from the Journal of the House of Representatives of the
							Province of Massachusetts Bay, of the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of
							November 1770. the entry of an order for the appointment of a Committee
							of Correspondence; to correspond with the Agent of the Province and
							others in England with the Speakers of the several Assemblies, and with
							Committees of Correspondence appointed, or who might be appointed by
							them— There was a Meeting of the Overseers of Harvard University in the
							Council of Chamber at half past 12. I found them in Session and the
							President, <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Quincy</persRef> giving them an account of the recent disturbances
							among the Students— He said among other things that he was not at
							Liberty to mention what the faculty had determined upon the whole
							affair; but that it would be made public to-morrow— The Senior Class had
							been allowed to go to their respective homes without being informed
							whether they would have a commencement or not. <persRef
								ref="austin-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James Trecothick
								Austin</persRef>, the Attorney General of the Commonwealth made some
							acerbated remarks upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy’s
							Statement; and <persRef ref="everett-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Alexander H. Everett</persRef> expressed surprized that
							the President should have declined communicating to the Board, what had
							been the determination of the Faculty; although it was to be made
							publicly known to-morrow— But this Meeting was held; by a regular
							By-Law, more than thirty days before Commencement, to consider of the
							honorary <pb n="353" type="ms"/>degrees proposed by the Corporation to
							be then conferred—and the subject of the disturbances was not even
							properly before the Meeting for discussion— I made this remark as
							serving to justify the President, for his omission to make a full Report
							to this Meeting on the disorders of recent occurrence, and observed that
							I could readily concern there might be very good reasons for the Faculty
							to withhold a premature report of their proceedings— It had been agreed
							that the meeting should be adjourned to the 21<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> of August to receive the report of a Committee of three
							upon the proposed honorary degrees.— <persRef ref="blake-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Blake</persRef> however thought
							it would be necessary that there should be an earlier meeting to
							consider of the disturbances, and at his motion it was agreed that the
							Meeting should be adjourned to this day fortnight, the 31<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of July at ten O’Clock in the
							Morning—when President Quincy engaged to be prepared with a full report
							upon the subject— He agreed to this with some reluctance—complaining of
							having been much overburthened with labour, and of having expected to
							enjoy some relaxation during the vacation— It was two O’Clock when the
							Meeting adjourned— My Carriage was then waiting for me at the gate, and
							took me with Charles to <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks’s</persRef> at Medford—to dine—
							There I found <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">Charles’s wife</persRef>
							with <persRef ref="adams-john17;adams-louisa3">their two
								Children</persRef>— <persRef ref="everett-edward;everett-charlotte"

							<persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> N.
								L. Frothingham</persRef>, and a young man named <persRef ref="u"
								>M’Cracken</persRef> from New-York, were of the dinner company; they
							all returned home in the Evening; but I remained to pass the Night at
							Medford— We had been overtaken by a copious Shower between Boston and
							Medford, and there was a heavy thundergust while we were at dinner— The
							evening was damp and sultry, so that it confined us to the house.</p>

						<p>I took a shower bath this Morning, and walked round the grounds of

								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> to Boston— Called

							found a Letter from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my

						<p><persRef ref="spear-william">William Spear</persRef> came this Morning
							and discoursed to me an hour or two upon various matters relating to my
							estate and affairs here— They are tedious, and irksome, and thorny—and I
							would gladly escape from them but cannot— I suffer by carelessness and
							inattention to them. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spear gave me much
							good advice, and apprised me of various depredations committed upon my
							property—the remedy for which would be attention. This I resolved to
							give, as I have often resolved before— My nephew <persRef
								ref="adams-john3">John Quincy</persRef> was here, and <persRef
								ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="morton-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph
								Morton</persRef> paid me a morning visit— I passed the day at home,
							with a morning and afternoon call in my Garden— My seedling trees
							increase in number; but many of them annually perish— I finally wrote of
								<persRef ref="tucker-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Tucker</persRef>, and enclosed to him a copy of the order upon the
							Journal of the House of Representatives of the Province of
							Massachusetts-Bay of 7. Nov<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1770.
							appointing a Committee of Correspondence to correspond with the Agent of
							the Province in England—with the Speakers of the several Assemblies of
							the other Colonies or with Committees of Correspondence appointed by
							them— The claim of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson</persRef> to these
							Committees of Correspondence, as a Virginian invention, is like the
							claim of <persRef ref="vespucci-amerigo">Amerigo Vespucci</persRef> to
							the discovery of the new Hemisphere— This search engaged me again in the
							perusal of the Journal of the Massachusetts House of Representatives of
							the year 1773, and of the third Volume of <persRef
								ref="hutchinson-thomas">Hutchinson’s</persRef> History, both of
							which I went cursorily through; with occasional reference to <persRef
								ref="bradford-alden">Alden Bradford’s</persRef> history of
							Massachusetts from 1764 to 1775— Hutchinson’s History is such a tale of
							humiliations and discomfitures to the author that it is scarcely
							conceivable how he should have had the patience to write it, or the
							courage to leave it in manuscript to survive him— It is a precious
							historical memorial as the narrative of the origin and progress of the
							American revolution, by the most effective Agent on the Royal side, in
							producing it— Himself too a native of the Colonies—the Representative
							not only of the Transatlantic Government, but of the portion of the
							Colonial population which adhered to the mother Country and her cause—
							The day was so much absorbed by this reading, that I had only the
							Evening to write to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my

						<p>Copied into my Letter-Book the Letter written last Evening to <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>— This is noisome, and
							to me useless labour, consuming time which might be fruitfully employed—
							But in <persRef key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> first
							Letter-Book, I find him saying on the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of
							June 1776 that in all the correspondences he had maintained, during a
							course of twenty years at least that he had been a writer of Letters, he
							never kept a single copy. And he adds— This negligence and inaccuracy
							has been a great misfortune to him on many occasions.— A Letter Book—a
							Diary—a Book of receipts and expenses—these three Books, kept without
							intermission, should be the rule of duty of every man who can read and
							write— But to keep them perseveringly requires a character given to very
							few of the Sons of men— Above all it requires a character to which toil
							is a pleasure, and of which untiring Patience is an essential Element.—
							I heard <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> P.
								Whitney</persRef> in the morning from Ecclesiastes 9.5. “For the
							living know that they shall die: but the dead knows not any thing,
							neither have they any more a reward: for the memory of them is
							forgotten.” A Sermon upon Death.— A monition? The text contains one of
							those passages, of which there are many in the writings of <persRef
								ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>, and in the Psalms, and which seem
							to deny a future state of existence— But there are many other passages
							in the same Books importing and even affirming, the immortality of the
							Soul— The most remarkable and emphatic of which is in the twelfth
							chapter of this Book of Ecclesiastes, and the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> verse— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney’s afternoon
							discourse was from 1. Corinthians 13.12. [“]For now, we see through a
							glass darkly.” There was a collection at the close of the afternoon
							service, to purchase books for the Sunday School.— <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef>
							came out from Boston, and dined and spent the day with me— Evening visit
							from <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Daniel Greenleaf</persRef>— I read the 8<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Sermon of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of
								<persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>—upon the
							participation of Christians in the exaltation of Jesus Christ—preached

						<p>Visited my garden this morning after Breakfast. My nephew <persRef

								brother</persRef>—our son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef>
							and his wife <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> are all sick— She
							says nothing of her intention to come on— I wrote two Letters—one to
								<persRef ref="brown-samuel">Samuel Brown</persRef>, and one to
								<persRef ref="kirby-edmund">E. Kirby</persRef>, both at Brownville,
							and in answer to Letters from them, relating to the Monument to be
							erected over the remains of <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General
								Brown</persRef> at Washington— They urge me to write the obituary
							Inscription; a task from which I should have been glad to be relieved,
							but which I have nevertheless consented to undertake.— General Brown is
							one of those men, who have rendered eminent services to this Country,
							and to whom full Justice has not been rendered in return. He was a
							native of Pennsylvania, and it is a very remarkable fact that the People
							of that State, whose fanatical passion for <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Andrew Jackson</persRef> can be compared to nothing but that of
								<persRef ref="titania">Titania</persRef> Queen of the Fairies, for
								<persRef ref="nickbottom">Bottom</persRef>, after his Assification,
							never manifested the slightest regard, or gave a single token of
							gratitude to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>. He made <pb n="356" type="ms"
							/>this remark once, himself, with deep and indignant feeling, to me— He
							said nothing of Jackson, or of the senseless devotion to him of the
							Pennsylvanians— But he knew that his own services had been more arduous
							and his sufferings infinitely more severe in the Cause of the Country
							than those of Jackson— But such is the nature of popular applause—
							General Brown died Commander in chief of the Army; and probably Jackson

						<p>My Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> returned this
							morning to Boston with a promise that he would come out again next
							Friday— He took with him my Letter Book, to copy the Letters that I may
							send him— I had a Letter from <persRef ref="thayer-elisha">Elisha
								Thayer</persRef> of Dedham requesting me to furnish him with
							extracts from the old Book of Braintree town Records, of all the entries
							of births, deaths and marriages of <persRef ref="tompson-benjamin"
								>Benjamin Tompson</persRef>, and his family— He was the town Clerk
							from the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of Oct<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> 1687—three years and again from 1696 to 1699. I undertook
							this morning to make the extracts; and they engaged me for three or four
							hours— The entries are in a state of confusion almost inextricable. My
							nephews <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-john3">John Quincy</persRef> came this morning and again
							at the high tide at one O’Clock, and I bathed with them at <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Greenleafs</persRef> wharf— They also dined with me, and visited my
							garden with me after dinner— There had been since yesterday another
							great change of weather from very cool to close and sultry—after dinner
							I was in such a state of lassitude that I found it impossible to write—
							I attempted to read, but could take no interest in any thing— I looked
							over the Annual Register for 1758 to find some historical facts of 1757—
							Then <persRef ref="marshall-john">Marshall</persRef> History of the
							British Colonies in America separated from his Life of <persRef
								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>— Then in <persRef
								ref="beloe-william">Beloe’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="herodotus">Herodotus</persRef> an account of the Median
							Empire, amusing, but too fabulous, and finally <persRef
								ref="degenlis-stephanie">Madame de Genlis’s</persRef> preface and
							introduction to the Memoirs of the <persRef ref="courcillon-philippe"
								>Marquis de Dangeau</persRef>. Somewhat unexpectedly I found there a
							warm panegyric upon the character of <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis the
									14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi></persRef> and rather an angry
							charge against <persRef ref="fenelon-francois">Fenelon</persRef>, for
							his indirect Satire upon the Government and court of Louis, in his
								<persRef ref="telemachus">Telemaque</persRef>— She cites the Eulogy
							of Fenelon by <persRef ref="dalembert-jean">D’Alembert</persRef> as
							Secretary of the French Academy, and refers to a Manuscript Letter there
							stated by him to have been written by Fenelon to Louis, more direct and
							explicit, and so bitterly censorious, that it is scarcely conceivable
							that Fenelon should have dared send it to the king; <pb n="357"
								type="ms"/>or that he should have received it without sending the
							writer to the Bastille. It is exactly in the style, of the Letter of
							Junius to <persRef ref="george-iii">George the third</persRef>— This
							reading employed me till near Sunset; when I called to see <persRef
								ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. W.

						<p>I wrote a serious Letter to my Son <persRef key="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef>—made a copy of it, and despatched it by the mail— So
							little of any thing that I ever deliberately projected in my life has
							ever succeeded, that I cannot indulge a hope of success on this
							occasion— The Circumstances of the time impose a duty upon me, which I
							must discharge— My own Life, has been upon the whole fortunate down even
							to the present time—or rather I would say that a kind and indulgent
							Providence has shaped my fortunes more auspiciously than I could have
							done by any Prudence of my own— As my years advance my prospects decay;
							my hopes are blasted with disappointment; my trials sharpen with
							severity, and the forethought of what is to come after me, bears me down
							with a burthen beyond endurance— Solitude quickens my fears— I have lost
							my appetite— I am losing my sleep— I feel as if heavy calamities were
							impending over me, and the Letters from <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> aggravate all my
							apprehensions— If not a Sparrow falls to the ground but by the decree of
							superior goodness and wisdom, may I not ask for mercy or for
							resignation? what I do, will come to nought—may not a ray of comfort and
							relief beam from a quarter where it cannot now be foreseen?— <persRef
								ref="thayer-solomon">Solomon Thayer</persRef> called upon me this
							morning— It has been in my power to serve him— I obtained for him a
							small increase of pension as a Soldier of the Revolution, and he is
							grateful— He offered me any service that it may be in his power to
							render me; and this is better than gold— In the afternoon <persRef
								ref="townsend-alexander">Alexander Townsend</persRef> came out from
							Boston to see me— He has just returned from Bangor in the State of
							Maine, where he went upon a Summer excursion, and where he told me he
							had made an investment on speculation to the amount of thirty-five
							thousand dollars— By a purchase of grounds from which the houses have
							been swept away by fire, with the intention of rebuilding upon it
							fourteen houses— Townsend is a man of college education, of classical
							taste, of literary dispositions, of self confiding understanding, and of
							singular destitution of judgment— He has been a very disinterested, and
							almost solitary political friend of mine, without defection when others
							have deserted me— But his opinions do not agree with mine, upon the
							recent disturbances at the University— After he went away <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Price
								Greenleaf</persRef> came, and visited my Garden with me— He promised
							to come, and bud some of my trees for me— I paid an Evening visit at

								Daniel Greenleaf’s</persRef>— His Sister <persRef ref="u">M<hi

							from my plantations of the last. I find full occupation for two hours
							merely in inspecting <pb n="358" type="ms"/>them— <persRef
								ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef> was here, and told me
							that his brother <persRef ref="adams-john3">John Quincy</persRef> had
							broken out yesterday with a poisonous eruption, attributed to his having

								ref="gourgas-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gourgas</persRef>—
							I resumed my Diary Index now nearly a year in arrear, and while engaged
							upon it was struck with the decay of my Memory, with regard to incidents
							even of the last year— And does not—must not the judgment, and the
							imagination decay with the Memory? for what is imagination but a
							combination of ideas lodged in the mind by Memory? and what is judgment,
							but a comparison and selection of ideas lodged in the mind by the same
							faculty? This afternoon <persRef ref="lanman-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter Lanman</persRef> called upon me,
							and mentioned that a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Benjamin</persRef> was proposing to publish a monthly Magazine for
							which he had obtained about one hundred subscribers, and for which he
							wished me to write an introductory Article— This task I declined having
							already upon my hands more writing to do than will be for my credit, or
							I fear for the good of mankind— The burden imposed upon me by the
							Assignment of the two Houses of Congress to deliver before them an
							Oration upon the Life and Character of <persRef ref="lafayette">La
								Fayette</persRef> is so oppressive that I sink under it— I can
							undertake nothing else and shrink from the performances of that— This
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lanman is a very old, though yet only
							a transient acquaintance about the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							September 1789. forty-five years ago, I casually met him as a fellow
							passenger in a packet Sloop from Providence to Newport, which passage we
							were nearly 24 hours in performing; a dead calm, having left us to drift
							down in two tides; laying at anchor the two others, which would else
							have drifted us back to Providence— There were several incidents which
							occurred that day and night which left impressions on my mind, never
							since forgotten—but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lanman was bound to
							Norwich in Connecticut, where he lived, and I to New-York to visit
								<persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef>— We parted at Newport,
							and I saw nor heard more of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lanman, for
							upwards of thirty years— When I was Secretary of State in 1819. his
							brother <persRef ref="lanman-james">James Lanman</persRef>, was a member
							of the Senate of the United States, and he himself was afterwards an
							applicant for a consular appointment— In February 1824. he was appointed
							Consul at Kingston in the Island of Jamaica; where he remained but a
							short time. I had again seen nor heard nothing of him since then, till
							he now presented himself to me upon this singular errand. His appearance
							is old and somewhat haggard— I have seen him in youth, in waning manhood
							and in old age—pass like three successive apparitions before me: and the
							changes in his aspect, are as a mirror in which I can see my own— He is
							within a year or two of my own age— I rode up to <persRef
								ref="thayer-solomon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Solomon
								Thayer’s</persRef>, and saw an Acre and a half of what he calls his
							Ray wheat— I took also from his trees, twigs of Iron and Pound Pears,
							and of the Wollaston Apple that of the last year, budded for me having
							failed— Called going and returning at <persRef ref="brigham-josiah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brigham’s</persRef> shop, and received
							two years interest on my Quincy Canal Notes— <persRef ref="beale-george"

						<p><persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac H. Adams</persRef> was here this

							to Paris—his Opera’s Comedies and Balls, his gratuities, promotions, and
							condescensions, his receptions of Ambassadors, and his royal
							irritabilities fill the book— The smartest things that I find in it are

						<p>Another disspiriting Letter from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef>, and I wrote another supplicatory Letter to my Son
								<persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef>— The thoughts of the
							future haunt me in my dreams; of which I had a cruel one last Night: yet
							my only enquiry must be what to do—and when I can ascertain that to do
							it, and submit to the Will of Heaven. <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy</persRef> the President of
							Harvard University was here, and I had a long conversation with him, on
							what is to be done with the disturbances among the Students there— The
							faculty, that is to say M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy, for the
							responsibility rests with him, have turned over, several of the
							Students, guilty of breaches of the Peace, to the Court of criminal
							Jurisdiction of the County; and three of them are under indictment by
							the Grand Jury of Middlesex, to be tried in September They have also
							dismissed and expelled several others— Eight particularly from the
							Senior Class— The others have received since they left College, their
							parts for Commencement, and there are instigations to them to combine,
							and refuse to perform— I asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy, if
							he had looked forward to that contingency, to be prepared for it— He
							said he had no reason to expect any such movement— I told him I should
							not be without apprehension of further disorder till the commencement
							shall be over— I urged him also to be prepared at the Meeting of the
							Overseers next Thursday, to sustain the measure of prosecuting in the
							Court of Criminal Jurisdiction, Students under matriculation at the
							University. He said he did not consider that as a question to be
							discussed— The Law was plain, and if the Overseers chose to alter it,
							there was no obligation upon him to dissuade them from such an
							intention— I told him there was great diversity of Opinion, and some
							public excitement upon this question— That I believed it would be
							discussed— I hoped he would be ready for it; and my disposition would be
							to sustain him and the faculty, to the utmost extent of my power. He
							thanked me for this notice, and said he would be prepared both by
							argument, and by precedent to shew the necessity and expediency of
							resorting to the <pb n="360" type="ms"/>Courts of criminal jurisdiction
							for the trial of criminal Students— He spoke of <persRef
								ref="townsend-alexander">Alexander Townsend</persRef>, as of an
							insane man, and of his shewing my Letter to him, to <persRef
								ref="quincy-edmund4">Edmund Quincy</persRef>, the President’s Son,
							as a proof of his insanity— He spoke also of his own remarks upon
							Southern Students, which have been misrepresented, and to which an
							invidious application has been given— There is in truth among the
							Students a contumacious and insurgent Spirit, which he has been
							labouring to subdue, and which takes to defend itself the expedient of a
							personal attack upon him. His intentions are upright, and his sense of
							his own duties deep and consciencious— He writes with great force, but
							his elocution is embarrassed and stammering— His present situation is
							very critical, and there is a strong disposition in the public mind to
							take side against him— At the Board of Overseers <persRef
								ref="austin-james">James T. Austin</persRef>, bitterly hostile to
							him— <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H. Everett</persRef>,
							not friendly to him, and <persRef ref="blake-george">George
								Blake</persRef>, fond of speech-making will take the lead— My course
							as a friend of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy, of the University
							and of good education, will be to act as little as possible—particularly
							to trust little to my own discretion— <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac
								H. Adams</persRef> was here this afternoon— I kept house the whole
							day owing to the extreme-heat of the weather; not exceeded this Summer—
							I could not write after dinner—nor read any thing more meditative than
								<persRef ref="courcillon-philippe">Dangeau’s</persRef> Memoirs—
							There is curious matter in them—and some exceedingly ridiculous— See 17.
								Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1690. the discovery, by the
								<persRef ref="saintvallier-jean">Bishop of Quebec</persRef> of an
							Indian tribe with hair like Parrot’s feathers—and another Nation of

								Angier</persRef>, this morning from 2. Corinthians 4.16—“but though
							our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed—day by day.” and
							in the afternoon from 2. Corinithians 6.2.—[“]behold now is the accepted
							time; behold now is the day of salvation.” sensible discourses—well read
							with propriety—with some pathos but not much animation. <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef>
							has lost the attachment of his Parishioners which for nearly 30 years he
							enjoyed in a very eminent degree— His powers of composition, never great
							have been for some time exhausted— Several of the neighbouring
							clergymen, with whom he was in the practice of exchanging have made
							their congregations equally weary of them, and they have been dismissed—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney’s Salary by the terms of his
							original Settlement in 1800 was 500 dollars a year— It has since been
							raised by consent of his parishioners to 750. and he has now agreed to
							reduce it again to 500. and to the remaining 250. the parish are to add
							an equal sum, to hire occasional assistance to supply his Pulpit one
							half the time— They give the occasional preachers ten dollars a day— The
							parish, or congregation have thinned off so that the house is never half
							filled; and besides the Episcopal Church rebuilt within the last two
							years, two new religious Societies have been formed, one of
							Universalits, and one of orthodox Calvinists, by each of which a new
							Church has been built— The building of these Churches makes a job for
							the builders, but their multiplication is the signal of the decline of
							the Religion— The singing choir at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney’s have dwindled down from 35 or 40 to 10 or 12. and from 15
							females down to seldom more than two— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney this morning asked prayers for himself and his family, on
							account of the death, suddenly, of a <persRef ref="whitney-william">brother</persRef>,
							and this afternoon he gave notice that the Communion <pb n="361"
								type="ms"/>would be administered, next Sunday.— I read the ninth
							Sermon of the fifth Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef>—for Whitsunday—upon the first discourse of
								<persRef ref="peter">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Peter</persRef>—very unsatisfactory—very artificial— The principal
							subject is the miraculous gift of tongue, conferred on the apostles, on
							the day of Pentecost: a subject that I never heard well treated in the
							Pulpit, and which perhaps cannot be well treated— This day was of still
							more intense heat than yesterday— I could do nothing out of the hours of
							public worship, but read, and I reviewed all the Sermons of <persRef
								ref="massillon-jean">Massillon</persRef>, which I had read more than
							twenty years since— I was chiefly in search of a comparison between
								<persRef ref="william-iii">William the third</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="jeroboam">Jeroboam</persRef>, and an invocation of curses upon
							Protestant Nations, which I remember, but could not find— In his funeral

								<persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis the 14<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>The Night without sustaining the intense heat of the day, was yet not

								Greenleaf’s</persRef> wharf, and bathed and swam about five minutes:
							then walked home, and to take the cool of the morning, spent a couple of

							Apple— It had rotted but not vegetated. The seeds within it were however
							yet alive I replanted it in the Summer-house cellar, and filled the Pot

							and one cherry— There came a tax collector, with a Bill of taxes for the
							years 1831 and 1832 for Land valued at 600 dollars in the town of
							Braintree— He thought it was my Pine-hill woodlots— I desired him to
							ascertain where and what land it was.— <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac
								H. Adams</persRef> came and took leave of me; about to return to
							West Point, his furlough being out— My Son <persRef key="adams-charles2"

								Alexander H. Everett</persRef>, and <persRef ref="hallett-benjamin"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hallett</persRef> came early in
							the afternoon, and remained till dark— The conversation was all upon
							Politics, and contained nothing worthy of record.— There was much upon
							masonry and Anti-masonry— Something upon the prospects of the next
							Presidential Election— And not a little about the Bank— As they were
							going away, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett asked me, if I should
							attend, at the Meeting of the Overseers of the University, on Thursday
							Morning— I said it was my intention— He said he thought there would
							probably be some discussion. I asked him what he thought would be done—
							He said he supposed the Report which would be made by <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef> would be referred to
							a Committee—nothing more was said— My Morning Bath and Visit to the
							Garden, and my afternoon visitors absorbed so much of my time for
							writing that I had scarcely a fragment left— I finished reading the
							first Volume of <persRef ref="courcillon-philippe">Dangeau’s</persRef>
							Memoirs, and this engaged me to look into <persRef
								ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire’s</persRef> Siécle de <persRef
								ref="louis-xiv">Louis quatorze</persRef>, where I found much in a
							very different Style— I read also a few pages of the Life of <persRef

							there is nothing satisfactory in the Book of <persRef
								ref="sarrans-bernard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							hope that by this day she is on her way from Washington.</p>

						<p>The day was cool, and in the afternoon there was a very copious
							thunder-shower which passed immediately over our heads from North to
							South. There was a single clap of thunder without echo and instantaneous
							after the flash— I visited my Garden, and Nursery with <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>.— I pointed out to him a
							seedling Apple tree of the second year, in the centre of the lowest,
							western side square bed of the Nursery, which came up from a whole Apple
							taken from the dwarf Apple tree in the Garden— This seedling came up
							about the first of May 1833. and by carefully shading it from the Sun,
							through that Summer, it was saved— A covering of Sea weed saved it from
							the Winter’s frost. It is now living, and may with care be preserved. My
							Garden and Nursery are now so filled with seedling trees, forest and
							fruit, from the first shoots of this Season to stocks of five years and
							six years standing, that a mere inspection of them gives me occupation
							two or three hours, without a perception of the passage of time— There
							are two or three new varieties of trees first appearing this Season, and
							which I have not ascertained.— I have eight or ten Nettle trees up in a
							row, where I planted the Spring before last the berries from the tree—
							The growth of these which are three and four years old is busy—and the
							leading shoot is winter killed, a foot or eighteen inches from the top—
							The Art of the Nursery and Seedsmen to make tall and strong Stems to
							their seedling trees, I still lack— My employment this day was without
							interruption of visitors, and the temperature of the atmosphere
							permitted me to write after dinner. I answered Letters from <persRef
								ref="saltonstall-leverett">Leverett Saltonstall</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="phillips-stephen">Stephen C. Phillips</persRef> of
							Salem—gave each an hour to my daily diary and index, and wrote two
							pages, of the sketch for the discourse on the life and character of
								<persRef ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>. This I ought to do,
							every day; and scarcely do one day in ten— <persRef ref="kirk-elizabeth"

						<p>My Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston
							immediately after Breakfast the intended course of my occupations was
							interrupted, and I could not visit my garden this day— <persRef
								ref="spear-william">William Spear</persRef> came to enquire
							concerning the numbers and price and rent of my pews in the Stone
							Meeting house, of which I have been obliged to take 34— I looked for the
							Deeds of them which I took from the Treasurer of the Society <persRef
								ref="beale-george">George W. Beale</persRef> last Autumn; but could
							not find them— I asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spear to call
							again, and then the whole morning was absorbed, in examining all my
							Deeds and vouchers, to find those of the pews— I found them at last, but
							discovered that other private vouchers are missing— This will occasion
							another day’s search, and will give me occupation that ought not to be
							neglected—but it interrupts that in which I am now engaged— After dinner
							I rode to the Mount Wollaston farm, and <persRef ref="spear-alpheus"
								>Alpheus Spear</persRef> being at Rock-Island I went there and found
							him in the barn getting in hay— He had given me among the Bills in
							payment of his rent one of ten dollars of the Suffolk Bank, which the
							declined receiving at the U.S. Branch Bank, as of doubtful authenticity.
							I shewed it to him, and he promised to give me other money for it— I
							then rode over and visited <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Bailey</persRef> at Dorchester,
							and had with him two hours of conversation. <pb n="363" type="ms"/>There
							is at present a great calm in the political world; and no prospects upon
							which I can dwell with satisfaction— The system of Administration for
							the Government of the Union, is radically and I believe irretrievably
							vitiated— Vitiated at the fountain. The succession to the Presidency
							absorbs all the National Interests, and the electioneering contests are
							becoming merely venal— My hopes of the long continuance of this Union
							are extinct— The people must go the way of all the world, and split up
							into an uncertain number of rival communities enemies in War, in Peace
							Friends— Were it otherwise, and were the future destinies of the Nation
							to be as prosperous and as glorious as they have been hitherto, my lease
							of life is so near its close that I should live to witness little of it—
							My own system of Administration, which was to make the National domain
							the inexhaustible fund for progressive and unceasing internal
							improvement has failed—systematically renounced, and denounced by the
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">present Administration</persRef>, it
							has been undisguisedly abandoned by <persRef key="clay-henry">H.
								Clay</persRef>—ingloriously deserted by <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
								>J. C. Calhoun</persRef>, and silently given up by <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">D. Webster</persRef>— These are the opposition
							aspirants to the Presidential succession, not one of them having a
							system of Administration which he would now dare to avow, and at this
							time scarcely linked together by the brittle chain of common opposition,
							to the unprincipled absurdities of the present incumbent— In coming home
							this Evening from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey’s I found it
							chilling cold.</p>

						<p><date>31.</date> Thursday— Boston and Quincy.— Overseers Meeting.</p>
						<p>I received this morning by the mail, a Letter from <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>; written last Sunday,
							and announcing her intention, to leave Washington for this place, the
							next day— Thinking she might reach here this afternoon, I sent <persRef
								ref="wilson-john8">Wilson</persRef> with the horses and Carriage to
							Dedham; to stay there till the Steam-boat Stages from Providence should
							arrive, and if she should be in one of them, to take her home; and if
							not to come in to Boston for me—this afternoon I went myself to Boston
							in the Hingham Stage, the Quincy Stage being full; and there were in the
							Stage with me, seven women, and three small children— I went to <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> Office, and he soon after
							came in from Medford— He agreed with me, to come out this Evening to
							Quincy with me, in the carriage, if it should come, and if not, with a
							Horse and Chaise to be hired by him— At ten O’Clock, I attended at the
							Council Chamber, the Meeting of the Overseers of Harvard University—
								<persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">Lieutenant Governor
								Armstrong</persRef> presided, and there were upwards of thirty
							members present. There was a debate of two hours upon the Question,
							whether the Meeting was public or private.— <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H. Everett</persRef>, said an
							Editor of a public Journal, (<persRef ref="hale-nathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hale</persRef>, publisher of the Daily
							Advertiser,) wished to be admitted to take minutes of the proceedings of
							the Meeting— This started the question, and no one could tell whether
							the Meetings were officially public or private— By the usage, the
							Meetings in the Council Chamber had always been de facto private; and by
							the by the recent usage when held in the Senate Chamber, or the Chamber
							of the House of Representatives they had been public— The Lieutenant
							Governor decided, though declaring his own experience very limited, and
							wishing for direction from the board, that the Meeting <pb n="364"
								type="ms"/>was officially public, from which after much discussion,
							and various motions, which were set aside, and one to refer the whole
							subject to a Committee, which was rejected, <persRef
								ref="lowell-charles">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								Lowell</persRef> appealed, and the decision was reversed by a
							majority, of at least three to one— The meeting was thus decided to be
							officially private— <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President
								Quincy</persRef> then read his Statement of the proceedings of the
							faculty in relation to the disturbances which have recently taken place,
							among the Students— He declared however that he made it, on his own
							responsibility only, as a member of the Board, and without consulting
							either the faculty or the corporation— After it was read through, a
							pause of silence for several minutes ensued, and then Alexander H.
							Everett moved that it should be referred to a Committee of five, which
							was agreed to without opposition— The Chairman asked how the Committee
							should be appointed and was answered by the chairman. He named me,
								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Levi Lincoln</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="codman-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Codman</persRef>, <persRef ref="pickman-benjamin">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Benjamin T. Pickman</persRef> and
							Alexander H. Everett. I asked to be excused from serving on the
							Committee: observing the inconvenience of my residence out of the City,
							and my own impression that upon the Statement that had been read, I saw
							nothing for a Committee to report, except a general approbation of what
							had been done— Remarking that the Statement itself, as it had been made
							without consultation with the faculty or the Corporation did not seem to
							me to present a case for the action of the Overseers, whose general
							functions I understood to be to revise the proceedings of the faculty
							and Corporation; and if they should now take the initiative of action
							would reverse that customary order— I was not sustained in my request to
							be excused, but <persRef ref="savage-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> James Savage</persRef>, <persRef ref="davis-john">Judge
								John Davis</persRef>, and <persRef ref="sullivan-richard">Richard
								Sullivan</persRef> earnestly opposed it—and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Sullivan moved an additional Resolution charging the
							Committee to prepare an Address to the Public on the connection of
							morals with an University Education, and with a view to change the
							public opinion favourably to the limitation of the degrees to youths of
							exemplary character— The chairman asked if I persisted in my request to
							be excused— I said I should not— I had hoped the board would excuse me,
							but was mortified at having given rise to a debate; and as the sense of
							the board did not seem favourable to my wish I should say no more about
							it— The Meeting was then adjourned to Thursday the 21<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of August, ten O’Clock, at the same
							place— <persRef ref="pierce-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pierce</persRef> the Secretary gave me the vote, and the Statement
							of President Quincy, and promised to send me a copy of the printed
							circular of the Seniors— He said it was my charge to notify Governor
							Lincoln of his appointment as a member of the Committee— I asked the
							other members of the Committee to remain after the adjournment of the
							Board, and they authorised me to agree with Governor Lincoln on a time
							of Meeting, which by Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Pickman’s
							invitation is to be at his house—and I am duly to notify them of the
							time— After the adjournment of the Meeting, I went to Charles’s Office
							again— Walking on the way with D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Codman, he
							told me he regretted the recent erection of the new Trinitarian Church
							in Quincy; because he thought those who built it might have been
							satisfied with attending at the Episcopal Church; but <pb n="365"
								type="ms"/>he hoped they would agree to differ— Charles dined with
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> at
							Charlestown— I remained at his office till near four O’Clock reading an
							Article by Alexander H. Everett in the North American Review of this
							Month upon the old parties in this Country; containing much good sense,
							much sound political doctrine, and some errors both of opinion and of
							facts— Near four O’Clock I went to the Post-Office, and enquired if the
							Steam-boat Mail was in; but it was not; and to <persRef
								ref="foster-isaac">Fosters</persRef> stables to see if Wilson and
							the Carriage were there; but they were not— Going to <persRef
								ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Parkman’s</persRef> to dine, I passed by the Common, upon which
							there was a crowd already collected to witness the ascension in a
							balloon of <persRef ref="durant-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Durant</persRef>; and there was a continued stream of population,
							especially of women, moving to it— I dined with D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> George Parkman—<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef>, Alexander H.
							Everett, <persRef ref="dexter-franklin">Franklin Dexter</persRef>;
								<persRef ref="furness-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Furness</persRef> of Philadelphia, <persRef ref="hitchcock-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hitchcock</persRef> of Alabama,
							and <persRef ref="parkman-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Francis Parkman</persRef>, were the company, and as many more were
							missing from the table—truants to see the Ascension. As we were at the
							dessert, Durant went up in the Balloon; we all went to the top of the
							house, he was then about 100 feet perpendicular over our heads— The
							motion of the balloon was perceptible only by the diminution of its
							apparent size to the eye; we followed it till it had diminished to a
							speck and vanished. The Sensation to me was painful to me, when I
							considered the extreme dangers to which the man’s life was exposed— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman invited me to pass the Night at
							his house, but I was too anxious to return home— Charles came for me
							about Sunset with a Horse and Chaise— The Steamboat Mail had arrived;
							but Wilson and the Carriage did not appear— I came home to Quincy with
							Charles, but <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> had
							not arrived, nor had Wilson returned with the Carriage— My forecast was
							a precaution inutile— I was very unwell almost the whole day, with a
							severe feverish headache, and a load upon the Spirits, almost beyond my
							strength to bear.</p>
