						<p><date>1. V. </date>Tuesday—</p>
						<p>At the close of the Session of Congress, I find a number of unanswered
							Letters upon my files, and the files themselves in no small disorder— I
							received this morning a Letter from my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> stating that <persRef ref="foster-phineas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Phineas Foster</persRef> had agreed to
							take up Midshipman <persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph H.
								Adams’s</persRef> Bill for 100 dollars drawn in favour of <persRef
								ref="todd-john2">John N. Todd</persRef>, and I went to the U.S.
							Branch Bank—and paid and took it up with 1 dollar 75 cents for the
							protest— There are sundry other very minute matters which occupied my
							time, but with which I did nothing— I wrote three short Letters to
								<persRef ref="adams-thomas2">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> T.
								B. Adams</persRef>—to <persRef ref="storer-john">J. P. B.
								Storer</persRef>, and to<space/>completed the diary minutes of the last
							three days, and arranged my Letters received in the last half year in
							three alphabetical files of two Months each— My practice of preserving
							all the Letters that I receive accumulates papers to such a degree that
							I often doubt whether it would not be a better role to preserve none— It
							would be certainly more convenient— It is difficult to discriminate
							between papers to be destroyed and papers to be retained— Nine tenths of
							the Letters that I have received in the course of my life are not worth
							preserving— Perhaps I might say the same of 49 in 50 or 99 in 100— The
							weather was oppressively warm, and in the evening at 8 O’Clock I went
							with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> to an Oratorio at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church— The music was chiefly from
								<persRef ref="handel-george">Handel</persRef>—the performers few and
							indifferent— “Let the bright Seraphim” brought Ealing to my memory; and
							the Star of Bethlehem reminded me of the Worcester Cattle Show and
							evening concert at Worcester on the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							October 1826, where I first heard it—how much have I needed the light of
							the Star since that day?— How much more am I to need it hereafter? But
							why art thou cast down? o my Soul, and why art thou disquieted within
							me?— Hope and still Hope.</p>
						<p>On the last day of the Session—<persRef ref="dickerson-mahlon">Mahlon
								Dickerson</persRef> was nominated and appointed Secretary of the
							Navy, and <persRef ref="wilkins-william">William Wilkins</persRef>
							Minister to Russia in his stead— <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Levi
								Woodbury</persRef> had been previously transferred from the Navy to
							the Treasury Department, and <persRef ref="forsyth-john">John
								Forsyth</persRef> appointed Secretary of State in the place of
								<persRef ref="mclane-louis">Louis M’Lane</persRef> resigned. </p>

						<p>Wrote three short Letters; to Midshipman <persRef ref="adams-joseph"
								>Joseph H. Adams</persRef> in answer to one from him, written last
							February—to <persRef ref="tucker-george">George Tucker</persRef>, a
							Professor at the University of Virginia, and which leaves me to make
							enquiries at the Secretary’s Office in Boston—and one to <persRef
								ref="hobart-thomas">Thomas Hobart</persRef> of Hanson, with a copy
							of the Bill reported by the Committee of Roads and Canals, containing
							the provision for improvement of the Navigation of North
							River—Massachusetts— I received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="collamore-anthony">Anthony Collamore</persRef> at Pembroke,
							with enquiries to sustain a claim of widow <persRef ref="thomas-averick"
								>Averick Thomas</persRef>— I took the Letter to the Pension Office,
							where the discharge of <persRef ref="thomas-isaac">Isaac
								Thomas</persRef> a Revolutionary Soldier was found, and <persRef
								ref="edwards-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards</persRef>
							the Commissioner of Pensions afterwards sent me a written answer to my
							enquiry— I called at the Navy Department where I saw the new Secretary
								<persRef ref="dickerson-mahlon">Mahlon Dickerson</persRef>— I left
							with him the Letter to Midshipman Joseph H. Adams, and spoke to him of
							the practice among the youngest Officers of the Navy of contracting
							debts beyond their ability to pay,—and of their being encouraged to this
							by the Pursers— I thought it required some new and severe regulation to
							restrain it— He concurred in this opinion and promised to issue such a
							regulation. At the War Department I spoke to <persRef ref="cass-lewis"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cass</persRef> of the
							appropriation for erecting a Monument over the remains of <persRef
								ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef>, which at my motion was
							placed under the direction of the Secretary of War. He said he would
							direct an Officer of the Engineers to prepare and shew me a design for
							the Monument and he requested me to write an Inscription for it which I
							promised to do— I spoke to him also of the appropriation of 100000
							dollars for the fortifications of Georges Island in the Harbour of
							Boston, and asked him if the work would be commenced this year— He said
							it would if there should not be a deficiency of funds in the Treasury— I
							had a long conversation with him upon this, and upon the resistance to
							the appropriation for Surveys, and to the assaults upon the Military
							Academy at West-Point, all by the most devoted partisans of the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>— He was not very explicit
							in his answers, and spoke of the expediency of reducing the number of
							the Cadets at West-Point to 200. But denied that the President had any
							hostile feeling to the Institution— Excessive heat— <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> 90.</p>

								Adams</persRef> spent the day at <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker"
								>her brother’s</persRef>— He has been extremely ill, but is believed
							to be now out of danger— I bathed this morning with my Son <persRef
								key="adams-john2">John</persRef> in the Potowmack, and swam a few
							minutes— I still find the exercise delightful— I went to the General
							Post Office, but the <persRef ref="barry-william">Postmaster General
								Barry</persRef> was not there I saw his Assistant <persRef
								ref="hobbie-selah">Selah R. Hobbie</persRef>, and left with him the
							Affidavits which I had received yesterday from <persRef
								ref="kingsbury-fisher">F. A. Kingsbury</persRef>; shewing that
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Linnfield</persRef>
							had been deceived in executing his contract for carrying the mail from
							Braintree to Randolph last February— The contract was changed without
							his being aware of it— I read M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kingsbury’s
							Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hobbie who took minutes of it
							and promised to send me a written answer upon the subject— I walked home
							with the Thermometer of <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> at 90— <persRef
								ref="bartlett-william2">Lieutenant Bartlett</persRef> called upon me
							by direction of the <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of
							War</persRef>, with a design for the monument of <persRef
								ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef>; a fluted broken column,
							upon a cubic pedestal—and he said the Secretary had directed him to take
							such Inscription as I should write— I had some conversation with
								Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Bartlett on the mode of
							executing the monument, and it occurred to me that it would be well to
							write to <persRef ref="brown-samuel">General Brown’s brother</persRef>
							concerning it— I wrote three Letters—one to <persRef
								ref="wilkes-charles">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Wilkes</persRef> thanking him for his invitation to me to visit his
							observatory on Capitol Hill; which I have been obliged to postpone— One

								ref="lafayette-george">George Washington La Fayette</persRef>, of
							condolence upon the decease of <persRef ref="lafayette">his
								father</persRef>—and of Enquiries— This brought me to reflect upon
							the perilous and burdensome task I have undertaken to perform during the
							next Session of Congress, which weighs most oppressively upon me— About
							one O’Clock afternoon came up a very heavy thunder-gust which passed
							down, and crossed the river, and was succeeded by others all the
							afternoon and evening, with very moderate rain— I took up and partly
							read the work of Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							<persRef ref="beaumont-gustave">de Beaumont</persRef> and <persRef

							with an awful solemnity which I cannot waste in frivolous banqueting;

						<p>I read over again M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jasper Adamss address

							How much upon temper?— How much upon address? How much upon intrigue?
							How much upon dishonesty—upon villainy? upon all the worst of human
							passions?— O how indispensable is another world to repair the injustice
							of this? And how little is the fruit of upright intentions and
							unremitting toil?— I dined with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">my

							nine when my wife came home from her brother’s—</p>

								Adams</persRef> had determined to proceed with the Carriage and
							horses to Baltimore this morning that I might overtake her at Night, in

								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">her brother’s</persRef> illness and that
							of <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef>, and of the excessive heat of the weather, she
							determined to remain a day or two longer, and rejoin me at Philadelphia,
							or follow me on to Quincy— I had hesitated whether I should not also
							postpone my departure, but she went early this morning to her brother’s
							and sent word that both he and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye were
							much better, so that I concluded to proceed, as I had promised <persRef
								ref="reed-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W B
								Reed</persRef> to be in Philadelphia on Monday Morning— I wrote a
							Letter to <persRef ref="brown-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Samuel Brown</persRef>, of Brownsville, New-York, in answer to one
							received some weeks since from him, and enclosing to him the design made
							by <persRef ref="bartlett-william2">Lieutenant Bartlett</persRef>, for
							the monument to <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General Jacob
							Brown</persRef>. I settled and balanced my account at the U.S. Branch
							Bank, and called at the Department of State, where I found <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Forsyth</persRef> installed as Secretary— I left with him my Letter
							to <persRef ref="lafayette-george">George W. La Fayette</persRef> which
							he promised to forward with the earliest despatches to <persRef ref="livingston-edward">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Livingston</persRef>— He said he had received this

							Legation at Paris giving an account of the funeral of <persRef
								ref="lafayette">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> La

							apprehended— At half past one O’Clock the Stage of <persRef
								ref="stockton-richard2">Stockton</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="stokes-william">Stokes</persRef> took me up, somewhat hurried,
							owing to a visit of an hour and a half from <persRef ref="u">Col<hi

								<persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">two children</persRef>
							with an indescribable pang—though with the hope to find them well here
							again in four months— I came as fast as the Stage would bring me with
							roads heavy from recent rains and a blazing Sun, <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> at 90. to
								<persRef ref="barnum-david">Barnum’s</persRef> Hotel at Baltimore,
							where I alighted at half past 8 in the Evening, obtained a Bed chamber,
							and soon after nine was in bed— I had five fellow-travellers in the
							Stage, and there were two outside passengers—no woman, and only two of
							the men decently well-bred— Among them was one dark mulatto— I had not I
							think ever before South of <persRef ref="mason-charles">Mason</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="dixon-jeremiah">Dixon’s</persRef> line seen a coloured
							man as an inside passenger— His dress was good, and his deportment not
							obtrusive— About 6 miles short of Baltimore the Jack of our Stage broke,
							and I was transferred to another of the line in which were more
							gentlemanly companions, and a woman and child—</p>

							Church, where I heard a young man preach from Daniel 5.27. “Thou art

								>Charles</persRef>, informing him as far as I was able when he may

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Binney</persRef> whom I found at his

							recently been assumed by the motley combination united in nothing but
							opposition to <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson’s</persRef>
							Administration— There is no common cement among them, and they will
							jointly, severally and signally fail— The heat continues so intense,
							that I kept my chamber till the approach of two O’Clock P.M. when I
							walked down to the wharf to see the Boat from Newcastle of the Baltimore
							line come in— It arrived, precisely at two— <persRef ref="wilson-john8"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilson</persRef> with my Horses

							had by advice of <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Huntt</persRef> concluded not to leave Washington

							announced past eleven O’Clock— I then walked home— I observed a

							marking in the shade 96— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddle told me,
							that <persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef> very shortly before

							make it the great instrument for putting down Jacksonism. He said also

						<p>Light Showers this morning and a change of temperature gradually cooling,

							with the Horses and Carriage, for New York— <persRef ref="reed-william2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Reed</persRef> called upon me,

							who walked with me to the Steam-boat Trenton— At 1/2 past ten she left
							the wharf and at 1/4 past two landed her passengers at Bordentown; after
							stopping as usual at Burlington at Bristol, and at the landing seven
							miles above Trenton. We entered immediately the Rail-road Cars, and in
							two hours and a quarter came 35 miles to Perth-Amboy— The average
							travelling was 3 1/2 minutes to a Mile— The shortest time within which
							they traversed a mile was by my Chronometer 3 minutes and 10 Seconds—
							About four miles on the way from Bordentown, we met the train coming
							from Perth Amboy and it being a part of the road where the double rail
							is not yet laid our train was obliged to run back about 2 miles to let
							the other pass which added 4 miles to our distance and a quarter of an
							hour to our time— The train stopp’d at Haightstown and at<space/>distances
							of ten miles each; about 5 minutes each time— I marked and remembered
							the spot, as near as possible the half-way line where the dreadful
							Catastrophe happened and from which I so narrowly escaped on the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last November— I met now the same
							man, who had been one of the Agents of the Proprietors then— He told me
							they had never had the slightest accident on the road from that day to
							this— At Perth-Amboy we took the Steam boat again and at seven in the
							Evening we landed at New-York— I came to the City-Hotel, where <persRef
								ref="u">Willard</persRef> gave me a bed-chamber three Stories high—
							On my way from the Boat I met <persRef ref="fulton-john">M<hi

							ascertain, and had much conversation with an old Gentleman from
							Charleston, S.C who spoke of Railways and Insurance Companies and City
							Ordinances and Orations, and told me he was in his grand climacteric,

						<p><date>12. V:30. </date>Saturday. From New-York— Steamer Boston— Sound</p>
						<p>I called this morning at the House of <persRef ref="matthews-james">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> J M. Mathews</persRef> the President
							of the New-York University, whom I had promised by Letter so to do— But
							he was not at home, and <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef> a young boy
							told me he would not be at home to be spoken to till half past four in
							the afternoon, when I was obliged to repair to the Steam-boat. I walked
							down Wall Street where I saw workmen demolishing the House of my old
							friend <persRef ref="mccormick-daniel">Daniel M’Cormick</persRef>, who
							died not many weeks since aged upwards of eighty— I continued my walk to
							and far up Pearl Street, and reflected that this was the fiftieth year
							since I first landed at New-York, and what a world of life I had since
							then gone through— New-York had then 20000 inhabitants— It has now ten
							times that number—but not one tenth now of those it had then—perhaps not
							one hundredth— Not a single one that I know. M’Cormick was the last— I
							called at the House of <persRef ref="brooks-sidney">Sidney
								Brooks</persRef> 86 White Street—but he and <persRef
								ref="brooks-frances">his wife</persRef> have been gone a fortnight
							to the Springs— At <persRef ref="davis-charles2">M<hi rend="superscript"

								ref="dolci-carlo">Carlo Dolcé</persRef>, both very beautiful— At two
							O’Clock I went down to meet the Steam-boat from Perth-Amboy of the
							Rail-way line; but after a walk of near half an hour on the Battery to
							and fro I found the boat had got in, before I was at the wharf— <persRef
								ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Biddle</persRef> and his family were on board, but not <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>— I returned to the

								<persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef>, a Letter from him was
							brought to me, written on Thursday enclosing one from my wife. She had

						<p><date>13. IV:30. </date>Sunday— From opposite New-London to Quincy.</p>
						<p>The fresh Eastern Breeze, raised a heavy dashing swell, which checked the
							progress of the Boat, and made her roll, to the loss of colour and of
							appetite to perhaps one third of the passengers, men, women and
							children— I rose with the Sun, and found we were only opposite to New
							London, just entering the passage between Fisher’s Island, and the main
							land of Connecticut— We passed between the Sisters and when beyond the
							Eastern end of Fisher’s Island, had a heavy swell and so much motion of
							the boat that several of the Passengers, men, women and children were
							thoroughly Sea-sick— A thick fog then came up for about two hours, and
							our Captain and Helmsman were barely able to discern the passage of
							Point Judith, by the surge upon the beach— The Light-house was not
							distinguishable— It was about nine in the morning when the Boat reached
							the wharf at Newport, and several of the passengers landed, among whom
							were <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Biddle</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="biddle-jane;biddle-jane2;biddle-adele;biddle-meta">his
								family</persRef>— The passage up the river was rapid, and at half
							past 11. I passed at Providence from the Steam-boat immediately into the
							Pilot Stage; a new line formed for the express purpose of taking the
							lead of the Mail— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Walker</persRef> was the only one of my companions from
							Philadelphia, who continued with me— The others were strangers—one a
							Woman, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Simmons</persRef> with a child about 3 years old— They all knew me
							but I remembered none of them— The Stage was new and an excellent
							Carriage— The Horses very fine and changed every seven Miles— We
							travelled without other stoppage than to change which never took five
							minutes, and in four hours, that is at 1/2 past 3. we were at <persRef
								ref="alden-francis">Alden’s</persRef> tavern in Dedham— Here I took
							leave of my Companions and left the Stage— Engaged a young man named
								<persRef ref="u">M’Intyre</persRef>, with a Horse and Chaise, which
							in one hour and a quarter, brought me to my own house at Quincy—which I
							entered at a quarter before five with a grateful ejaculation of heart
							for preserving mercy. I found <persRef ref="kirk-john;kirk-elizabeth"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Kirke</persRef>, with their daughter <persRef
								ref="kirk-elizabeth2">Elizabeth</persRef> at the House—well—as were
							the tenant of the farm <persRef ref="carr-john2">Carr</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="u">his wife</persRef>— I dined; read a Sermon of
								<persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef> the 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							volume, upon obscure faith, and four Chapters of Proverbs in <persRef
								ref="thomson-charles">Thomson’s</persRef> Bible; and commenced a
							Letter to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>— I
							left <persRef ref="wilson-john8">Wilson</persRef> with the Carriage and
							Horses on board the Steam-boat at Providence with directions to come on
							to Walpole this Evening; and the rest of the way to-morrow— I took with
							me only my small trunk— Rain.</p>

						<p>There was a magnificent Rainbow last Evening, just before Sunset, and it
							began immediately afterwards, and continued the whole night, pouring
							part of the time in torrents— The brooks were this day much swollen—
							This morning after Breakfast I visited my garden, which I found in a
							state as good as I could expect—most of the places where I had planted
							my trees, seeds, stones, nuts and acorns overrun with weeds, or ploughed
							up, scattering all my plantations to the winds— The greatest growth is
							my buttonwood stake— Then the willows. Honey Locust— Red and English
							Oaks— I found a wild cherry of the fourth year, bearing fruit—my most
							troublesome difficulty is to make stems for the seedling trees— There is
							very little fruit—almost no peaches. Cherries gone and there were very
							few— The only new seedling trees that I find are black mulberries, of
							which there are several— No Strawberries from the seed— No walnuts—no
							Oaks from the Acorn— <persRef ref="adams-john3">My nephew and
								namesake</persRef> came this morning to see me—followed by <persRef
								ref="russell-abraham">three Quakers</persRef>, one of whom, <persRef
								ref="shepherd-calvin">Calvin Shepherd</persRef>, introduced first
							himself and then the two others— <persRef ref="arnett-thomas"
								>Arnett</persRef> is a travelling preacher, a native of
							North-Carolina, settled in the State of Ohio, about 50 miles from
							Cincinnati, and is now visiting various parts of the Country, dispensing
							the word, as the Spirit moves— They called upon me only from motives of
							curiosity, and after a short conversation departed— They told me they
							were of the party in opposition to the doctrines of <persRef
								ref="hicks-elias">Elias Hicks</persRef>— I received three Letters,
							and finished and despatched the one I had begun last Evening to <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>— At 5 in the
							afternoon <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef> who is
							here upon furlough, being a Cadet at West Point, came with his brother
							John Q. and we all bathed at <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf’s</persRef> wharf and
							Creek— The water was fresh, and rather cold from the rains of last
							Night. I swam less than ten minutes, annoyed by the gadflies. <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E. Price
								Greenleaf</persRef> called upon me, and returned the three Volumes
							of <persRef ref="michaux-francois">Michaux’s</persRef> Silva which I
							lent him last November— I walked to <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams’s</persRef>, <persRef
								key="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef> widow and there spent the
							Evening— <persRef ref="miller-edward;miller-caroline">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Edward Miller</persRef> came in for
							half an hour— <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> is
							there, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Price Greenleaf, came and
							walked home with me— <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Angier</persRef> is likewise there
							from Medford, but goes home to-morrow.</p>
