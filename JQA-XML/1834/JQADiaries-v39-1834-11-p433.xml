						<p>With the month I commenced a course of occupation, in which, I can only
							enjoin upon myself to persevere— Rising at four O’Clock I wrote, after
							preparation for the day till about Sunrise. Then took my accustomed
							walk— Received by the mail a Letter from my Son <persRef

							Tuesday; and one to <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">W. S.
								Smith</persRef> from <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">his
								wife</persRef>, at Quincy, of the same date— I may cherish the hope
							that the health of <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my dear
								wife</persRef> may yet be to a great degree restored— I resumed the
							writing of the Discourse upon the life and character of <persRef

									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt</persRef> was here to see
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef>, who seems to be gaining

							Administration, upon the Estate of my Son <persRef key="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef>, and of Guardianship of <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">his two children</persRef>— Upon
							full deliberation I believe it will be necessary— W. S. Smith dined with
							me— I invited him to do so every day, till his wife comes home, but he
							declined. I answered a Letter from <persRef ref="bryant-james">J. R. M.
								Bryant</persRef>, the tenant of one of my houses; and also, my Son
							Charles’s Letter— To effect this, I had very little time to read, and
							was obliged to write all the Evening till 9 O’Clock— I return this Night
							to my Bed-chamber.</p>

						<p><date>2. IV:30 </date>Sunday.</p>
						<p>On returning from my usual morning walk, I found a Letter from my Son
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> which I answered— It
							made a deep impression upon my mind; his opinion of my condition
							corresponds but too closely with my own— I attended the morning service
							at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, where <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read Prayers for the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Sunday after
							Trinity, and preached a short Sermon from Hebrews 7.24. “But this man
							because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.”— It was an
							exposition of the <persRef ref="calvin-john">Calvinistic</persRef>
							doctrine of the Story of <persRef ref="melchizedek"
								>Melchisedek</persRef>, the most mysterious of all the types of
							Christ— Three verses in the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of
							the Book of Genesis contain the whole history of this person as related
							in the Old Testament— He is named with an obscure allusion in Psalm.
							110.4. but the Commentary of <persRef ref="paul">Saint Paul</persRef>,
							in the whole of this 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of the
							Epistle to the Hebrews, upon those two passages, gives them great
							solemnity, and high importance to the system of Christianity— S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul uses them with his accustomed power
							of Eloquence to argue the abolition of the Levitical Priesthood, and the
							consequent superseding of the <persRef ref="moses">Mosaic</persRef> Law—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley’s auditory was exceedingly
							thin, but the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> was
							there, looking as well as I ever saw him— After dinner I attended at the
							Presbyterian Church— <persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Smith</persRef> preached from Galatians 6.15. “For in
							Christ Jesus, neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
							uncircumcision, but a new creature.” The doctrine of regeneration. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith treats these hacknied subjects
							somewhat differently from the common herd of Calvinistic preachers—he
							occasionally dwells upon principles of practical morality, and the
							virtues of social life— These are totally neglected by the generality of
							Calvinists, and even slighted by many of them— I met <persRef
								ref="meigs-clara">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Meigs</persRef>,
							the mother of <persRef ref="forsyth-clara">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Forsyth</persRef> there— <persRef ref="munroe-thomas"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Munroe</persRef> paid me
							a visit after the morning service at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							John’s— I wrote from necessity as upon a week day, and finished reading
							the second part and began upon the third of a History of the civil,
							Military and political Life of <persRef ref="lafayette">La
								Fayette</persRef>, in French— A book of those lent me by <persRef
								ref="sparks-jared">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>I went last Night to bed with a heavy heart, and rose this Morning
							without having closed my eyes in sleep— The pressure upon my Spirits is
							greater than I can bear, and it is by the loss of Sleep that it operates
							upon my bodily health— What shall I do to be saved from ruin? not in the
							future world, but in this? I see no hand of relief from man— Shall I
							lose my trust in God? far—far be from me the thought—whom have I in
							Heaven but thee?— On returning from my walk, I received a Letter from my
							Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> which I answered—
							Several troublesome Bills were brought to me in the course of the day—
								<persRef key="frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">his two children</persRef>, to

						<p>Grateful for a Night of sound refreshing repose—on my return from the
							morning’s walk, I found a Letter from <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Bailey</persRef>, with a request
							that I would answer by return of Mail addressed to <persRef
								ref="hallett-benjamin">B. F Hallett</persRef> or <persRef
								ref="gassett-henry">Henry Gassett</persRef>— I did accordingly write
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hallett Immediately after Breakfast
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-william">W. C. Greenleaf</persRef> came, and
							went with me to the Columbian Mills— I found the small mill in a ruinous
							condition with one side of the wall of the house broken down—at the
							large Mill nothing was doing— The Miller <persRef ref="u"
								>Speakman</persRef> was there; without wheat or flour— I read to him
							the minute in writing but unsigned left by <persRef key="adams-john2">my
								Son</persRef>, and by which Speakman had rented the Mills for one
							year from the first of August last— My Son had read it to me before I
							left this City on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July and I had
							assented to it— Speakman admitted that it was correct, and professed to
							be willing to carry it into effect on his part; but it stipulated the
							quarterly payment of rent, at least at the rate of 500 dollars a year,
							and Speakman said my Son had told him he should not press hard upon him
							for quarterly payments— He talked also of repairs which he had made and
							which he said must of course come out of the rent. It is apparent that
							the man has nothing to pay, and nothing to do— He said he could get no
							wheat— That he had never known such a time— That the Mills of Lyons and
							Nourse are in no better condition— That they purchase wheat at 1 dollar
							4 or 5 cents a bushel and must sell their flour at 4 dollars 87 cents a
							barrel— A clear loss of 33 cents upon every barrel of flour they make— I
							asked him what was the cause of this failure in the supply of wheat— He
							said it was the multiplication of Mills, and the readier Markets at
							Baltimore and Richmond. W. C. Greenleaf left me and returned to
							Georgetown. I went to the City Hall to apply to the <persRef
								ref="chase-samuel2">Judge</persRef> of the Orphan’s Court, for
							Letters of Administration upon the Estate of my Son John, and of
							Guardianship of <persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">his two
								children</persRef>; but the judge was not at the Office, and his
							residence is at Georgetown— I called at <persRef ref="gadsby-john"
								>Gadsby’s</persRef> to visit <persRef ref="gray-francis">F. C
								Gray</persRef> and <persRef ref="lawrence-william2">W. B.
								Lawrence</persRef>, but they had both <pb n="435" type="ms"/>left
							the city— I returned the visit of <persRef ref="vaughan-charles">Sir
								Charles R. Vaughan</persRef>, with whom I had some conversation— His
							health is precarious and he has been dangerously ill— I received visits
							before dinner from <persRef ref="palfrey-cazneau">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cazneau Palfrey</persRef>, the
							Minister of the Unitarian Church, and in the Evening from <persRef
								ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Connell</persRef>— A man named <persRef ref="u">Miller</persRef>
							came here, and almost ruffled my temper. He has taken possession of the
							vacant part of my lots upon which are built the two Houses in F. Street,
							and of the Stable— He says it was by a verbal agreement with my Son John
							last March— That he was to hold them for a year in consideration of his
							putting a fence there which he has done— And he has turned the ground
							into a vegetable garden— A man applied to <persRef key="frye-nathaniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef> yesterday to rent
							the Stable for a year at 3 dollars a Month— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Frye authorized him to deposit a load of hay in the stable,
							but Miller claimed the right of possession, and had a lock upon the
							door. The man last Night took a staple out of the door, and put in his
							load of hay— Miller said he considered it as burglary— I called upon him
							for evidence of my Sons verbal agreement with him alledged by him— He
							said his brother <persRef ref="u">Doctor Miller</persRef> would testify
							to it, and I assured him I would fulfil any agreement made by my Son— In
							the mean time he is not to dispute my right of possession of the Stable—
							My time thus engrossed reduced my writing concerning <persRef
								ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef> to half a page.</p>

						<p>A second Night of calm repose, and sleep undisturbed— I varied a little
							the morning walk and on returning from it, received a Letter from
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my dear and most afflicted
								wife</persRef> which I answered— I received also a Letter from a
							Committee of the whig young men of Boston, enclosing a Resolution passed
							by them at a public Meeting, approving of my conduct in Congress and of
							my approbation of the Administration of the State. I had a morning visit
							from <persRef ref="vaughan-charles">Sir Charles R. Vaughan</persRef>,
							interrupted by one from <persRef ref="delavan-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Delavan</persRef> of Albany
							with <persRef ref="sewall-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sewall</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Delavan is much
							devoted to the cause of the Temperance Reform, which now agitates the
							community— He said he was going to Europe, on some purpose connected
							with this object, and he had obtained the signatures of <persRef
								ref="madison-james">James Madison</persRef> and of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President Andrew Jackson</persRef>,
							recommending to the young men of the United States, total abstinence
							from the use of ardent Spirits, as a drink— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Delavan was exceedingly urgent that I should also sign this
							paper, which after some conversation with him I did—though with much
							reluctance— I observed that I had not joined any Temperance Society;
							though I heartily approved of their object, and wished them success in
							their cause— As the President of the United States, and the only
							surviving Ex-President besides me had consented to sign the paper, I
							could not refuse to sign it, without seeming to discountenance the
							Temperance reform itself— The paper purported only to recommend
							abstinence from ardent Spirits undiluted—pure Rum, Gin, Brandy or
							Whiskey— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Delavan said that was all that
							the paper intended— I then said my difficulty was the apprehension that
							the paper if published, would be otherwise understood— That I had all my
							life time been in the habit of drinking wine—generally with moderation;
								<pb n="436" type="ms"/>sometimes freely— That I saw nothing like a
							prohibition to drink wine, in the Scriptures, but the contrary—a
							recommendation to use it moderately, and medicinally— I believed it
							conducive to health— I believed the same of ardent Spirits, diluted with
							water and in small quantities; and must not be understood as
							recommending a total abstinence from them— He said that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison had made similar remarks, and said
							he was in the daily habit of drinking a small portion of Toddy— I signed
							the Paper, and said to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sewall that I
							believed the <persRef ref="brown-john8">Brunonian</persRef> system of
							medicine had made more drunkards than all the dram-shops on the face of
							the Earth— He said he thought so too— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Eckardt</persRef> was here this
							afternoon, and brought a marketing account with <persRef
								key="adams-john2">my late son</persRef>—authenticated by her Oath
							before a Magistrate. <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef> spent with me a couple
							of hours of the Evening— I wrote a Petition to <persRef
								ref="chase-samuel2">Judge Samuel Chase</persRef> of the Orphan’s
							Court for Letters of Administration upon the Estate of my Son, and of
							Guardianship of <persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">his two

							guardianship of each of the children at 7200. but he said he must see

							Carpenter was here, and spoke of an old horse that <persRef
								key="adams-john2">my Son</persRef> had left with him, and which he

							for the benefit of another by the name of <persRef ref="ash-nicholas"
								>Ash</persRef>, who is sick. The enclosure within which the balloon

							The balloon went in a Southeastern direction, and at five O’Clock I had
							lost sight of it. There were Artificial fireworks in the Evening, within

							And after dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> John’s Church,
								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							and <persRef ref="john">John</persRef>, to purchase the power of

								>Henry Colman’s</persRef> Volume—upon Christianity as taught in the

						<p>Scarcely two hours of sleep, and the rest of the Night passed in anxious
							and desponding thought, ever with the consciousness of the multitude of
							blessings yet left me, and for which no sentiment but of gratitude ought
							to enter my heart— Why must this Sentiment be embittered with incessant
							fear that these blessings too are, I know not how soon, to be taken from
							me— The resources of wretchedness are Stoic fortitude which is
							insensibility, and Christian resignation to the will of God— The first
							is not in my nature. The last I know to be my duty, but is not always in
							my power— Reason is no salve for pain— Loss of Sleep, like Sleep itself
							is involuntary— And it weakens body and mind— I received this morning a
							Letter from my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> with
							cheering information of <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife’s</persRef> convalescence, and that she intends to leave
							Quincy, next Saturday to come here— After the morning walk, which I take
							regularly every day, and hearing my Grand child <persRef
								ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny</persRef> read and spell, I made
							progress in the discourse upon the life and character of <persRef
								ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>— This is now not the least of
							my sorrows and anxieties— Under the Harrow as I have been and am, and
							shall be while composing it, I see it must fall short, not only of
							public expectation, but of what it might have been, had I written with a
							mind at ease— There are topics involved in the Discourse, which it will
							be impossible properly to treat without giving Offence, to parties of
							the most opposite characters, and the whole theme has been so often
							handled, and especially so well by <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward
								Everett</persRef>, that it is scarcely possible to say any thing new
							upon it— Nor in the condition of my voice am I <pb n="439" type="ms"
							/>without serious doubts of my ability to deliver it— Yet I am unwilling
							unless from extreme necessity to ask to be excused from the performance
							of a service so honorably conferred, and which I have undertaken— This
							is the day of the annual, and also of the Congressional Elections in
							Massachusetts— My Constituents of the twelfth Congressional District,
							have this day decided whether they are willing to be again represented
							by me or not— Much of the fortunes of my remnant of days depends upon
							their decision— I called this Evening to visit <persRef
								ref="macomb-alexander">General Macomb</persRef>, but he was not at
							home— I received a friendly visit from <persRef ref="hawley-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>— Excessive

						<p>I was again favoured with a Night of repose with between five and six

								ref="borland-alexander">Borland</persRef>— Six dollars and a half

							upon <persRef key="adams-john2">my Son’s</persRef> Estate, but not the

								ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">Children</persRef>— He said the
							Judge was again unwell, and had not been at the Office since the day

								<persRef ref="munroe-thomas">Thomas Munroe</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="cutts-richard">Richard Cutts</persRef> to appraise the returned
							Inventory of personal Estate; and the order of the Judge, that I should

							ready written— I gave M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Neale the
							Administration and the two Guardianship Bonds, and am to wait for the
							Letters of Guardianship, till the Judge shall have seen the children— I
							went next to the Capitol, and took out from the Congress Library, the
								31<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> and 32<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> Volumes of <persRef ref="hansard-thomas"

						<p>On going to the door this morning for my daily walk, I found it raining
							and the ground a glare of ice— The rain continued without intermission
							the whole day— It kept us all confined to the house, and I gave much of
							it to reading— A few chapters of <persRef ref="stael-anne">Madame de
								Stael’s</persRef> considerations on the French Revolution—a few
							passages of <persRef ref="lacretelle-jean">La Cretelle</persRef>—and a
							large portion of the Memoirs of <persRef ref="thibaudeau-antoine"
								>Thibaudeau</persRef>— All these works were published after the
							Restoration of the Bourbons in 1814. and before the last Revolution of
							1830— I read for the sake of collecting facts relating to the Life of
								<persRef ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>, but in retracing
							these events of the French Revolution, an impression of deep melancholy
							is the sentiment resulting from them all— The facts are a succession of
							deep tragedies; with a total absence of all religious principle
							excepting in <persRef ref="louis-xvi">Louis 16</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="louisemarieoffrance">his Sister</persRef>, the two most
							deplorable victims of the Tale— The horrible effusion of blood for five
							years from July 1789 to July 1794— The constant alternations of
							Representative Assemblies elaborating Constitutions, and Popular and
							Military Insurrections destroying them— The despotism of a frantic
							rabble, succeeded by that of an automaton soldiery—and the wild and
							wonderful rise and fall of a <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">military
								adventurer</persRef>, oppress the mind with gloom, from which the
							only resource I now find is in looking at the results which now appear,
							and which after all seem to promise and even to exhibit some improvement
							in the condition of the human race— This is my consolation and my hope—
							I made out my task of writing for the day.</p>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gadsby</persRef>, that the
							driver of the Stage which came in from Baltimore last Night at Midnight,
							had mentioned that my Carriage was overset at the Bladensburg Bridge—
							After some hours of painful suspense, about 2 O’Clock came a man who had
							been sent from Baltimore, with an extra horse to bring on the Carriage;
							who said that the Carriage had been overset from the Bridge into the
							water—and that the stream was so much swollen by the rain and melted
							snow that they had been unable to get the Carriage righted and it was
							still lying there— One of the Horses belonging to the Carriage had died
							at Providence, and <persRef ref="wilson-john8">Wilson</persRef> had been
							obliged to hire extra horses to bring the Carriage <pb n="443" type="ms"
							/>here— The man went back with money and the extra horse to Bladensburg,
							and about seven O’Clock this Evening, Wilson arrived with the Carriage,
							which though much injured was not broken— <persRef
								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B.
								Johnson</persRef> was here this morning, and <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> dined with him— <persRef
								ref="wyer-edward">Edward Wyer</persRef> paid me, an Evening visit—
							Neither Wilson, nor either of the horses was hurt by the accident which
							happened to the Carriage— This as well as the loss of the horse who died
							so happened, that I ought only to have taken joy that it was not worse—
							How dreadful would it have been, if the family had been in the Carriage;
							which accident rather than purpose had avoided— I lament to say that the
							perturbation of mind occasioned by these incidents now almost daily
							occurring, depresses me beyond all reasons and reduces me to a condition
							worse than childhood—for childhood helpless as it is suffers nothing by
							cruel anticipation— I look around me for consolation, and find nothing
							but terrible foreboding. Yet in this state I am constrained to write— I
							did write and made this day no arrears.</p>

						<p>My Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> left us this
							morning to return home to Boston, which occasioned my postponing my walk
							round the Capitol Hill to the middle of the day. I wrote and gave him a
							Letter of directions for the disposal of part of my property in Boston,
							for the payment of my debts, and a power to transfer the stock that I
							own, in the New-England Insurance Company— <persRef ref="huntt-henry"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Huntt</persRef> was here this
							morning— The day and evening passed off, in a fearful looking for of
							judgment—a temper of mind becoming habitual to me, and from which I see
							no prospect of relief— Philosophy and Christian Resignation lose their
							hold upon my Soul— A superstitious Sentiment of fatalism usurps the
							place of my Reason, and among the terrors that it excites is that of
							losing my Reason itself— My present condition deeply calamitous as it
							is, seems to me only the early stage of others in prospect before me,
							and of which my own death is not the term— The extirpation of my own and
								<persRef key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> race is the issue
							ever haunting my imagination. Could I familiarise my mind to reflect
							upon this Event, as not only probable, but in the ordinary course of the
							destinies of the human race, it would yet afford me no consolation— The
							extinction of families, is one of the most common processes of
							nature—why should I expect that mine will be exempted from the common
							Law? It is also the policy of Republican Government— With these
							Meditations I read and write upon the Life and Character of <persRef
								ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>— Upon this I performed my daily
							task— I read also in the Newspaper of this afternoon the account of the
							fire, which on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October consumed
							the two Houses of the British Parliament.— This compendious process of
							fire is one of the most powerful auxiliaries of Time in sweeping from
							the Earth the vestiges of human intellect and human toil— And all this
							leaves to be solved the only question in which all my duties are
							involved— What am I to do?</p>

							consideration requires that I should keep and leave a faithful record of
							my proceedings in this capacity of Guardian, as well as in the

						<p>I attended the morning service at the Presbyterian Church and heard
								<persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> from 2. Thessalonians 3.5 “And the Lord direct your
							hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ”
							from which words, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith with much logical
							acuteness drew a fervent exhortation to piety, or the love of God, and
							as usual with him, he argued with his hearers, as with free and
							responsible agents— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
							John’s Church, where I took <persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna"
								>my two Grand-children</persRef>, the same person who had officiated
							last Sunday, read the Evening prayer for the 6<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Sunday after the Epiphany; this being the 26<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> after Trinity and supernumerary— His
							Sermon was from Job. 19.25. “For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and
							that he shall stand, at the latter day upon the Earth 26 And though
							after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God
							27 Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not
							another.” The Preacher took no notice of the different versions which
							have been given of this passage, nor of the various commentaries upon
							it— He took it as he found it in his English Bible, and raised no doubt
							but that the Patriarch <persRef ref="job">Job</persRef> had revealed the
							mystery of a carnal resurrection, and of his own immortality, by the
							efficacy of a Redeemer, to be born two thousand years after his own
							death. The Church of England so understands this passage, and makes it a
							part of the funeral service— But if Life and immortality had been
							revealed by Job, how were they brought to light by the Gospel of Christ—
							I read the seventh Sermon of <persRef ref="colman-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Colman’s</persRef> Volume, on the
							question how far our Persuasions and convictions may be relied upon, and
							the 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> on the moral Government of God—
							There is good sense in all these discourses; but it is scarcely possible
							to discuss any moral or religious topic in a space of twenty minutes.

						<p>My right cheek began to swell last Evening, with a slight pain which
							continued and increased the whole of this day— I took nevertheless my
							usual walk this morning, with a sharp and biting wind— I rode also about
							noon to the City Hall—and applied at the City-Register’s Office, with a
							Certificate of <persRef ref="billings-w">W. W. Billing</persRef>
							Collector of taxes; that at a sale of Square 592 in 1829. <persRef
								key="adams-john2">John Adams</persRef> had purchased the Square, and
							paid the tax thereon— He had omitted since then, to take a Deed from the
							Corporation under the Sale— I had bought the Square of <persRef
								ref="tyler-benjamin">B. O. Tyler</persRef> in 1820. whose title was
							by purchase from the Corporation— But <persRef ref="greenleaf-james"
								>James Greenleaf</persRef> had a claim to it, and contested the
							legality of the sale, by which it had been conveyed to Tyler— The tax
							upon it being assessed in my name, I permitted the sale, for the sake of
							completing the title— Billing was here this morning with my tax-bill of
							1833. in which I am still taxed for the Square— He said that James
							Greenleaf had attended the sale in 1829. and by bidding had run up the
							price of the Square to 400 dollars, beyond the tax for which it was
							sold— Billing had given the certificate of purchase as by John Adams,
							which would have vested the new title in him; but Billing now added in
							the certificate that John Adams had purchased as my Agent— I took the
							Certificate to the Register’s Office, and left it with <persRef
								ref="hewitt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hewitt</persRef>, who promised to make out and send me the Deed— I then
							went to the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court, and took a Deed
							from <persRef ref="johnson-george">George Johnson</persRef> of Alexandria to me of lot 18. Square 231. which had
							been lying two years and nearly a half in the Office, I went then to the
							Office of the Register of Wills, and found <persRef ref="chase-samuel2"
								>judge Chase</persRef> there— I stated to him the case of the
							personal property left by <persRef ref="hellen-thomas">Thomas J.
								Hellen</persRef> yet undistributed, and asked whether, I must return
							it in the inventory of my Son’s administration. He said he could not
							decide to whom any property belonged; that I should make a statement of
							the facts and he would then refer the law to the decision of the Circuit
							Court— I called at <persRef ref="wilkes-charles">Lieut<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Wilkes</persRef>; but he was not at
							home— Then returned the Visits of <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">E.
								Whittlesey</persRef> and <persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace
								Everett</persRef>, who spoke as if the investigations of their
							Post-Office Committee would end in no very satisfactory result— At the
							Library of Congress I took out the last two Volumes of the English, and
							one of the American Annual Register— I found that <persRef
								ref="watmough-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Watmough</persRef> had changed his lodgings and that <persRef
								ref="chauncey-isaac">Commodore Chauncey</persRef> was absent in
							New-York— I came home, suffering for the remainder of the day and
							Evening, with a swollen and swelling face. Warm foot-bath, and tumbler
							of balm-tea, just before going to bed; with a promise not to walk out
							before breakfast to-morrow Morning.— A desponding, dejected evening—but
							I wrote my two pages. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My
								wife</persRef> was better than yesterday—and received a Letter from
							our Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, dated at
							Boston, Sunday Morning. He reached home the Evening before— I have got
							through the Discourse on the Life of <persRef ref="lafayette">La

						<p>The pain in my face subsided last Evening, and has not returned; but I
							rose an hour later than usual this morning, and as I had promised,
							omitted my morning walk— Finished reading the New Testament, and read
							the Chapters upon France in the English and American Annual Registers
							for the year 1832— I received my Credential from the <persRef
								ref="davis-john4">Governor of Massachusetts</persRef> as a member
							elect of the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress; but from the
							circumstance that no formal opposition to my re-election was made in the
							District, the returns from only a part of the Towns have been published—
							From the official return to the Governor and Council it appears that the
							whole number of votes was 3728. of which 3234 were for me, and 494 for
							others; a proportion more favourable to me than at either of the two
							preceding Elections.— For this I am duly grateful, as a manifestation of
							the continued good opinion of the great mass of my constituents— And I
							feel it as a warning to remember the great and manifold blessings with
							which I am yet indulged; and to rebuke in my own Spirit the ungrateful
							temper of repining— I had morning visits from <persRef
								ref="gouverneur-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gouverneur</persRef> of New-York and<space/><persRef ref="u"
								>Matthias</persRef>, and I walked before dinner to the shop of
								<persRef ref="kennedy-john3">John Kennedy</persRef>, who rents a
							tenement belonging to <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef>, and
							which he rented of <persRef key="adams-john2">My Son</persRef>— There is
							a note from him due and an Account for Rent; upon which his Statement
							agreed with the entries appearing on my Son’s books— It was late this
							Evening before I finished the two daily pages upon <persRef
								ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>. In Kennedy’s shop I met
								<persRef ref="lane-amos">Amos Lane</persRef> the member of the House
							from Indiana, who had a large plaister upon his head, and told me he had
							been overset in the Stage, coming here, and been in danger of dying by
							loss of blood— Met <persRef ref="hawes-albert">Hawes</persRef> of
							Kentuckey also in my walk.</p>

						<p>Resumed my walk round the Capitol Hill before Breakfast, the habit of

							be placed, not where it was intended they should be, but in the Hall of

								>Kennedy’s</persRef> shop— And I this Evening finished the first
							draught of my discourse on the Life and Character of <persRef
								ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>—which must be wholly written
							over again— I read to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my

							closing pages, and Mary immediately remarked that if any of the foreign
							Ministers should be present they would not be pleased with it— That is

						<p>Walking round the Capitol Hill this morning I met <persRef
								ref="lansing-gerrit">G. Y Lansing</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="chambers-george">G Chambers</persRef>; members of the House of
							Representatives from New-York and Pennsylvania— This forenoon I attended
							with my Grand-child <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> at
							the Presbyterian Church, where <persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> preached from 1. Kings
							18.21. [“]And <persRef ref="elijah">Elijah</persRef> came unto all the
							People, and said, how long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be
							God, follow him: but if <persRef ref="baal">Baal</persRef>, then follow
							him. And the people answered him not a word”— In the application of his
							text M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith, observed that the question
							now to those who halt between two opinions, is not between the Lord and
							Baal—but substantially the same thing—between Religion and none— It is
							remarkable that in the old Testament there is not a trace of Atheism, as
							a creed— The fool hath said in his heart there is no God—but this is a
							solitary individual, no common belief— The question of all the
							exterminating Wars was between Religions—who was the God, and who the
							Idol— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith gave notice that he should
							administer the communion next Sunday; and that there would be
							preparatory services on Friday and Saturday Evenings— After dinner, at
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, an Irish clergyman,
							read the Evening prayer for the first Sunday in Advent, and discoursed
							till dark from Jeremiah 17.7. [“]Blessed is the man that trusteth in the
							Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.” <persRef
								ref="frye-nathaniel;frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frye</persRef>, and their Son
								<persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas</persRef> dined and spent the
							Evening here. There was an Eclipse of the Sun, almost total, which began
							soon after noon, and finished after 3. O’Clock— The sky was clear, but
							we only looked at it through smoked glasses— <persRef
								ref="silsbee-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Silsbee</persRef>, the Senator called upon me this Evening; and
							mentioned to me his intention to decline a re-election; and his wish
							that I should be elected in his place— I urged him not to decline, and
							told him that if he should not be a candidate, I should leave the
							Legislature to choose whom they pleased, but if he was, I would not
							suffer my name to be used against his, and would immediately take
							measures to prevent it— He persisted in his intention to decline, but
							seemed to have some doubts whether it would be proper for him to
							withdraw his name— I said if that was his determination, I thought there
							could be no impropriety in his making it known, and if he did not, I
							should expect he would be re-elected— The party with whose opinions he
							concurred, being stronger this year in the Legislature than for many
							years past; and I had never heard from any one connected with the
							party—a whisper of dissatisfaction with him— I said it was not the
							practice of that party, capriciously to drop persons in office, willing
							to be re—elected; nor was it the custom of the People of the State— I
							should of course expect his re-election, if he would consent to be
							rechosen, as I hoped he would— He appeared to persevere in his
							Resolution; but said he had spoken to no other person, on the subject—
							He spoke much also of the prospects of the next Presidential Election,
							and told me, that <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Webster</persRef>
							<pb n="450" type="ms"/>to his certain knowledge had indulged not only
							the hope, but the expectation of being a successful Candidate for the
							Presidency at the ensuing Election— I said I had heard so, but could not
							believe it; holding his sagacity and penetration in higher esteem, than
							to be accessible to so much delusion— There is not at present the colour
							of a prospect, of any one opposition Candidate’s being even formidable—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Silsbee concurs with me in this
							opinion. He spoke of his lodgings here for the present Season, and says
							the charges of boarding here have been regularly increasing every Winter
							for several years— That two years ago he paid for a Parlour, dining
							room, and 3 bed chambers; with himself, <persRef ref="silsbee-mary">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Silsbee</persRef>, <persRef ref="u"
								>their daughter</persRef> and one other woman, 65 dollars a week at
								<persRef ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef>, who now asks 80
							dollars a week, for the same Apartments, and the same persons, and 5
							dollars a week more, for an additional Servant— 2 1/4 dollars additional
							for every person invited to dine; and all the wines used to be taken at
							the house at tavern prices.— There are other boarding houses at more
							moderate charges, but none, at which it would be possible for me with my
							family to live at less than 75 dollars a week, for mere board and
							lodging— I read the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of <persRef
								ref="colman-henry">Colman’s</persRef> Sermons on Man’s personal
							accountableness; and the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> on occasions
							of self-deception— Not so much time for meditation upon them, as I
							should have wished.</p>
