						<p>Hail— Sleet. Snow— This was the succession of weather throughout the day.
							I called at the War Department, and left with the Secretary, <persRef

							Commonwealth of Massachusetts that <persRef ref="burgess-thomas2">Thomas

							upwards of two years— <persRef ref="bartlett-zacheus">D<hi

							me, with a view to obtain for Burgess a Military Land Warrant.— He also
							made enquiries, for a discharge of <persRef ref="barton-john">John
								Barton</persRef>, another Revolutionary Soldier, given by him to a
								<persRef ref="bradford-robert">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Robert Bradford</persRef>, of whom he has seen or heard nothing

							which I gave him from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bartlett’s Letter,
							and promised to have the proper enquiries made, and to inform me of the
							result— I then left Cards for <persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M<hi

								ref="felder-john">John M. Felder</persRef>, members of the House
							from South-Carolina, and sat for my Portrait to <persRef

							I sat now about half an hour, when <persRef ref="frelinghuysen-theodore"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frelinghuysen</persRef>, a

							read Prayers for Sexagesima Sunday and preached in the Morning from

							neither indeed can be.” This is the text upon which <persRef
								ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> of
							the Presbyterian Church, has preached a series of discourses. M<hi

							Prisoner from <persRef ref="sterne-lawrence">Sterne’s</persRef>
							Sentimental Journey, as a quotation to present a parallel between the
							fate of this Prisoner, and that which the Sinner must expect in the
							other world— This afternoon he said it was a melancholy thing to
							consider how totally religion was neglected by most of the persons who
							stood the highest in the honours and power of the Nation— I answered
							this Evening a Letter, received from <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott"
								>Abbott Lawrence</persRef> of Boston. A Bill for the annexation of
							Penalties to the Administration of unlawful Oaths, is in discussion
							before the Legislature of Massachusetts— And also a Bill for altering
							the manner of electing members of the House of Representatives of the
							United States— Both these measures were most earnestly recommended by
							me, in my Address to the People— But so sure is every thing recommended
							by me to meet with insuperable opposition, that I cannot yet flatter
							myself with the hope that either of these measures will be effectively
							carried through.</p>

								<persRef ref="smith-francis">F. O. J. Smith</persRef> presented

							and the disordered state of the Currency; and praying for a national
							bank— Selden made a Speech of about an hour and a half, on presenting
							the petition— Objection was made to his proceeding, but the rule was
							suspended to allow him to go on— He concluded by moving the reference of
							the petition to a select committee of five. <persRef ref="wilde-richard"
								>R. H. Wilde</persRef> of Georgia moved an Amendment of Instructions

							accepted the Amendment offered by Wilde—but modified his motion for a
							Committee, so that it should consist of one Member from each State— Polk
							moved its reference to the Committee of Ways and Means, and by the rule
							of Order in taking Questions, that of reference to a standing Committee,
							precedes that for a select Committee— The simple reference to the
							Committee of Ways and Means was made by yeas and nays 113 to 97. Wilde
							of Georgia said to me, that my hope that this would come before the end
							of the Session, to be a lost Majority, was likely to be realized; but
							the operation would be slow— It was dark when the House adjourned; and

								<persRef ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of War</persRef> shall be

							upon this subject— That it was necessary to come to some decision, and
							he hoped immediately after Archer should finish his Speech, the House
							would take the question, and there he got down— I rose to speak; the
							Speaker asked Archer if he yielded the floor— I told him it was merely
							to remark on M’Kinley’s notice—and he gave me the floor— I asked what
							was the notice given by the member from Alabama? The Speaker answered
							that I had heard what he had said— I said I had heard him announce that
							he had a <hi rend="italic">notice</hi> to give to the house; and then I
							had heard him say, that immediately after M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Archer should finish his Speech, the House must take the question— Was
							that the Gentleman’s <hi rend="italic">notice</hi>? The Speaker laughed.
							M’Kinley made no reply, and I sat down— Archer resumed his Speech, and
							spoke about an hour, without a Quorum in the House. I asked <persRef
								ref="gorham-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gorham</persRef>, if he did not intend to speak— He said no—he had
							given it up, and should wait for the report of the Committee— When
							Archer finished however, there were three or four claimants for the
							floor. It was taken by <persRef ref="peyton-balie">Bailey
								Peyton</persRef> of Tennessee— He had been conning his Speech for a
							long time, for it was chiefly in answer to <persRef
								ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie</persRef>— Very declamatory, and full
							of invective— In the course of half an hour he became exhausted, and
							before <persRef ref="bell-john">B. Bell</persRef> of Tennessee moved an
							adjournment, in his behalf— The house immediately adjourned. I went into
							the Senate chamber which was crowded, and where <persRef
								ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> was
							speaking— Between him and <persRef ref="wright-silas">Silas

								>Wilkins</persRef> and <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
								>Webster</persRef>, and <persRef ref="sprague-peleg"

							question whether 5000 or 6000 copies should be printed of the Report of
							the Committee of Finance, on the <persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke"
								>Secretary of Treasury’s</persRef> Deposit report— It was made this
							morning by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster, and the debate upon
							it was very acrimonious— I asked <persRef ref="bell-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef>, the Senator from New
							Hampshire how it happened that he had not dined with us yesterday— He
							said he had waited until after the adjournment of the House, and had

							the House— I said the Journal had then been falsified— <persRef ref="u"
								>Johnson</persRef> the assistant Clerk looked over the minute of the

							unanimous consent— This however was only one mistake for another— It was
							not passed by unanimous consent when offered, but as I thought laid over
							one day and then adopted without opposition— Even of this I am not sure,
							for I was confident I had a minute of it and found I had not— I was rash
							and violent in the charge of falsification of the Journal— Dickins asked
							me, whether I thought the written opinions which by the Constitution the
							President is authorised to require from the Heads of Departments, are
							public Papers, liable to be called for by either house of Congress. I
							said I thought they were, and referred him to the Documents of the first
							Session of the last Congress upon the apportionment Law among which are
							the opinions given to <persRef ref="washington-george">President
								Washington</persRef>, by the Heads of the Departments, upon the
							first Apportionment act, which he negatived. I thought Dickins meant to
							give me a hint, that there were written opinions, given by the Heads of

							have called for. In the House <persRef ref="chilton-thomas">T.
								Chilton’s</persRef> Resolution was up, and <persRef

							his Speech, an elaborate one, against it— <persRef ref="lay-george">G.

								ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of Ways

							been first debated— But the Speaker gave the preference to the motion to
							reconsider— It was warmly contested, but the House refused to reconsider
							by yeas and nays 115 to 103— Wilde of Georgia then moved to <hi

							Amendment of the Senate, and this raised another sharp debate, Polk
							pleading piteously for another Conference— The vote to recede was
							carried by yeas and nays 111 to 104. and the Bill is passed— A motion
							was made to adjourn over to Monday; but it was objected to and a few
							votes were wanting of two thirds to suspend the rule— Several private
							Bills at the third reading were passed, and the House between 3. and 4.

								Lincoln</persRef> called this morning called upon me, and shewed me
							several papers in support of his claim. A Bill for his relief has passed
							the House of Representatives, but labours before the Committee of Claims
							of the Senate. The same Bill has more than once passed the House before.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lincoln is much discouraged, and

								Webster</persRef> and <persRef ref="silsbee-nathaniel">M<hi

							brought me the Report unfavourable to the claim of <persRef

							the relief of the legal Representatives of <persRef ref="dohrman-arnold"
								>Arnold Henry Dohrmann</persRef> was however contested, but finally
							passed— The House adjourned between 3 and 4.— In the Evening I paid a

							with the prize of an old Lottery ticket of the year 1780. and enquired

							over the States for Petitions, the <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew"
								>Speaker</persRef> began with New-York—at which the call of last
							Monday was arrested by the debate on the Memorial then presented by
								<persRef ref="selden-dudley">Selden</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> now presented four
							Memorials, and accompanied them with an inflammatory Speech— One was for
							the establishment of a Warehousing System, upon which Cambreleng uttered
							an invective upon the Tarriff-Act of July 1832. one of his Memorials was
							from the Tammany Democrats against the Restoration of the Deposits and
							the rechartering of the Bank of the United States. He said it was signed
							by ten thousand persons— But Selden read one of their Resolutions which
							was suppressed in the Memorial—and which squinted at a National Bank to
							be located at New-York— Selden presented also a Counter-memorial signed
							by 2000 tradesmen, and Mechanics, complaining of distress, and praying
							for the restoration of the deposits— From Pennsylvania, <persRef
								ref="muhlenberg-henry">Muhlenberg</persRef> presented a Memorial
							from Lancaster against the re-chartering of the Bank, and <persRef
								ref="denny-harmar">H. Denny</persRef>, a Memorial from the same

								<persRef ref="speight-jesse">Speight</persRef> of North-Carolina
							called for the reading of it, and it was read— There was a string of

							for the reading of the first Memorial and Resolutions— The Speaker said

							Watmough moved a suspension of the rule, which was refused. He moved a

							Officers of the Washington National Monument Society, praying for an Act

							Objection was made— I observed that the House had suspended the rule, to

							them the same indulgence— The rule was suspended— My Resolution was

							rule for transacting business in the house, making it the duty of the
							Committee of Ways and Means to report the Annual Appropriation Bills
							within thirty days after their appointment—the House adjourned about

						<p>At the House, among the Reports from standing Committees was one made by
								<persRef ref="polk-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Polk</persRef> Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, with a
							Bill for the payment of the Pensioners— Ordered that ten thousand copies

							presented yesterday by <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cambreleng</persRef>, to the Committee
							of Ways and Means, with a view to move its reference to the Committee of
							Manufactures. It was the one praying for the Establishment of a
							Warehousing System— I said the Memorial had not been read, and being now
							at the Printers I had not been able to get a sight of it, but from the
							observations made by the Gentleman who presented it, there could be no
							doubt that the measure prayed for by the Memorial would deeply <pb
								n="247" type="ms"/>affect the manufacturing interest; for the
							protection of which the Committee to which I belonged was instituted—
							The Speaker said the Consideration of my Motion must be laid over till
							next Monday— I said that if the reference of the Memorial was to be made
							to the Committee of Manufactures, it was important that it should be
							made as speedily as possible, and asked the unanimous consent of the
							house to consider the motion now— But objection was made— I moved to
							suspend the rules for which a considerable majority voted, but not two
							thirds, so that the motion was lost— Then <persRef ref="chilton-thomas"
								>Chilton’s</persRef> Resolution for extending the Pension system,
							with <persRef ref="bouldin-thomas">Bouldin’s</persRef> Amendment were
							called up— <persRef ref="allan-chilton">Chilton Allan</persRef> of
							Kentucky said he was very desirous of replying to the Arguments of
							several Gentlemen against the Resolution, and a member from Georgia.
								(<persRef ref="gilmer-george">Gilmer</persRef>) had also claimed the
							floor in opposition to it— But the House was weary of the debate, and he
							was willing to forego the privilege of further addressing the House on
							the Resolution, and would do, what he had never done before, move the
							previous Question. This of course cut off Bouldin’s Amendment, and Allan
							was requested to withdraw his motion, but declined— There was a large
							second for the previous Question—which was carried by a large majority
							by yeas and nays, 136 to 66 as was the question upon the Resolution
							itself 119 to 87 The Committee to consist of nine members. The hour
							expired— The motion for reference of the <persRef
								ref="taney-roger-brooke">Secretary of the Treasury’s</persRef>
							Report on the removal of the deposits to the Committee of Ways and
							Means; with the Instructions moved by <persRef ref="mcduffie-george"
								>M’Duffie</persRef>, and the Amendment proposed by <persRef
								ref="jones-seaborn">S. Jones</persRef> of Georgia came up. T. T.
							Bouldin of Virginia had the floor, from last Thursday, and a long and
							impressive Speech was expected from him— He rose and said that before
							entering upon the subject in debate, he would notice a rebuke he had
							received from his Colleague who had last spoken (<persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>) for the omission to offer the usual
							Resolution that the House should go into mourning for the decease of
								<persRef ref="randolph-john">John Randolph</persRef>, who at the
							time of his Death, had been a member elect of this House (Randolph died
							last June, and Bouldin was chosen to succeed him—) He said he had no
							disposition to take to himself any general reflections which might
							equally apply to others, but thought he could not avoid some reply to a
							censure, which could apply to no other person than himself— That it
							would have been kind if his colleague instead of this public
							animadversion upon his omission had enquired of him privately the reason
							for it— That another of his Colleagues had done so in the most delicate
							manner, and through a third person, at the commencement of the Session—
							And now to justify himself before this House, his Colleagues and his
							Constituents it was necessary for him to say, what he should have said,
							if he <hi rend="italic">had</hi> offered such a Resolution— At this
							instant M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bouldin shook, staggered and
							fell, and never spoke another word— He was taken as soon as possible
							without the bar, laid on the carpet close to a window which was thrown
							up— The House was instantly adjourned. Two or three physicians, members
							of the House, and <persRef ref="naudain-arnold">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Naudain</persRef> of the Senate hastened to his aid— He
							was immediately bled, but died within fifteen minutes— <persRef
								ref="bouldin-eliza">His wife</persRef> was in the Gallery where she
							had come to hear him speak— She came down immediately <pb n="248"
								type="ms"/>after he fell, quite in a state of distraction— There was
							a moment of interval when he had an appearance of returning life, which
							was told her to compose her agitation, but two minutes after, he
							expired—her friends were obliged to take her away, screaming in agony. I
							saw him within five minutes after the Spirit had departed; and the
							corpse was soon after removed into the Speaker’s chamber— I had gone
							over from my Seat, to say a word to <persRef ref="beardsley-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Beardsley</persRef>, while M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bouldin was speaking, and had my eyes upon
							him as he was speaking his last words— I had but just turned from
							looking in his face, when I heard a member say—“he is greatly agitated”—
							I looked towards him, and he was already fallen— As I walked home, I
							mused on the frailty of human life, and the vicissitudes of human
							passions and fortunes—but especially on the tenderness with which the
							feelings and judgments and motives of others ought to be treated in
							political debate— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bouldin was a man of
							good dispositions and sterling integrity; warped sometimes into great
							curvature by the political prejudices of the Virginia School— He had
							been bitter as gall upon all the Tariff questions, and the Proclamation
							and the removal of the deposits had brought him round to determined
							opposition to the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">present
								Administration</persRef>— His Speech would have been one of the
								s<unclear>ev</unclear>erest against the administration to which the
							debate has given rise; and the Catastrophe which intercepted it is but
							one of the symptoms of intense excitement spreading over the
							community</p>

							that City— These are most or all delegates from the Memorialists to
							Congress, for relief which they will not obtain— They are in a state of
							great discouragement— But it is the spirit of fear, and not of
							resentment— At the House, a Resolution offered by <persRef
								ref="gilmer-george">George R. Gilmer</persRef> of Georgia came up,
							calling upon the <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of War</persRef>,
							for a Correspondence relating to the death of a man named <persRef

							by a soldier of the United States troops— It is a part of the sham
							quarrel between the Government of the State of Alabama, and the <persRef

							moved to lay the Resolution on the Table— Four Claimants for the floor
							were up—but the Hour for Resolutions had expired, and a motion to
							suspend the rule, for a continuance of the debate was lost— Several
							Bills at the third reading were passed, but the House refused to take up
							the Appropriation Bills, and it was impossible to get up a debate upon
							any thing else— The House adjourned about 2 O:Clock. I had urged
								<persRef ref="binney-horace">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Binney</persRef> to prepare a minority Report for the Committee of
							Ways and Means—there being a Resolution before the House for printing

								<persRef ref="gorham-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gorham</persRef> has his own opinions— <persRef ref="wilde-richard"
								>Wilde</persRef> does not attend the Committee at all— Binney said

							prepared a Report which he sent me by <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi

							read and return it to him to-morrow Morning. We had a company of members

							from Daniel 5.27—“Thou art weighed in the balances and art found
							wanting.” After the Sermon he gave notice that there would be a monthly

							called most earnestly upon the members of the Society for contributions—
							There was an approach to an intimation that if they should neglect this
							intimation, he would be forced to leave them. And he particularly
							requested every individual member of the Society to pray every evening
							for a revival of the Spirit of Religion— There is great need of it—
							Indifference to religion and infidelity are vices which naturally spring
							from general peace and prosperity— We are deeply infected with them, and

						<p>Rainy day. I rode to and from the Capitol— It was the day for Petitions
							and Memorials— But my motion to reconsider the reference to the
							Committee of Ways and Means of the Memorial from New-York praying for
							the establishment of a Warehouse system, was first taken up. I supported
							it by a few remarks, but my voice was so hoarse and feeble that it broke
							repeatedly, and I could scarcely articulate— It is gone forever; and it
							is in vain for me to contend against the decay of time and nature, and
							the incurable misconstruction of the House. <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> resisted the motion—
							I was sustained by <persRef ref="huntington-jabez">Huntington</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="selden-dudley">Selden</persRef> was willing to
							reconsider but wished the memorial to go to the Committee of Commerce,
							to which I had no objection—but the House by yeas and nays 84 to 126
							refused to reconsider— Then came Memorials from Portsmouth,
							New-Hampshire, presented by <persRef ref="harper-joseph2"
								>Harper</persRef>, who made a Speech against it—from Providence
							Rhode-Island by <persRef ref="burges-tristam">Burges</persRef>, who made
							a Speech in support of it, and was answered by <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">Pearce</persRef>, his Colleague—a sharp
							altercation between them succeeded— From Connecticut by <persRef
								ref="foot-samuel">Foot</persRef> with a few remarks— By Cambreleng
							from New-York. Tammany Resolutions against the Bank— By <persRef
								ref="king-henry">King</persRef>, Harper and <persRef
								ref="sutherland-joel">Sutherland</persRef> from Pennsylvania—
							Harper’s from Shoemaker’s which he supports with a Speech— <pb n="252"
								type="ms"/>Among Sutherland’s Memorials there was a counter one from
							Shoemaker’s to that presented by Harper, and some words passed between
							them— One of the Sutherland’s Memorials was accompanied with Resolutions
							violent against the Government that is, the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>— <persRef ref="mann-abijah"
								>Mann</persRef> of New-York objected to the printing of them, as
							containing disrespectful expressions to the Government— He asked for the
							reading again of the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Resolution to mark
							the disrespectful expressions, but they were not there— He asked the
							reading of the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> and they were still not
							there— Sutherland intimated to Mann that he had better withdraw his
							objection, and whisperers flocked to him till he did withdraw it—
								<persRef ref="watmough-john">Watmough</persRef> took fire and said
							he was very sorry he had withdrawn it— He asked him what he meant by the
							Government? and said he would read to him the expressions which had
							given him offence; and he did read them— They were sharp enough— The
							<persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker</persRef> called Watmough to order, but he persisted— Mann said he meant
							by the Government the House of Representatives, but admitted that the
							words read by Watmough were those he had thought exceptionable, and they
							referred only to the President. Mann backed out rather ungraciously and
							concluded with a declaration of personal Independence of Watmough—
								<persRef ref="lane-amos">Lane</persRef> of Indiana was for bringing
							the House upon Watmough but the Speaker put him down, by saying there
							was nothing before the House to reflect upon. <persRef
								ref="heath-james2">Heath</persRef> of Baltimore County presented a
							numerously signed deposit Memorial from Baltimore which he supported
							with a very warm speech declaring himself a firm friend and supporter of
							General Jackson, but no collar man— He said if the President were to
							send a message here to-morrow recommending the restoration of the
							deposits, the whole house would vote for it upon which he was called to
							order by the Speaker— <persRef ref="patton-john">Patton</persRef> of
							Virginia presented a Memorial and Resolutions from Richmond, against the
							removal of the deposits and made an ambiguous speech against the
							Resolutions— From North-Carolina there were Resolutions against the
							removal of the deposits passed at a Meeting where <persRef
								ref="carson-samuel">S. P. Carson</persRef> presided with
							considerable ability. Resolutions of the House of Representatives of
							Kentucky against the removal of the deposits were presented, and
								<persRef ref="lyon-chittenden">Lyon</persRef> presented a Memorial
							signed he said by 33 persons to the same effect— He presented also a
							memorial from others, pretenders to the discovery of endless life on
							Earth—asking for Land. <persRef ref="pinckney-henry">Pinckney</persRef>
							of South-Carolina presented a Memorial from a large Meeting at
							Charleston South-Carolina, against the removal of the Deposits, but
							reserving the question of the constitutionality of the Bank. These
							memorials and debates with other Petitions kept the House in Session
							till half past five— Several attempts to adjourn were made but failed
							until all the States had been gone through— It was about six when I got
							home, exhausted and dispirited; and I could do nothing but play whist
							all the evening. This universal cry of distress from Portsmouth to
							Charleston and from Baltimore to Frankfort Kentucky, produces no
							appearance of a disposition to afford relief. I stopped this morning at
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt’s</persRef> lodgings to enquire how he was— He is at the point
							of death with an attack of Erisypelas.— At the House I saw <persRef
								ref="barney-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> John

						<p>Passing in my way to the Capitol this morning, by the house where

								Wirt</persRef> had lodged, a crape tied to the knocker of the door
							announced his decease; and thus pass away in succession the glories of

							election of President of the United States, he was one of the Candidates
							who received the suffrages of the People, and a very little difference
							in the state of the public mind at that time would have effected his
							election— He had never been in public life, excepting in connection with
							his profession, which was the Law, but for twelve years during the
							Administration of <persRef key="monroe-james">James Monroe</persRef>,
							and mine, he was Attorney-General of the United States— His death was
							announced to the Supreme Court by <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef>, with an appropriate
							Eulogy.</p>
						<p>At the House upon the reading of the Journal I objected to the Statement
							on it respecting the Memorial from New-York for the Establishment of a
							Warehousing system, but the <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew"
								>Speaker</persRef> persisted in leaving the statement upon the
							Journal, without correction— The Resolution of <persRef
								ref="gilmer-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gilmer</persRef>
							of Georgia, respecting the killing of <persRef ref="owens-hardiman"
								>Owens</persRef> was discussed till the expiration of the hour.—
								<persRef ref="gorham-benjamin">B. Gorham</persRef>, presented the
							Minority Report from the Committee of Ways and Means, on the Bank and
							Pension fund Message— I took that opportunity to offer a Resolution
							calling for a Statement of facts and the Correspondence respecting the
							disallowance by the accounting Officers of the Treasury and of an
							account paid by the Bank of the United States; under an order from the
							Commissioner of Pensions.— My Resolution necessarily lies over a day.—
							When the deposit question came up, <persRef ref="muhlenberg-henry">Henry
								A. Muhlenberg</persRef> of Pennsylvania, after a Speech, moved the
							previous Question— <persRef ref="wilde-richard">Wilde</persRef> of
							Georgia, and <persRef ref="burges-tristam">Burges</persRef> of
							Rhode-Island, asked him to withdraw his motion, but he declined.
								<persRef ref="chilton-thomas">Chilton</persRef> of Kentucky moves a
							call of the House; which the Speaker declares to be not in order.
							Chilton appeals from the decision of the Speaker, but afterwards at the
							request of <persRef ref="hardin-benjamin">Harding</persRef> of Kentucky,
							withdraws his Appeal, which I immediately renewed, and a discussion of
							an hour or more followed— I then withdrew my appeal, stating that
							although more and more convinced of the pernicious character of the
							decision, there were indications enough to me that the majority of the
							House would not <hi rend="italic">now</hi> agree with me in opinion, and
							I preferred leaving the question for a propitious moment than to take
							now a vote which might hereafter appear to be a precedent against the
							principle which I deem correct— <persRef ref="foster-thomas2"
								>Foster</persRef> of Georgia however renewed the appeal again, and
							the question was decided by yeas and nays— The Speaker’s decision was
							sustained by 115 to 112—which in the state of parties and the temper of
							the house was equivalent to a majority of 25 against it— Then upon the
							question of a second to the demand for the previous question the vote
							counted by Tellers was 116 to 109— Then voted by yeas and nays that the
							main question should be now put<space/>Motion to adjourn rejected by
							yeas and nays.<space/>and finally the main question being for a simple
							reference to the Committee of Ways and Means was carried by 130 to 98—
							The House adjourned, about half past 4 O’Clock— I dined with <persRef

						<p>At the House a Resolution offered by <persRef ref="mardis-samuel">Samuel

							which the only qualities of the deceased which he noticed were his piety
							and religious faith— It was near three O Clock when we reached home, and
							for the rest of the day, I was unable to attend at all to any thing of
							the multiplicity of business in which I was involved— I could think of
							nothing, but William Wirt—of his fine talents—his amiable and admirable
							character— The twelve years during which we had been in close official
							relation together— The Scene when he went with me to the Capitol— His
							warm and honest sympathy with me in my trials, when President of the
							United States—my Interviews with him in January 1831. and his faithful
							devotion to the memory of <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt was no partizan of the present
							Administration— He had been a formal and dreaded Candidate, in
							opposition to the re-election of Andrew Jackson; and so sure is any
							thing that I say or do, to meet insuperable obstruction, that I could
							not imagine any thing that I could offer, with the remotest prospect of
							success. I finally concluded to ask of the House to-morrow morning to
							have it entered upon the Journal of this day that the adjournment was
							that the <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker</persRef> and members
							might be enabled to attend the funeral of William Wirt— I wrote a short
							address to the Speaker, to be delivered at the Meeting of the House, and
							endeavoured to concentrate in it, allusions to the remarkable
							excellencies in the character of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt, in
							words as few as possible— It occupied me till near Midnight, and left me
							still anxious, lest I should say too little or too much, and still more

						<p>I was still unable to bestow a thought this morning, upon any subject but
							that in which I was absorbed— I walked to the Capitol, and being there
							an hour before the Meeting of the House, I went into the Library and
							consulted <persRef ref="mallet-paul">Mallet’s</persRef> History of
							Denmark, and <persRef ref="guthrie-william">Guthrie’s</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="maltebrun-conrad">Malte-Brun’s</persRef> Geography.—
							Before the House met, I asked the <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew"
								>Speaker</persRef>, if the Journal of the House would notice the
							decease of <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef>, as being the occasion of the adjournment yesterday—
							He said no— I asked him if he could not have it so entered upon the
							Journal he said no— This I expected and I asked him if he would object
							to my asking the unanimous consent of the House that the entry should be
							so made— He said certainly not Accordingly when the House met, I made my
							proposal, and delivered my short Address of 5 minutes— It concluded with
							saying that as my proposal was not a fit subject for debate, if there
							should be an objection made to it, I wished him to consider it as
							withdrawn— The Speaker said he could not have the entry made, without
							the authority of the House, and he should consider it as granted if he
							should hear no objection made to it— <persRef ref="mann-joel">Joel K.
								Mann</persRef>, precisely the rankest <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Jackson</persRef> man in the House said no— There was a general
							call upon him from all quarters of the House to withdraw his objection;
							but he refused— <persRef ref="blair-james">Blair</persRef> of
							South-Carolina rose and asked if the manifest sense of the House could
							be defeated by one objection— The Speaker said I had requested that my
							proposal should be considered as withdrawn if obection should be made;
							but that the House was competent to give the instruction upon motion
							made— I was then called upon, perhaps by two thirds of the voices in the
							House—move—move—move—and said I had hoped the proposal I made would have
							obtained the unanimous assent of the House—and as only one objection had
							been heard, which did not appear to be sustained by the general sense of
							the House I would make the motion, that the addition should be made
							which I had proposed, in the Journal. The Speaker took the question and
							nine tenths at least of the members present, answered aye— There were
							three or four who answered no—and no division of the House was asked—
							The Reporters of the three Newspapers, immediately applied to me, for
							copies of my Address to the Speaker, and I gave the very draught, that I
							had made last Evening, to <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef>, who promised to have
							a proof of it sat in type for the National Intelligencer of to-morrow,
							and ready for my revisal, at the adjournment of the House— My anxious
							feeling was relieved. <pb n="256" type="ms"/><persRef
								ref="mardis-samuel">Mardis’s</persRef> Resolution about the Bank
							deposits was taken up, and he continued his Speech; much unheeded by me
							till the expiration of the hour— Private business followed, and the Bill
							for the relief of <persRef ref="decatur-susan">Susan Decatur</persRef>,
							called forth <persRef ref="patton-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Patton</persRef> of Virginia to sustain it. <persRef
								ref="grayson-william">William J. Grayson</persRef>, a new member
							from South-Carolina, spoke also in favour of the Bill <persRef
								ref="crane-joseph">Joseph H. Crane</persRef> of Ohio opposed it; and
							was answered by <persRef ref="parker-james2">James Parker</persRef> of
							New-Jersey. <persRef ref="chilton-thomas">Chilton</persRef> of Kentucky
							took the floor against it, but as four O’Clock approached, the Committee
							of the whole, <persRef ref="connor-henry">Connor</persRef> Chairman,
							rose, reported progress, and asked leave to sit again— The House, after
							some struggle, suspended the rule, and adjourned over till Monday; to
							morrow being the <persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>
							Birthday.— <persRef ref="davis-warren">Warren R. Davis</persRef> brought
							me to read a copy of a very pretty verses to a young Lady, and <persRef
								ref="potts-david">David Potts</persRef> of Pennsylvania came to ask
							me what was to be done by the Antimasons about a candidate for the next
							Presidential Election— <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> having been their
							Candidate at the last— I said I thought their best policy would be to
							wait.— I called on my way home at the Office of the National
							Intelligencer, and found my Address already in type, with only one error
							of the Press which I corrected— He shewed me his two <persRef
								ref="napier-david">Napier</persRef> Presses improved by <persRef
								ref="u">Coe</persRef> of New-York; each of which strikes off 1200
							sheets in an hour— Also an <persRef ref="adams-isaac3">Adams</persRef>
							Press invented by a man of that name at Boston— I had evening visits
							from <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="dexter-franklin">Franklin Dexter</persRef>; to the latter of
							whom I renewed, an invitation to dine to-morrow which he had declined—
							But he said he should be engaged at the Supreme Court all the morning,
							and was obliged to go off early the next Morning, so that he desired to
							be excused.</p>

						<p>I took to the <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of War</persRef>, a

								ref="churchill-solomon">Solomon Churchill</persRef> for

							the West Point Academy, complaining that in the Appropriation Bill
							before the House of Representatives it is proposed to increase the
							Salary of the Professor of drawing, <persRef ref="leslie-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Leslie</persRef>, which would give him

							raising of the Salary of the Teacher of Drawing was desired by <persRef
								ref="binney-horace">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Binney</persRef>;
							who took great interest in it— That subsequently it had been proposed to
							make the Teachers and of Drawing Professors and to increase their
							Salaries; but it had not been introduced into the Appropriation Bill,
							and he had no expectation that it would succeed.— I then spoke of the
							Resolution offered by <persRef ref="hawes-albert">Alfred G.
								Hawes</persRef> and now before the House for abolishing the Military
							Academy; and he said there would be a very heavy vote for it in the
							house— I observed that there was some discontent in the public at the
							changes which had lately been made in the Government of the Institution—
							He said it had never been in so good condition as at this time— That he
							remembered a remark I had made to <persRef ref="douglas-david">Major

							upon me with him, that the Government there was not sufficiently

							But whether it will turn out as good Officers is yet to be seen.— From

							County of Berks, for the restoration of the Deposits, and made a very
								<pb n="258" type="ms"/>rancorous Speech against it— This gave rise

							Statement of the sums denominated in the Treasury Accounts, unavailable

								Mardis’s</persRef> Resolution upon the distribution of the public

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Duffie’s</persRef> motion to
							recommit the Bill to the Committee of the whole on the State of the

								ref="wayne-james">Wayne</persRef>, <persRef ref="pinckney-henry"

								>Parker</persRef> of New-Jersey and <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron"
								>Vanderpoel</persRef>— The <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew"
								>Speaker</persRef> successively made M’Kay, Parker, Pinckney and
								<persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> sit down as being out of
							order; on a principle no better than his own caprice— He assumed that a
							Motion, to recommit a Bill at the third reading of a Bill, when it can
							not otherwise be amended, to a committee of the whole; admits of no
							debate upon the principles of the Bill; and he stopped every member who
							objected to any part of the Bill, as if he was undertaking to debate its
							principles— Polk the Chairman of <pb n="259" type="ms"/>the Committee of
							Ways and Means, after feebly struggling for some time against the
							recommitment, and utterly unprepared to meet and answer any one
							objection to any item in the Bill, finally consented, and the Bill was
							recommitted, without dividing the House.— The Appropriation Bill for the
							Indian Department was next taken up— Motion was made by M’Kay of
							North-Carolina, for its recommitment to the Committee of Indian Affairs;
							but it was opposed by <persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace
								Everett</persRef> of Vermont, and <persRef ref="ashley-william"
								>Ashley</persRef> of Missouri; and the recommitment was refused by a

								ref="clay-clement">C. C. Clay</persRef> the House passed to the

								<persRef ref="mckay-james">James M’Kay</persRef> of North-Carolina
							now moved that it should be recommitted to the Committee of the whole on

							Committee of Ways and Means, and kindled a fiery debate of three hours—
							M’Kay insisted that there were several items of the Appropriations not
							warranted by Law nor by Treaty and particularly that there was an item
							of 21000 dollars which included both in this, and in the Indian
							Annuity-Appropriation Bill— This was at first positively denied, but
							M’Kay repeated the charge and produced proof of its truth from a
							manuscript tabular statement which had been furnished to the Committee
							of Ways and Means from the War Department— Polk could reply by nothing

								<persRef ref="coulter-richard">Coulter</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wilde-richard">Wilde</persRef> of Georgia— The debate became
							exceedingly personal— Beardsley of New-York, to rally the party feeling,
							threw out a suspicion that there was insidious design lurking under the
							motion for recommitment; and that there was a project for tacking to
							some Appropriation Bill, a recharter of the Bank of the United States—
							In making this remark he pointed particularly to Coulter of
							Pennsylvania, who was in high Spirits, and who replied with great
							indignation, and no measured use of epithets, closing with a general
							remark that any man capable of imputing dishonest motives to others
							without evidence to support him could be no other himself than a <hi
								rend="italic">rascal</hi>—a word which he pronounced with an
							emphasis quite electrical— Wilde of Georgia, who felt annoyed by
							Beardsley’s insinuation answered him with more polish, but with equal
							keenness of edge, and Mercer said he would not reply to him, were it
							only from motives of mere humanity— Beardsley turned upon Mercer and
							Wilde with retorted scorn, but somewhat bewildered aim—and he disclaimed
								<pb n="260" type="ms"/>any intention of imputing insidious purposes
							to Coulter— The debate closed by a crowing declaration of Coulter, that
							if the Gentleman from New-York was satisfied he was so.— He wished it
							only to be understood that no man should tread upon his toes without his
							levelling at least a lance against him— The question was taken by yeas

						<p>At the House <persRef ref="hall-thomas">Thomas H Hall</persRef> of
							North-Carolina, obtained the unanimous consent of the House to offer a
							Resolution— It was that the Committee of Ways and Means should be
							instructed to enquire into, and report upon the expediency of reducing
							the revenue to the necessary expenditures of the Government, and called
							for the yeas and nays upon the question which was immediately made
							whether the House would <hi rend="italic">consider</hi> the motion <pb
								n="261" type="ms"/>I asked what was the motive of the member to
							offer this Resolution at this time— The <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew"
								>Speaker</persRef> said it was not in order to debate the question
							of consideration— The House refused to consider the motion 70 to 115— I
							voted against it— <persRef ref="harper-james2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Harper</persRef> of Philadelphia asked again the consent
							of the House to offer his Resolution, but objection was made, and he did
							not move the suspension of the rule— <persRef ref="mardis-samuel"
								>Mardis’s</persRef> Resolution about the deposits, and the Banks
							came up, and <persRef ref="clowney-william">Clowney</persRef> finished
							his Speech against it.— The orders of the day, Bills upon private
							business followed the House went into Committee of the whole on sundry
							Bills, <persRef ref="connor-henry">Connor</persRef> of North-Carolina in
							the Chair— There was a Bill for the relief of <persRef
								ref="brook-edmund">Edmund Brook</persRef>, which upon question made
							by me, had been postponed, and upon which I was not yet prepared to
							vote—it was again postpone— It was a bill to authorize Brook to bring
							two Slaves into the District, from the State of Virginia, by an
							exemption from the Law prohibiting such introduction of Slaves— <persRef
								ref="chinn-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chinn</persRef>
							Chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia, who had reported
							the Bill, came and asked me if I had satisfied myself with regard to the
							prohibitory law— I said I had not examined it, and asked him where it
							was to be found— He said it was an old Statute of Maryland; passed in
							the year 1794— The Bill for the relief of <persRef ref="decatur-susan"
								>Susan Decatur</persRef>, was debated till near four O’Clock—opposed
							by <persRef ref="hawes-albert">Hawes</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hardin-benjamin">Hardin</persRef> of Kentucky, and supported by
							an eloquent Speech of <persRef ref="pinckney-henry">H. L.
								Pinckney</persRef> of South-Carolina, who mingled as usual much
							nullification and the bloody Bill with his argument— The
							South-Carolinians do this now to a ludicrous degree. When Hardin
							finished the Committee rose and reported several Bills which passed to
							be engrossed. <persRef ref="wayne-james">Wayne</persRef> obtained a
							suspension of the rule to move an adjournment over to Monday—upon which
							the yeas and nays were demanded and refused— It was to give the
							Committee of Ways and Means time to prepare their report upon the
								<persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">Secretary of the
								Treasury’s</persRef> reasons for removing the deposits—adjourned
							between 3. and 4.— <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Edward Everett</persRef> brought me a Letter from
								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb Cushing</persRef> a Royal Arch
							Mason, and Member of the Massachusetts Legislature to <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>— This Gentleman had written to enquire what was
							the reason, of their delay to act upon the Resolutions respecting the
							distress, and removal of deposits, and recharter of the Bank. Cushing
							answers, bitterly complaining that they are paralyzed by the Anti
							Masons, who upon all occasions vote with the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> party— And enquires if I
							could not do something to heal this breach?— I said I had done every
							thing in my power, and if any thing had been done to conciliate the
							Antimasons, they would have met every advance in the same Spirit— But
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing must look to himself and his
							party, for the failure of all my endeavours to conciliate— I had given
							fair notice and warning both to <persRef ref="davis-john4">Governor
								Davis</persRef>, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster from
							both of whom I had received encouraging assurances of conciliation to
							the Anti-Masons—instead of which every possible thing had been done to
							fret and exasperate them— All their Candidates for the Senate had been
							swept off the board— Not one Anti-Mason had been elected to the Council—
							A fraudulent Law against unlawful Oaths was now in concoction to baffle
							and deceive them—and just now the Senate had refused to grant to the
							joint investigating Committee the Power to send for persons and
							papers—And now their aid was implored to pass National Republican
							Resolutions in favour of the Bank.— It was impossible for me to do any
							thing more with them, and I did believe they would go over to
							Jacksonism— I had done all I could to prevent it, but in vain.</p>
