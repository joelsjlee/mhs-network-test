						<p><date>22. V.30. </date>Sunday.</p>
						<p>I attended this morning at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church,
							where M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley read the Morning service for
							the fourth Sunday after Trinity, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Butler of Troy New-York read the first part of the Communion service,
							and preached from 1. Corinthians 1. part of v. 21—“the world by wisdom
							knew not God” Mary and her daughter Louisa were at Church with me— At 5.
							O’Clock afternoon I attended again at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							John’s Church where M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Hawley read the
							service but I was the only respondent of part of it, and not twenty
							persons present at any part— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley gave
							out two hymns to be sung but there were no singers, and no performer on
							the Organ, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley’s exhortation
							substituted for a Sermon of not of five minutes duration— Between the
							two services there had been a long continued and very severe
							thunder-storm, in whi<unclear>ch</unclear> the clouds in conflict seemed
							for a full half hour to be susp<unclear>en</unclear>ded immediately over
							our heads— In the leisure of the day I was reflecting upon the
							Resolutions and measures which it might be proper to adopt on the
							occasion of the decease of La Fayette— I moved the appointment of the
							joint-Committee yesterday because I felt that my position required it
							specially of me more than of any other member of Congress—but having
							done that, my principle will be to let others do all the details and
							propose myself, nothing All may possibly thus go on smoothly— But if I
							should propose Resolutions written by myself, the instant they should be
							read <unclear>in</unclear> Committee, the Spirit of verbal criticism
							would be kindled in the joint Committee, and there might be two days
							debate without coming at last to a Conclusion— I was well advised
							yesterday even in leaving the number of the Committee on the part of the
							House in blank— Five and seven had been named, but one from each State
							was more acceptable to the House; and as it is, multitudes of members
							will be disappointed, in not being themselv<unclear>es</unclear> upon
							the Committee— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frye was here this
							morning after the service was over.</p>

						<p>The Committee on the part of the House to consider and report suitable
							tokens of respect to the Memory of Gen<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> La
							Fayette was announced on the reading of the Journal— I was Chairman—the
							names of the members on the part of the Senate 13. were afterwards
							communicated— I notified a meeting of the Committee at 1/2 past 9
							to-morrow Morning at the Chamber of the Committee of Commerce of the
							House. This was petition day—but Polk moved to suspend the rules after
							two O’Clock, to take up his Bank-deposit Bill Question divided—vote to
							suspend the rules carried— But to take up that Bill not two thirds— The
							time till 2 O’Clock was wasted in violent altercation Speeches between
							Burges and D. J. Pearce of Rhode Island upon Resolutions from the
							Legislature of that State—both touched upon the Hartford Convention— At
							two the Harbour Bill was taken up, and under a running fire for and
							against internal improvement till near 9 at Night, with the Episode of a
							very heavy Thundergust was carried by a final vote of 107 to 46— The
							appropriation of 29000 dollars for Surveys voted down upon my Speech the
							other day was now carried 92 to 82— All by the change of Beardsley and
							the New-York Van Buren members—Jones of Georgia—Felder of South-Carolina
							and especially Wise of Virginia taunted them upon it bitterly Beatty of
							Kentucky, Ewing of Indiana and other western members flew the course,
							because they could not carry special favourite improvements of their
							own— The Appropriation for surveys was the tug for life and death—the
							question of engrossment was carried by an increased majority; and the
							passage of the Bill by more than two to one. I saw M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster twice in the House, and once in
							the Senate about the Meeting to-morrow of the La Fayette Committee, and
							W. S. Archer at my request drew up Resolutions to offer. I came home
							pleased with the result of the day.</p>

						<p><date>24. V. </date>Tuesday. At 1/2 past 9 this Morning the joint
							Committee of the two Houses of Congress on the honours to be paid to the
							memory of General La Fayette, met in the room of the Committee of
							Manufactures of the House of Representatives—24 Members of the House and
							13 of the Senate all present except Joseph Duncan of Illinois— The
							Resolutions drawn yesterday by W. S. Archer were presented, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay offered one embracing the substance
							of the three— Propositions were offered for dressing in mourning the
							Chairs of the Vice-President and of the Speaker of the House— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun offered a resolution that I should
							be requested to deliver an Oration upon the Life and character of Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l</hi> La Fayette before both Houses of Congress
							at the next Session— There was little discussion upon the Resolution and
							the two Chairmen, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster and myself were
							authorised to draw them up and report them— This was done with the aid
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Archer, and in the Evening I reported
							them to the House, where they were accepted—read three times and
							unanimously passed. In the House there was some discussion and much
							manoeuvering to take up the Bank deposit Bill in preference to the
							Fortification Bill— The Bank Bill prevailed and after
							excellent-senseless Speeches from Coulter and Stewart of Pennsylvania,
							Jones of Georgia, and M’Vean of New-York, Miller of Pennsylvania moved
							the previous question which was seconded and carried—and the Bill as
							reported by the Committee of Ways and Means passed the second and third
							reading after a Call of the House, by a vote of 112 to 90. about 25
							members of the House being absent intentionally to avoid voting— The
							Bill for pensioning the French Sailors wounded and the relatives of the
							two that were killed by the Salute at Toulon was taken up and reported
							by a Committee of the Whole on the Union, engrossed, read a third time
							and passed— M’Kinley of Alabama made an objection upon Constitutional
							grounds which I answered— The House refused him the yeas and nays upon
							the passage of the Bill— Adjourned about 1/2 past 6. The Senate this day
							rejected the nomination of Andrew Stevenson as Minister to London 23 to
							22. of Roger B. Taney as Secretary of the Treasury 28 to 18. and
							confirmed<space/>Butler as Attorney General without division— Evening
							visit from J. Connell</p>

								ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of War Cass</persRef>, who promised to
							examine the case and send me an answer— At the House <persRef
								ref="thomas-francis">Francis Thomas</persRef> Chairman of the Bank
							investigation Committee, asked the consent of the House to offer a
							Resolution that Friday next should be fixed to make the Majority Report
							of that Committee the special order of the day for next Friday— Thomas
							as usual made a speech and then a question was made by <persRef
								ref="watmough-john">Watmough</persRef> whether the motion should be
							considered by the House—considerable debate on this was allowed by the
								<persRef ref="bell-john">Speaker</persRef>, until the question was
							taken by yeas and nays and carried for the consideration 87 to 65— I
							voted for the Consideration—but before the debate could be got afloat,
							the hour expired, and the orders of the day were called and a question
							arose between the fortification Bill, unfinished business, and three
							Bills reported by the Committee on Indian Affairs which had been made
							the special order for this day— The Speaker decided in favour of the
							special order, and the House went into Committee of the whole on the
							Union, on the three Indian Bills, they went through the Committee almost
							without a question, <persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace
								Everett</persRef> acting as Chairman, moved sundry petty amendments
							which pass’d without opposition—and I said nothing until the question of
							engrossment came upon the third Bill which was for assuming an absolute
							Government over all the Indian tribes, under colour of constituting them
							into a Western Territory. I enquired whether the Committee had examined
							the Constitutional right of Congress to pass such a Bill— Everett
							answered that no member of the Committee doubted the right— <persRef
								ref="vinton-samuel">Vinton</persRef> moved to postpone the Bill till
							the next Session— Then the House took a recess from 3. to 1/2 past 4
							O’Clock— On returning Vinton supported his motion— I urged again the
							necessity of further time for examining the Bill H. Everett, <persRef
								ref="gilmer-george">Gilmer</persRef> and <persRef ref="wayne-james"
								>Wayne</persRef> sustained it— <persRef ref="archer-william"
								>Archer</persRef> joined in opposing it—and it was laid on the

							Indian depredations before 1802 followed and was engrossed for a third

							House adjourned at ten O’Clock at Night.</p>

							ground that this was not one of the last three days of the Session
							considering Sunday as much a Legislative day as any other—but the
							Resolution was adopted— A few minutes before two O’Clock the Georgia
							claims Bill came up at the third reading, and I asked for the yeas and
							nays upon it, adding some remarks which were interrupted by th arrival
							of the hour of two O’Clock— I dined with <persRef ref="webster-daniel"

							transacted— I finished my Speech against the Georgia claims Bill, and
							particularly showed that the allowance of Interest upon the claims of
							the States for the repayment of expenses incurred by them during the War
							was the reason, assigned by the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President</persRef> for putting his negative on the Bill for
							Settlement of the Accounts of the States passed two years ago, at the
							first Session of the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Congress— To this
							part of my Speech Governor Lincoln replied, insisting that the veto upon
							the Bill allowing interest to the States was not for objection to the
							allowance of interest but to the manner in which it was computed—now in
							point of form this was true, but the substance of the objection was to
							the allowance of interest at-all— The resistance to this Georgia Bill
							was however vain, for the previous question was called and the Bill
							passed—all the drilled parties being retained in its favour, and there
							is not a party in the house that votes upon measures by their merits
							alone— Other business ensued, and it was between nine and ten at Night

							The Article in the Compiler is wormwood, and I suppose written by
							Fendall himself— I attended worship this morning at the Presbyterian
							Church, where <persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> preached from Zechariah 13.1. “In that day there
							shall be a fountain opened to the house of <persRef ref="david"

							were scarcely ten men, and twice as many women at Church— There had been
							a very heavy Shower just before the service came on— M<hi

								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"

							Then a motion was made to lay the Bill on the table—negatived by yeas
							and nays 48 to 107— Then the vote to insist on the amendment was
							carried.<space/>Next came a long debate on an Amendment from the Senate
							to the Potowmack Brid<unclear>ge</unclear> Bill— The House disagreed to
							the amendment and the Senate afterwards receded from it— A great number
							of Bills were passed, and others were laid upon the table— A Bill for
							remitting the duties on a set of Bells; a donation to the Roman Catholic
							Church at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Louis Missouri was much
							altercated. <persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> made a
							Constitutional Question of it, and read a veto of <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Madison</persRef>, upon a grant of land to a Baptist Church somewhere—
								<persRef ref="sutherland-joel">Sutherland</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="hardin-benjamin">Hardin</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="beardsley-samuel">Beardsley</persRef>, and I supported the Bill
							and it was carried by yeas and nays 67 to 55— This was the last
							appearance of a Quorum— The members successively left the House and
							departed by Stages full North and South— But Bills continued to pass
							between the two Houses with Amendments till 6 P.M— The last three Hours
							the House was idle, the Senate being engaged upon Executive business—
								<persRef ref="hawes-albert">Hawes</persRef> played two or three
							boyish tricks, in which he was humour— The <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President</persRef> retained one Bill—20000 dollars for improving
							the Wabash River— He sent a written unsigned Message, which <persRef
								ref="fulton-john">Fulton</persRef> of the joint Committee on the
							part of the House read, and which at my motion was ordered to be entered
							upon the Journal— It purported that he retained the Bill, doubting his
							power upon his views of the Constitution, to sign it— A Message was sent
							to the Senate that the House was ready to adjourn, and a similar Message
							was received from the Senate— About 1/2 past six both Houses adjourned,
							and the first Session of the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Congress
							was closed— I came home with the <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary">Ladies</persRef>, who were
							waiting for me in the Barouche, at the door— <persRef
								ref="smith-william-steuben;smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi
