						<p><date>1. V.20. </date>Thursday. Met <persRef ref="foot-samuel">S. A.
								Foot</persRef> in the Apartment of the Committee of Commerce, upon
							the Sub-Committee on the Rules of the House. <persRef ref="wayne-james"
								>Wayne</persRef>, the other Member of the Sub-committee did not
							attend, though he had promised that he would— I proposed several
							amendments to the Rules which we discussed till the time of the meeting
							of the House without coming to a conclusion— At the House, after the
							reading of the Journal, according to notice given yesterday I asked
							leave to introduce a Bill to prohibit the Corporations of Washington,
							Georgetown and Alexandria from issuing promissory notes of any
							denomination under ten dollars— The <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew"
								>Speaker</persRef> made difficulties upon the 70<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Rule, but finally my Bill was received,
							and at my motion referred to the Committee on the District of Columbia—
							This precedent will enable me hereafter if I should see fit to introduce
							a Bill ready prepared, upon some other subject— The distribution of all
							the business of the House into standing Committees has brought the
							introduction of Bills by individual members into total disuse; and it
							was not without difficulty that I obtained the permission in this case—
								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> moved a
							suspension of the Rule, to take up his Resolution calling upon the
								<persRef ref="barry-william">Postmaster General</persRef> for
							information respecting his Clerks—rejected 93 to 63—not two thirds—
							Sundry other Resolutions were taken up— The Bills regulating the value
							of certain foreign silver coins and for extending the French and
							Neapolitan Commissions were ordered to be engrossed for a third reading
							to-morrow— The commutation pension Bill postponed till next Tuesday. The
							hour was expiring and <persRef ref="galbraith-john">Galbraith</persRef>
							moved to postpone <persRef ref="mardis-samuel">Mardis’s</persRef>
							Resolution, and <persRef ref="corwin-thomas">Corwin’s</persRef>
							Amendment till to-morrow, and pass to the orders of the day— Committee
							of the whole on the state of the Union on the general Appropriation
							Bill. <persRef ref="hubbard-henry">Hubbard</persRef> in the Chair. The
							item of Appropriation for Ministers to Great Britain and Russia was
							debated on <persRef ref="davis-warren">Warren R. Davis’s</persRef>
							proviso and Foot’s motion to strike out, till 5 O’Clock and then both
							were rejected— The next item for Salaries for certain chargés d’Affaires
							gave rise to sundry questions from me to <persRef ref="archer-william"
								>Archer</persRef> the Chairman of the Committee of foreign
							Relations—especially respecting a proposed Chargé d’Affaires to
							Buenos-Ayres— Upon which the Committee rose and the House adjourned. The

								Willis</persRef> of Boston came to me this morning and reminded me
							of old acquaintance at Haverhill— Immediately after the Meeting of the
							House <persRef ref="jarvis-leonard">Leonard Jarvis</persRef> called up
							his Resolution of enquiry respecting the condition of the Banks in the
							District, and the causes of the breaking of several of them, upon which
								<persRef ref="chilton-thomas">Thomas Chilton</persRef> spoke till
							the expiration of the hour— Then the Bill <pb n="307" type="ms"/>for
							making certain foreign silver coins a legal tender was read the third
							time, and gave rise to a debate of two hours, at the close of which
								<persRef ref="wilde-richard">R. H. Wilde</persRef> moved that the
							Bill should be postponed till next Tuesday which was carried. A message
							from the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> with certain
							proposals for amending the Laws in relation to the naval Service,
							prepared and reported by the board, constituted under the Act of May 19.
							1832— He declares his approbation of these proposals— The rule of
							private business was suspended and the general Appropriation Bill,
							resumed in Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, <persRef
								ref="hubbard-henry">H. Hubbard</persRef> in the Chair, and debated
							till near eight in the Evening when it was reported to the House— I
							restated my questions respecting the Chargés d’Affaires to Belgium and
							to the South-American Governments, seven in number, but especially to
							the Government of Buenos-Ayres— <persRef ref="archer-william"
								>Archer</persRef> in a speech of two hours gave a full reply, and
							explanations respecting them all— Not being satisfied with regard to the
							proposed mission to Buenos-Ayres, I moved to strike out the outfit and
							Salary proposed for that mission, and stated the rupture which had
							occurred eighteen months since, by the return home of <persRef
								ref="baylies-francis">Francis Baylies</persRef>, the last Chargé
							d’Affaires at that place— The refusal of the President, at the last
							Session of Congress to communicate to the House the Instructions to F.
							Baylies, and the Correspondence in the Negotiation, although the
							Government of Buenos Ayres had published that same Correspondence, in
							the Spanish language, and I had received from thence a copy of it, at
							the very time when the President refused to send the papers to the
							House— The question was taken twice on my motion, once without a Quorum—
							The second time by Tellers, 19 to 101— The federalists voting with the
							Administration members, to screen from exposure and disgrace Frank
							Baylies, one of the rankest of their own gang—who bought his mission to
							Buenos-Ayres, by voting for Andrew Jackson in the House of
							Representatives in 1825— Who stayed at Buenos-Ayres, only a few weeks
							just long enough to disgrace his Country, and whom Jackson now shelters
							from the public contempt, by withholding the documents of his shame—
							Baylies after grossly insulting the Government of Buenos-Ayres, and
							abusing the privileges of his diplomatic character, till he was in
							danger of personal chastisement from the popular indignation of the
							place, deserted his Post and came home, without waiting for orders or
							Instructions— Jackson has not given him another Office—but he shields
							him from condign punishment by refusing the papers called for by the
							House— There was little debate, excepting upon this item, but several
							other Amendments were adopted— The House adjourned about 8 O’Clock— In
							the evening I had visits from <persRef ref="bates-isaac">Isaac C
								Bates</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lyman</persRef> of Northampton— The adjournment was at the motion of
								<persRef ref="pinckney-henry">H. L. Pinckney</persRef>, till
							Monday.</p>

							as I found him formerly for correspondence. He returned six or eight

								<persRef ref="hill-lucy">his wife</persRef> and a family of eleven
							children two of whom he has lost in the course of the winter, in the
							western part of the State of New-York; which he attributes to the

							his first coming home he had found large sums, standing charged against
							him, as they had been many years standing, without the corresponding
							credits. So that he had time after time been reported as a defaulter,
							without knowing it, when in fact he had a claim for a balance due to
							him, which was now before the Committee of Claims of the House of
							Representatives, and for which he asked my attention when it should come
							before the House. I called with <persRef

								<persRef ref="montesquieu-charles">Montesquieu</persRef> upon the

							After dinner, another Stranger read the prayers, and a third preached

						<p>Rainy night and day— At the House <persRef ref="osgood-gayton">Gayton P.

							Instructions from his own District, and then moved that they should be

							against the Resolutions— But he withdrew this motion and moved that they
							be laid on the table and printed. He then presented a Memorial from
							Boston, signed by 3200 persons against the restoration of the Deposites
							and the recharter of the United States Bank— I presented a Memorial from
							380 citizens of Detroit in the Territory of Michigan praying for the
							abandonment of the experiment and the restoration of the public funds to
							the Bank of the United States— At my motion it was read, laid on the
							table and ordered to be printed with the names—<persRef
								ref="lyon-lucius">Lucius Lyon</persRef>, the Delegate from the
							Territory, assured me that the signers were highly respectable, but he
							said he thought the Distress had in a great degree passed away— That by

							from Rhode Island, Connecticut, <pb n="309" type="ms"/>Vermont and
								New-York;—<persRef ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef>
							presented Resolutions one of which disapproved his own votes here upon

								<persRef ref="slade-william">W. Slade</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="allen-heman">Heman Allen</persRef> also introduced Memorials
							with short Speeches— Several of the members of New-York presented
							Anti-Bank Memorials with Speeches. <persRef ref="selden-dudley"

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lazell</persRef> but he had gone to
							the Navy-Yard— I fear his case is an immedicable consumption, to close
							at no distant day.— At the House, after the calling of Reports from

							Resolutions of enquiry of expediency by three Committees, moved by
								<persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef> of Louisiana, and
							adopted, <persRef ref="mardis-samuel">Mardis’s</persRef> Resolution with

								<persRef ref="jones-seaborn">Seaborn Jones</persRef> of Georgia,

							of <persRef ref="letcher-robert">Robert P. Letcher</persRef>, and

							Moore; and concluding with a Resolution that he is entitled to the

							Report till next Tuesday, and that the Report and accompanying Documents
							be printed— <persRef ref="banks-john">Banks</persRef> moved that the
							Evidence should also be printed, and said there would be a Report from
							the Minority of the Committee in two or three days. Jones opposed the
							printing of the Evidence, which raised a debate— <persRef
								ref="hardin-benjamin">Hardin</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wilde-richard">Wilde</persRef> insisted upon the printing:
							Jones replied— The debate kindled into a blaze of personalities between
							Wilde, <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="peyton-balie">Peyton</persRef> of Tennessee, and between Jones
							and Hardin of Kentucky— The <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew"
								>Speaker</persRef> as usual checking Jones just as he was closing
							his volley of invective, so as to let him have the last word and
							suppress Hardins final retort. After the proposal and rejection of
							sundry modifications, it was finally resolved that the whole Testimony
							should be printed, and the consideration of the Report postponed till
							next Tuesday.— The House adjourned after 5 O’Clock.— I gave <persRef
								ref="wayne-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wayne</persRef> the
							papers left by <persRef ref="foot-samuel">S. A. Foot</persRef>, (who has
							been elected Governor of Connecticut, and resigned his Seat in the

								<persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>, and upon a count

						<p>A Session of nearly fifteen hours, without intermission and without

							objects for the year 1834. Many amendments were proposed to this Bill,
							which were variously debated. An amendment was proposed applying 112000
							dollars deposited in the War Department, the capital belonging to the
							Seneca Tribe of Indians, to the payment of all the annuities in the
							Bill: to which I objected as a violation of good faith, by disposing of
							the property belonging to the Indians, and of which the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President of the United States</persRef> is the
							Trustee— The Amendment was however adopted 67 to 59. The Bill was
							further debated till 5. O’Clock, when the Committee rose and reported
							both the Bills with Amendments, and the House adjourned. <persRef
								ref="clayton-augustin">Augustin S. Clayton</persRef> of Georgia,
							brought me <persRef ref="clayton-almira">his daughter’s</persRef> Album

						<p>At ten O’Clock this morning, I attended at the room of the Committee of

							memorial from York-town asks an appropriation of 20000 dollars, to carry
							into effect a Resolution of the Confederation Congress of 29. October
							1781— After some conversation I was charged to prepare and report to the
							Committee a Bill— In the House <persRef ref="galbraith-john"
								>Galbraith</persRef> after consuming the first hour in continuation
							of his Speech upon <persRef ref="mardis-samuel">Mardis’s</persRef>
							Resolution and <persRef ref="corwin-thomas">Corwin’s</persRef>

							and he spoke another full hour— <persRef ref="stewart-andrew"
								>Stewart</persRef> then moved to lay the Resolution on the table,
							without recollecting that the question before the House was upon
							Corwin’s Amendment, upon which we were desirous of obtaining a direct
							vote— The rule at <persRef ref="boon-ratliff">Boon’s</persRef> motion
							was suspended to enable Stewart to make the motion to lay the Resolution
							on the Table— He made and after some discussion withdrew it— <persRef
								ref="moore-samuel2">M’Dowell Moore</persRef>, immediately renewed
							it, and I made it a question of order, whether the suspension of the
							Rule extended to authorise other members to renew the motion, when the
							mover had withdrawn it.— <persRef ref="hubbard-henry">Hubbard</persRef>
							who was in the Chair as Speaker decided that it did not, upon which a
							debate of two hours arose, on several questions of order, till Hubbard
							reversing his first decision, decided, that under the suspension of the
							rule, for one member to make a motion, if it be withdrawn, by him, it
							may be renewed by another— From this decision I appealed—after some
							debate Moore withdrew his motion and the question occurred whether my
							appeal, fell with the withdrawal of Moore’s motion— Hubbard decided that
							it did not, <persRef ref="vanhouten-isaac">Van Houten</persRef> repeated
							the motion <pb n="316" type="ms"/>to lay the Resolution and Amendment on

							by a vote of 150 to 13— Corwin then withdrew his Amendment, after a
							debate upon it of more than four months—that is upon Mardis’s
							Resolution, which he also withdrew— <persRef ref="vance-joseph"
								>Vance</persRef> had moved a reconsideration of the suspension of

								>Thompson</persRef> of Ohio, moved a reconsideration of the vote of

							postponement of his own Resolution, substituting next Thursday instead
							of Tuesday for taking it up— <persRef ref="evans-george2"
								>Evans</persRef> of Maine moved that the motion for reconsideration

							almost unanimous vote of the House against my appeal. But R. M. Johnson
							now acquiesced without appealing. My Resolution then came up, offered

									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> John Tayloe</persRef>— No

							hearing of him almost sickened me with quarterly Sunday School meetings.
							It is a scandal to hear such men as him and <persRef ref="avery-ephraim"
								>Ephraim K. Avery</persRef> pronounce the name of God, in prayer. He
							was followed by the <persRef ref="hatch-f">Rev<hi rend="superscript"

							Chaplain to the Senate with an extemporaneous Address to the children of

							Then <persRef ref="frelinghuysen-theodore">M<hi rend="superscript"

							weather was so oppressive that after returning home I was unable to
							write— I had already attended three or four of these quarterly meetings,
							which are all much alike— The Addresses were this day less interesting
							than I had ever found them before: whether from the infection of Obadiah

						<p><date>23. V. </date>Friday.— Excursion to Harper’s Ferry.</p>
						<p>I was up this morning before 5. O’Clock and my Son <persRef
								key="adams-john2">John</persRef> went with me over to Georgetown, to
							the landing place of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. There we found two
							Canal boats, one of them of Cast-Iron— They were filled with a company,
							chiefly of members of Congress; and a few of them had their families
							with them; all invited by the <persRef ref="eaton-john"
								>President</persRef> and Directors of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal
							Company to make an excursion to Harper’s Ferry. My Son left me at the
							landing place and returned home. I entered the largest of the two Boats,
							which was full of company: among whom a small number of Ladies— The band
							of musick of the Marine Corps were also there, distributed in the two
							boats— <persRef ref="mercer-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Charles F. Mercer</persRef> late President of the Corporation, and
							the real founder of the whole undertaking was of the Company; <persRef
								ref="vanness-john">John P. van Ness</persRef>, Mayor of Washington,
								<persRef ref="cox-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Coxe</persRef> of Georgetown, and <persRef ref="abert-john">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Abert</persRef> a Director on the
							part of the Government, did the honours of the party— The passage on the
							Canal was very slow, and continually obstructed by stoppage of the
							Locks. Of these there are thirty-four, between Georgetown, and Harper’s
							Ferry— There was a light collation and dinner and after it some drinking
							of strong wine, which made some of the company loquacious and some
							drowsy. The Band gave occasional reports of animating instrumental
							musick— The Canal almost the whole way follows close upon the course of
							the Potowmac river: the country along the margin of which is general
							beautiful, sometimes wild, and in other parts variously cultivated, but
							seemingly little inhabited— There is not a luxuriously comfortable
							Country Seat, on the whole way— Nor one that bespeaks affluence and
							taste— The point of Rocks is one of the remarkable positions on the way—
							We reached Harper’s Ferry about 9 in the Evening, and with the aid of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mercer, and of the agent of the
							corporation I was quartered in the House of <persRef ref="rust-george"
								>General Rust</persRef>, the Superintendant of the National Armoury
							of this place. The Ladies and daughters of several members of Congress,
							were also provided with the same place for lodging— All were hospitably
							received by General Rust and <persRef ref="rust-maria">his
								Lady</persRef>— But it was about midnight when I got to bed.</p>

							of Rocks— At One O’Clock we all dined together at the Inn, and after
							dinner first visited the Armoury, where the Rifles are made, but the

						<p><date>25. IV:30. </date>Sunday— Return from Harper’s Ferry to
							Washington.</p>
						<p>At five O’Clock this morning our Company reassembled at the Landing, and
							embarked in the two Canal Boats upon the return from our excursion—
							About ten miles from Harper’s ferry we landed and breakfasted at a
							Public House where notice had been given to be prepared to receive and
							provide for us. We then re-embarked and proceeded upon our return. The
							heat of the weather was great and retarded the pace of the horses, by
							which the boats were drawn till a heavy thunder shower and gust came up
							about four in the afternoon. There was some occasional change of the
							company. Some of the passengers passing from one boat to the other.
								<persRef ref="hawes-albert">Albert G Hawes</persRef> a member of the
							House of Representatives from Kentucky made himself very amusing to the
							company by facetious humours and coarse jokes, and a very frequent and
							copious consumption of whisky drams. He talked much more than his share,
							sometimes to the great entertainment, and sometimes to the no small
							distaste of the Company— In the height of the thunder shower, I and many
							others of the Passengers landed at a Lock, and took refuge from the rain
							in a neighbouring house. After the thunder shower, the rain continued at
							intervals all the Evening, which was very dark. The Ladies retired into
							a small cabin, very narrow, and to my great surprise sung with great
							facility a variety of methodistical hymns. It was past midnight, when we
							arrived at the landing at Georgetown, where my Coachman <persRef
								ref="wilson-john8">Wilson</persRef>, and the coloured Man <persRef
								ref="u">Ball</persRef> were waiting for me with the Barouche, and
							had been waiting from 5 in the afternoon. I returned immediately home,
							and was safe in bed about one in the Morning— Among our Company was
								<persRef ref="thatcher-peter">judge Peter O. Thacher</persRef> of
							the Municipal Court at Boston— Members of the House of Representatives
							from all parts of the Union, but only one member of the Senate, <persRef
								ref="mckean-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kean</persRef>
							of Pennsylvania— I have been much pleased in observing the style in
							which the work upon the Canal has been executed. It is certainly a great
							work, but whether of proportional utility is yet to be ascertained— The
							new system of Rail-roads is taking the place of Canals, and the horse
							can hold no competition with the locomotive.</p>

						<p>Wrote to my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, and also

							Parnell</persRef>.— At the House, I asked the <persRef
								ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker Stevenson</persRef>, if under the
							rule of the House he could introduce Strangers into the Lobby— He said
							yes— He told me that he was very unwell, and was about to undergo an
							operation for a fistula— Soon after the Meeting of the House he placed
								<persRef ref="hubbard-henry">H. Hubbard</persRef> in the Chair— With
							leave of the House I moved that the use of the Hall should be granted
							for a meeting in behalf of the exiled Poles, to-morrow Evening, and it
							was granted. The meeting failed on Monday, from the weather— Several
							reports of Committees were received, among which a Bill with a Report
							from the Committee on the Judiciary, to refund <persRef
								ref="lyon-matthew">Matthew Lyon’s</persRef> Sedition Law fine, to
							his Heirs and Representatives. N. 498. and it was referred to the
							Committee of the whole, who have already before them a Bill of the same
							complexion for the relief of <persRef ref="cooper-thomas">Thomas
								Cooper</persRef> 485. The contested Kentucky election followed—
								<persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef> of New-York,
							and <persRef ref="pope-patrick">Pope</persRef> of Kentucky made
							successive Speeches, each of an hour, in favour of <persRef
								ref="moore-thomas3">Moore</persRef>. Then <persRef ref="davis-amos"
								>Amos Davis</persRef>, a speech of two hours against Moore and the
							Report of the Committee— Then <persRef ref="jones-seaborn"
								>Jones</persRef> of Georgia replied and offered an Amendment to the
							Amendment proposed by Banks; and after speaking till four O’Clock moved
							to adjourn, which motion was carried— In the Evening I had a visit from
								<persRef ref="litchfield-franklin">Franklin Litchfield</persRef>,
							Consul of the United States, at Porto Caballo in Venezuela, and had a
							long Conversation with him on the present Condition of that Country— The
							Republic of Colombia is dissolved, and its very name is extinct— It
							forms three Independent States—Venezuela—New-Grenada, and Equador. Each
							recognising the two others as separate and Sovereign States— There is
							not the remotest prospect of their ever being united together again—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Litchfield says the Government of
							Venezuela, acknowledges as the Treaty of the Republic of Colombia with
							the United States as binding upon them— So do the Governments of
							New-Grenada and of Equador— This inability of South-America, to live
							united under one Government is ominous.</p>

						<p><date>29. V. </date>Thursday.— At the Meeting of the House, I asked its
							unanimous consent to offer three Resolutions, which I propose to move as
							Amendment to the Resolutions proposed by the Majority of the Bank
							investigating Committee, and to my great surprize they were received
							without objection, and ordered to be printed— The House transcended far
							and wide its legitimate constitutional authority in the Powers which it
							gave to the Bank inquisition Committee as it should have been called—
							The <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">President</persRef> and Directors of
							the United States Bank, stood upon their rights, and refused to submit
							to the Scrutiny of the Committee, the members of which were of course
							obliged to slink back with their errand unexecuted, and to relieve
							themselves with a petulant report of invective against the President and
							Directors, of the Bank and closing with a Resolution that they should be
							brought to the Bar of the House to answer for a contempt— The House will
							not dare to pass this Resolution, from which even the British Parliament
							would shrink abashed— I determined to put upon the Records of the House
							my Protest against the adoption of any such Resolution, and my
							indignation at the mere proposition of such measures— <persRef
								ref="boon-ratliff">Boon’s</persRef> Resolution for adjourning on the
								16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of June, postponed for
							consideration to this day was next taken up, and debated till four
							O’Clock— <persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> asked Boon to change
							his day to the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June; which he
							declined— <persRef ref="parker-james2">Parker</persRef> of New-Jersey
							moved the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of June, and <persRef
								ref="everett-horace">Horace Everett</persRef> the 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July— The two longest terms, were
							rejected by yeas and nays—the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July
							28 to 172—the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June 96 to 109.—
								<persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> moved to lay the Resolution
							on the table—which was rejected 65 to 141— Then Boon agreed to take the
								23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> but the 16<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> was still insisted on by the opposition Members and a part
							of the others. <persRef ref="clayton-augustin">Clayton</persRef> moved
							to reconsider the vote, by which the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							of June had been rejected; and <persRef ref="speight-jesse"
								>Speight</persRef> called for the previous question which was
							carried— Then the vote to reconsider was 122 to 84. and the final vote
							for the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June 129 to 83— I voted
							first against the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June, for the
							chance of a shorter day, and finally for it, to exclude a longer one—and
							assigned these reasons to the House for my change of vote— After the
							adjournment of the House, I went into the Library, and consulted the
							four Volumes of Precedents of cases in the House of Commons, for
							Parliamentary Law— Upon this doctrine of contempts, I examined also, the
							Register of Congressional debates. 8. 2. 2597. 1. <persRef

						<p><date>30. VI. </date>Friday— About one in the morning after three
							restless hours in bed, I was seized with extremely violent cramps in
							both legs; which forced me out of bed, and to the immediate use of a
							Seidlitz Powder.— I then became more composed, and got three or four
							hours of Sleep. But the morning was idleness and despondency— At the
							House just after ten—few members there. I went into the Library, and
							consulted 6. <persRef ref="wheaton-henry">Wheaton</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="raymond-robert">Lord Raymond</persRef> for the
							doctrine of contempts— I found the House in Session—and met at the door
								<persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Stevenson</persRef>, the Speaker, who had placed <persRef
								ref="hubbard-henry">H. Hubbard</persRef> in the Chair; and he told
							me that he had just given notice that he should resign the Chair next
							Monday— <persRef ref="chilton-thomas">Chilton</persRef> moved a
							suspension of the rules to offer a Resolution for meeting during the
							remainder of the Session at ten in the morning, and taking a daily
							recess from 2 to 4. O’Clock— Suspension rejected by yeas and nays 59 to
							87. The contested Kentucky Election was taken up— The Resolution
							reported by the Majority of the Committee of Elections assigns the Seat
							to <persRef ref="moore-thomas3">Thomas P. Moore</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="banks-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Banks</persRef>
							moved as an Amendment <pb n="325" type="ms"/>that certain votes excluded
							by the Committee ought to be counted. He accepted an amendment proposed
							by <persRef ref="jones-seaborn">S. Jones</persRef>, and modified his
							Resolution, to embrace the names of a number of individual<hi
								rend="strikethrough">s</hi> voters. <persRef ref="letcher-robert"
								>Robert P. Letcher</persRef> then addressed the House, in support of
							his claim— When the first hour expired the Speaker announced the order
							of the day for private business, but upon a general call from all
							quarters of the House, Letcher continued till 3. O’Clock, with a strong
							argument, earnest and good humoured— The house then adjourned to give
							time for preparation to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore— I went
							into the Senate, where they were debating a Bill for giving Land to a
							manual labour College in Indiana— In the Library I looked at <persRef
								ref="guthrie-william">Guthrie’s</persRef> translation of the second
							Philippic of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>, much to my
							dissatisfaction— Then walked and rode home. My Son <persRef

							Committee on Roads and Canals, reported a Bill, to authorize
							examinations, surveys, and estimates, for the construction of roads, and
							the improvement of certain rivers and harbours. N. 502. read twice, and
							referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union—
								<persRef ref="bell-john">John Bell</persRef> of Tennessee Chairman
							of the judiciary Committee, reported a Bill giving the consent of
							Congress to a Convention, for the settlement of the boundaries on
								<persRef ref="hudson-henry">Hudson’s</persRef> River between the
							States of New-York and New-Jersey— The Bill was read twice, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell urged that it should be immediately
							engrossed and passed— I proposed that it should be postponed a few days
							and printed— The Convention affirms the exclusive jurisdiction to the
							respective States, and the Bill contains no reservation of the right of
							jurisdiction of the United States. The bill was postponed till next
								<unclear>Wednesday</unclear> and is to be printed— Kentucky
							contested election. <persRef ref="moore-thomas3">Thomas P

								>Leavitt</persRef> of Ohio made a Speech, and upon being interrupted
							by <persRef ref="marshall-thomas">Marshall</persRef> of Kentucky moved
							the previous Question.— Tellers were called to ascertain if there was a
							second to the motion, and it failed 58 to 102— Upon which <persRef
								ref="hardin-benjamin">Hardin</persRef> opened with a Speech— He was
							followed by <persRef ref="mckinley-john">M’Kinley</persRef> who
							presented certain new views of the subject. Before he commenced, I moved
							at half past four an adjournment which was rejected by yeas and nays 81
							to 121. After M’Kinley had finished <persRef ref="allan-chilton">Chilton
								Allen</persRef> moved again to adjourn—rejected 92 to 106— Then he
							moved a Call of the House and 213 members answered to their names.—
							Excuses received from 19. <persRef ref="beardsley-samuel"
								>Beardsley</persRef> again moved the previous question again
							rejected. I wrote a note of excuse to <persRef ref="vaughan-charles">Sir

								ref="archer-william">Archer</persRef> by <persRef ref="wilson-john8"
								>my Coachman</persRef>, with orders not to return— The House sat
							till 9 O’Clock, taking a series of questions by yeas and nays, upon all
							the amendments moved by <persRef ref="banks-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Banks</persRef>— The yeas and nays
							were taken five times; and all Banks’s Amendments were carried by
							majorities from 8 to 20 votes, till it came to the last, the question
							upon which was arrested by a motion of <persRef ref="muhlenberg-henry"
								>Muhlenberg</persRef> to adjourn which was carried— It was now
							ascertained, that the result of the amendments adopted by the House must
							be to declare <persRef ref="letcher-robert">Letcher</persRef> duly
							elected, and Muhlenberg’s object was to concert out of the House, means
							to escaped from this conclusion. I walked home 10. P.M— It had rained
