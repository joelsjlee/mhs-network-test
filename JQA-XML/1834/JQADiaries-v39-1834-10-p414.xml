							and saw numerous stumps of trees which have been cut down, and carried
							away by despoilers to whom they were convenient— I desired M<hi

							half of the lot, about the first week in next Month— And I agreed with
							him to visit the Verchild lot, next Tuesday if the weather should be

							pack of fine chesnut Oak Acorns fallen from the trees, and found
							scarcely any others, excepting of the scrub oak, two bushes of which
							were covered with fruit. It began to sprinkle before we left the woods,
							and blew a heavy South-west gale with warm light showers all the

						<p>I walked before breakfast to the North side of Neponset Bridge; with the

								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Milestones, that it takes 1070 of my
							paces to a mile, and 17 minutes 8 seconds of time, equalling 3 1/2 miles
							to an hour— This is for cool weather, and a good level road— And I could
							venture to measure the road from my gate to the Boston free Bridge by
							that rule, without displacing one of the milestones to the extent of
							five feet.— I ascertained also the distance to the North side of
							Neponset river which is 45 1/2 paces short of 2 Miles, and 3 quarters— I
							was out one hour and 36 minutes— <persRef ref="adams-thomas2">Lieut<hi

						<p>My admeasurement of the distance between the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> and 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Milestones, by which
							I find that it takes upon the average 1070 of my paces to a mile on
							level ground and a good dry road enabled me to rectify former
							approximations to correctness— By this new standard I found that from my
							gate to the Apthorp house is 1. mile—to the Braintree and Quincy line
							stone 2 to the gate below <persRef ref="capen-samuel">S.
								Capen’s</persRef> house 3. to <persRef
								ref="adams-ebenezer;adams-josiah">Eb and Josiah Adams’s</persRef>
							gate 4. to the Scotland pond gate 5. and across the hills to my gate 7
							furlongs 7 Rods and 3 feet—a walk for me of 1 hour and 40 minutes; but
							as I stop’d nearly half an hour to gather white Oak Acorns I was upwards
							of two hours out on my walk. The acorns were from one of two large white
							oak trees in the middle pasture; and are large and fair of their kind—
							In order to plant some of the white Oak Acorns immediately I passed much
							of the morning after breakfast in my garden; and put them in the ground
							between a seedling black-walnut and a wild cherry, near the
							honey-locust. I have so often failed in ascertaining the identity of the
							plants, with the seeds sown, that I constantly vary my expedients to
							accomplish it, and one of my curiosities now, is to mark specially the
							manner in which the white Oak first comes from the ground, and its
							habits of the first and second Season— I think it has but one growth in
							the year—in April and May; and then very small and slender— The Chesnut,
							red, and English Oaks, have two growths in a Summer, and their progress
							is proportionally rapid— With the Acorns I buried also some Beech seeds,
							and S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Michael Pear seeds, with 3 white
							crab apple seeds from Stoney field hill— Transplanted three
							Apple-seedlings from the Eastern close box, to the border in front of my
							chamber window, where I have now six Seedling Shellbark walnuts growing
							of a row of 12. that I planted in 1830. and not one of them is yet six
							inches high— After clearing the box, and spading up the earth in it I
							planted in a cross row 5 Trask Pear-seeds, with two white Oak Acorns,
							and 3 Beech seeds in it— And this Seedsman’s work so swallowed up the
							day, with visits from my Tenant <persRef ref="carr-john2"
							>Carr</persRef>, who complained of a charge, of cabbaging my wood, and
							talked politics, and from <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi

								ref="thaxter-edward2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward
								Thaxter</persRef> from Hingham, that I found not a quarter of an
							hour to write; and when I attempted it in the Evening soon found it
							impracticable— There was heavy rain in the afternoon and Evening—
								<persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> was again severely
							afflicted with the ear ache, and aggravated with anxiety the disease of

							rumsellers, among whom he said there were a great multitude of Deacons—
							He most earnestly urged his auditory never to vote for an intemperate
							man, as a candidate for any political Office— His delivery bating much

						<p>Walk to the Mount Wollaston farm, and found by the new measurement of my

							Germantown road, at a single Oak tree at the West side of the road and

							called by <persRef ref="michaux-francois">Michaux</persRef>, or White
							Walnuts by <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bigelow</persRef>. Juglans alba, or tomentosa— They are not yet
							ripe: and Michaux says they are ripe about the 15<hi rend="superscript"

							23. Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> and 6. and 20. Nov<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> 1830., I found most of the Apple-trees, in
							very indifferent and unpromising condition— The border of forest trees
							has almost totally failed on three sides—but on the West side, along the
							brow of the hill there are several Walnuts, Chesnut Oaks, and especially
							chesnuts which in 25 years from this time may form a grove, and in 50 a
							thick and tall forest. Alteri Seculo must be the motto of the man who

							trees on the spots where they will come up— This experiment first made
							last year was partially successful, and I shall repeat it, as long as I

							O’Clock and I went with him and viewed my Verchild and Atherton Pasture,
							which is rapidly becoming a Woodlot— There is on a part of it a
							considerable growth of White-Birch, which I have been much advised to
							sell off as it stands; but which would sell for almost nothing; and
							there is growing with them a goodly number of Hickory Walnuts, Oaks and
							Maples which if suffered to grow a few years more will make valuable
							trees— I thought it most advisable to have the Birch and perhaps the
							cedars cut away, and leave the other forest trees to grow— I visited
							also the grove on the brow of the hill opposite the house in which I was
							born, and found there a number of fine Oaks and Walnuts; but scarcely
							any nuts or acorns. One black Oak only I found bearing very full but the
							Acorns are not yet ripe. There were two cows of <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilde</persRef> who hires the
							adjoining lot, in the close, and evidence that there had been horses
							there— And no small number of stumps disclosed the fact, that the
							neighbours had freely supplied themselves with fire wood from the same
							grounds— These are depredations against which it is perhaps impossible
							to guard. How much the eye of the master is wanting I can perceive by
							what I discover even in my morning walks— I agreed with Spear to go into
							the woods with him again next Tuesday; if the weather should be fair— I
							returned home about one O’Clock, and <persRef

						<p>Walk to and upon the Railway— I was upwards of two hours out but my walk

							Politics, in which or in any other Politics at this time, there is
							nothing of absorbing interest— The Prosperity of the Country,
							independent of all agency of the Government, is so great that the People
							have nothing to disturb them, but their own waywardness and corruption—
							They quarrel upon dissensions of a doit, and split up into gangs of
							partizans of A, B, C, and D, without knowing why they prefer one to
							another— Caucusses, County, State, and National Conventions Public
							dinners, and dinner table Speeches two or three hours long, constitute
							the operative power of electioneering, and the parties are of working

							Republicans and Democrats, without one ounce of honest principle to
							chuse between them— New-Hampshire is governed by a knave of the name of
								<persRef ref="hill-isaac">Isaac Hill</persRef>, Editor of a
							Newspaper, Mail contractor and now a Senator of the United States—just
							cunning enough to grow rich by railing against the reach, and to fatten
							upon the public spoils bawling Democracy— This is the begetting Sin of
							popular governments, and it is now as it always has been— Van Buren is a
							demagogue of the same School, with a tincture of Aristocracy, an
							amalgamated metal of lead and copper. There are five or six Candidates
							for the succession to the Presidency; all of them demagogues; and not
							one of them having any consistency of system for the Government of the
							Union. Plumer asked, as other have asked, whether they might not go back
							to the last Administration— They might as well ask the resurrection of
							one dead man to life by touching the bones of another—a miracle never
							repeated since it was seen at the Sepulchre of <persRef ref="elisha"
								>Elisha</persRef>. I have nothing henceforth to look to but the
							grave, and if possible to withdraw from the public Scene, without

						<p><persRef ref="foster-louisa">Louisa Foster</persRef> had determined to
							return home this morning, and <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth
								C. Adams</persRef> was to go in to Boston with her— I had been very

							relating to <persRef ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>, and

							my best way to obtain the papers was to go this day to Cambridge where
							Sparks resides, and to ask the papers of himself— I went into Boston and
							after leaving the young Ladies at <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> James H. Foster’s</persRef> I called
							at <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> Office where I saw

							and her daughters <persRef ref="quincy-eliza2">Susan</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="quincy-anna">Anna</persRef>— She sent a man with me to

								>Montgaillard’s</persRef> history of the French Revolution— The
							Manuscripts are collections which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparks
							received from La Fayette himself, with whom he passed several weeks at
							La Grange; and who communicated to him many of the circumstances of his
							own history— I asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparks whether he
							proposed to write and publish a Life of La Fayette— He said no—he had
							not time, for such a work— Most of the papers are yet in the possession
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett.— I returned immediately
							Boston—called again at Charles’s Office, and he promised to get the
							papers of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparks at Cumings and

							visit of the late <persRef ref="winthrop-thomas">Lieut<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Governor T. L. Winthrop</persRef>,
							and had some amusing conversation with him. He said that the object of
							La Fayette’s visit to this Country in 1784. was to communicate to
							General Washington the secret of <persRef ref="mesmer-franz"
								>Mesmer’s</persRef> animal magnetism; and mentioned that he had at

								<persRef ref="livingston-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

							before I came in— I called at <persRef ref="jones-john-8"
								>Jones’s</persRef> shop 123 Washington Street, and selected a Seal
							for the engraving of an Oak Acorn, and then went and dined at M<hi

						<p><date>13 IV.45. </date>Monday—</p>
						<p>Walk to the middle and Druid Pastures, where I gathered about a quart of
							Chesnut white Oak and white Oak Acorns— They are just now ripe and loose
							from their cups. But the Black Oak Acorns will not be ripe in less than
							another week, or perhaps fortnight.— The Chesnut Oak Acorns, which I
							picked up, fallen from the trees on the first day of this Month in the
							woods were then ripe— I planted in the garden sixty of them that same
							day; and 20 more two days after— These I expect will many of them come
							up next Spring; but almost all the rest have sprouted before I was ready
							to plant them— I put into the ground last Friday and this day upwards of
							100 with sprouts some of them an inch long, uncertain whether they will
							continue to vegetate underground or perish— The white and chesnut oak
							Acorns are the only ones which I have observed to sprout thus in the
							open air; and from this facility of vegetation it may be inferred that
							they may be easily raised. Of the Chesnut Oak my experience has
							confirmed this expectation: for of my seedlings of that kind, I see
							many, if not all have two growths every Summer— The white Oaks have but
							one; and that so slender that it is winter killed to the ground, for
							several successive years— Of many hundred white Oak Acorns planted by me
							in my garden and Nursery, I have only two ascertained white Oak
							seedlings growing— The Chesnut Oaks are numerous. This difference of
							about one month in the time when the Acorns of the several kinds of oaks
							growing here come to maturity, and the difference between the kinds
							which have two growths, and those which have only one in a Season, are
							both circumstances much to be noted by any one who would raise a forest
							of Oaks— I have learnt them by experience, and have no doubt that with a
							faculty of meditative observation tenfold greater than that which has
							been <pb n="421" type="ms"/>allotted to me, every succeeding year would
							disclose to me some secret of vegetation from which inferences of public
							utility might be drawn— This afternoon was consumed in finishing to
							plant the row, the whole length of the North fence of the Eastern
							close—but I had been without interruption in the morning, and had
							written for leisure after dinner— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"

						<p>Sharp frost again and a cold morning— I walked to the mount Wollaston

							Bridge free—to the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> mile-stone—and found
							the distance 435 paces, which at 1070 paces to a mile is 1/4 of a mile
							and 50 Rods exactly— I was out 1 hour and 49 minutes, at 17 minutes to a

							quickened my pace, and I walked away the numbness of my left hand
							fingers; but not entirely that of the right hand fingers. <persRef

						<p>Short walk of forty minutes before breakfast; and then devoted the whole

							out of the ground— The first leaves of most of them are altogether
							different from those which afterwards come out; and from my observations
							hitherto, I cannot discern of what kind the tree will be from its first

							chesnut Oak Acorn with intent to observe how they will severally come

							to plough up the ground on the Eastern border where none of the plants
							from the seed of 1830 has survived; though there are nearly three

							The Doctor did not apprehend any further effect upon her of this

							with excessive sickness, faintings and cramps— I sent for him again and

						<p><date>20. V. </date>Monday— From Boston to Providence— Steamer Benjamin

						<p>After breakfasting at the Tremont-house, I took my seat in the Pilot
							Stage to Providence— Its departure was at half past six of the morning,
							and at Noon the passengers passed from the Stage into the Steamboat
							Benjamin Franklin <persRef ref="coleman-robert">Captain

								ref="stewart-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stuart</persRef>
							and her daughter <persRef ref="stewart-delia2">Delia</persRef> were of
							the number. It had rained all Night, and continued to rain till past ten
							of the morning— The Stage leaked from the top from which I received a
							dripping of the moisture—and it drove me to change my seat— In the
							Steam-boat there were a multitude of passengers of whom I recognized
							prior acquaintance in <persRef ref="ward-thomas">T. W. Ward</persRef>,
							Treasurer of Harvard University, last week returned from a short visit
							to England, and <persRef ref="arnott-thomas">Thomas Arnott</persRef> a

								ref="u">Son</persRef> of <persRef ref="parker-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Parker</persRef>
							of Boston was one— He said he had been several years an inhabitant of
							the State of New-York: in the interior, on the borders of Hudson’s
							river— There was much conversation this evening among the Passengers
							upon religious and political topics in which I took a part. Much
							discussion upon the controverted character and divinity of Christ, and
							much upon the Slave question, the prospects of universal emancipation,
							and the intellectual capacity of the African race. These Conversations
							were continued till past midnight—to the annoyance of one whom they
							roused from seep in his cot— A wind at N.N.W. had before Sunset swept
							off all the clouds, and the evening was smooth and mild with clear
							moonlight.</p>

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye, whose devotion to my dear

								Cazneau Palfrey</persRef> the Pastor of the unitarian church here to
							unite in the Solemnities, but on consulting with the two other Clergymen

							to them— The ordinary funeral arrangements were referred to the
							Undertaker <persRef ref="u">Kripps</persRef>—and a short obituary notice
							was sent to the Offices of the National Intelligencer, the Telegraph and
							the Globe— It was published in the Telegraph of this afternoon— I wrote
							to my beloved wife, and to <persRef key="adams-charles2">my only
								surviving Son</persRef>, communicating to them this heavy
							dispensation of the Providence of God. I controuled as far as I was able
							the unutterable anguish of my own Soul, endeavouring to sooth the yet
							more aggravated affliction of his widowed wife— Reduced and emaciated by
							sickness herself, she suffers in body and in mind; above all at her own
							inability to render to her beloved and affectionate husband in the
							extremes of his last illness the tender attentions and good Offices
							which smooth the pillow of death— <persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson
								Hellen</persRef> called here in the course of the day—and <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-william">William C. Greenleaf</persRef>— Walter
							Hellen went to <persRef ref="hellen-adelaide">his mother</persRef> at

							pass here the Night— He also wrote at my request to my Son Charles.</p>

						<p>The day passed like that of yesterday almost unconsciously to myself—with
							an agonizing heart, a perpetually aggravating sense of the calamity that
							has befallen me—an inability to realize its extent—a galling
							consciousness that it can never be repaired, and an unceasing
							recollection of all the precious services that <persRef
								key="adams-john2">my darling child</persRef> had rendered me—his
							discharge of all his filial duties, his kindness, his affection, his
							devotion to all my interests, and all my desires—the uncomplaining
							patience with which he has endured misfortune, sickness and
							disappointment the hardness of his fate, and the meekness with which he
							has submitted to it—even his infirmities— Oh! let me not murmur at the
							will of God— Let me cast myself and him upon the mercies of an
							omnipotent creator and preserver; let me believe, that for suffering
							upon Earth there is compensation in Heaven, and that there, the tears of
							sorrow are wiped away, and that every virtue shall be blessed with its
							reward— My child—my child— In the bosom of your God, may never ending
							joys—joys unspeakable and full of glory, cancel all the sufferings, of
							which your portion was so great here below, and may it one day be the
							blessed destiny of your Parents to enjoy them with you. <pb n="428"

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Haskell</persRef>, in watching over
							his body— The arrangements are all made for its preservation so that it
							may hereafter be transported according to his desire to Quincy— I saw
							him, while he was yet living and in the last struggle of life— I saw,
							and kissed his lifeless brow yet warm and all but animate— I saw him
							last evening laid out in his shroud, and this day in the last receptacle
							of his form— The brow was placid in death as it had been in life— There
							was no trace of agony upon it; nor had there been throughout his illness
							a disordered muscle upon his face— Bodily disease and silent Sorrow were
							all that preyed upon his form, and his death was tranquil—undisturbed by
							any conscious pang of voluntary wrong— <persRef ref="hawley-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> the Clergyman,

							of the duties which the decease of his brother has brought upon me, and
							for the entire performance of which I implore a blessing from above—but

						<p>We had but just returned home last Evening, when there set in a heavy
							rain, which had been gathering in the clouds the whole day— It continued
							all Night and the greater part of this day. In the middle of the Night
							we were alarmed by a fire in the house, first discovered by the smoke
							making its way into the upper chamber where <persRef ref="hellen-mary"
								>Mary</persRef> was lying unable to close her eyes in sleep— She
							roused <persRef ref="goode-eleanor">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Good</persRef>, who on going down to the kitchen found the mulatto
							man <persRef ref="u">Ball</persRef>, with his hat on—stooping over the
							table asleep— The table-cloth burnt to a cinder, the table on fire and
							blazing, and Ball’s coat <pb n="429" type="ms"/>sleeve kindling— M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Good extinguished the fire; but it was an
							hour or more before the house, was clear of smoke, and there was a
							second alarm before the morning, excited by the agitation of the first,
							but without the same cause— My spirit is awed even to superstitious
							terror, by these menaces of divine chastisement, mingled with the actual
							infliction of so many Scourges— I bless the hand that withholds the
							uplifted blow, and I supplicate for mercy— This morning I attended at
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, and took my
							Grand-child, <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny</persRef> with me—
								<persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef> also
							accompanied me— <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the morning prayer, for the 22<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> Sunday after Trinity, and delivered a
							short exposition upon Romans 8.31—“What shall we then say to these
							things? If God be for us, who can be against us?— 32. He, that spared
							not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with
							him also freely give us all things? 33 who shall lay any thing to the
							charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth. 34. Who is he that
							condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather that is risen again, who
							is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us
							35. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or
							distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril or sword?
							36. As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long; we
							are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. 37. Nay, in all these things
							we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. 38 For I am
							persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities
							nor Powers, nor things present, nor things to come 39 Nor height; nor
							depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the
							Love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord”— The text itself is a
							Sermon, and the exposition could scarcely add to its impressiveness.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley administered the communion—of
							which I also partook. In the afternoon I attended the Presbyterian
							Church, and heard <persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Smith</persRef> from Luke 16.31. “And he said unto him,
							if they hear not <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef> and the Prophets,
							neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.” M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith’s argument was the all sufficiency
							of the Scriptures for salvation— In the evening I read the first Sermon
							of the Volume sent me last Summer, by <persRef ref="colman-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry Colman</persRef>, on Nature and
							Revelation, and the second, upon Christianity as taught in the

							answered a Letter which I had yesterday received, from <persRef

							written last Tuesday—and I received this day, one from my Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, and one from <persRef

						<p>My old morning walk, before breakfast, of four miles, round the Capitol

						<p>My morning walk is every day the same— A melancholy pilgrimage in which
							to divert my thoughts from the bitterness of my misfortunes, I am
							compelled to seek refuge in errant trifling— That walk has often been
							attended with pleasing and promising contemplations of hope and joy—

							occupations suitable for me— But I could barely bring up the arrears of
