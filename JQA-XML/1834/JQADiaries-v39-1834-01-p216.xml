						<p>Walking to the Capitol this morning, I overtook <persRef
								ref="davis-john4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Davis</persRef>, and as he was to dine with me, told him I should be
							glad to have some conversation with him, this Evening, upon matters of
							public interest, to which he agreed— At the House there was a
							skirmishing debate on the question whether J. Davis’s Resolution, with
							the Memorial of <persRef ref="fletcher-noah">Noah Fletcher</persRef>
							should or should not be taken up for consideration— The memorial had
							been received on the thirtieth day of the Session— There is a rule of
							the house that after the first 30 days Petitions and Memorials shall be
							received only on the first day of the House’s sitting every week— But
							the rule applies only to the reception, and not to the consideration of
							them. By another Rule of the House Resolutions must be over one day, and
							that Rule was enforced, in this case— Davis’s Resolution thus passing
							over the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> day, the <persRef
								ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker</persRef> now decided that it could
							not be called up before Monday, the day fixed for receiving Petitions—
							This was one of Stevenson’s arbitrary extensions of a Rule, for the mere
							wantonness of party Spirit— It was contested by several members, and
								<persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> appealed from
							it, but afterwards withdrew his appeal, well knowing that it was useless
							to appeal to a majority, from a decision made to favour a majority— The
							Speaker’s immediate object was to give <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>Polk</persRef> the floor, to finish his Speech in answer to
								<persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie</persRef>, upon the motion
							to instruct the Committee of Ways and Means to report a joint Resolution
							for depositing the revenues to be hereafter collected in the Bank of the
							United States. Accordingly Polk took the floor, nearly half an hour <pb
								n="217" type="ms"/>before the usual time for proceeding to the
							orders of the day— He spoke nearly three hours, and his speech is said
							to have given entire satisfaction to his party— It consisted of a
							repetition of all the matter which has been gathering for years against
							the Bank, sufficiently methodised, and delivered with fluency— But the
							galleries were empty, and there was scarcely a quorum in the house— Polk
							is the leader of the Administration in the House, and is just qualified
							for an eminent County-Court lawyer—par negotüs nec supra— He has no
							wit—no literature; no point of argument—no gracefulness of delivery—no
							elegance of language—no philosophy—no pathos—no felicitous
							impromptus—nothing that can constitute an Orator but confidence,
							fluency, and labour— When he finished several members rose and addressed
							the Speaker—among them, <persRef ref="moore-samuel2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore</persRef> a new member from
							Virginia, said to be a man of talents—and <persRef ref="binney-horace">H.
								Binney</persRef>, who moved that the House should adjourn, and has
							of course the floor for Monday. We had all the Massachusetts delegation
							in both Houses to dine with us— I invited them all together, for the
							sake of promoting good-fellowship among them; but as they do by no means
							harmonize in political Sentiments I was apprehensive the party would be
							stiff, and cold—but it was quite otherwise— I avoided all conversation
							that could lead to unpleasant collisions and we talked about Egyptian
							Hieroglyphics, and Militia-Laws, and <persRef ref="king-rufus">Rufus
								King</persRef>— When the rest of the company went away, John Davis
							remained, and I had a long conversation with him upon the state of
							Affairs in Massachusetts.— I told him that I had sent a Letter to the
								<persRef ref="calhoun-william">Speaker of the House of
								Representatives of the State</persRef>, withdrawing my name from the
							election in the House, and that I had done it, with a sincere wish that
							he might be chosen the Governor. I told him also that there had been
							approaches between the Antimasonic and the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Jackson</persRef> parties to combine with a view to exclude him
							from the election— That I had been urged to concur in this movement,
							which I had positively refused to do. That its object had been to unite
							the members of the two parties in the House, to elect <persRef
								ref="morton-marcus">judge Morton</persRef> and me in the House, with
							the understanding that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morton should be
							chosen by the Senate— That this was all done under an impression that
							he, Davis, was so inveterately hostile to the Anti-masonic cause; that
							they could expect no favour from him; an opinion in which I had not
							concurred— That I was myself in favour of his election, and believed I
							was rendering a service to the public by apprising him of the course
							which affairs appeared to be taking, and believing it would depend upon
							the policy which he should pursue, whether the Antimasons should be
							reunited to the Antient National Republican party, or whether they
							should go entirely over to Jacksonism— That I was very solicitous to
							accomplish this reunion believing it indispensable to restore to us the
							influence in the general affairs of the union which by our internal
							divisions we had lost; and which would be worse than lost, if the People
							of the State should be delivered over to Jacksonism. He thanked me for
							the communication, and said that his views and opinions with regard to
							Masonry had been misunderstood— That he never had been a Mason, and
							thought the Masonic pageantry very ridiculous— And also that the conduct
							of some of its members had been very wicked— That he had accepted the
							nomination of the Worcester Convention with extreme reluctance, and only
							because the responsibility of breaking up entirely the party had been
							presented to him as the alternative— That he had wished to retire from
							public life altogether; but if he was to continue in it he should much
							prefer his station here to that of being Governor of the State— That he
							felt as strong and anxious a desire as I could to restore harmony among
							the People of our own State, and felt as forcibly as I did, the
							necessity of that harmony to obtain for us any influence in the Affairs
							of the Nation. <pb n="218" type="ms"/>That he particularly desired that
							this Masonic Controversy should be amicably adjusted—and had spoken to
							two or three of our delegation, members of the fraternity and reasonable
							men. They were perfectly disposed to give up and abandon the
							Institution—and he had received yesterday a Letter from <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>, mentioning that he
							had urged upon some respectable members of the order the necessity that
							they should give up the Grand Lodge altogether; and that they had
							promised to make the proposal, and he had hopes would succeed in it— I
							said I heartily wished they might. But that there would be a Memorial to
							the Legislature, praying for a Legislative investigation of the Oaths,
							Obligations and Penalties of Masonry, and also of the Affairs of the
							Grand Lodge at Boston, and whether they had not forfeited their charter—
							That the investigation had been defeated by a disagreement between the
							two Houses at the last Session of the Legislature— That I presumed the
							investigation would be pressed with great earnestness by the Antimasons
							in the present Legislature, and if it should be inflexibly resisted by
							the National Republicans it would totally alienate from them all the
							Anti-masons of the State and ultimately throw them into the Scale of
							Jacksonism— I added that I must in candour tell him that the Anti-masons
							had been very ill-treated by the National Republicans as a party, and if
							there was any expectation or wish to restore them to friendly feeling it
							must be by a different course of conduct towards them— He assented to
							this— He said that if he should be elected he would see and converse
							with me again before he should leave this City.</p>

							said I would cheerfully render to the Clerks any service in my power but
							should wish to see their memorial before I presented it.— He said that
							he had told them so; and their Committee would wait upon me with the
							memorial— At the House, the day was occupied with private business—
							Several bills were called up and referred successively to two Committees
							of the whole— To the first the <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew"
								>Speaker</persRef> called <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis

							excused— The Speaker was very much nettled; but said “certainly—the
							Gentleman from North-Carolina shall be excused”—and then called <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> of Tennessee to the Chair— The rule
							of the House is that not more than three Bills shall be referred to one
							Committee of the whole; but the practice is to refer six eight or ten—
								<persRef ref="ellsworth-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							<pb n="219" type="ms"/>came into the Hall, and I invited him to go home

						<p>The House adjourned over to Monday— I received this Morning a short
							Letter from my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> with
							his quarterly account to the close of the year— I was roving from noon
							till 3 O’Clock—visited <persRef ref="archer-william">W. S.

							and the Resolutions introduced by <persRef ref="barbour-john">John S.

							and left a Card for <persRef ref="preston-william2">M<hi

							left a card at <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								M’Daniel’s</persRef> for <persRef ref="patton-john">John M.
								Patton</persRef> member of the House from Virginia, who very
							unexpectedly paid me a visit on New-Year’s day. Returning home, I met
							one of the Clerks who had been to my house, with the Memorial for the
							increase of their Salaries— Soon after I came home, one of them,
								<persRef ref="queen-rt">R. T. Queen</persRef> brought me the
							Memorial and left it with me— I promised to present it on Monday
							Morning— He said they wished it might be referred to a select Committee
							rather than to the Committee of Ways and Means, the Chairman of which
								<persRef ref="polk-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Polk</persRef>, had been spoken to, and was favourably disposed to
							the Memorial, but thought that Committee so burthened with other and
							indispensable business, that they would not have time for attending to
							this.— He said they were aware also that my time would be so much
							absorbed with other business, that they could not expect I should be
							willing to act as Chairman of a Select Committee upon the memorial, but
							that the Speaker might probably appoint another Chairman— I took the
							memorial; and told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Queen, I would do for
							the Memorialists the best that would be in my power— <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef>, now a Senator from New Jersey, came and spent a
							couple of the hours of this Evening with me. We had a free conversation
							upon the present state of political affairs— <persRef key="clay-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> has introduced
							into the Senate two Resolutions relating to the removal of the Deposits—
							The first assailing the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President</persRef>, and the second declaring the reasons assigned
							by the <persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>
							for the removal of the Deposits were not satisfactory— I said to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard that I thought the first
							unnecessary, and an incumbrance. He said he had some doubts whether he
							should vote for it without some modification; and perhaps M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay himself might withdraw it— He said he
							was preparing to speak on the subject, and intended <pb n="220"
								type="ms"/>to follow immediately after <persRef ref="benton-thomas"
								>Benton</persRef> who is answering Clay, and has not yet finished.
							He asked what ought further to be done. I said the question rather was
							what could be done— I thought the men renominated as Government
							Directors ought to be rejected— He said he should vote against them—next
							I said they ought to reject the nomination of R. B. Taney, as Secretary
							of the Treasury, when it should be sent in— He said he should vote
							against him— As for anything further I thought time should be taken to
							consider— There seemed a probability that the great mischief would work
							its own cure. I spoke to him of a gross misrepresentation in Benton’s
							Speech giving credit to Jackson, as if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had
							introduced the guards requiring the Signatures of the Secretary,
							Comptroller and Register of the Treasury as well as that of the
							Treasurer to all warrants for drawing money from the Treasury: and
							observed that the Telegraph Newspaper in commenting upon Benton’s speech
							had repeated this misrepresentation, but claimed the credit of it for
								<persRef ref="ingham-samuel">Ingham</persRef>— He said it was a
							misrepresentation, and he would rectify it in his speech— The river was
							partly frozen over last night, and Snow is threatened.</p>

						<p>The Season is coming in its severity, and the Thermometer this morning
							after Sunrise was at 6. Cold is always one of my disqualifiers for
							writing, and the instant I lose my pen my diary and correspondence fall
							into arrears, and my mind into confusion. I received this morning a
							Letter from <persRef ref="pentland-ephraim">E. Pentland</persRef>
							Recorder of the City of Pittsburgh with a Volume of the By-Laws and
							Ordinances of that City; and some remarks upon my Letter of 14. December
							last to <persRef ref="moorhead-james">James Moorhead</persRef>— I rode
							to the House owing to the intenseness of the cold— The <persRef
								ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker</persRef> offered the floor to
								<persRef ref="binney-horace">H. Binney</persRef>— But he waved the
							privilege to allow time for the States to be called over for petitions.
							I presented the Memorial of <pb n="221" type="ms"/>the subordinate
							Clerks in all the Executive Departments, signed by 219 names, praying
							for an increase of their Salaries— I stated that I presented this
							Memorial not as a Representative of the State of Massachusetts, but at
							the request of a very respectable body of men, and as it was upon a
							matter considerably general interest I requested it might be read, that
							the members of the house might be apprized of its contents. It was read,
							and I then moved that it should be referred to the Committee of Ways and
							Means—observing that all I presumed that the Memorialists desired only a
							fair examination of the merits of their claim— That was at least all
							that I desired— A member from Pennsylvania, suggested that it should be
							referred to the Committee on the expenses of the Departments, but there
							is no such Committee and he made no Motion— It was referred to the
							Committee of Ways and Means— As the Petitions were called up, <persRef
								ref="lewis-dixon">Dickson H. Lewis</persRef> of Alabama asked leave
							to offer a Resolution of enquiry—objection was made and he asked the
							suspension of the rule, which was carried— He moved a Resolution to
							arrest the operations of the United States troops, to remove the
							settlers on Indian Lands in Alabama, and supported it by a violent
							speech of three quarters of an hour against the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>, and the <persRef
								ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of War</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="stewart-andrew">Stewart</persRef> of Pennsylvania moved to lay
							it on the table; but withdrew the motion— <persRef ref="jones-seaborn"
								>Seaborn Jones</persRef> of Georgia, sustained Lewis by a very
							animated Speech— <persRef ref="mckinley-john">M’Kinley</persRef> of
							Alabama to get rid of the Resolution moved to postpone the consideration
							of it till to-morrow— There was some discussion what the effect of this
							would be— The Speaker said it would be to throw it in the rear of all
							the orders of the day— The question was then taken by yeas and nays and
							carried 110 to 107— The House adjourned about 3— I saw <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>, and told him I wished to have some conversation
							with him concerning the state of Affairs both here and at home— I had
							engaged to dine with him to-morrow, and he asked me to stay with him an
							hour or two after the rest of the company shall have retired; to which I
							agreed— I spoke also to <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef>, and asked them to
							republish an Article from <persRef ref="niles-hezekiah"
								>Niles’s</persRef> last Register, concerning their affairs— And I

								Banks</persRef> and <persRef ref="denny-harmar">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Denny</persRef> members of the House

						<p>The coldest night of the Season hitherto— Probably the coldest Night of

							Nationals had from 300 to 330— The average majority was just equal to

								ref="foster-thomas2">Foster</persRef> of Georgia, asked leave to
							offer a Resolution, that after this day the first hour after the Meeting

							proceeding to the question about the <persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke"
								>Secretary of the Treasury’s</persRef> <pb n="222" type="ms"/>reasons for removing the deposits— Objection was

								<persRef ref="grennell-george">G. Grennell j<hi rend="superscript"

								ref="webster-caroline">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Webster</persRef>, and <persRef ref="webster-fletcher">his eldest
								Son</persRef>, were at table— I remained with him after the rest of
							the company went away—upwards of an hour— I told him that in declining
							the competition for the election in the House of Representatives, it was
							my purpose, if possible to bring back to the National Republican party,
							the Antimasonic portion of it. that the tendency of the party was to go
							over to Jacksonism— That they had been encouraged to this by Antimasonic
							opinions and perhaps pledges given by judge Morton, and his friends, and
							that they were prejudiced against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis,
							upon the belief that he was entirely under the influence of Masonry—
							That I was persuaded they might be induced almost universally to support
							the Administration of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis, if it should
							disentangle itself from the Masonic faction— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Webster concurred altogether in these opinions; and said
							that all the other members of the delegation (excepting <persRef
								ref="baylies-william">Baylies</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="osgood-gayton">Osgood</persRef>) concurred with them also— Of
							the Delegation, <persRef ref="bates-isaac">Bates</persRef>
							<persRef ref="choate-rufus">Choate</persRef>, Grennell, and Silsbee are
							Masons, and are all willing to abolish the Institution— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster told me his own impressions upon
							Masonry which had always been unfavourable; said <persRef
								ref="webster-ebenezer">his father</persRef> had always disliked the
							Institution, and had brought him up in the dislike of it.— He told me an
							anecdote of a man who had removed from New-Hampshire into the State of
							New-York; and who as early as the year 1817. had written to him
							concerning the extraordinary power of Masonry in that State. He said he
							perfectly concurred in every thing that I had published upon Masonry,
							except perhaps a part of my Letter to <persRef ref="cowell-benjamin"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cowell</persRef>— I said that I
							could not expect that all I had published should meet the concurrence of
							any one; but that the Committee of the Worcester Convention, to assail
							my Letter to Cowell had been obliged grossly to misrepresent it. He said
							that was altogether unjustifiable. I said that in my Address to the
							People, I had assigned my Reasons for the part I had taken in the
							Masonic controversy— The people would judge of them and I was willing to
							abide by their decision— I said the Surrender by the Grand Lodge of
							Massachusetts of their Act of incorporation, could not possibly satisfy
							the Antimasons, for that in the Memorial itself accompanying the
							Surrender there is a distinct and avowed assertion of prerogatives,
							transcending the Authority of the Legislature and even of the People— He
							said they would go further— That all the Masons in the delegation here
							would join in recommending the total abandonment of the institution—
							That he saw no reason to object to an act making all extra-judicial
							Oaths whether of Antimasonry, or about the Sea-Serpent <unclear>penal</unclear>— He said
							he thought too that by electing one or two distinguished Anti-Masons as
							members of the Governors <pb n="223" type="ms"/>Council, a conciliatory
							disposition might be manifested; and he named <persRef
								ref="fuller-philo">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bailey</persRef>— I said that would certainly be a measure both
							just, and conciliatory. We then spoke of the state of affairs here, and
							the controversy between the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President of
								the United States</persRef> and the Bank— He said the Committee of
							Finance of the Senate of which he was Chairman would make a report on
							that subject—that he did not expect there would be a shade of difference
							between his opinion and mine in this case, and that his object will be
							to call upon the Administration, to shew what they propose to do with
							the public Treasure after consummating the removal of the deposits and
							extinguishing the Bank of the United States— He enlarged much on this
							topic, but I have no time to detail the conversation—</p>

								Williamson</persRef> came this morning before the Meeting of the

							Meade consistently with the obligation of my duties I would readily do

						<p>Going to the House this morning, I met <persRef ref="kent-joseph">D<hi

							from Maryland, who told me that <persRef ref="tazewell-littleton"
								>Littleton Waller Tazewell</persRef> had been elected Governor of
							Virginia, an event considered of formidable import to the present
							Administration of the General Government— Tazewell published last Winter
							a long series of Essays against the Proclamation— Tazewell has boxed the
							compass of politics from Federalism to nullification— There were three
							ballots before the election was completed, so that he had little more
							than one third of the votes at first, but his election is the signal for
							raising the Standard of Virginia against <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Jackson</persRef>. Its first operation against him will however be
							in the matter of the Bank; and the course of his Administration is now
							so detestable, that, all other questions of public interest sink into
							insignificance, in comparison with that of arresting him in his career
							of ruin— <persRef ref="binney-horace">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Binney</persRef> took the floor again for an hour and a half, <pb
								n="224" type="ms"/>and closed one of the most powerful Speeches, for
							sound argument, correct principle, and honourable sentiment that ever
							was delivered in Congress—immediately after he finished, <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> with a short
							flourish of emphatic malice and nonsense moved the previous question,
							but could not carry it. The vote by tellers was 89 to 108 Cambreleng
							then declared his intention to reply to Binney, but the day being far
							advanced he would wish to postpone the further consideration of the
							subject till next week. The House passed the consideration of other
							business— Bills from the Senate were taken up, had their first and
							second readings and were committed. The Naval Appropriation Bill
								<persRef ref="mcintire-rufus">M’Intire</persRef> of Maine in the
							Chair of Committee of the whole on the Union, an Amendment from the
							Senate was discussed— <persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef>, Chairman
							of the Committee of Ways and Means proposed disagreeing to it—some
							debate arose thereon, in which I took part: but before the question was
							decided, I was called out of my place by <persRef ref="seaton-william"
								>W. W. Seaton</persRef>, to urge me to deliver the monumental
							discourse in honour of <persRef ref="washington-george"
								>Washington</persRef>, upon the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of
							next Month— I declined for want of leisure, and upon prudential
							Considerations—it being impossible to pronounce the appropriate praise
							of Washington, without thereby pronouncing the Satire of the present
							times—which would necessarily bring upon me a charge of indecorum— While
							I was talking with Seaton the Naval Appropriation Bill passed from
							Committee of the whole into the House, and then was postposed— We had
							company to dine— <persRef ref="archer-william">Archer</persRef> did not
							come till the dinner was nearly over, and remained an hour after the
							rest of the company went away—</p>

						<p>Miscellaneous business in the house— <persRef ref="selden-dudley">Dudley
								Selden</persRef> a new member from the City of New-York had offered
							a Resolution, proposing to pay off certain 5 per Cent Stocks, and to
							sell some of the Bank Stock of the Public for that purpose— It was
							changed into a reference to the Committee of Ways and Means to enquire—
							There was a small skirmish of debate upon it this day, after which it
							was adopted by yeas and nays 126 to 81. The chief incident of the
							debate, was the braying of <persRef ref="lane-amos">Lane</persRef> a new
							member from Indiana, upon the recovery of the lost Treasury of the
							United States— I voted for Selden’s Resolution, because he appears to be
							a promising young man, and has on the deposit question shewn symptoms of
							revolt against the Scullions of the kitchen—for which he has been duly
							<unclear>besmutted</unclear> in their newspapers— The deposit question came up, but
								<persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cambreleng</persRef> wished for further time of preparation to reply
							to <persRef ref="binney-horace">Binney</persRef>, and gave up the floor
							till next week. The house passed to the consideration of private
							business— There was a Bill for placing sundry persons on the invalid
							pension list—generally from the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of
							January 1832. but <persRef ref="combs-leslie">Leslie Combs</persRef> of
							Kentuckey at 20 dollars a month from 1813. It was in truth a gratuity of
							about 5000 dollars, which had crept unnoticed to the third reading—
								<persRef ref="gilmer-george">Gilmer</persRef> of Georgia, now
							started a debate upon it, which soon assumed a party complexion. Combs
							in the war of 1812 was Captain of a band of Spies and had performed
							active and efficient service— He had suffered hardships like others—had
							received a wound in his shoulder, and bruises at the elbows— But he is
							now a man under 40. and to <pb n="225" type="ms"/>all appearance as
							sound and vigorous as any other man of his age. Of late years he has
							made himself very notorious as an electioneering partizan against
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>, and in favour of
								<persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>— The debate turned upon the question of his
							disability, which was affirmed by <persRef ref="allan-chilton"
								>Allan</persRef>, <persRef ref="chilton-thomas">Chilton</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="love-james">Love</persRef>, and denied by <persRef
								ref="hawes-albert">Hawes</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lyon-chittenden">Lyon</persRef>— There were certificates both
							of disability (not very conclusive) and of meritorious service. Gilmer
							finally moved to strike out 1813 and insert 1832 for the commencement of
							the pension, which was carried by yeas and nays 168 to 20— The question
							was not taken on the Bill— The House adjourned over to Monday.</p>

						<p>At the House I sent round a notice to <persRef
								ref="huntington-jabez;denny-harmar;dickerson-philemon;martindale-henry;osgood-gayton;davis-warren;corwin-thomas;mccomas-william"
								>the members of the Committee of Manufactures</persRef>, to meet at
							11. to-morrow Morning— <persRef ref="davis-john4">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Davis</persRef> called me aside
							in the Lobby, behind the Pillars, and told me he had received from the
							Committee of the Massachusetts Legislature the notification of his
							Election as Governor of the State— And that he should go to-morrow— He
							wished me therefore to give him my views of the present state of
							Affairs— I said that there was little to add to what I had already said
							in my last conversation with him— There were two things which seemed to
							me highly important—one was to reunite the Anti Masons with the National
							Republican party, to support his Administration— The other was to obtain
							a decisive action of our Legislature upon the Deposit-Bank and Treasury
							question— That to satisfy the Antimasons, a Legislative investigation of
							the Oaths, Obligations, and Penalties of Freemasonry, and an Act of the
							Legislature, annexing penalties to the Administration of Extrajudicial
							Oaths, would be necessary—and I believed the Antimasons generally would
							concur in passing Resolutions by the Legislature disapproving of the
							removal of the deposits— The primary purpose would be to conciliate the
							Antimasons, or the alternative was infallible— They would go over to
							Jacksonism— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis repeated his assurance
							to me that he was under no pledge to Masons or Masonry—and that he
							should be desirous of conciliating the Antimasons— He thought it would
							not be proper for him to recommend to the Legislature any particular
							measure against Masonry, because it might seem like courting the favour
							of his opponents, but he should be willing to have a Law enacted to make
							the Administration of extra-judicial Oaths penal, and he should be glad
							if one or two Antimasons should be elected as members of the Council— He
							said the House of Representatives had sent to the Senate the name of
								<persRef ref="lathrop-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lathrop</persRef>, as one of the Candidates for the Lieutenant
							Governor’s Office, but that is nothing— In the House M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis’s Resolution for the restoration of
								<persRef ref="fletcher-noah">Noah Fletcher</persRef> as a
							subordinate clerk in the service of the House was debated— Davis made a
							short and rather feeble Speech in support of it— <persRef
								ref="clay-clement">C. C. Clay</persRef> answered him with common
							place, about rotation in office, and much invidious matter. <persRef
								ref="chilton-thomas">Chilton</persRef> of Kentucky wasted many, and
								<persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">E. Whittlesey</persRef> of Ohio a
							few words in behalf of Fletcher, and the Resolution was laid on the
							table by a vote of 126 to 83— Petitions were then called over— Many
							Resolutions were offered, but objected to. Two or three times motions to
							suspend the rule failed— <persRef ref="ashley-william">Ashley</persRef>
							of Missouri was pettish, at the rejection of that motion when made by
							him— <persRef ref="mckennan-thomas">M’Kennan</persRef> of Pennsylvania
							offered a Resolution to purchase 300 copies of <persRef
								ref="elliot-jonathan">Elliots</persRef> debates on the
							Constitution—to which were added by way of Amendment a volume of the
							Land Laws, and <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">Seaton’s</persRef> Register of Debates—for the
							use of the new Members of the present Congress—those of the last
							Congress having provided themselves with them already— <persRef
								ref="pinckney-henry">H. L. Pinckney</persRef> a new member from
							South-Carolina solemnly protested against this as unconstitutional
							because an expenditure of money required the concurrence of the Senate,
							and the approbation of the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President</persRef>— Clay of Alabama and <persRef
								ref="coulter-richard">Coulter</persRef> of Pennsylvania, supported
							Pinckneys objection and vapoured about the Constitution— <persRef
								ref="sutherland-joel">Sutherland</persRef> said a few words in
							favour of the Resolution, and <persRef ref="wardwell-daniel"
								>Wardwell</persRef> of New-York moved an Amendment which M’Kennan
							accepted, that <pb n="227" type="ms"/>instead of 300 copies there should
							be only a number sufficient to supply the members of the new Congress,
							not members of the last— <persRef ref="hawes-albert">Hawes</persRef>
							asked Clay whether he had refused to accept the books purchased for the
							members of the last Congress— Clay did not answer. I observed that there
							was no constitutional difficulty, the object of the Resolution being
							only to contract a debt, for which the House singly was competent,
							although the appropriation for the payment must be made by Law with the
							concurrence of the Senate and President— The Resolution was adopted—
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> called and spent an hour with me this Evening. We
							went again over the subject of the condition of parties in
							Massachusetts— The Masons and Anti-masons, National Republicans and
							Jackson men— There was much repeated which had been said before; but
							nothing explicit as to the Masonic investigation, or to the enactment of
							a penal law against extra judicial Oaths— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Webster said he had drawn up and sent to <persRef ref="white-stephen"
								>Stephen White</persRef>, Resolutions to be proposed to the
							Legislature on the deposit and bank questions— He urged me very strongly
							to give my opinions on the subject, either in the form of a Speech or a
							Report, or a Letter to be published by my authority— He said the Senate
							would reject the nomination of Government Directors of the Bank— They
							would reject <persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">R. B. Taney</persRef> as
							Secretary of the Treasury—and they would pass a Resolution disapproving
							the removal of the deposits— They had only been waiting for the arrival
							of <persRef ref="clayton-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clayton</persRef> of Delaware—and he was expected to-morrow—</p>

								>Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> for Copies of the Instructions
							to the Collectors since the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							December last, respecting the execution of the Tariff Law of the last
							Session— Resolution adopted, and at Huntington’s motion the Chairman was
							directed to ask the Consideration of the Resolution this day— The Letter
							from James Keefe was a complaint at the inadequate duties upon
							Vermicellis and Macaronie, of which he is a manufacturer. The Committee
							adjourned to meet again next Tuesday at 11. In the House I offered the
							Resolution of the Committee— Objection was made to its being
							received—but withdrawn upon my moving a suspension of the Rule— The
							Resolution was adopted— Many other Resolutions were offered received by
							unanimous consent—one by me, calling on the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>, for a List of the
							Presents, deposited at the Department of State, received from foreign
							Governments by persons in the Service of the United States, and referred
							to in his Message of the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi

							consideration. At last upon a Resolution offered by <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef>, objection was made by
								<persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">E. Whittlesey</persRef> of Ohio—
								<persRef ref="foster-thomas2">Foster</persRef> of Georgia then
							offered a Resolution that excepting on the Fridays and Saturdays,
							devoted to private business, the debate upon the Secretary of the
							Treasury’s reasons for removing the deposits—should be taken up every
							day after one hour devoted to other business— This Resolution was
							adopted— The deposit question was then taken up, and <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">C. C. Cambreleng</persRef> made a Speech
							of an hour and a half, on the Banks of Scotland, and sundry other
							matters in answer to <persRef ref="binney-horace">H. Binney</persRef>. I
							never saw Cambreleng so thoroughly broken down— When he finished
								<persRef ref="moore-samuel2">Samuel <pb n="228" type="ms"/>M’Dowell

						<p>At the House. A Message was received from the <persRef

							a copy of the Instructions from the <persRef ref="maxcy-virgil"
								>Comptroller of the Treasury</persRef> to the Collectors of the

							Comptroller, on the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of December last—
							My call, by direction of the Committee of Manufactures was made and
							adopted by the House the day before yesterday— The corrective
							Instructions were not then given, and they were no doubt hastened by
							that call. The Message at my Motion, was ordered to lay on the table,
							and to be printed, and I requested the assistant Clerk to have it <pb
								n="229" type="ms"/>printed in the Intelligencer to-morrow morning—
								<persRef ref="chilton-thomas">Chilton’s</persRef> Resolution for
							extending the Pension system, and <persRef ref="bouldin-thomas"
								>Bouldin’s</persRef> Amendment to abolish it were taken up, and
								<persRef ref="peyton-balie">Bailey Peyton</persRef> a new member
							from Tennessee, spoke till the expiration of the hour, with some
							eloquence in behalf of the Pioneers, and sharp invective upon <persRef
								ref="burges-tristam">Burges</persRef> for his reflections upon them
							yesterday— Peyton did not finish— At one, the Deposit question came up,
							and <persRef ref="beardsley-samuel">Samuel Beardsley</persRef> of
							New-York, spoke till four against the U.S. Bank— His Speech was the
							strongest that has been made in the House on that side of the question—
							Much better than <persRef ref="polk-james">Polk’s</persRef>, and
							incomparably superior to <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
								>Cambreleng’s</persRef>— When Beardsley finished, four or five
							members were up to claim the floor— <persRef ref="jones-seaborn"
								>Jones</persRef> of Georgia obtained it—and the house adjourned— We
							had a company of ten Gentlemen to dine, and much amusing Conversation—
							There was an Evening party at <persRef ref="dickinson-julia">M<hi

						<p>Warm rainy weather which compelled me to ride to and from the Capitol— At
							the House the Pension Resolution was further discussed. <persRef
								ref="peyton-balie">Peyton</persRef> finished his invective upon
								<persRef ref="burges-tristam">Burges</persRef> who was absent
							yesterday but now present— <persRef ref="pinckney-henry">H. L.
								Pinckney</persRef> of South-Carolina, made an angry Speech against
							the Pension System, and burdensome taxation, and wasteful extravagance,
							but concluded by moving the indefinite postponement both of the
							Resolution and Amendment— The hour had expired— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Burges asked leave to say a few words in reply to Peyton,
							and by the curiosity of the House to hear what he would say obtained it.
							He brought in the fable of <persRef ref="hercules">Hercules</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="cacus">Cacus</persRef>, and the story of <persRef
								ref="samson">Samson</persRef> and his jaw-bone to slay the
							Philistines, and illustrations of his prior Sarcasms upon Indian Wars—
							Half the members of the House deserted their Seats and crowded up, round
							his place to hear him— He kept the house in a roar of laughter, for ten
							minutes; not a little at the expence of poor Peyton— When Burges sat
							down Peyton begged to be heard one moment in reply; but objection was
							made— <persRef ref="wilde-richard">Wilde</persRef> of Georgia moved a
							suspension of the rule, but the House refused. It was the day for
							private business.— <persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef>, Chairman of
							the Committee of Ways and Means, moved to take up the Amendments of the
							Senate to the partial Appropriation-Bill; which was at first refused—
							Sundry bills at the third reading were passed— Polk then renewed his
							motion to take up the Appropriation Bill, and succeeded—the Committee of
							the whole had reported a concurrence with the Amendment of the Senate,
							striking out a silly and nugatory restriction upon printing and the
							purchase of Books— Polk now moved anew—the nonconcurrence, upon which
							the debate was renewed— <persRef ref="everett-edward">Everett</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="bates-isaac">Bates</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="foot-samuel">Foot</persRef> of Connecticut, <persRef
								ref="whittlesey-elisha">Whittlesey</persRef> of Ohio, and myself
							shewed that the proviso stricken out, was insulting to the Senate,
							utterly impotent as a restriction, and fraudulent as holding out a
							colourable restriction upon expenditures, which it was really none— But
								<persRef ref="clay-clement">Clay</persRef> of Alabama sustained
							Polk, and <persRef ref="mckim-isaac">M’Kim</persRef> of Baltimore called
							for the Yeas and Nays— This made it a party question, and the Amendment
							of the Senate was non-concurred 112 to 70. <persRef ref="hawes-albert"
								>Hawes</persRef> voted against the party; but before the vote was
							declared said smiling, that he believed he had gone a little astray, and
							asked to change his vote— <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> of
							Tennessee, did not go astray but after the vote was declared I overheard
							him, discussing the question with another member, and warmly insisting
							that the proviso was inefficient and worse than useless— In Committee of
							the whole there had been a large majority for concurring <pb n="230"
								type="ms"/>in the Amendment of the Senate; but the call for the yeas
							and nays is the bugle <unclear>horn</unclear> of party, and never fails to rally the
							pack— The house adjourned just before 3. I went in to the
							Senate-chamber, and heard <persRef ref="rives-william">W. C.
								Rives</persRef>, Senator from Virginia, upon the deposit question,
							and against the Resolutions of <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>— He spoke till near
							five, and when he closed, the Senate immediately adjourned— I was unable
							to write or read this Evening; and retired before nine, to bed.</p>

						<p>At the Presbyterian Church this Morning I heard <persRef
								ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef>,
							from Luke 16.2 “And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I
							hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest
							be no longer steward.”— The discourse was delivered with great
							earnestness, and the argument that every individual should consider
							himself as a Steward of God, accountable to him, and sure after this
							life to be called to account by him was urged with an appearance of deep
							conviction and sincerity— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith gave
							notice that he should administer the communion this day fortnight, and
							that he should next Sunday deliver a discourse on the necessity of
							conforming to the will of God— And with an intense feeling verging upon
							dejection, he said he felt it to be his duty to use every exertion in
							his power to revive a Spirit, which for some time had appeared to cease
							to exist. Before dinner I had a visit from <persRef
								ref="hassler-ferdinand">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hassler</persRef>, who has come as usual to pass the winter at <pb
								n="231" type="ms"/>Washington. In the Summer he is employed upon
							what he calls the Coast survey, and he brought with him and shewed me
							his Map of Triangulation, from Springfield in New-Jersey to Mount Carmel
							near New Haven— Some of the distances between his Stations he says are
							of 35 Miles— After dinner at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							Church, <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read the Evening Service for the second Sunday
							after the Epiphany; and a short Sermon from Proverbs 4.18. “But the path
							of the just, is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto
							the perfect day.”— I retrieved my Diary, and was engaged all the Evening
							in writing to the <persRef ref="howe-elbridge">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi> Elbridge Gerry Howe</persRef>, upon the Sealed
							Obligation or cup of the fifth Libation. He has published at Plymouth,
							my correspondence with him last October.</p>

							praying indemnity for two fishing vessels belonging to him, taken by the

						<p><date>21. IV:30. </date>Tuesday— Snow</p>
						<p>There was a fall of Snow in the course of the last Night, about nine
							inches deep, after which it cleared off cold— I forgot the adjournment
							of the Committee of Manufactures to this Morning, and on riding to the
							Capitol, found the House, already in Session— After the Reports from the
							standing Committees, and the first and second readings, by their titles
							and Commitment to the Committee of the whole of sundry Bills reported by
							them, several Resolutions were introduced, with the unanimous consent of
							the House—among them one offered by me, requesting the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> to communicate to the
							House, if not inconsistent with the public interest; a copy of the
							Instructions to <persRef ref="rush-richard">Richard Rush</persRef>,
							Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Great-Britain of 6.
							November 1817. and of the order of the President to all the Ministers
							and Agents of the United States, abroad, forbidding them to accept
							Presents from any foreign State, unless previously authorised by
							Congress. This Resolution lays over of course one day— <persRef
								ref="chilton-thomas">Chilton’s</persRef> motion for the extension of
							the Pension-List, with <persRef ref="bouldin-thomas">Bouldin’s</persRef>
							Amendment, and <persRef ref="pinckney-henry">Pinckney’s</persRef> motion
							for indefinite postponement were taken up, and <persRef
								ref="hardin-benjamin">Hardin</persRef> of Kentucky made a Speech of
							about an hour, chiefly in reply to <persRef ref="burges-tristam"
								>Burges</persRef> whom he tomahawked without mercy, though he was
							not present: <pb n="232" type="ms"/>the hour expired while Hardin was
							speaking, but by a suspension of the rule he was allowed to finish his
							Speech— The House then resumed the deposit question, and <persRef
								ref="jones-seaborn">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones</persRef>
							of Georgia, finished his Speech against the Bank— When he closed, after
							three O’Clock there was a great contest for the floor which <persRef
								ref="archer-william">Archer</persRef> lost again— He is exceedingly
							anxious to speak soon—so that his Speech may tell in Virginia against
							that of <persRef ref="rives-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rives</persRef>— The whole subject is just now convulsing the people
							of Virginia. <persRef ref="huntington-jabez">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Huntington</persRef> of Connecticut obtained the floor
							and moved the adjournment— There came a message from the Senate,

							to the Appropriation-Bill; to which the house disagreed last Friday.—
								<persRef ref="rencher-abraham">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							brother of <persRef ref="stedman-john">the unfortunate person who
								perished</persRef> at the accident upon the Rail-road in New-Jersey
							last November— He said he was going to Philadelphia as the Administrator
							on his brother’s Estate, to receive a large amount of Jewelry, which he
							had with him, at the time of his decease, and which was now deposited at
							the Girard Bank. He said he was charged with the thanks of the family
							for the kindness I had shewn them on this occasion, and to ask for any
							advice that I might be disposed to give them— I told him I should be
							happy to render them any service in my power, and advised him to see
								<persRef ref="bartlett-william2">Lieutenant Bartlett</persRef> and
							ascertain from him what measures had been taken in the prosecution in
							behalf of <persRef ref="bartlett-harriet">his wife’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="u">Sister</persRef>— He said he would do that on his

						<p>At the House, immediately after the Journal was read <persRef
								ref="polk-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Polk</persRef> the
							Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means moved to take up the
							Appropriation Bill, in which the Senate yesterday <hi rend="italic"
								>adhered</hi> to the amendment to which the House had agreed last
							Friday— He moved that the House should insist upon their disagreement to
							the Amendment of the Senate, and ask a Conference— This gave rise to a
							debate of two hours, in which there were a multitude of Speakers, many
							points of order, all settled as usual according to the <persRef
								ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker’s</persRef> will, and one of them
							directly in the face of the Manual— Much temper was manifested, much
							petulance against the Senate, and very little reason— I spoke twice
							myself; but to little effect— The main question was whether a Conference
							could be asked by one of the two Houses, after the other has adhered to
							a point in difference between them. By the Parliamentary Rules in
							England such conference may be asked; but I asserted that in the
							practice of this Government no such conference had to my knowledge ever
							been held— The Speaker referred to one case 4. May 1826. when a
							Conference after adherence by the Senate, had been asked by the House,
							but declined by the Senate— <persRef ref="foot-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Foot</persRef> of Connecticut moved
							that the House do <hi rend="italic">recede</hi> from their disagreement
							to the Senate’s Amendment, and the Speaker after some beating about the
							bush, decided that the motion to recede, took precedence of that to
							insist and ask a Conference— The question upon the motion to recede was
							taken by yeas and nays and decided in the negative 87 to 127. Then
								<persRef ref="fillmore-millard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fillmore</persRef> of New-York <pb n="233" type="ms"/>asked for a
							division of Polk’s motion to insist, and ask a Conference— The House
							refused to insist, but agreed to ask a Conference, and ordered five
							Conferees on the part of the House to be appointed— This occupied the
							House till near 3. and then <persRef ref="huntington-jabez">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntington</persRef> who had the floor
							upon the deposit question, proposed to postpone it till to-morrow. The
							House then took up the Bills from the Senate, one of which after
							considerable debate among the members from Maryland, was recommitted to
							the Committee on the District of Columbia— Another was the Bill in which
								<persRef ref="combs-leslie">Leslie Combs</persRef> is introduced as
							a Pensioner— The time for the commencement of his Pension was changed
							from 1813 to 1832, but the question now was upon the passage of the Bill
							at all— After some debate it was further postponed till Friday, and the
							House adjourned at half past 3. <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">D. J.
								Pearce</persRef> shewed me a Letter from Providence Rhode-Island,

							Rhode-Island, by <persRef ref="hazard-b">B. Hazard</persRef>, though

							informed me, that the three Pittsburgh Newspapers which he gave me some

							reflecting upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ewing the Senator; and he
							said he would put the case hypothetically— His contemptuous rejection of
							the Instructions to himself, and his sallies against Ewing and Southard
							for disregarding theirs formed a contrast quite ludicrous.— The Report
							of the Conferees of the two Houses upon the disagreeing votes on the
							restriction clause in the Bill, making partial Appropriations for the
							year 1834; was presented and taken up for Consideration— Immediately
							after it was read I enquired of the <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew"
								>Speaker</persRef>, whether the reported compromise, embracing

							in order— The Speaker decided that it was—but that it might be made a

							in the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union— The House
							immediately went into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union.

							some question concerning brevet-rank; and hearing that I had written
							something on that subject he came to ask, if I would favour him with a

							Brevet rank—but it was a controversy raised by <persRef
								ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef> which had forced me to
							it, and he was severely treated in it— He had set himself in defiance to
							the Executive authority; and I should have been under the necessity of
							dismissing him from the army highly as I estimated his Services, if I
							had not myself been dismissed from my own Office— Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l</hi> Scott gave up the point, under <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">my Successor</persRef>, and since then had
							treated me with great courtesy— I had suppressed my manuscript, which I
							at one time had intended to publish: and retaining no resentment against
							General Scott, wished to forget all past animosities— If therefore I
							could lend him the manuscript, it must be confidentially, and with the
							understanding that he will consider all harsh commentary on Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l</hi> Scott as expunged— On that condition I
							promised to lend him the manuscript, if I find it here, for I am
							uncertain but it may be at Quincy— <persRef ref="ward-aaron">M<hi

						<p>My Diary still runs in arrear— I wrote 8 lines of verse without much

							and took the book up to the Capitol, and returned it to <persRef
								ref="ward-aaron">her father</persRef> in the House— I offered by

							House, who was not a member of the Last Congress. and it was adopted
							without opposition— <persRef ref="hawes-albert">Hawes</persRef> of
							Kentucky offered two Resolutions together. One that the Committee of
							Military Affairs enquire into the expediency of establishing an Armoury
							somewhere in Kentucky— And the other that the same Committee enquire
							into the expediency of abolishing the Military Academy at West-Point in
							the State of New-York— The question was first irregularly taken upon
							both the Resolutions together—without result. no Quorum voting— Then the
							question was again taken upon the first which was adopted without
							opposition— Then a Motion was made to lay on the Table the Resolution
							looking to the abolition of the West-Point Academy. The question was
							taken by yeas and nays, and the House refused to lay on the table 86 to
							102. I voted against laying on the table, differently from most of my
							Colleagues; but for reasons of my own. Then came a motion that a
							certificate of beggary should be required for admission to the
							Academy—which the Speaker rejected as not in order— <persRef

							of New-Hampshire moved that the reference should be not to the Military

							question upon the removal of the deposits followed, and <persRef
								ref="archer-william">William S. Archer</persRef> of Virginia took
							the floor. He spoke with great emotion for about an hour; but then
							became quite exhausted and sat down without finishing. The house
							adjourned about 2. O’Clock. Archer has been one of the most ardent and
							faithful friends of the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">present
								Administration</persRef>; but being withal a man of some principle
							he has been compelled to break away from his Associates, and he now is
							warm in opposition. But his agitation was too great for his slender

							went into the Senate-chamber, and there heard <persRef
								ref="sprague-peleg">P. Sprague</persRef> of Maine for an hour and a

						<p>I devoted part of the morning to the redemption of Diary arrears, and the
							rest to tracing in the Journals of Congress the History of the Army of
							the United States, from the Peace of 1783 to the Organization of the
							Government, under the Constitution of the United States. In the House
							the most remarkable movements were to revoke the decision of yesterday
							against the Report of the Committee of Conference— First, <persRef
								ref="speight-jesse">Speight</persRef> of North-Carolina, by
							unanimous consent of the House, offered a joint Resolution, for
							supplying the members of the present, who were not of the last Congress
							with all the books which had been supplied to the old Members—the
							expence to be paid from any monies in the Treasury not otherwise
							appropriated— A regular appropriation by Resolution—and it was hurried
							on till it came to the order of engrossment for a third Reading, which
							passed— <persRef ref="chilton-thomas">Chilton’s</persRef> Resolution was
							then taken up, and <persRef ref="hubbard-henry">Hubbard</persRef> of
							New-Hampshire made a foolish Speech in answer to that of <persRef
								ref="pinckney-henry">H. L. Pinckney</persRef>. Hubbard exceeded the
							hour, and there were manifestations of impatience in the House at the
							continuance of this debate, and <persRef ref="foster-thomas2"
								>Foster</persRef> threatened the previous question— I said I wanted
							five minutes to speak upon the Resolution itself, disincumbered of
							Amendments. Foster proposed to refer the Resolution to a Committee of
							the whole House, where debate cannot be arrested by the previous
							Question; to which I said I would not object— I asked the <persRef
								ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker</persRef>, if an Appropriation of
							money could be made by a joint-Resolution; he said yes, but that by a
							Rule of the House it must at the second reading go through a Committee
							of the whole— So he told the House that Speight’s Resolution had passed
							to a third reading by mistake, and it must be committed to a Committee
							of the whole— The House accordingly went into Committee—the Speaker
							called Foster of Georgia to the Chair, but he asked to be excused—
								<persRef ref="connor-henry">Connor</persRef> of North-Carolina was
							then called to the Chair, and in Committee of the whole Foster made a
							violent attack upon the Resolution itself. He moved that the <pb n="239"
								type="ms"/>Committee should rise; so that the Resolution should be
							referred to the Committee on the Library to ascertain the amount of the
							Appropriation. Upon taking the question there was found no Quorum— After
							some debate the Committee rose and reported the fact— And the
							consideration of the Resolution was postponed— <persRef
								ref="mcintire-rufus">M’Intire</persRef> of Maine then rose and moved
							the reconsideration of the vote yesterday rejecting the Report of the
							Committee of Conference. This too was postponed— The Speaker Stevenson
							then said that when he decided yesterday that the motion to recede, was
							not in order; because the House had already refused to recede, it had
							not occurred to him, that the refusal had been at a different Stage of
							the Bill— That therefore the motion yesterday to recede was in order— I
							repeated what he now said, and asked him if I had correctly understood
							him. He said yes— I told him I was very glad to hear it; for that I had
							proposed to make a little discussion upon that decision—this occasioned
							a laugh in the house— The orders of the day on private business were
							then taken up— Sundry bills passed in Committee of the whole <persRef
								ref="foot-samuel">S. A. Foot</persRef> of Connecticut in the Chair—
							Some debate in which <persRef ref="thomas-philemon">Thomas</persRef> of
							Louisiana entered with warmth— The Committee rose after 3. reported
							several Bills with out, and others with amendments— <persRef
								ref="bates-isaac">I. C Bates</persRef> moved that when the house
							adjourned, it should be till Monday. Much objection was made, but the
							rule was suspended, the yeas and nays twice refused, and the adjournment
							over carried by a large majority— I asked <persRef ref="seaton-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton</persRef> whether he
							intended not to report the debates on the partial Appropriation bill,
							and the Report of the Committee of Conference—from his answers I
							concluded that they meant to slur over the whole of those debates— He
							promised me however that they should be published, and <persRef
								ref="stansbury-arthur">Stanberry</persRef> the reporter told me he
							had full Notes of them all. <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef>
							and Seaton have an individual interest in the whole discussion and in
