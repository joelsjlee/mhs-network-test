						<dateline>Sunday 1. June 1834.</dateline>
						<p><date>1. VI. </date>Sunday. Rain, the greater part of the day. In the
							morning I heard a Stranger at the Presbyterian Church, from Matthew
							5.14. [“]Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill
							cannot be hid. 15. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a
							bushel; but on a candlestick; and it giveth light to all that are in the
							House. 16. Let your Light so shine before men, that they may see your
							good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.”— No afternoon
							service at that Church— At S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church
							at 5. P.M. heard <persRef ref="mccallum-archibald">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> M’Callum</persRef> read prayers for
							the first Sunday after Trinity, and preach from John 4:24. “God is a
							Spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in Spirit and in
							truth.” The remainder of the day was consumed in writing an answer to
							the Blue Book received from <persRef ref="hughes-christopher"
								>Christopher Hughes</persRef>— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>My wife</persRef>, who was quite unwell all day yesterday and last
							Night, was this day confined to her bed— Our house is a hospital—
								<persRef key="adams-john2">My Son</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">his wife</persRef> always in a precarious state of
							health, and subject to sudden and violent attacks— <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">Their two children</persRef>
							sickly, and when well too delicate to bear the slightest exposure—
								<persRef ref="goode-eleanor">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Good</persRef>, the Nurse of the children, having a <persRef
								ref="goode-mary">daughter</persRef> subject to convulsion fits, and
							the Servants often sick— My own health, formerly so robust, having
							become so exceedingly variable. I am bound to consider these as
							visitations of Providence, perhaps intended to wean me from a world,
							where I have had my share of blessing and enjoyment, and from which I
							must very shortly be withdrawn— Public Affairs, inauspicious as their
							movements are afford me rather relief and relaxation from these heavier
							domestic and personal afflictions— As in paroxysms of disease we
							sometimes obtain partial and momentary relief by turning over from one
							side to the other. I find it difficult to keep up the record of my life
							as it is passing away. <persRef ref="wilson-john8">Wilson</persRef> my
							new Coachman took a bad cold yesterday by exposure to the rain. He has
							taken the place of <persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirk</persRef>, who
							some weeks since very suddenly left this City and went to Boston, and
							then to Quincy, where <persRef ref="kirk-elizabeth">his wife</persRef>
							was left last Winter to take care of our house. He now works in the
							Garden there. <persRef ref="wilson-mary">Wilson’s wife</persRef> has

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hughes</persRef> to claim payment of
							Baron Stackelberg’s debts, one of which was for money furnished him by

							said Hughes had been once instructed to claim the payment of
							Stackelberg’s debts, and had applied without success. He said further
							that if Kervand would make his claim against Krehmer, in writing he
							would instruct <persRef ref="dickerson-mahlon">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Dickerson</persRef>, who is going out Minister to Russia

								<persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Andrew Stevenson</persRef> the

							had this day addressed a Letter to the Executive of Virginia, resigning
							his seat as a member of the House— He then took leave of the House in a
							Speech of 15 minutes full of good principles and good feeling, in
							elegant language, very handsomely delivered— The House immediately
							proceeded to ballot for Speaker— There were ten ballots taken, at the
							last of which <persRef ref="bell-john">John Bell</persRef> of Tennessee
							was chosen by 114 of 215 votes— He was conducted by me, and <persRef

							engaged me to talk till I wasted their time and mine— I found the House
							in Session. Reports were received from standing Committees— Several
							attempts were made to suspend the Rules, that Resolutions might be
							offered, and Memorials received; but they all failed— <persRef
								ref="parker-james2">Parker</persRef> from the Committee of Naval
							Affairs, reported a Bill N. 522 to establish rations for the Navy—read
							twice and committed to the Committee of the whole House on the state of
							the Union— <persRef ref="mercer-charles">C. F. Mercer</persRef> moved a
							rule to be added to the standing Rules of the House—giving every member
							entitled to the floor, to move that any pending debate shall cease—and
							if seconded by a majority of the House, the question upon the pending
							motion shall be taken without further debate— Mercer’s motion lies over,
							one day— The Kentucky contested election was taken up, and <persRef
								ref="pope-patrick">Patrick H. Pope</persRef> modified his Amendment
							offered last Friday. It appeared that some of the votes, that he wished
							to have stricken from <persRef ref="letcher-robert">Letchers</persRef>
							poll had already been deducted from it. There remained from 30 to 40
							votes, which he moved by five Resolutions to have struck off from
							Letcher’s poll, as minors, or not citizens, or as having been counted
							for him by mistake, and to be added to the poll of <persRef
								ref="moore-thomas3">Moore</persRef>. The yeas and nays were taken
							seven times with various results, on petty varieties of testimony— I
							voted in every instance against striking out, approving on this point
							the principle adopted by the Committee of Elections, to admit no such
							postliminary testimony to invalidate votes, received on either side— I
							spoke also against the reversal of this principle, but without effect—
							The house did reverse it, and struck out successively several votes <pb
								n="331" type="ms"/>from Letcher’s poll; refusing to strike out
							others— Three calls were made for the Previous question; the first and
							second time falling short of a second— The third time, the motion was
							made by <persRef ref="lytle-robert">Lytle</persRef> immediately after
							the House had struck out from Letcher’s Poll, every vote they could, on
							evidence that the voters were minors, and to prevent the application of
							the same principle to Moore’s poll. On the vote taken by Tellers there
							were then 105 for and 96 against seconding the motion— When my name was
							called, I asked what the effect of the previous question would be, and
							stated it amidst stunning cries of order, and gentle remonstrances of
							the new Speaker (<persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef>) against
							discussion; but I persisted till he answered my question— The main
							question would have been ay or no upon the Resolution reported by the
							Committee of Elections, that Thomas P. Moore was entitled to the Seat,
							and the effect of the Previous Question would have been to annul, all
							the decisions on the House, restoring to Letcher the votes unjustly
							struck from his Poll by the Committee— The restoration of these votes,
							gave Letcher the legal majority, and the previous question would not
							only have taken it from him again, but brought the whole party machinery
							to bear on the naked declaration that Moore was entitled to the Seat—
								<persRef ref="marshall-thomas">Marshall</persRef> moved a call of
							the House which was carried 119 to 85—220 Members answered to their
							names, and excuses were received from 7— Even the suspension of further

								>Mann</persRef> was contested by yeas and nays 130 to 84— <persRef
								ref="hardin-benjamin">Hardin</persRef> moved an adjournment—rejected
							56 to 158— Marshall called for the reading of the portion of the report
							of the Committee of Elections, which contains a statement of the votes.—
							The Speaker decided this to be out of order, as equivalent to debate—
							Marshall appealed from the decision of the Speaker which was confirmed
							by the House— Mercer, moved a reconsideration of the vote striking out
							Letcher’s minors; for which he had voted, in the confidence that the
							same principle would be applied to Moore’s poll; which was now to be
							evaded— The Speaker decided that this was not in order; from which
							Mercer appealed, but after debate, withdrew the appeal— The vote upon
							the Previous Question was that the main Question should <hi
								rend="italic">not</hi> now be put. 108 to 112. and the House at 1/2

							This morning I received from <persRef ref="edwards-james">J. L.

								>Bell</persRef> decided doubtingly that as a duty upon Spanish

							Pinckney withdrew his motion. <persRef ref="jones-seaborn">S.

							improvement of red river, but was too late for my vote— The harbour and
							river Bill continued to be debated till past 7. O’Clock. The amendments
							adopted in Committee of the whole were chiefly confirmed, and other

							was warmly debated, earnestly supported by me, and rejected by yeas and

							50000 for Cumberland river above Nashville— Then followed Motions, for
							the previous Question, for a Call of the House, to lay the Bill on the

								>Mary</persRef>, and her daughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Louisa</persRef> were at Church with me— At 5. O’Clock afternoon I
							attended again at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, where
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley read the service, but I was
							the only respondent of part of it, and not twenty persons present at any

							sung, but there were no singers, and no performer on the Organ, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley’s exhortation substituted for a
							Sermon was not of five minutes duration. Between the two services there
							had been a long continued and very severe thunderstorm, in which the
							clouds in conflict seemed for a full half hour, to be suspended
							immediately over our heads— In the leisure of the day, I was reflecting
							upon the Resolutions and measures, which it might be proper to adopt on
							the occasion of the decease of <persRef ref="lafayette">La
								Fayette</persRef>. I moved the appointment of the joint Committee,
							yesterday because I felt that my position required it specially of me,
							more than of any other member of Congress—but having done that my
							principle will be to let others do all the detail, and propose nothing
							myself. All may possibly thus go on smoothly. But if I should propose
							Resolutions written by myself, the instant they should be read in
							Committee, the Spirit of verbal criticism would be kindled in the joint
							Committee and there might be two days debate, without coming at last to
							a conclusion— I purposely left the number of the Committee on the part
							of the House in blank when I offered the Resolution yesterday— Five, and
							seven had been named; but one from each State was more acceptable to the
							House, and as it is, multitudes of members will be disappointed, in not
							being themselves upon the Committee— <persRef key="frye-carolina">M<hi

						<p><date>23. V:30. </date>Monday. The Committee on the part of the House to

							of the Committee of Commerce of the House. This was petition day: but
								<persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> moved to suspend the rules
							after two O’Clock to take up his Bank-deposit Bill— I moved to
							substitute 5 O’Clock instead of 2.—rejected— Polk’s motion was
							divided—vote to suspend the rules carried—127 to 61— But not to take up
							the Bank deposit Bill—123 to 65— <persRef ref="gilmer-george"
								>Gilmer</persRef>, from the select Committee on the Bill from the
							Senate to settle and establish the Northern boundary of the State of
							Ohio, moved that the Committee be discharged from the further
							consideration of it, and that it be postponed till the next Session of
							Congress—the Bill at the motion of <persRef ref="leavitt-humphrey"
								>Leavitt</persRef> of Ohio was laid on the table— The time till two
							O’Clock was wasted in violent altercation— Speeches between <persRef
								ref="burges-tristam">Burges</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef> of Rhode-Island, upon
							Resolutions of the House of Representatives of that State, both touched
							upon the Hartford Convention. At two the Harbour Bill was taken up, and
							under a running fire for and against internal improvement till near 9 at
							night, with the Episode of a very heavy thundergust was carried by a
							final vote of 107 to 54— The appropriation of 29000 dollars for Surveys,
							voted down, upon my Speech the other day was now carried 92 to 82. All,
							by the change of <persRef ref="beardsley-samuel">Beardsley</persRef>,
							and the New-York <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef>
							members. <persRef ref="jones-seaborn">Jones</persRef> of Georgia,
								<persRef ref="felder-john">Felder</persRef> of South-Carolina, and

							Kentucky, <persRef ref="ewing-john">Ewing</persRef> of Indiana and other
							western members flew the course, because they could not carry special
							favourite improvements of their own. The appropriation for surveys was
							the tug for life and death; the question for engrossment was carried by
							an increased majority, and the passage of the Bill by two to one— I saw
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> twice in the House, and once in the Senate about
							the Meeting to-morrow of the La Fayette Committee, and <persRef

						<p>At 1/2 past 9 this Morning the joint Committee of the two Houses of

								ref="bell-john">Speaker</persRef> for the remainder of the Session—
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> offered a Resolution that I should be requested to
							deliver an Oration upon the Life and character of General La Fayette,
							before both Houses of Congress at their next Session— There was little

							two Chairmen, <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Webster</persRef> and myself were authorised to draw
							them up and report them— This was done with the aid of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Archer, and in the Evening I reported them
							to the House, where these were accepted, read three times and
							unanimously passed. At the House there was some discussion and much
							manoeuvering to take up the Bank deposit Bill, in preference to the
							fortification Bill— The Bank Bill prevailed, and after excellent
							senseless speeches from <persRef ref="coulter-richard">Coulter</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="stewart-andrew">Stewart</persRef> of Pennsylvania,
								<persRef ref="jones-seaborn">Jones</persRef> of Georgia, and

								ref="miller-daniel">Miller</persRef> of Pennsylvania moved the

							reported by the Committee of Ways and means, passed the second and third
							reading, after a call of the House upon which only 175 members answered
							to their names, and 12 excuses received— The Bill passed by a vote of
							112 to 90, about 25 members, being intentionally absent, to avoid
							voting— The Bill for pensioning the French <pb n="340" type="ms"
							/>Sailors wounded, and the relatives of the two that were killed, by the
							Salute at Toulon was taken up and first recommitted to the Committee of
							the whole House on the State of the Union—there entirely new-modelled,
							reported by <persRef ref="ward-aaron">Ward</persRef>, chairman of the
							Committee of the whole, amended—then engrossed for a third reading, and
							finally read a third time and passed; after which the title was amended,
							to conform to the amendment of the Bill— <persRef ref="mckinley-john"
								>M’Kinley</persRef> of Alabama, made an objection upon
							Constitutional ground which I answered— The house refused him the yeas
							and nays upon the passage of the Bill— Adjourned about 1/2 past 6— The
							Senate this day rejected the nomination of <persRef
								ref="stevenson-andrew">Andrew Stevenson</persRef>, as Minister to
							London, 23 to 22. of <persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">Roger B.
								Taney</persRef> as Secretary of the Treasury 28 to 18 and confirmed

						<p><date>25. V. </date>Wednesday.— I received this morning a Letter from J.

							for increase of pension, for a Soldier named Jeremiah Smith, the papers
							of which I immediately took, and delivered to the Secretary of War,

							Committee; and that this consideration should be continued from day to

							Speaker, after which the question was taken by yeas and nays, and
