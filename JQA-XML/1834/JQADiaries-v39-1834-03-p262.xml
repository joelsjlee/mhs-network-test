                        <p>I called this morning at the General Post-Office, but was told the
                                <persRef ref="barry-william">Postmaster General</persRef> was and
                            had been for some time sick.— I saw, <persRef ref="hobbie-selah">Selah
                                R. Hobbie</persRef>, one of his deputies, and spoke to him of the
                            Bill reported by the Committee of Commerce, appropriating 10,000 dollars
                            to build a Custom-house at Plymouth— I told him that the Memorial from
                            Plymouth had asked an Appropriation of 12000 dollars for a building to
                            accommodate both the Custom house, and Post-Office— That the <persRef
                                ref="taney-roger-brooke">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> had
                            informed me that the expence of that part of the building intended for
                            the Post-Office must be defrayed by that department; as the Treasury
                            Department could only recommend the expenditure for the Post-Office—
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hobbie took minutes of what I said
                            and promised to answer me in writing— He said however that the same
                            union of Custom-house and Post-Office had been undertaken at New-York,
                            and in that case there had only been a recommendatory Letter from the
                            Post-master General to the Secretary of the Treasury, who had thereupon
                            undertaken to defray the whole expense of both parts of the building—
                            While I was at the Post-Office, the Masonic procession consisting of the
                            members of the Grand Lodge of the District, and the New Jerusalem Lodge
                            marched by, escorted by the Band of Music of the Marine Corps.— There
                            were upwards of 100 men—arrayed in all their paraphernalia to attend the
                            funeral of <persRef ref="ashton-henry">Henry Ashton</persRef>, the
                            Marshal of the District who died the day before yesterday— I paid a
                            visit to <persRef ref="gray-francis">F. C. Gray</persRef>, at <persRef
                                ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef> and found <persRef
                                ref="reed-john">J. Reed</persRef> with him— I then sat for my

                            him to the House next Monday. It is for double-rations and 2 1/2 per
                            Cent allowance on expenditures from 7 April 1829 to 10 December 1832,
                            being in charge of the Delaware Breakwater— He wishes that the Memorial,
                            may be referred to the Committee of Claims— We had a very miscellaneous
                            company to dine with us—among whom were <persRef ref="burnet-jacob"

                            scarcely reverend. He represented the wicked as struggling successfully
                            against God—as defeating the deliberate purposes and wishes of God—as
                            prostrating God— I could hardly sit and hear him with Patience— In the

                            The weather has been for several days so warm that some of the trees are

                            attention is so distracting that I am unable to fix it upon any one

                        <p>Having been up last Evening till near Midnight, the Sun this morning rose
                            before me, an incident which I think had not before happened this
                            Winter— I lost of course the precious time for writing. At the House the
                            day was consumed in receiving Memorials, and resolutions of popular
                            Meetings for and against the removal of the deposits and the recharter
                            of the Bank of the United States— Last Monday the call for Petitions
                            commencing with the State of Maine, had proceeded only as far as
                            Pennsylvania, which State was this day first called by the <persRef

                                ref="hiester-william">William Heister</persRef> presented
                            Resolutions from the County of Lancaster, with a short preliminary
                            Address— At his request they were read, and were against the removal of
                            the Deposits, and in favour of the Bank— He then presented twenty other
                            Memorials of the same purport, which without reading were at his motion
                            referred to the Committee of Ways and Means— <persRef

                            presented Resolutions from a Meeting in Chester County, which at

                                <persRef ref="king-henry">Henry King</persRef> presented Memorials
                            and Resolutions on both sides of the questions—read. Sutherland
                            presented a Memorial signed by four thousand working men of the third
                            Congressional District (<persRef ref="watmough-john"
                                >Watmough’s</persRef>) against the Bank and the restoration of the
                            Deposits— Watmough makes enquiry who the signers were; and Sutherland
                            answers that he will find them no men of straw—and that the Memorial was
                            transmitted to him by a gallant old revolutionary Soldier— Watmough
                            hints that Sutherland himself got up the memorial That it was
                            clandestinely circulated for signatures, and that it was signed by many
                            not belonging to the District.— He asks the printing of the Memorial
                            with the names of the signers—ordered—Watmough presents two Memorials
                            with Resolutions, from the same District in favour of the Bank— And
                            several others were presented, by other members from Pennsylvania—

                            two or three Memorials from Maryland, and <persRef ref="gordon-william3"
                                >John J. Gordon</persRef>, presented Resolutions of the Legislature

                            Constitutionality of the Bank of the United States— Gordon made a
                            moderate Speech in support of the Resolutions— <persRef
                                ref="patton-john">John M. Patton</persRef> asked that the Letter

                            the Legislature, and prophesied that the People of Virginia would not

                        <p>At the House, <persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef>, Chairman of the
                            Committee of Ways and Means, presented a Report on the Reasons of the

                            of the U.S. Bank complaining of a violation of the Charter contract by
                            their removal, and demanding reparation, the memorial of the Government
                            Directors accusing the other Directors, and sundry other Memorials— The
                            report concludes with four Resolutions 1. That the Bank of the United
                            States ought not to be rechartered 2. That the public deposits ought not
                            to be restored— 3. That the deposits should be continued in the State
                            Banks under regulations to be prescribed by Law. 4. That a travelling
                            Committee of investigation be appointed to examine and report upon the
                            affairs and Corruptions of the Bank of the United States as soon as
                            practicable— <persRef ref="clay-clement">Clay</persRef> of Alabama moved
                            for the reading of the report—objection was made, but the <persRef
                                ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker</persRef> decided that a paper being

                            pleasure of the House— Part of the report was accordingly read, when
                            Clay consented that the reading of the remainder should be suspended it
                            being understood that he should have leave to move the printing of an

                            Committee should be printed— Objection made, he moved a suspension of
                            the rule—a majority but not two thirds for it— The house then passed to
                            the orders of the day. There were numerous Bills reported by the

                            a Royal Arch Mason and member of the Massachusetts Legislature— It says
                            that some of the members of the Legislature wish that the Legislative
                            Resolutions on the Currency should be presented to the House of
                            Representatives here by <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor

                            make it acceptable to me— He says <persRef ref="davis-john4">Governor
                                Davis</persRef> has promised to write to <persRef

                            that it must not be thought Governor Lincoln desired it, and that it was
                            first proposed by a person who had a great respect for me— I asked
                            Everett if he had any explanation to give me, to make it acceptable to
                            me— He said none; and that he had even hesitated whether he should shew
                            me the Letter— I said the reason given by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Cushing did not appear to me to be sufficient— If there were some
                            members who wished they might be presented by Governor Lincoln— I
                            supposed there were others who would prefer that they should be
                            presented by me, and if the former were a majority they might pass a
                            Resolution that they should be presented by him— Everett said they
                            certainly would not do that— I said I had at the request of the whole
                            delegation presented the Resolutions of the Legislature at the last
                            Session of Congress, and I presumed it would be generally expected that
                            I should present these; rather than an entirely new Member— But I was
                            perfectly willing the Delegation should determine by whom they should be
                            presented— He said he thought that would be a proper course, and that he
                            himself thought they ought to be presented by me— I wrote a little this
                            Evening. </p>

                            concert in the production of all these Memorials in a cluster; but they
                            were not supported by the members who presented them— M<hi

                        <p>The occupations of the day are so much confined to my attendance upon the

                            question’s being taken, it appeared there was not a Quorum— When the
                            members came in the vote was taken again and carried. My Resolution was
                            received and laid over, one day— Several other Resolutions were admitted
                            in the same way— <persRef ref="mckay-james">M’Kay</persRef> of N.

                            not ineloquent was warm in favour of the Bill; not considering it as in
                            the nature of a pensionary grant; for as <pb n="267" type="ms"/>a

                            Justice— <persRef ref="gilmer-george">Gilmer</persRef> of Georgia
                            opposed the Bill, and moved its recommitment without Instructions—

                            In conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taney, I referred
                            him to the case of New-York, and to what <persRef ref="hobbie-selah">S.

                            conversation with him also upon the Memorials, and upon <persRef

                            introduced a Resolution, proposing a grant of Public Lands to the State

                            Ohio Canal, with the Pennsylvania Canal, by the Sandy and Beaver route—
                            Referred to the Committee of Roads and Canals, after striking out at the

                            “If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit”— The
                            distinction between the Spirit and the flesh is more strongly marked in
                            the chapter from which this text is taken, than perhaps in any other
                            part of the Scriptures— All vices and crimes are said to be the works of
                            the flesh, and all the virtues are denominated the fruit of the Spirit—

                            known, even thou, in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy
                            Peace! but now, they are hid from thine eyes.” This passage immediately
                            precedes the prediction of the destruction of Jerusalem— In the interval
                            between the services I had visits from <persRef ref="marshall-john"

                                >President Jackson</persRef> very shortly after his inauguration. He
                            visited me first at Meridian Hill, and has repeated his visits, once at
                            least every winter from that time— Don Miguel is now expelled from his
                            throne and from his Country— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torlade

                            Don Miguel is the rightful Sovereign of the kingdom, and also that he is
                            the preferred favourite of the People of Portugal— But his elder brother

                            from the <persRef ref="mclane-louis">Secretary of State</persRef>, and

                            adopted at the motion of <persRef ref="pinckney-henry">H. L.

                                ref="gholson-james">James H. Gholson</persRef> of Virginia, to make
                            a Speech in opposition to that of <persRef ref="patton-john">John M.
                                Patton</persRef>, made last Monday against the Resolutions of the
                            Legislature of Virginia, which had been presented by <persRef
                                ref="gordon-william3">William F. Gordon</persRef>— I asked the
                            Speaker to allow the States to be called over for Petitions and
                            Memorials—stating that I had Resolutions of the Legislature of
                            Massachusetts to offer, and promising not to consume the time of the
                            House in debating them— Gholson offered to suspend his remarks to give
                            me an opportunity to present the Resolutions of the Legislature of
                            Massachusetts, but <persRef ref="moore-samuel2">Samuel M’Dowell
                                Moore</persRef>, objected, and came to my Seat to tell me, that they

                            Patton— The Elections to the Legislature of Virginia, are to take place
                            in the course of the next month, and the influence of Patton’s Speech
                            upon them, is so terrific, that it must be counteracted, or all will be
                            lost— Gholson therefore proceeded, till near 2. O’Clock, and was
                            followed by M’Dowell Moore; both in Speeches to sustain the Resolutions
                            of the Legislature of Virginia, but both shackled by their <persRef
                                ref="jefferson-thomas">Jeffersonian</persRef> creed— Then succeeded
                            H. L Pinckney of South-Carolina, in defence of his State against
                            Patton’s charge of rashness in her recent councils and measures.—
                            Pinckney talks much nullification, and indulges himself in bitter
                            invective against Andrew Jackson— All the members of the House from
                            South-Carolina, excepting one of the nullification School; and so
                            fanatical in their devotion to it, that they cannot resist the
                            temptation to introduce it into all their Speeches; the consequence of
                            which has been the forfeiture of every particle of their influence in
                            the house. Pinckney who is a very able and eloquent and pious man, raved
                            till have past 3 O’Clock, when the house adjourned, leaving his Speech
                            unfinished— Spent the Evening with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"

                            56—not two thirds for the suspension of the rule, and my motion of
                            course failed— Reports from standing Committees received. <persRef

                            fair and honourable men, in that report, and without naming any one in
                            particular, made an apology to all whose feelings may have been wounded

                            the previous nomination. He intimates that if the Reasons of the Senate

                            recommending that provision should be made for a Post-Office together
                            with the Custom-house at Plymouth, returned me the Letter, and said that
                            the Committee of Ways and Means, approved of the object, but declined
                            proposing an Appropriation as I had requested, because the Bill for
                            erecting the Custom-house was reported by the Committee of Commerce— He
                            said he should propose to the House to postpone the Report of the
                            Committee of Ways and Means, on the deposit and Bank questions till next
                            Tuesday, and would not object to suspend the rule to allow me to present
                            the Resolutions of the Massachusetts Legislature— At the meeting of the
                            House, he moved that the Report and Resolutions of the Committee of Ways
                            and Means, which had been made the special order for this day, should be
                            postponed till next Tuesday; <persRef ref="wilde-richard"
                                >Wilde</persRef> of Georgia, objected; and said that he was ready
                            and desirous to address the House upon the subject now— A debate of two
                            hours ensued, till Wilde withdrew his opposition to the postponement—
                                <persRef ref="mckennan-thomas">M’Kennan</persRef> of Pennsylvania
                            moved that the postponement should be till next Tuesday week, but this
                            the House refused—and voted the postponement till next Tuesday— I then
                            asked leave to present the Resolutions of the Legislature of
                            Massachusetts— Objection being made, I moved the suspension of the rule,
                            for that purpose, which the House refused to grant— Polk then moved a
                            Resolution, to make the Deposit and Bank report, the special order for
                            every day at one O’Clock from next Tuesday till the decision of the
                            House upon the Resolutions; Saturdays excepted; and Mondays for the
                            reception of Memorials and Petitions— I objected to the reception of
                            this motion, and Polk moved and carried a suspension of the Rule, that
                            he should make it— The <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker</persRef>
                            said the Resolution must lie over one day; upon which Polk moved a

                            Speaker and the party had settled it otherwise, and Polk’s motion was

                            Saturday’s and Monday’s— Adjourned at 1/2 past three— I dined with

                            New-York. At the House the <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew"
                                >Speaker</persRef> read a Letter from <persRef ref="burges-tristam"
                                >Tristam Burges</persRef>, stating that he was prevented by
                            indisposition, from attending the House this day, and requesting the
                            postponement of <persRef ref="mardis-samuel">Mardis’s</persRef>
                            Resolution, upon which he was speaking, which was accordingly done— The
                            rule of private business was suspended, and the army appropriation Bill
                            was taken up and passed.— Then the rule was again suspended and <persRef
                                ref="speight-jesse">Speight’s</persRef> joint Resolution with an
                            Appropriation was taken up at the third reading— There was an Amendment
                            proposed by Speight, to strike out the whole Resolution, and turn it
                            into a mere Resolution of the House, directing the payment to be made
                            from the contingent fund of the House. The Speaker pronounced this not
                            in order— <persRef ref="foster-thomas2">Foster</persRef> of Georgia
                            moved that the Resolution be committed to the Committee on the Library,
                            with instructions to enquire the amount of the cost of the Books to be
                            purchased, under the Resolution— I opposed the commitment of the
                            Resolution, on the ground that the Resolution itself was
                            unconstitutional, as containing an Appropriation— The Speaker pronounced
                            me not in order, and after some contest I submitted to his decision—
                            Foster asked for the yeas and nays upon his motion, but they were
                            refused, and his motion was rejected. Speights amendment then came up,
                            and the Speaker said I might now make my objection— I did object the
                            unconstitutionality of an Appropriation of money by a joint Resolution—
                            Speight replied by renewing the proposition to convert the joint
                            Resolution into a separate one, and direct the payment from the
                            contingent fund of the House. <persRef ref="mcduffie-george"
                                >M’Duffie</persRef> moved that it should remain a joint Resolution,
                            striking out the Appropriation—but this was rejected. <persRef
                                ref="pinckney-henry">Pinckney</persRef> of South-Carolina moved the
                            indefinite postponement of the subject, which was also rejected by yeas
                            and nays 78 to 114— M’Duffie moved an Amendment, that the Volumes of the
                            Register of Debates, furnished to the members, should be deposited into
                            the Library when the <pb n="273" type="ms"/>present members retire, for
                            the use of their Successors—rejected— <persRef ref="polk-james"
                                >Polk</persRef> who opposed the Resolution, read a Statement which
                            he had procured from <persRef ref="lowrie-walter">Walter
                                Lowrie</persRef>, Secretary of the Senate, of their contingent
                            expenses for the present Session, which he represented as enormous— I
                            remarked sharply upon the impropriety of a member of one house of
                            Congress applying privately to the Clerk of the other, for statements to
                            raise charges against the House itself to which the Clerk belonged—and
                            asked what the House would think if an individual Senator should apply
                            to our <persRef ref="franklin-walter">Clerk</persRef>, for Statements of
                            our expenditures of the contingent fund, and should read those
                            Statements in the Senate, to support a charge of extravagance against
                            the house— Polk was so ashamed of what he had done, that he made no
                            reply, but the joke was that his Statement produced the directly
                            opposite effect to what he intended, and promoted the passage of the
                            Resolution It passed as a separate Resolution—payment to be made from
                            the contingent fund of the House. I thus succeeded in preventing the
                            passage of a joint Resolution with an Appropriation— But Stevenson the
                            Speaker, from ignorance, or carelessness had suffered it to go to a
                            third reading even without reference to a Committee of the whole, and
                            when I asked him whether an Appropriation could be made by Resolution,
                            answered yes— Upon such Slender threads hang the vital principles of our
                            Constitution— There was some sparring between <persRef ref="wise-henry"
                                >Wise</persRef> of Virginia and <persRef ref="mann-abijah"

                            named in the margin under the dash, to dine— And in the Evening, the

                            trumpet 11. Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last:”—the

                            Hawley’s afternoon Sermons— The Book of Revelation though in form only

                            House of Representatives of the United States, to deliver a long,
                            elaborate and studied Speech, by driblets of a half an hour a day— At
                            one O’Clock the special order of the day was called <persRef

                            Speech, which was learned, ingenious, eloquent, and full of sarcastic
                            humour.— When he closed, <persRef ref="ellsworth-william">W. W.

                        <p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="appleton-nathan">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Nathan Appleton</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="motley-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
                                Motley</persRef> of Boston— They are here as members of a deputation
                            from the Boston Memorialists for the restoration of the Deposits and in
                            favour of the Bank of the United States— I was a little surprized and
                            much on finding the tendency of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Appleton’s conversation decidedly against the Bank, and in no wise
                            favourable to the ostensible object of his mission— In the last Congress
                            I had considered M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Appleton, as a very
                            equivocal friend to the Bank of the United States, and <persRef
                                ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> had told me that
                            Appleton had a large interest in one of the State Banks, rivals to that
                            Institution— He took however no active part against the Bank of the
                            United States— His Patriotism was all concentrated in the Cotton
                            Manufactures— Where his Treasure was, there was his heart also— But his
                            acceptance of this mission, and his manner of executing its duties gives
                            me as slender an opinion of his personal integrity as of his political
                            morals.— At the House, <persRef ref="binney-horace">Horace
                                Binney</persRef>, came to my Seat, and enquired, whether it might
                            not be advisable to move the recommitment of the third of the four
                            Resolutions reported by the Committee of Ways and Means— This Resolution
                            is, that the State Banks ought to be continued as the places of deposits
                            of the public money, and that it is expedient for Congress to make
                            further provision by Law, prescribing the mode of Selection, the
                            securities to be taken, and the manner and terms on which they are to be
                            employed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Binney’s proposal was to move
                            the recommitments for the Committee to report a regulating Bill— I told
                            him I thought the motion to recommit would not succeed, and that their
                            regulating Bill, if they should report one, would not be worth a straw—
                            Binney did not make the motion for recommitment.— The petition from
                            Massachusetts, for the improvement of Taunton river, was at the motion
                            of <persRef ref="harper-joseph2">Joseph M. Harper</persRef> of New
                            Hampshire transferred from the Committee of Commerce to the Committee of

                            chairman of the Committee of Commerce, reported two light house Bills, a

                            Massachusetts a Port of Delivery—all referred to Committees of the
                            whole— <persRef ref="burges-tristam">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            when the special order of the day was called, and <persRef

                            of Ways and Means— While Pinckney was speaking <persRef
                                ref="blair-james">James Blair</persRef> of South-Carolina came, and
                                <pb n="277" type="ms"/>took a seat near and in face of him, looking
                            steadily and intently at him for some time— And at the moment when
                            Pinckney said that the whole South, was united against the removal of
                            the Deposits, Blair with a loud voice exclaimed <hi rend="italic">“Its a
                                lie.”</hi>— There was a momentary pause— Pinckney stop’d, and
                            said—“I claim the Protection of the House.”— No movement was made by the
                            House— One of the members friendly to Blair, went round to the seat
                            where he was and whispered to him; upon which Blair rose, and went with
                            him out of the house— Pinckney had already resumed, his Speech, which he
                            concluded without appearing to have been at all disconcerted by this
                            singular interruption— Blair is an honest and very intelligent man
                            ruined by habits of intemperance and maddened with opium.</p>

                                ref="ashley-william">William H. Ashley</persRef> of Missouri, the
                            Committee of the whole House were discharged from the consideration of
                            two Bills, which had been referred to them, one for the continuation of
                            the Cumberland road, from the river Mississippi to the city of Jefferson
                            in the State of Missouri, and one, for the survey and location of the
                            Cumberland road, from Vandalia, in the State of Illinois, to the
                            Mississippi, and the Bills, were committed to the Committee of the whole
                            House on the State of the Union— There is by the rules of the House a
                            distinction between a Committee of the whole House, and a Committee of
                            the whole House on the State of the Union—the latter being reserved for
                            subjects considered of the highest importance— It is always in order to
                            move to go into Committee of the whole on the State of the Union, and it
                            always has precedence in point of time, over the ordinary Committees of
                            the whole House— The practice, with the ordinary routine of Bills, when
                            they are reported, to read them a first and second time, by their
                            titles, which is a constructive reading, and refer them to the Committee
                            of the Whole House, and make them the order of the day for <hi
                                rend="italic">to-morrow</hi>— But this to-morrow, for multitudes of
                            Bills never comes— It is to-morrow, and to-morrow and to-morrow—for the
                            Bills thus referred must when the House go into Committee of the whole
                            be taken up in the order of their commitment, and there are many which
                            the Committee never reach— Ashley’s motive therefore in getting the two
                            Bills transferred from the Committee of the whole House, to the
                            Committee of the whole House on the State of the Union, was to obtain
                            for them a chance of being considered, at the present Session of
                            Congress.— This Cumberland Road, from Vandalia, in the State of Illinois
                            to the Mississippi, and from the Mississippi, to the City of Jefferson,
                            in the State of Missouri—how it sounds! what a demonstration of the
                            gigantic growth of this Country in population and in power is contained
                            in these few words—and how insignificant in comparison with them is the
                            subject which occupied the whole time of both Houses of Congress this
                            day— In the House, <persRef ref="burges-tristam">M<hi rend="superscript"

                                >M’Kim</persRef> of Maryland moved to suspend the rule of private
                            business, to take up the Bill making Appropriations for continuing the
                            Cumberland road, in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, and repairing the same
                            road, East of the Ohio, and continuing certain territorial roads for the
                            year 1834— To this were added at the motion of others, and accepted by
                            M’Kim, the Bill authorising the construction of a Bridge across the
                            Potomac, and repealing all former acts, relating thereto—and the Bill
                            for the continuation of the Cumberland road, from the Mississippi river
                            to the city of Jefferson, in the State of Missouri— <persRef
                                ref="parker-james2">Parker</persRef> of New-Jersey demanded that the
                            question should be taken separately upon each Bill— But the vote of two
                            thirds, to suspend the rule could not be obtained upon either of the
                            Bills— The yeas and nays upon the first were 104 to 85—upon the second
                            102 to 81— The motion for suspending the rule upon the third was then
                            withdrawn, and after a waste of about two hours upon this abortive
                            attempt to smother the consideration of private business, on the only
                            day of the week now left for that part of the duties of the House, the
                            private Bills were taken up. A Bill for remitting the impost duties upon
                            certain marble Sculptures to ornament an Exchange building at
                            Philadelphia, was vehemently debated—supported with great earnestness by
                                <persRef ref="binney-horace">Horace Binney</persRef>—opposed by

                            hunted down— Immediately after this exploit, at 1/2 past two the House
                            adjourned— I went into the Senate chamber, but they were going into
                            conclave upon Executive business— I took refuge in the Library, and

                                Naudain</persRef> came this morning, and introduced to me <persRef
                                ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Courtney</persRef>, a
                            strolling Lecturer upon Astronomy, who solicited my Subscription to a
                            course of Lectures which he is about to deliver here, and I gave
                            it—though it may probably not be in my convenience or inclination to
                            attend one of the Lectures— With such an introduction it was scarcely
                            possible to decline the Subscription, but this is one of the common
                            modes of beggary practiced in this Country— At the House it was the
                            weekly day for the reception of Memorials and Petitions— <persRef
                                ref="pinckney-henry">Henry L. Pinckney</persRef> had the floor, for
                            the remnant of a nullification Speech upon <persRef ref="wilde-richard"
                                >Wilde’s</persRef> amendment, but he was not in the house. <persRef
                                ref="schley-william">Schley</persRef> of Georgia, was also in labour
                            with a Speech, but the <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker
                                Stevenson</persRef> denied him the <pb n="279" type="ms"/>floor— So
                            the Petitions and Memorials were called—beginning with the State of
                            New-York, where they had ceased at the adjournment last Monday— 167
                            memorials and petitions were now presented, upwards of sixty of which
                            were for and against the removal of the deposits and the rechartering of
                            the Bank of the United States. Almost all the Memorials from New-York,
                            New-Jersey and Pennsylvania were upon this subject— <persRef
                                ref="binney-horace">H. Binney</persRef> presented the proceedings of
                            several Meetings, and Memorials, from Tradesmen and Meckanics of every
                            description, all bitterly complaining of distress and praying for the
                            restoration of the deposits and the recharter of the Bank of the United
                            States— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Binney upon presenting these
                            papers made a few explanatory remarks— Then <persRef ref="watmough-john"
                                >Watmough</persRef> followed with certain proceedings of Meetings,
                            and Memorials, of the same complection, from his, the third
                            Congressional District of Pennsylvania—one of the Memorials complained
                            of a fraudulent exaggeration of the numbers signed to a memorial from
                            the same District, against the Bank of the United States, and heretofore
                            presented by <persRef ref="sutherland-joel">Joel B.
                            Sutherland</persRef>.— This produced a skirmish of debate between
                            Sutherland, Watmough and Binney— Sutherland retorts the charge of
                            repetitions and duplicate names, against the Memorials presented by
                            Watmough and Binney, and says that such accidents will sometimes happen
                            in the best of families.— Mutual explanations follow, and Sutherland
                            comes off without much discomfiture— <persRef ref="jones-seaborn"
                                >Seaborn Jones</persRef> of Georgia, presented to the House an
                            accord and explanation between Henry L. Pinckney and <persRef
                                ref="blair-james">James Blair</persRef>— The difference being
                            adjusted honourably to both parties, and the friendly relations between
                            them restored. The Speaker presented the proceedings of a meeting in
                            York County, Pennsylvania, approving the removal of the deposites, and
                            against the recharter of the Bank of the United States— The leading
                            subscriber to these proceedings was <persRef ref="king-adam">Adam

                            the present member from the District presented a protest against these

                            that a majority of the Meeting were opposed to them and voted against
                            them— All the papers Pro and con, lie on the table— Sundry other

                            Mississippi; and prevented Lytle of Ohio, from making a Speech on a

                            Plummers motion was rejected; but there was no semblance of a Quorum— A
                            motion for a call of the House was rejected— Two successive motions were
                            made to adjourn, and at 5 O’Clock the adjournment was carried by yeas
                            and nays 24 to 21—only 45 members voting— Consumed the evening with my
                            family at whist.</p>

                        <p>This Morning, by leave of the House sundry Memorials and Petitions were
                            presented, which there was not time to receive yesterday. I presented
                            the petition of <persRef ref="harris-relief">Relief Harris</persRef>;
                            called up from the last Session, when it had been presented 12. December
                            1832—and with the papers accompanying it, had it referred to the
                            Committee on Revolutionary Pensions— <persRef ref="lytle-robert"
                                >Lytle</persRef> of Ohio made an attempt to appeal from the <persRef
                                ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker’s</persRef> decision yesterday,
                            interdicting him from speaking on the memorial presented by him— The
                            Speaker now decided that it was too late for him to appeal—much to
                            Lytle’s annoyance.— <persRef ref="plummer-franklin">Plummer</persRef>
                            renewed his application for leave to speak against <persRef
                                ref="cage-harry">Cage’s</persRef> Resolutions, and after some
                            altercation with the Speaker moved that Cage’s Resolutions should be
                            referred to the Committee of Ways and Means, with Instructions to report
                            Resolutions, adverse to the prayer of the Memorials. The hour was so
                            nearly absorbed in this petty warfare, that <persRef
                                ref="burges-tristam">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burges</persRef>
                            declined proceeding upon his Speech on <persRef ref="mardis-samuel"
                                >Mardis’s</persRef> Resolution— The Speaker laid before the House a
                            Letter from <persRef ref="levy-uriah">Lieutenant Uriah P. Levy</persRef>
                            of the Navy of the United States, offering as a present, a colossal
                            bronze Statue of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Thomas
                                Jefferson</persRef>, executed at Paris by the celebrated <persRef

                                >Honoré Gonou</persRef> which communication was referred to the
                            Committee on the Library— At one the special order of the day was called
                            and <persRef ref="clay-clement">C. C. Clay</persRef> of Alabama made a
                            Speech of two hours against <persRef ref="wilde-richard"
                                >Wilde’s</persRef> Amendment, and to the glorification of <persRef
                                ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef>—he was personally
                            abusive upon Wilde, and upon me. Clay is a man of some talents, and of
                            much activity and perseverance: a fluent Speaker of very little power;
                            but making up the deficiency of substance, by the ardour of his zeal— So
                            it is with almost all the Jackson leaders in the House— After Clay had
                            finished, about 3 O’Clock the House adjourned— <persRef

                        <p>I had this morning a number of visitors, but could not retain their
                            names— Chiefly members of the numerous deputations from Meetings in
                            several of our Cities, sent to represent to Congress, and to the
                                <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>, the great
                            distress among all the industrious classes of the community, in
                            consequence of the harsh and unlawful measures of the President against
                            the Bank of the United States— It is scarcely conceivable that such
                            extensive desolation should have been effected, by so very trifling a
                            cause.— At the House, <persRef ref="allan-chilton">Chilton

                            in the Evening, I attended the meeting of the Anti-Masonic Members of

                            Massachusetts— I was chosen chairman of the Meeting, which had been
                            agreed upon by the members from New-York and Pennsylvania. Its purpose
                            was to hold a consultation upon the present condition and prospects of
                            the Antimasonic cause, in the several States where it has partially
                            prevailed, and to enquire whether any concert of measures might be
                            advisable for its promotion.— The Occasion of the Meeting was the
                            presence of <persRef ref="granger-francis">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Grainger</persRef> of New-York in the City, and he was
                            present at the Meeting— Nothing special was proposed, but Mr Grainger
                            was requested to give a statement of the condition of Antimasonry in the
                            State of New-York, and especially in that part of it where he resides.—
                            He said that in all the Western Counties of New-York Masonry was
                            extinct— The lodges and Chapters were all abandoned, and almost all of
                            them formally dissolved.— That the Spirit of Antimasonry had
                            consequently subsided; there was no adversary left to contend with, and
                            as a distinctive party there could scarcely be said to be any
                            anti-masonry left— If the Free-Masons should attempt to revive their
                            Institutions in those Counties, he had no doubt, the Antimasonic Spirit
                            would instantly revive, with as much zeal and ardour as it had ever
                            manifested <pb n="282" type="ms"/>but Masonry was no longer a subject
                            upon which there was a conflict of opinion to stimulate exertion, and as
                            a distinct principle it would be utterly impossible to maintain a mere
                            antimasonic party— The members of the House from the State of New-York
                            all agreed that this was perfectly in harmony with the prevailing
                            Sentiments of their Constituents— All were of opinion that it would be
                            impossible to maintain any longer in that State a distinct, organized
                            Anti-masonic party— The members from Pennsylvania, appeared to be not
                            quite so much discouraged; but none of them entertained any expectation
                            that the party would obtain a majority of the People of the State— After
                            a desultory conversation, of between two and three hours the meeting was
                            by common consent adjourned; to meet again on Tuesday the 15<hi

                            Seat.— I offered a Resolution to call upon the <persRef

                            returns relating to the Deposit Banks— The Resolution was received by
                            unanimous consent— I asked the House to consider it now— Objection was
                            made by <persRef ref="wayne-james">James M. Wayne</persRef> of Georgia—

                            shall then be taken up— Some other Resolutions were introduced— Then

                            and a half, arguing to the majority, friends and supporters of the
                            Administration, that the restoration of the deposites is a measure of
                            high interest and true policy <hi rend="italic">to them</hi>. It was the
                            most eloquent Speech of the Session, and in a course of reasoning
                            altogether impressive and original— But seed sown at broadcast which
                            will take no root in the soil— Choate is a young man, of great power and
                            promise, whose political career has been short but brilliant— His health
                            is indifferent and he has a cadaverous look— He proposes to resign his
                            Seat in Congress which interferes too much with the profits of his
                            practice at the bar— He was this day followed by <persRef

                            is documents— Adjourned by yeas and nays 82 to 69.— The House on the
                            motion of <persRef ref="mckinley-john">John M’Kinley</persRef> of
                            Alabama, agreed to meet from this time forward at eleven in the morning—
                            The Senate this day took the questions on two Resolutions offered by
                                <persRef key="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef> of Kentucky. 1.
                            Censuring the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President of the United
                                States</persRef> for usurpation of Power in his late measures—passed
                            by a vote of 26 to 20. 2. That the reasons of the Secretary of the
                            Treasury, for removing the deposites are insufficient 28 to 18— <persRef
                                ref="chambers-ezekiel">Chambers</persRef> of Maryland, and <persRef
                                ref="bell-samuel">Bell</persRef> of New-Hampshire absent— They would
                            have voted for both the Resolutions— The first of these Resolutions
                            ought in my opinion not to have passed, and I gave it very fully and
                            with much earnestness to <persRef ref="silsbee-nathaniel">Nathan

                            it— They did nevertheless both vote for it, under the domineering
                            influence of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay— My time was absorbed

                        <p>Morning crowded with researches for information upon the subjects of
                            discussion before the house, at the meeting of which, immediately after
                            the reading of the Journal, I called up my Resolution; which I modified,
                            by adding to it the Resolution that I offered on the 6<hi
                                rend="superscript">th</hi> of this month, as follows—[“]Resolved
                            that the <persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">Secretary of the
                                Treasury</persRef> be directed to lay before this House, copies of
                            the charters of all the Banks selected by him as depositories of the
                            public moneys in the place of the Bank of the United States and its
                            branches; together with the names of the Presidents, Cashiers, Directors
                            and Stockholders in the said selected Banks, and the names of the
                            lawyers and Solicitors; with the amount of Stock in said Banks, held by
                            each Stockholder, and the amount of debt due by each President, Cashier
                            and Director of each of the Banks to the said Bank, at the Time, when it
                            was selected as a depository and at this time; and that the Secretary of
                            the Treasury be directed to report to this House a Statement of all the
                            sums denominated in the Treasury accounts unavailable funds,
                            specifically designating the several banks or individuals indebted to
                            the Treasury therefor; the time when each debt first became due; the
                            time when failure of payment thereof first occurred; the security if
                            any, which the public have for payment thereof at any time, and the
                            prospect of such eventual payment.”— This Resolution now engaged a
                            debate which absorbed the hour and was left unfinished: the names of the
                            lawyers and Solicitors were introduced at the motion of <persRef
                                ref="ewing-john">John Ewing</persRef> of Indiana, accepted by me.

                            moved as an Amendment to strike out the call for the debts of

                            Harper finally withdrew his proposed amendment— The hour expired— The
                            Orders of the day were called— Private business. <persRef

                            preached from 2. Peter 2.20. “For if after they have escaped the

                            most animated devotion, and as the day of the Resurrection of the
                            Saviour is more emphatically the Christian’s day, than that of his
                            birth, which is not very precisely ascertained, and if it were, could
                            only be commemorated, as the day of promise, while that of Easter is the
                            day consummated life and immortality.— The Resurrection of Christ, was
                            the accomplishment of the purposes for which he came into the world— Its
                            extraordinary and mysterious connection of coincidence with the
                            Jewish-Passover, gives it great additional interest, and the occasion it
                            has given for ascertaining to the minutest second of time the extent of
                            the annual revolution of the Earth round the Sun, has made it important
                            to the scientific history of Astronomy. For these reasons I have
                            regretted that in the general abolition of religious holidays, by the
                            Protestant Churches of the purest doctrine, they had not made an
                            exception for this day; with which I would also have included Christmas
                            day— In this Country the Catholics, and especially the Episcopalians,
                            keep Christmas with much more earnestness than Easter; the cause of
                            which may be that Christmas is a day for feasting, and Easter is not—
                            The minced-pies and Plum-pudding of the Christmas dinner form for the
                            great multitude of worshippers the keenest incentive to their piety, and
                            the most rapturous of their extasies.</p>
