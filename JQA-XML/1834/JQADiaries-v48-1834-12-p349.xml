                        <p>Balie Peyton of Tennessee from the Committee of foreign Relations,
                            reported a joint Resolution authorizing and requiring the President of
                            the United States to cause the present of a Lion and two Horses from the
                            Emperor of Morocco, to be sold and that the proceeds be put into the
                            Treasury— Read twice, and ordered to be engrossed for a third reading—
                            Peyton reports also that the Committee be discharged from further
                            consideration of the remainder of the Resolution referred to them; which
                            proposed to dispose of the other unconstitutional presents, deposited at
                            the Department of State— adopted</p>
                        <p>Clayton’s Resolution of enquiry by the Committee of Ways and Means, for
                            repealing the duties on loco-motive engines, and rail-road Car wheels,

                            imported within two years.</p>
                        <p>Long Speech from Chambers, for reference to the Committee of
                            Manufactures; answered by Cambreleng who affirmed that such resolutions

                            Means— William Jackson of Massachusetts makes a Speech on the same
                            side—to which Miller of Pennsylvania replies— Ewing begins, but Watmough

                            him, Speight, Wise, Reed, Harper of Pennsylvania, and Mann of New-York—
                            Wise moves amendments discarding all distinction for seniority among the
                            Captains— Pearce speaks in favour of Boatswains, Gunners and

                        <p>Hamer of Ohio, moves an instruction to the Committee on so much of the
                            President’s Message as recommends an Amendment to the Constitution, in
                            the mode of electing President and Vice-President, was referred, to
                            provide that the election be made directly by the People, in districts—
                            That the election in no event shall devolve upon Congress— And that no
                            person who has been elected shall be eligible again—and that no member
                            of Congress shall be appointable to any Office under the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The Speaker presents the memorial of the recent Convention held at
                            Baltimore from the States of Virginia, Maryland, Ohio and the District
                            of Columbia praying a grant for carrying on the Chesapeake and Ohio
                            Canal—on motion of C. F. Mercer ordered to be printed and referred to
                            the Committee in charge of the Bill on that subject.</p>

                            Tariff, and objects to all disturbance of the compromise— Beardsley
                            moves to lay the Resolution on the Table, though he voted against it on
                            Wednesday.</p>

                            Committee of Ways and Means— Dickerson renewed the motion to lay on the
                            table, which after a short Speech from Burges is carried by yeas and
                            nays 125 to 85.</p>

                            gratuitously— M’Carty of Indiana moves an Amendment that the fees for
                            administering the Oaths shall be paid from the Treasury— This was
                            rejected— I spoke a few words in favour of Lane’s Amendment, which was
                            adopted, and the Bill passed to a third reading.</p>
                        <p>On motion of Connor, chairman of the Committee on the Post Office

                        <p>The Resolution fixing the 31<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> inst<hi
                                rend="superscript">t.</hi> for the delivery of the Oration upon the

                            engrossed for a third reading. The Speaker this morning said it was not
                            a joint, but a concurrent Resolution, and did not require three
                            readings—he should therefore consider it as passed, and send it for
                            concurrence to the Senate—</p>
                        <p>L. Lincoln’s Call upon the President, for information respecting the
                            State of the Negotiation with the British Government concerning the
                            Northeastern boundary, was opposed by Gorham Parks of Maine, who
                            professed perfect indifference whether it should pass or not—but
                            objected specially to the latter part of it— He considered it as an
                            officious intrusion of a member from Massachusetts in the affairs of
                            Maine, and as implying a censure upon the members from that State— He
                            cast many reflections upon the State of Massachusetts for her supposed
                            ill treatment of Maine— He is answered by Evans, who exposes the
                            tergiversations and jugglery of the ruling party in Maine, upon this
                            subject; in all which Parks himself has been a prominent actor— T. F.
                            Foster of Georgia, makes a smart nullification Speech. Lincoln replies
                            conclusively to the objections of Parks— Smith of Maine, opposes the
                            Speech of Evans, but says he shall vote for the Resolutions— The orders
                            of the day were called for, at the expiration of the hour, but the house
                            refused to pass to them and the debate continued till past 3 when the
                            house adjourned over to Saturday.</p>

                            the purpose, and I delivered an Oration upon the Life and character of

                            closing, I left the Speaker’s Chair which he resumed, and the House

                            irresistible Spirit of idleness came over me, and I could neither read
                            nor write.</p>
