						<p>I wrote to <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>,
							notifying him of the appointment of the Committee of Overseers and
							requesting him to fix a time some day next week, for the meeting of the
							Committee at the house of <persRef ref="pickman-benjamin2">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> B. T. Pickman</persRef> at Boston—and
							I enclosed to him the Statement yesterday made by <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef>— <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> took my Letter with him to
							Boston to send it by this day’s Mail— I visited my garden, but was
							called from it by <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef>,
							who being on his way to West-Point, received at Boston an answer to his
							application for an extension of his furlough, with a consent to its
							extension until the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month. I
							received also a Letter from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef>, written last Monday: in the body of the Letter
							uncertain whether she should leave Washington that day or not; and on
							the cover of the Letter, under the superscription written “departure
							postponed.” I wrote a line to Charles, informing him of this fact— The
							remainder of the day was employed in journalizing the two last days, and
							in continuing to assort my private papers—a task which will take much
							more time than I had anticipated; but which to do methodically I must
							reserve, for afternoon’s work— The weather was this day cool, and
							pleasant, so that I was able to write as much after as before dinner— In
							the Evening I visited <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef> and spent an hour
							with him, and his Son <persRef ref="whitney-augustus"
							>Augustus</persRef>— I felt all the morning some anxiety for <persRef
								ref="durant-charles">Durant</persRef> the Aeronaut: but it was
							relieved by learning before Night that he had been saved— After being in
							the air about an hour and a half, he came down at Sea, about 5 Miles
							East of Cape Ann, and was taken up, by a boat from the Schooner Miner,
								<persRef ref="spalding-a">Captain Spaulding</persRef> from
							Thomastown Maine, and came into Boston harbour, about nine O’Clock this
							morning— His preservation was almost miraculous.</p>

						<p>Occupations accumulate upon me— I visited this morning my Garden and
							Nursery— My Seedlings are so multiplied that they furnish matter for
							continual observations many of which are curious; but they are
							barren—they pass out of the memory and lead to no improvement—
							Observation is useless unless accompanied by meditation; and followed by
							the action of experiment— Then too, there must be the memory of the
							experiment—the observation of its results, and sagacious enquiry into
							the causes of its success or failure— I have planted many whole Apples,
							and it frequently happens, that two, three or four seedlings come up in
							a cluster from one apple— I have never settled, when they should be
							separated— This morning I took away two out of three Apple seedlings,
							which came up together—left the tallest in the place where it came up,
							and set out the two others in a line with it, about a foot distant from
							it and from each other— The question is whether this is a safe time for
							transplanting—and I make it as an experiment— I find in several places
							seedling Strawberries, from seeds which I sowed last year in July, but
							in most cases they are smothered with weeds— All my vines which I had
							thought killed last November by the frost are alive, and creeping along
							for support— Several new ones are up from seeds sown last year— It is
							with trees as with animals much easier to breed than to bring them up—
							Many of my seedlings of the present year are as usual perishing <pb
								n="367" type="ms"/>under the heat of the Sun— I have filled two of
							the Earthen Pots which I left last year, with seeds sown in them, none
							of which have come up, with new Earth; and put in them Strawberry
							seeds—Lime berries, and Plum stones— I began a draught of a Report to
							the Overseers of Harvard University, upon the recent disorders among the
							Students— Afternoon visit from <persRef ref="gray-francis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> F. C. Gray</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lawrence-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. B.
								Lawrence</persRef>— While they were here, about five O’Clock
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> arrived
							safely from Washington, with <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter
								Hellen</persRef>, my Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John’s</persRef>
							daughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="wilson-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Wilson</persRef>—
							They found the Carriage and horses, and <persRef ref="wilson-john8"
								>Wilson</persRef> waiting for them at Dedham, and came home in the
							Carriage— They left Washington Wednesday afternoon.</p>

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter
								Whitney</persRef>, this morning from John 14.6. “I am the way, and
							the truth, and the life.”—a Communion discourse, and he administered the
							communion after the ordinary service— There were no female singers in
							the choir— The afternoon Sermon was from Ecclesiastes 5.1. [“]Keep thy
							foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear than
							to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do
							evil.” Two female singers in the Choir—<persRef ref="smith-louisa"
								>Louisa C Smith</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-isaac">I. H.
								Adams</persRef> were here after Meeting this afternoon— I read the
								10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon of the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef>, which was for a fast day, on the 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of November 1720. This Sermon was
							preached at a time of great public distress. He speaks of a mortality
							among the cattle, and says it had continued many years—of suspended
							credit—of failing commerce—of multitudes of families ruined, and many
							others touching upon ruin— These complaints seem to be of all times in
							commercial Countries— Among the instruments of divine indignation he
							enumerates wind—the horn distemper—the plague in France, and
							stock-jobbing— There is something ludicrous in this catalogue of
							Scourges— The wind for example— Tempestuous times— He says there had
							been within the preceding ten years so many storms that it seemed as if
							Nature was falling into her primitive Chaos— The horn-distemper— He says
							they had suffered so long from this, that they had grown accustomed to
							it, and scarcely regarded it as a misfortune— The Plague in France— It
							had not reached Holland; though it was just then raging at Marseilles—
							Stockjobbing—he barely touches upon this and says he purposely avoids
							enlarging upon it— Yet of the four calamities specified by him this was
							the only one which they could justly impute to themselves— Saurin and
								<persRef ref="massillon-jean">Massillon</persRef> were
							cotemporaries—both Frenchmen—one a Protestant refugee; the other a Roman
							Catholic—and each considered the other, as one of the greatest sins of
							the Age— I looked again over the Volumes of Massillon for the invective
							upon <persRef ref="william-iii">William the 3<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi></persRef> and the malediction of the Protestants,
							without finding it—but I recognized again numerous admirable passages in
							Massillon, which I had marked, when reading him in 1809–10 and 11.— I
							always admire the boldness of his reproof and the severity of his
							rebukes upon the vices of Courts and Courtiers— I continued also the
							draught of a Report to the Board of Overseers, upon the disturbances at
							the University— This is a subject the importance of which grows upon me
							as I proceed, and the earnestness in writing grows in proportion</p>

							promised to go down there next Thursday afternoon at four O’Clock, and
							talk with him about it— In visiting my garden and Nursery—I find every
							day new matter of observation— The vegetation of the second shoots of
							the chesnut Oaks has ceased— That of the red and English Oaks has not
							yet closed. A very promising Peach tree, of those which I set out in the
							Garden last October, has until within the last fortnight appeared to be
							dead; but is now putting out shoots— A remnant of root left in the
							Summer house cellar, from one of the elms taken up and transplanted last
							October has thrown out a vigorous shoot, and led me to the enquiry
							whether upon transplanting a young elm, you cannot always leave root
							enough to bear another tree; and if you can of elm, why not of fruit
							trees of all kinds—an enquiry the result of which may be useful— I had
							requested yesterday <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull
								Adams</persRef>, who told me he should go to Boston this morning, to
							see my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and tell him

								<persRef ref="phillips-stephen">Stephen C Phillips</persRef> of
							Salem— This brought me in arrears of other writing, but not of the most
							essential— I visited my garden and nursery where I found the heat of the
							Sun intolerable— Of my young seedlings which were unknown, I now
							recognize the holly— My seedling Strawberries both in the garden and
							nursery are putting forth their creepers— The white oak bud, in the red
							Oak stock does not take— I sheltered several seedling cherries and
							apples of the present year with shingles.— I stake with twigs of willow
							every day some new seedling the progress of which I wish to observe—
							Observation multiplies upon me, as my seedlings annually increase; and
							with it, the pleasure of observing— One step further is needful—that is
							to make observation profitable—to derive fruit from observation At noon,
							the tide being high, and the day of the new moon, I bathed with <persRef

						<p>The heat and the Musquitos drove me from my bed to another chamber,
							without securing me much repose— I began to water the Pots in which I
							have young seedling fruit trees— In one of them seven trees from as many
							seeds of one dwarf Apple— I could stay but a short time in the Nursery,
							from the intensity of the Sun; and it was to observe—first the almost
							certain destruction of every seedling of the present Season, constantly
							exposed to the Sun; and secondly the like failure of almost every plant
							that comes up wholly shaded— Such is the case with the Apples, Pears,
							Cherries, Peaches and Walnuts, planted on the Northwest side of my
							Nursery Gate, and under the Elms at the bottom of the Nursery— Many have
							come up: but none of them thrive— To keep a plant alive through its
							first season, it should be alternately shaded and exposed to the Sun,
							morning and afternoon— Between one and two O’Clock before dinner, I
							bathed and swam at the wharf—but the excessive heat prevented me from
							going after dinner to the Mount Wollaston farm— I made an exertion to
							finish the draught of a report to the Board of Overseers, but without
							success— I saw in the Newspapers an account of the death of <persRef
								ref="johnson-william">Judge William Johnson</persRef> of
							South-Carolina, a judge of the Supreme Court of the United States— He
							died in the very act of submitting to a surgical operation, by <persRef

							of curious trifles at the Court of <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis
								14</persRef>—who was a sort of great man—a compound of great virtues
							and vices; and like most other great men a bundle of inconsistencies—
							Small men, in their sphere are much the same— Absolute consistency is

						<p>I finished early this morning my draught of a Report to the Board of

								<persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef>, and my
							Grand-child <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>. We went

									rend="superscript">l.</hi> B. T. Pickman’s</persRef> at eleven
							O’Clock— The other members of the Committee, <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="codman-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> John
								Codman</persRef> and <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H.
								Everett</persRef>—soon came in; and I read to them, the Report that
							I had prepared in performance of the commission from the board of
							Overseers— It took me an hour and a quarter to read it, and it did not
							meet the approbation of any other member of the Committee— They all
							thought it much too severe upon the Students— Governor Lincoln, was
							entirely opposed to the prosecution of the Students in the Court of Law—
							He was also opposed to a Resolution recommending that the <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">President</persRef> should conditionally cause
							the Prosecution to be withdrawn— He was opposed to every thing proposed
							in my report; but had nothing of his own to propose. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett was equally opposed to the
							prosecution at Law, but was in favour of the Resolution recommending
							that the prosecution should be withdrawn— He also thought the Report,
							not only too severe upon the Circular of the Senior Class, but even
							unjust, because it was treating young men scarcely arrived at the age of
							discretion, as if they were entirely responsible men— He thought besides
							that although the charges in the Circular were very improper as coming
							from undergraduates, they were upon the whole substantially well
							founded— That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy was a man very
							wanting in discretion; of which he had given many proofs— He specified,
							his proposal when a member of Congress to impeach <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef> for which he could not obtain a second—and also
							his conduct to him last Winter upon an enquiry respecting the conferring
							a degree of L.L.D. on <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President
								Jackson</persRef>, without duly notifying the members of the board
							of Overseers— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett said he had then
							prepared a conciliatory proposition; and went to President Quincy and
							proposed reading it to him; upon which he said to him—“I wont talk with
							you about it”— He thought the report therefore incorrect in defending
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy from the charge of
							indiscretion— That was his character, and his Administration at the
							University was also very unpopular—as evidence of which he had received
							a Letter from a friend in a remote part of the State, who noticing his
							(Everett’s) appointment as a member of this Committee, says “cannot you
							contrive to get us rid of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy”— I
							replied that as to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy’s general
							character for discretion, I did not think it a subject of enquiry or
							report by this Committee—but I had undertaken to prove and I thought had
							proved that there had been no want of discretion in his conduct in
							relation to these transactions— That I believed neither M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy, nor any other public man of his
							standing could be exempt from some charge of indiscretion in the course
							of a long life, and if there was such a man, he was none the better on
							that account— That discretion was a negative virtue, perhaps possessed
							in higher perfection by knaves than by honest men and that if the object
							of this Committee, was to contrive to get rid of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Quincy, I was not a proper person to be a member of it; as I
							could give no countenance to any such design. D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Codman said he was sorry to hear M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Everett, quote this expression from the Letter of his
							friend— He added that he himself was friendly to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Quincy; and preferred him to all the other persons who had
							been mentioned for the Office at the time of his appointment— That he
							approved generally, and very highly the substance of my report; but <pb
								n="371" type="ms"/>he wished it might be modified, in the severity
							of its Language respecting the misconduct of the Students; and that it
							should avoid the expression of any opinion, respecting the propriety of
							the prosecution at Law— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pickman declared
							his concurrence in all the opinions expressed in the report, and only
							wished that its severity should be softened— D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Codman said that it had been evidently written under some
							excitement, and personal feeling at the treatment of President Quincy by
							the Students and that a revisal might take off some of its sharpness— I
							admitted that it had been written under excitement, of indignation at
							the charges in the Circular of the Senior Class against President
							Quincy, who had been my intimate friend for nearly fifty years; without
							interruption even by the most earnest and ardent opposition of political
							opinions— He had been my unwavering friend, without a moment’s
							interruption; and I had the most unbounded confidence in his integrity—
							But I declared myself not at-all tenacious of my report, either as a
							whole, or of any parcel of it— I would alter, amend or entirely withdraw
							it at the pleasure of the Committee.— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Codman proposed that Governor Lincoln and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Everett should be a Subcommittee to revise and amend my report to be
							considered at an adjourned meeting of the Committee next Thursday—
							Governor Lincoln said it would not be in his power to attend a meeting
							next week, and he shewed a great disinclination to take any charge upon
							himself in this affair; expressing a doubt whether he should even attend
							the adjourned meeting of the overseers; and repeating that the President
							could not arrest the prosecution upon the Indictment, if he would— He
							disclaimed all ill will towards President Quincy, and said he had
							constantly been under the impression, until very recently, that his
							administration at the University was very popular.— I said I knew well
							that the prosecution upon the Indictment could not be arrested but with
							the consent of the Attorney for the Government— But as it had been
							commenced at the instance of the College faculty, I had no doubt, a noli
							prosequi would be entered upon an intimation from the President that it
							was desired— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Codman then proposed that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett and I should be the
							Subcommittee to revise the report for an adjourned meeting of the
							Committee next Thursday— To this I assented and it was so voted by the
							Committee. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett took with him my
							report, the President’s Statement, the Circular of the Senior Class, and
							a copy of the College Laws, received this morning while the Committee
							were in Session— Upon these papers, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Everett is to prepare his report, and communicate it to me by next
							Monday; and we are to report again to the Committee at Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Pickman’s house next Thursday morning at
							11. O’Clock— It is possible that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett
							and I may agree on this point but not probable— His principles in
							relation to the subject are entirely different and indeed opposite to
							mine— His object is a marked expression of disapprobation by the
							Overseers of the prosecution at Law, and only such censure upon the
							riotous Students, as to leave on the public mind the impression that in
							the main they were right— He distinctly avowed that opinion this day—His
							object is to “get rid of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy[”], and
							most probably to take his place himself. He will improve this adventure
							to that end, with all his ability which is great, and with all his
							Address which is small— For his manners are not more captivating <pb
								n="372" type="ms"/>than those of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Quincy himself— I deeply sorrow that I am obliged to take any part in
							this controversy; and the more so because in wishing to sustain my
							friend Quincy, I am fearful of injuring myself without benefiting him:
							and because I am much perplexed how to support him most efficaciously— I
							distrust my own discretion in the endeavour to sustain his, and am above
							all anxious not to aggravate, where I would assuage— The meeting of the
							Committee adjourned after two O’Clock, and I remained and dined with

							which he had suffered in working on board the Brandywine Frigate on the
							first of the preceding January— He said he now had on the Truss which
							the Surgeon put on him at the time when the rupture happened, but he had
							no evidence to prove either the rupture or the disability. He said the
							fact must be noted both on the Journal kept on board of the Brandywine,

							whom he represented himself as having spoken insultingly— He was so much
							inflamed with liquor that I did not much discourse with him nor
							ascertain the cause of his animosity against Chauncey; but I inferred
							from what he said that he had been discharged for his insolence. He told

							New-York where he believed he could obtain the Evidence, and then go on
							to Washington himself. He said he belonged to this town—had formerly
							been a tenant of my farm at the foot of Penn’s Hill, and was now working

							bespeaks an intelligent first cause, not temporary— The authentic

							most 6000 years—a drop of water to an Ocean, in comparison with a
							conceivable portion of time— But eternity has neither past nor future,
							while time has no present— Eternity cannot be measured by time— The
							phenomena of physical nature, would seem to indicate that matter is not
							destructible, but only changeable— It is unceasing mutability— Eternity
							is immutable. I must wait for light, and hearken to human reason upon

							consideration to-morrow morning— I expressed very strongly my opinion
							against the presentation in the Circular of the Senior Class to be <pb
								n="375" type="ms"/>exempted from prosecution at Law, for property
							destroyed, belonging to the University— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Everett thought the prosecution in this instance was unpopular— I said I

							there were three members of the Committee against the Prosecution— I
							thought, only two— He claimed <persRef ref="codman-john">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Codman</persRef>, whom I considered as
							only doubting— Everett then asked me to consider the claim of the
							Students to exemption from prosecution—upon the ground of youth and
							inexperience—which I promised to do. At 11. O’Clock I attended a Meeting
							of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences— There were less than ten
							members present, and the only communications received were acceptances
							of election of members— I had at the Statute Meeting of last August
							proposed the <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">Rev<hi

							was informed by <persRef ref="treadwell-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Treadwell</persRef>, the corresponding Secretary that he

							Patent Office— I was not. He said he was Editor of the Journal of the
							Franklin Institute. The meeting was not more than a quarter of an hour
							long, and on the whole did the most nothing of any meeting of a

								<persRef ref="bowditch-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bowditch</persRef> who is a member of the Corporation of the

							the measure had been unanimously approved by the Corporation, and also
							by <persRef ref="jackson-charles">Judge Jackson</persRef>, who had been
							a member of the Board, but had lately resigned— He said too that the
							prosecution was not a novelty, but that there had been repeated
							instances of it for the last fifty years, though never carried through
							to judgment— He said that thirteen of the Students had testified at
							Concord without hesitation, and two after making some objection, and
							having the Law explained to them— I went to Charles’s Office and

								rend="superscript">l</hi> Pickman’s on the adjournment of the
							Committee at one— <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Parkman</persRef> had invited me to dine with him at
							two: I had accepted conditionally the invitation, and desired Charles if
							I should not be at his Office at one, to go out with him, to give notice
							to <persRef ref="gillet-simon">Gillet</persRef> driver of the Quincy
							Stage to call for me at D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkmans at 4— At
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Odiorne’s I met M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward, and found the subject on which they
							wished to converse with me was Antimasonic Politics— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wards ostensible object was to persuade
							the Anti-masons of Massachusetts to be prepared to nominate <persRef
								ref="granger-francis">Francis Granger</persRef>, for next President
							of the United-States, and to agree that a National Antimasonic
							Convention should be called to meet in June 1835 for that purpose— There
							is a collateral question, who shall be voted for as Governor of
							Massachusetts by the Antimasons of the State— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Odiorne said they could not possibly vote for <persRef
								ref="davis-john4">John Davis</persRef>; but I told him I believed
							the Antimasons of Worcester County would do so— He spoke of <persRef
								ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef>—of
								<persRef ref="lincoln-heman">Heman Lincoln</persRef>—of <persRef
								ref="lathrop-samuel">S. Lathrop</persRef>, and of <persRef
								ref="morton-marcus">Judge Morton</persRef>, for whom he thought it
							was hardly possible they should— I told him I believed it must be soon
							reduced to that—Davis or Morton; for if they should set up a Candidate
							of their own they would be certainly and totally defeated— And as to the
							nomination of Francis Granger for President of the United States; they
							would do well, first to try their hands at electing him Governor of New
							York— If they should succeed in that, and if <persRef
								ref="ritner-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ritner</persRef>
							should be chosen Governor of Pennsylvania, then there might be a
							reasonable formation of a prospect upon which M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Granger might be brought forward as a Candidate for the
							Presidency.— For the present I thought the project impracticable— This
								<pb n="377" type="ms"/>conversation continued upwards of an hour,
							and I found it necessary rather to infer the object of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward’s present visit to Boston from the
							whole tenor of his observations than from the direct proposition which
							he made— My inference was that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward’s
							mission was to take the soundings of Antimasonry in Massachusetts in
							behalf of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin van Buren</persRef>; and
							that the first step towards it is to turn over the Antimasonic votes
							here to Marcus Morton, for the Office of Governor.— I dined with D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> George Parkman who urgently invited me to
							dine with him again next Thursday; the day when the Overseers of Harvard
							University are to meet— There were this day at the dinner <persRef
								ref="thatcher-peter">judge Peter O. Thacher</persRef> and <persRef

							and two outside passengers, all except <persRef ref="bartlett-ibrahim"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ibrahim Bartlett</persRef>
							Strangers to me.— I found Charles, his wife and two children at my

							thunder shower after we were in bed.</p>

						<p>Morning visit to my Garden and Nursery— Abridged by visitors— <persRef

							astonishment at finding all the young men, whom he had treated with the
							greatest kindness combining in the Senior Class against him— He said he
							should not have been more surprized if <persRef
								ref="quincy-edmund4;quincy-josiah">his two Sons</persRef> had come
							into his Study and knock’d him down— This is almost identically the
							saying of <persRef ref="pompey">Pompey</persRef> the great, when asked
							what if <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef> should cross the
							Rubicon— He repeated also the reminiscence of the Proctor who was with
							him when <persRef ref="u">Barnwall</persRef> of South-Carolina, came to
							his Study and announced himself as from the nullification State— It was
							to him and on that occasion that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy
							told him he expected he would give trouble to the faculty, and that he
							made some remark upon the licentiousness of Southern Scholars, which
							this young man has perverted into an invidious charge against him— I
							read to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy the Report and
							Resolutions, which the Committee of the Overseers have agreed to report
							to the Board, and told him that I had prepared a long Report, which no
							other member of the Committee had entirely approved, and to which
								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H. Everett</persRef> were
							so strongly opposed that I had thought best to withdraw it— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy was not satisfied with the third
							Resolution proposed by the Committee and appeared exceedingly averse to
							any recommendation to discontinue the Prosecution of the Indictments,
							against the three Sophomores at Concord; unless they would plead that
							they would not contend with the Commonwealth— He said that two of them
							had been dismissed from the University and therefore could not now
							submit it to its Laws— This I did not know, and think it does not appear
							from the Statement of the President, or the two previous Circulars of
							the Faculty— I told him that the third Resolution, was not in the form
							that I had proposed and that I had assented <pb n="380" type="ms"/>to it
							only that a report should be presented for consideration of the Board,
							to which all the members present of the Committee could agree— I had
							thus far yielded my own opinion, but should readily acquiesce in a
							different modification of the Resolution, or even to postpone it till
							after Commencement— I requested him particularly to come prepared with
							all the precedents which had heretofore occurred of prosecutions at Law,
							against Students, which had been commenced, and with authentic testimony
							to what stage the prosecutions had been carried; and he said he would— I
							fear that from some of the peculiarities of his temper, and from a
							hesitancy in his elocution the Students have lost the feeling of
							reverence for his character which is essential to the preservation of
							authority; and that it will be difficult if possible for him to recover
							it— The very familiarity of personal intercourse with him and his family
							which he has allowed to the Students beyond all former example has I
							believe contributed to weaken his influence over them. After he left me
							I returned to my Garden, which exercised me for another hour— I resumed
							this afternoon the Discourse on the Life and Character of <persRef

							of willow—and I transplanted from the Garden to the Nursery, three roots

							from Braintree came a second time for taxes for the years 1831 and 1832.
							with a specification by two of the Assessors that it was partly for

							I had not an inch of Land in Braintree that ever belonged to Norton
							Quincy, I could not pay taxes upon any such land— He said it was too

							receive only eight Cents for collecting the tax, and intimated that he
							would sell my land. I called <persRef ref="kirk-john">John

						<p>The morn was lowering, with rain, and <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> not inclining to go to Boston I went in the

							corner near the Stone Blacksmith’s Shop, and <persRef
								ref="gulliver-anthony">Gulliver’s</persRef> Brook in Milton to its
							issue, on the Neponset Bridge road— It is a few rods short of two
							miles—and <persRef ref="gillet-simon">Gillet’s</persRef> average
							travelling is at the rate of 7 1/2 minutes to a Mile, or eight miles an
							hour— Arriving at Charles’s Office, I met <persRef ref="parkman-george"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Parkman</persRef> as I
							alighted, and he reminded me of my engagement to dine with him— At ten I
							attended at the Council chamber the Meeting of the Overseers of Harvard
							University— But <persRef ref="pierce-john">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pierce</persRef> the Secretary did not attend the
							Meeting: he had not sent the Book of Records of the proceedings of the
							Board, and had advertised the Meeting for eleven O’Clock— There were not
							a sufficient number of members present to open the Meeting, and an hour
							of time was lost— When opened, presided by <persRef
								ref="armstrong-samuel">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Governor
								Armstrong</persRef>, he called for the Report of the Committee on
							the degrees to be conferred. <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander
								H. Everett</persRef> Chairman of that Committee not being present,
							the Report of the Committee on <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President
								Quincy’s</persRef> Statement was called for, and I read and handed
							it in, at the table. <persRef ref="sullivan-richard">Richard
								Sullivan</persRef> rose, and said he had expected a different sort
							of Report, and wished to know why the Committee had asked to be
							discharged from the instruction to prepare an address to the Public— He
							was not satisfied with the Report presented, and could not give his
							assent to the third Resolution— He wished to know why the Committee had
							made such a Report as that which had been read— I then stated that there
							had been two Meetings of the Committee— That I had first sent to
								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>, President
							Quincy’s Statement, and a copy of the commission and instruction to the
							Committee requesting him to prepare a report to be submitted to the
							Committee— He had returned the President’s Statement, and agreed to
							attend a meeting of the Committee; but declined preparing the Report,
							and expressed his regret at having been placed on the Committee, which
							owing to his being much engaged in other business, was much to his
							inconvenience— I had been thus under the necessity of preparing a
							Report, according to my own impressions upon the subject, which accorded
							altogether with those expressed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Sullivan— This report I had read to the Committee at their first
							Meeting, and it had unfortunately not met the approbation of any one of
							my Colleagues on the Committee— Two of the members, Governor Lincoln,
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett were decidedly opposed to
							some of its principles— A third doubted of the expediency of the
							prosecution at Law, of the Students, and all objected to the severity of
							animadversion, in the Report upon the conduct of the Students, and
							particularly upon the Circular of the Senior Class. It was not for me
							under these Circumstances to press the Report upon the Committee. I
							accordingly withdrew it, and afterwards, with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> A H. Everett, and then with the other members of the
							Committee except Governor Lincoln, at a second Meeting, assented to the
							Report and Resolutions which had been read, to bring the subject in
							proper form before the Board for their consideration. I had at the
							direction of the Committee, sent a copy of this Report to Governor
							Lincoln, and had this morning received from him an answer to my Letter,
							declaring his approbation of the first and third Resolutions, and his
							dissent from the second— The third having been now so modified, as to
							have removed his objections. <pb n="382" type="ms"/><persRef
								ref="pickman-benjamin2">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Pickman</persRef> stated that his views had in general concurred
							with mine. That he should have preferred my report to that which had
							been presented, and had wished only for the softening of some of its
							expressions— <persRef ref="codman-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Codman</persRef> said that he too approved of my report in the main,
							but had entertained doubts with regard to the Prosecutions at Law, and
							had agreed to the presented report for the sake of unanimity— Alexander
							H. Everett made a Speech of near half an hour in favour of the presented
							report— He regretted the movement of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Sullivan which had called forth the Statement by me of the proceedings
							in the Committee—and gave the reasons of his disapprobation of the
							prosecution at Law— He thought the Government of the University stood
							towards the Students in loco parentis, and it was not for them to
							institute against them prosecutions at Law— He likened the relations
							between teachers and pupils to those between father and Son—between
							Husband and wife; between guardian and ward, and thought that wherever
							there was a personal and intimate relation between a mere trespasser and
							the cardinal Law of the State, he thought the party offended should not
							be the prosecutor— He enlarged upon this position with some ingenuity
							and earnestness, but without apparent impression upon any member
							present. He objected with great warmth against making the Resolution
							recommending the withdrawal of the prosecutions contingent upon the
							entire restoration of order— He said it was in the highest degree unjust
							to make the fate of persons under prosecution before a Court of Law to
							depend upon the conduct of any other persons than themselves— I replied
							to the parts of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett’s Speech, which
							assailed the principles sustained in my Report; and Everett intimated
							that if I had insisted upon them, there would have been a Counterreport
							exhibiting the views of that part of the Committee who dissented from
							mine— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sullivan moved that the Draught of
							a Report prepared by me should be laid on the Table— This gave rise to
							some discussion, and to various motions. <persRef ref="lowell-charles"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowell</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="fay-samuel">judge Fay</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="austin-james">James T. Austin</persRef> replied to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett’s argument against the Prosecution
							at Law. Austin especially referred to many cases of prosecutions by
							persons even in the relations of husband and wife against each other—
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowell referred to the Law of the
							University which makes it the duty of the Faculty to prosecute for
							trespasses which they cannot detect or punish themselves—and judge Fay
							expatiated upon the odious character of the privilege of exemption
							claimed by the Students. <persRef ref="savage-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Savage</persRef> made a few remarks,
							and my draught of a Report was called for by several members— I said I
							had it in my pocket— That if the Board thought proper to hear it, I
							would read it now, even in its present condition—reserving to myself the
							right of revising it hereafter— But it would take upwards of an hour to
							read it; and the debate was running on, till past one O’Clock— A motion
							then was made to discharge the Committee from all further consideration
							of the subject, and to refer the Report already made, my draught and all
							the papers to a new Committee of which I should be Chairman, to report
							at an adjourned Meeting of the Board, next Monday at ten O’Clock AM.
							this motion prevailed, and Richard Sullivan, James Savage, the <persRef
								ref="francis-convers">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Convers
								Francis</persRef> and <persRef ref="cotton-john2">John
								Cotton</persRef>, were the members appointed on the Committee— James

								n="383" type="ms"/>the Chairman, but were excused at their own
							request, being much occupied about the riotous destruction of the
							Ursuline Convent at Charlestown— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Alexander H. Everett then made the report of the Committee upon the
							degrees to be conferred at the Commencement, all of which were approved—
							A Letter was received from <persRef ref="spooner-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> William Spooner</persRef> with his
							resignation, from age and infirmity, of his Seat at the Board. They
							adjourned about a Quarter before two— I asked the members of the new
							Committee to stay; except M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cotton, who was
							gone— I put all the papers into the hands of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Savage,—and then it was agreed that the rest of the
							Committee should without my presence meet and examine my Report; propose
							such amendments and alterations as they shall think proper, and then
							transmit the papers to me by Sunday noon: and that I should meet them on
							Monday Morning at nine O’Clock. I dined with D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> George Parkman, and at 4. afternoon the State called for me
							and I returned to Quincy by six— <persRef ref="shattuck-george">D<hi

								Mackintosh</persRef>, who is a claimant for a Pension for having

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Mackintosh’s claim has not been admitted

								ref="edwards-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards</persRef>
							of the Pension Office stating that there is no Evidence at the
							Department that there was a Corps of Artificers in the Army. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Child had two parcels of depositions and
							other papers to prove M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mackintosh’s
							Services, and among them was a Resolution of the Congress at Watertown,
							rejecting a petition from the Corps of Artificers for an increase of
							their pay, and referring to the rates of pay fixed by the Resolution
							establishing the Corps— I suggested to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Child the expediency of examining the Journals of that Congress, for the
							record establishing the Corps, where the terms of engagement thus
							subsequently referred to must be found. He said he would make the
							search, and then send on the papers to the Commissioner of Pensions, or
							keep them till I shall go on to Washington, next winter— I said that as
							to the existence of the Corps of Artificers, it had been admitted by the
								<persRef ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of War</persRef>, upon
							explanations verbally given by me to him, in the case of Solomon Thayer,
							whose Pension had been consequently increased by his order— I invited
							them to breakfast with us; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Child said
								<persRef ref="child-lydia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Child</persRef> would be waiting for him, as he had promised to

								>Charles</persRef> went into Boston, and returned to dine— I worked
							at weeding three hours in the garden and Nursery where I have had a

							other approving the proceedings of the faculty—omitting entirely that
							which recommended that the proceedings on the prosecution at Law
								<unclear>should</unclear> be discontinued—and they propose to
							expunge from my report the passages which allude to that recommendation—
							In this I shall readily acquiesce, as in the course of the discussion
							yesterday it was mentioned that there had been a Meeting of the Senior
							Class the day before, thinly attended, which had adjourned to meet again
							to-morrow, to determine whether they would perform their parts on
							Commencement day or not— I stated that I considered those meetings
							themselves as unlawful, and as proving that the third Resolution

						<p>Visited my garden and Nursery, but the heat of the Sun slackened my work;

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> a young preacher at large, who has been settled at
							New-York, and parted from his Congregation there— He preached here four
							Sundays in the month of June and has now engaged for two Sundays more—
							His morning text was from Romans 2.14 “For when the Gentiles, which have
							not the Law, do by nature, the things contained in the Law, these,
							having not the law, are a law unto themselves.” The general doctrine
							expounded and illustrated by the discourse was, what to be <pb n="385"
								type="ms"/>understood by the words doing <hi rend="italic">by</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">nature</hi>, the things contained in the Law; it was a
							regulated, virtuous nature; and not the indulgence of vicious Passions—
							The original doctrine was that of the Stoics, and I believe there is
							something of it in <persRef ref="butler-joseph">Bishop Butler</persRef>—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s delivery is cool, and not
							without animation— He reads well— His reasoning is sound; his morality
							pure— His deficiency like that of almost all the young men of his
							profession is of pathos— His afternoon Sermon, was from Titus 2.11. “For
							the grace of God, that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, 12.
							Teaching us, that denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live
							soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.”— The argument
							was that in this passage, the practice of virtue was represented as
							taught by the grace of God; and it was ingeniously sustained— I read the
							first Sermon of the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>— Upon the Affliction caused by
							the death of those whom we love— I expected much from this title, but
							was disappointed— The text is from 1. Thessalonians 4.13–18. and the
							preacher instead of confining himself to his proper subject which is
							contained in the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and 14<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> verses, launches into the difficulties
							of the subsequent verses and never extricates himself from them— He
							perplexes a subject in itself deeply pathetic with controversial
							commentary upon the specific mode of resurrection described by the
							Apostle; and so unintelligible, that he says he has particular reasons
							for believing this to be the very passage to which <persRef ref="peter"
								>Peter</persRef> alludes, in the assertion that there are in the
							Epistles of <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef> some things hard to be
							understood— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt and <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> dined with us— <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef> came in the
							afternoon after public worship, and read to me a long paper that he had
							prepared to deliver at the Board of Overseers of the University,
							containing references to former cases of prosecutions at Law, of
							Students, from the year 1749 down to the present time; with a narrative
							of the disorderly state of the University when he was appointed
							President, of the measures which he took for the restoration of order,
							and of the alteration in 1829 of the Law of the University respecting
							the prosecution of Students in the Courts of Law— It had been previously
							discretionary, with the Faculty— It is now made their positive duty, in
							cases of aggravated trespasses. There was also, a very earnest argument
							to shew the indispensable necessity of resorting to the tribunals, for
							the preservation of Peace, Property and Persons belonging to the
							University— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy said he had prepared
							this paper in consequence of my saying that he would be called upon
							before the Board of Overseers to justify the prosecutions at Law. He had
							understood me to mean, that I should call upon him; and that I was
							adverse to the prosecutions— I told him I had not intended to call upon
							him, unless it should be to answer objections from other quarters— I had
							wished to apprize him of questions which I knew would be made, and
							particularly to urge him to come armed with all the precedents that he
							could collect, in answer to the charge of innovation— I was therefore
							gratified to find that he had prepared this paper, and hoped it would be
							read to the Board of Overseers, and preserved among their Records—that
							my own Report was altogether in the same Spirit, and that it was
							entirely approved by the present Committee, and would be presented to
							the board to morrow. I asked him what information he had of the
							proceedings of the Senior Class— He said they had had a second meeting
							yesterday; and had passed and rescinded two or three Resolutions; but
							had finally resolved that those who had parts for Commencement, should
							perform them; but that they should all refuse to receive their degrees.
							I said that this <pb n="386" type="ms"/>might perhaps occasion some
							riotous disturbance to the performances, or on the Evening of
							commencement day; and I hoped that he and the faculty would be prepared
							for any such event as might occur— He said he would call a meeting of
							the faculty tomorrow morning, and consult with them, upon the proper
							course to be pursued. He said he had been constantly, and ably supported
							by <persRef ref="ware-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ware</persRef> in every measure adopted by the faculty hitherto—but
							that he had great difficulties with the younger members even of that
							body— That three of the Tutors had been opposed to almost every measure
							adopted, and that the most important of all, the delay to give out the
							Parts for commencement, till after the Senior Class were separated, had
							been carried only by a majority of one— He specially complained of the
							Tutor <persRef ref="mckean-henry">M’Kean</persRef>, son of a half-crazy
								<persRef ref="mckean-joseph">professor</persRef> there, now
							deceased, and who had himself been confined as a lunatic within eighteen
							months before he was appointed a Tutor—though this fact had been but
							recently made known to him— There was a long and copious Thunder shower
							towards Evening, and I invited M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy to
							take a bed with us, but he declined, and said he must at all hazards
							return this Evening to Cambridge</p>

							the Savings Bank Office, for <persRef ref="savage-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Savage</persRef>, who went with me to
							the Council Chamber at 9 O’Clock—the other members of the Committee,

							<persRef ref="cotton-john2">Cotton</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="francis-convers">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Convers
								Francis</persRef> were already there— The Committee agreed
							unanimously to my draught of Report, with several amendments, to which I
							assented. They agreed also to propose a Resolution, as a substitute for
							that which recommended the withdrawal of the Prosecution, which it was
							now proposed to strike out— The new Resolution I proposed to stand as
							the first, and declared that the Students of Harvard University have no
							just or equitable claim to exemption from prosecution in the Courts of
							Law, for trespasses upon property or against Persons, whether belonging
							to the University or otherwise— To this Resolution, after some objection
							from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis, supported by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sullivan the Committee, at last
							unanimously agreed— At ten O’Clock the board of Overseers met. 21
							members present, and I read my report, which took an hour and a quarter—
							After it was read, and the three Resolutions with which it concluded,
							the <persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Governor</persRef> as Chairman enquired what disposal should be made
							of the Report, <persRef ref="pickman-benjamin2">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Pickman</persRef>, after a pause of
							two or three minutes moved that it be accepted— <persRef
								ref="welles-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Welles</persRef> made a short Speech; commending the Report,
							approving the motion that it should be accepted, and moved further that
							it be entered at large, on the Records of the Board, printed and
							extensively circulated— This gave rise to a debate which continued about
							two hours— <persRef ref="willard-sydney">Sidney Willard</persRef> moved
							to strike out from the Report, every allusion to the withdrawal of the
							prosecutions; but was not seconded, and did not persist in the motion—
							The debate became quite desultory; <persRef ref="davis-john">judge John
								Davis</persRef> approved the Sentiments of the Report, though he
							said it was a melancholy one; but thought it an unfortunate time for its
							publication— He saw an inconsistency, in adopting so severe a censure
							upon the conduct of the young men, at the very time when the honours of
							the University were to be conferred upon them— He suggested the
							expediency of holding no Commencement the present year— He spoke of the
							recent Meetings held by the members of the Senior Class, and enquired if
								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef> had any
							information of their proceedings. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy
							said his information was not very precise. There <pb n="387" type="ms"
							/>were fourteen members of the Class, who had taken no part in any of
							the disturbances; six who had not attended the recent Meetings; these
							twenty were ready to perform their parts and take their degrees— There
							were twenty-eight who had held two Meetings last week, and passed and
							rescinded several Resolutions— Their last Resolution was that those who
							had parts should perform them; but that all should refuse to accept
							their degrees— This they had done, in the expectation that they should
							receive their degrees the next year with the eight members of the Class
							who have already been declared to have forfeited their degrees for the
							present year— The faculty had therefore had a Meeting this Morning, and
							resolved, that the President should send for every individual members of
							the Class, and demand of him, whether he would perform his part, and
							receive his degree—and in case of his failing to answer satisfactorily
							on both points, the President should inform him that he will have
							neither part nor degree, and that the faculty will never recommend him
							hereafter, for the reception of a degree— There now ensued various
							propositions, and at last a vote to take a question upon each of the
							three Resolutions appended to the Report, separately, and they were all
							unanimously adopted— Then came the question upon the acceptance of the
							Report— <persRef ref="austin-james">James T. Austin</persRef> proposed
							that the President should send for the whole Class and read to them the
							Report and the Resolutions, and give them an opportunity to reply to
							them. He spoke of the Report in extravagant and invidious terms of
							commendation— Thought some of its expressions ought to have been
							softened, and said it was the severest punishment that had ever been
							inflicted upon any Student of Harvard— He repeated indeed the remarks
							made by <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>, at the
							first meeting of the former Committee, in language so identical, that I
							concluded Lincoln had told him what passed at that Meeting— <persRef
								ref="shaw-lemuel">Chief Justice Shaw</persRef> answered M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Austin very fully— He said the Report was
							no punishment, nor was it to be understood as such— The punishments had
							been inflicted by the Government of the University— The Report was a
							review of all the transactions both of the immediate Government and of
							the Students—made by a Committee of the Overseers to them— It spoke of
							the past conduct of these young men with severity—this was not part of
							their punishment, nor so intended—it was incidental to the exposition of
							the condition of the University, which the Committee was charged to
							present, but formed no part of the punishment— I observed that it was
							analogous to the remarks which it is usual for judges to make, on
							pronouncing sentence upon a criminal. Those remarks might occasionally
							be felt by the criminal, as a punishment more severe than the sentence
							itself, but formed no part of the punishment— I added that the
							Resolutions as adopted were th act of the Overseers, and expressive of
							their Sense— That the Report was merely the act of their Committee
							addressed to them, and at their disposal— And I hoped if the board
							should direct that it should be printed, they would not permit its
							publication; for I believed its first effect would be to irritate and
							inflame the temper of the young men, censured in it; make them pass an
							unpleasant Commencement day which was far from my wish or intention, and
							perhaps even excite them further to fresh disorders, injurious to
							themselves— <persRef ref="lowell-charles">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowell</persRef> concurred, in these views; he wished the acceptance
							of the report now, and its publication hereafter. His hope <pb n="388"
								type="ms"/>was that its tendency would be to prevent the recurrence
							of such disorders hereafter, and having himself a Son to enter the
							present year, it would be with terror, rather than with satisfaction, if
							he could not indulge this hope. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy
							said it would be impossible for him to call the Class together and read
							this paper before commencement morning; the Students themselves being
							occupied with their own preparations for Commencement; and the
							inauguration of three Professors which was fixed for tomorrow
							necessarily absorbing his time— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Austin’s
							motion was not supported, and the Report was accepted with only one
							dissenting voice, which was that of judge Davis— He said his objection
							was only to the time and not to the Sentiments in the Report— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Savage moved that President Quincy should
							cause the publication to be made after Commencement; but D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowell made some objection to this, and I
							said I should be content to leave it at the discretion of the President,
							upon which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Savage withdrew his motion,
							and the meeting was dissolved. I asked President Quincy that when my
							Report should be printed, the vote for which was unanimous, he would
							have a proof sheet of it sent to me for revisal—he promised that he
							would— He shewed me a Letter from one of the refractory Seniors named
								<persRef ref="labranche-drausin">La Branche</persRef>, one of the
							first in the Class; full of compunction and bitter regret— Acknowledging
							and thanking M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy for the kindness
							which he had uniformly shewn him; and lamenting the necessity under
							which he felt himself of declining to take his degree but declaring that
							he could not conform to the vote of the Class, to perform their parts
							and then refuse the degree, and that he should therefore not perform his
							part. A curious Letter, and strong exemplification of the convulsive
							struggle in the mind, between the sense of right, the consciousness of
							wrong, and the cowardly Spirit of dishonest combination— Immediately
							after the Meeting of the Overseers adjourned, I went to my Son Charles’s
							Office, and we returned to Quincy to dine— President Quincy had
							expressed himself, extremely well satisfied, and grateful for the
							support given to him and to the Government of the College in my report—
							After dinner I visited my garden and nursery; Evening visit from
								<persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter
								Whitney</persRef>; and walked with him to <persRef ref="adams-ann"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams’s</persRef>, where
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;adams-abigail4">our
								Ladies</persRef> had been to tea—and where we found assembled a
							company of twenty persons— We came home about 9 O’Clock.</p>

							upon the production and growth of Plants. I propose for the future not
							to indulge myself with the idle pleasures of my garden till after
							dinner, when I find it more irksome to write, and even to read— The

								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy’s</persRef> Study—
							The judges of the <persRef ref="boylston-nicholas">Boylston</persRef>
							prize Declamations present were twelve—we proceeded to the new Meeting
							House, the old one being now demolished—and took Seats in the two
							central pews— The competitors for the prizes were eight— Six of the
							present Senior Class, and two graduates of the present year— No Juniors;
							the whole of that Class with the exception of three having been
							dismissed. There was much equality among the performers; and no one of
							them very good— On returning to the President’s Study—one of the two
							first prizes was at the second ballot awarded to <persRef
								ref="cabot-george2">George Cabot</persRef>. At the first ballot he
							had six votes without any previous comparison<pb n="390" type="ms"/>of
							opinions between the judges— <persRef ref="dennis-hiram"
								>Dennis</persRef> had four and there were two blanks. At the second
							ballot Cabot had seven votes— I then made it a question, whether the
							second first prize should be conferred, which gave rise to a short
							debate— <persRef ref="walker-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Walker</persRef> of Charlestown said he had put in a blank at the
							first ballot, because he thought neither of the first prizes ought to be
							conferred— The speaking was all good; but none of it excellent— <persRef
								ref="story-joseph">Judge Story</persRef> was very ardently of a
							different opinion— It was found after some discussion that the vote was
							six and six, upon which came a question whether this was a decision to
							give or to refuse the prize— Judge Story and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Walker now changed sides—the judge thinking the majority
							necessary to grant, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walker to deny—
								<persRef ref="gray-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> F. C.
								Gray</persRef> read the rule of the founder which was that the
							judges might if they thought proper withhold the prizes— And the
							affirmative being to withhold, the tie did not make a vote, and the
							second first prize was awarded to Dennis. Both these were Seniors— At
							the first ballot for the first second prize there was no majority for
							any one— It was then voted to ballot for the three at once—and there
							were eleven for <persRef ref="wellington-hiram">Wellington</persRef>,
							one of the two graduates; 11 for <persRef ref="blake-harrison"
								>Blake</persRef>, and 9 for <persRef ref="west-benjamin2"
								>West</persRef>, both Seniors— I had proposed that in awarding the
							prizes there should be some consideration of the taste and judgment
							exercised in the selection of the pieces for declamation—this was
							vehemently opposed by judge Story, and raised another debate— I
							mentioned as an instance, one of the pieces delivered this day; not well
							selected; and although as well spoken as any of the others, I had not
							voted to award a prize to the Speaker; and he had not in fact a single
							vote— I urged also that one of the prizes should be awarded to one of
							the graduates, on account of the circumstances in which the Class was
							situated towards the Government of the University and before the public—
							One of the second prizes was accordingly awarded to Wellington. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy observed that neither of the two
							graduate competitors had taken any part in the late disturbances— It was
							half past twelve when the judges returned to the Meeting House, and then
							took Seats on the Stage— The auditory was assembled for the ΦB.K.
							performances, and the house was crowded— The Oration was delivered by
								<persRef ref="gardiner-william">William Howard Gardiner</persRef>, a
							lawyer in Boston, son of the late <persRef ref="gardiner-john2">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Silvester John Gardiner</persRef>
							and was an admirable defence and vindication of the Study of classical
							learning— It was two full hours in the delivery, and not much too long—
							It was admirably well spoken, and rivetted the attention of the auditory
							almost to the last moment. Never was the cause of classical Literature
							pleaded with more eloquence and beauty— The Poem by <persRef
								ref="emerson-ralph">Ralph Waldo-Emerson</persRef> was a slovenly
							performance, the only merit of which was its brevity. It was five
							minutes past 3 when the performances closed, and I went immediately into
							Boston, walked round the Borders of the common, reflecting on the
							various turns of fate below, and especially on all the vicissitudes
							which have befallen me, since on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of

								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Levi</persRef>, whom

								>r</hi> Yeadon spoke with some concern of the political condition of
							South-Carolina, where the nullification and Union parties are still at
							issue with each other, and still mutually inveterate— I observed that in

							adversaries.— Levi said that if so, <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s</persRef> doctrine was the
							cause of it; and that if the Union party had not held out a strong
							adhesion to State rights, they would have been officers without an army—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Yeadon said they had much anxiety
							about the appointment of a judge of the Supreme Court, in the place of
								<persRef ref="johnson-william">Judge Johnson</persRef>, and hoped it

							offered the Office of Secretary of War to Col<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi> Drayton, by whom it was declined—and that Drayton was the

							Session of the Legislature, the nullification party would call a
							convention of the People, and thereby procure an Amendment to the
							Constitution of the State, prescribing the test Oath to establish the
							State authorities as the only Sovereign powers in this Union— And he
							alluded to the apprehension always prevailing in the South, that the
							People of the North have a perpetual propensity to promote the abolition
							of Slavery in the South— This Ghost I believe will haunt them, till they
							bring it up in reality— I said I had no longer the confidence in the

							once in twenty years— I asked him the cause of his aversion to

							revised the proof, which as usual much needed it, and he took the papers

							there had been admitted 76 students into the Freshman Class; and that a

							education of my seedling plants, presents in miniature, almost as many
							difficulties, and problems to solve, as the education of children at
							School and College. Spent the Evening in my Library; busied with small

								Lunt</persRef> in the morning from 2. Timothy 1.7. “For God hath not
							given us the Spirit of fear; but of power, of love, and of a sound
							mind.”— And in the afternoon from Galatians 5.6 “For in Jesus Christ
							neither Circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision: but Faith
							which worketh by Love.” The two discourses appeared to be parts of one
							Sermon; the subject of which was the Spirit of Christianity— The
							illustrations of the morning were chiefly confined to the negative
							portion of the text, shewing that the predominating principle of the
							gospel was not <hi rend="italic">Fear</hi>—and those of the afternoon,
							were to mark the discrimination, between that Faith which worketh by
							Love, and other modes of Faith. There was little or no direct allusion
							to the Calvinistic doctrines of election, reprobation, and atonement,
							but the bearing of the whole argument was—These doctrines are all
							founded in the Spirit of Fear—and the Faith, which they exact is not
							that which worketh by Love <pb n="393" type="ms"/>The texts were both
							well selected, and the deductions from them very ingeniously drawn— The
							scope of both the discourses was closely argumentative; to prove that
							the vital spirit of Christianity is not Fear, but Love— There was a
							notice of a Town-Meeting at 4 <unclear>to</unclear>morrow afternoon, to
							consider an application for a road, to pass through my Penn’s hill Land.
