						<dateline>Tuesday 1. April 1835</dateline>
						<p><date>1 V:30. </date>Tuesday. I received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="turner-samuel">S. A Turner</persRef> of Scituate, with a
							Petition signed by 750 names of that neighbourhood, praying for a Canal
							at the mouth of Taunton-river— At the meeting of the House, I asked
							unanimous permission to present it— <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis
								Williams</persRef> moved to suspend the rules, for the reception of
							Memorials and Petitions intercepted by the sparring debates of
							yesterday—upon this the vote was only 24 to 15. No Quorum— Members
							coming in I renewed my request for unanimous consent which was
							refused—vote taken again No Quorum. Call of the House demanded by
								<persRef ref="lytle-robert">Lytle</persRef> of Ohio, and refused—
							Call of the House again demanded by <persRef ref="grennell-george"
								>George Grennell</persRef>, who asks for the yeas and nays. Carried.
							101 to 18: Making with the <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew"
								>Speaker</persRef> by his construction a Quorum— My name was called,
							and then the call was superseded, members constantly coming in— I asked
							again unanimous consent to present my Petition from Scituate. No—said
							one voice. I moved that the rule should be suspended— Carried 96 to
							47—just rubbed through— My Petition was received, and without reading
							referred to the Committee on Roads and Canals.— Lewis Williams then
							moved the suspension of the Rules, for the reception of Petitions and
							Memorials from the States, and calls for the yeas and nays—rejected 82
							to 84. <persRef ref="parker-james2">Parker</persRef> of New-Jersey asks
							to introduce a Resolution and fails— <persRef ref="archer-william"
								>Archer</persRef> from the Committee of foreign Affairs made a
							report recommending the purchase of <persRef ref="washington-george"
								>Washington’s</persRef> papers, and proposing to provide for the
							payment by an amendment to the General Appropriation-Bill. <persRef
								ref="jarvis-leonard">Jarvis</persRef> from the Committee on the
							Public Buildings reported an amendatory Appropriation Bill— The Speaker
							took up the commutation pension Bill, and <persRef ref="marshall-thomas"
								>Thomas M. Marshall</persRef> resumed his argument commenced on the
								6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of last Month, and spoke till 1.
							O’Clock without finishing— Then the Speaker read a Message from the
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>, with a Report
							from the <persRef ref="mclane-louis">Secretary of State</persRef> on the
							counterfeiting of foreign Coins—referred to the Committee on the

								ref="wilde-richard">Wilde’s</persRef> Amendment to the first
							Resolution reported by the Committee of Ways and Means.— <persRef
								ref="hardin-benjamin">Benjamin Hardin</persRef> of Kentucky spoke
							three hours— After which <persRef ref="chilton-thomas">Chilton</persRef>
							moved to adjourn—rejected by yeas and nays 68 to 82— Ten minutes after,
							another motion to adjourn rejected 76 to 84— After another 10 minutes
							third motion to adjourn, carried 82 to 80— Spent the Evening at
							whist.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="blair-james">James Blair</persRef> a member of the House of
							Representatives from South-Carolina shot himself last Evening at his
							lodgings at <persRef ref="dowson-alfred">Dowson’s</persRef> N. 1. after
							reading part of an affectionate Letter from <persRef
								ref="blair-charlotte">his wife</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="murphy-john">Governor Murphy</persRef> of Alabama, who was
							alone in the chamber with him, and a fellow lodger with him at the same
							house—</p>
						<p>At the Meeting of the House, <persRef ref="mcduffie-george">George
								M’Duffie</persRef>, announced the decease of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Blair: alluding to the Catastrophe of the death of <persRef
								ref="bouldin-thomas">Thomas T Bouldin</persRef>, and said that the
							decease of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Blair had been equally sudden—
							He expressed his disapprobation of the practice of pronouncing
							panegyrics upon members who have ceased to live, and are beyond the
							reach alike of censure and of praise— That panegyrics were useless to
							those to whom the person was known, and uninteresting to those who knew
							him not— He moved that the usual Resolutions on similar occasions should
							be adopted— That the members of the House would attend the funeral at 4
							O’Clock this afternoon— That they would testify their respect for the
							memory of James Blair, by wearing crape thirty days— That a Message be
							sent to the Senate, announcing the Event; and that a Committee of <pb
								n="286" type="ms"/>Arrangements be appointed to superintend the
							funeral— The house then adjourned— Poor Blair— The indifference and
							insincerity of M’Duffie’s remarks were as unfeeling as if his heart had
							been of marble— There is a gloomy churlishness in the character of
							M’Duffie averse enough to Panegyric, but if Blair had been of his own
							political party, he would have lauded him to the skies— Blair was a man
							of amiable natural disposition, of excellent feelings, of sterling good
							sense, and of brilliant parts, irredeemably ruined by the single vice of
							intemperance, which had crept upon him insensibly to himself, till it
							had bloated his body to a mountain—prostrated his intellect, and
							vitiated his temper to madness— He had paid three hundred dollars fine,
							for beating and breaking the bones of <persRef ref="green-duff">Duff
								Green</persRef>, because he had charged the Union party of
							South-Carolina, with being Tories.— He had discharged a pistol, at an
							actress on the Theatre at Washington, from one of the boxes— He had
							within the last ten days given the lie to <persRef ref="pinckney-henry"
								>Henry L Pinckney</persRef> while speaking in his place in the House
							of Representatives, and he was in the constant habit of bringing a
							loaded pistol with him to the House— The chances were quite equal that
							he should have shot almost any other man than himself. Yet he was one of
							the most kind hearted men in the world; a tender and affectionate
							husband and father, and has left a wife devoted to him, and <persRef
								ref="blair-lovick">children</persRef> to whom his death is perhaps a
							blessing— It was no doubt a difficult task for M’Duffie to announce his
							decease to the House in an appropriate manner— But the expedient of
							evading all note of sympathy with the feelings of his friends, by an
							affected and hollow pretence of dislike to all obituary panegyric was
							not felicitous— Half an hour after the adjournment of the House I went
							into the Senate chamber just as <persRef ref="preston-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Preston</persRef> of South-Carolina
							was moving their adjournment— I went home, and at four P.M—returned to
							the Capitol— The funeral Service was performed by the <persRef
								ref="stockton-thomas;hatch-f">two chaplains</persRef> of the two
							houses.— The Episcopal service was not read— It is by the principles of
							that Church interdicted in cases of suicide— I went to the Cemetery,
							near the Navy-Yard, in a Carriage with <persRef ref="mclene-jeremiah"
								>Jeremiah M’Lene</persRef> of Ohio, and two other members of the
							House— There was a short prayer made by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hatch at the common vault— I returned in the Hack, with my associates to
							the Capitol, and thence home in my barouche— Evening visit from <persRef
								ref="pope-nathaniel">judge Nathaniel Pope</persRef> of Illinois,
							with <persRef ref="lacy-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>Job Pierson</persRef> of the State of New-York and that the
							President asked him when the House would take the Question upon the

							upon it would only work further mischief, and that if the House would
							decide the question, in one week after, nothing more would be heard of

							whether he was within the bar, when his name was called— He asked to

							there were not two thirds so indulgent, and he lost his vote— The third
							Resolution, that the State Banks should be continued as depositories,
							and that Congress should further regulate the subject by Law, passed 117
							to 105— The fourth Resolution, directing the appointment of a Select
							Committee for a Bank investigation, with power to visit the Bank and any
							of its branches, was adopted by 175 to 42—the most exceptionable of all
							the Resolutions by the largest vote— The Committee appointed were

								ref="thomas-philemon">Thomas</persRef> of Louisiana moved that the

							his Resolution, that the reasons assigned by the Secretary for removing
							the deposites are insufficient and unsatisfactory—but <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> moved the house to adjourn, and the
							vote was carried— The Speaker declared the House adjourned— But upon an
							objection made he proceeded as if the House was yet in Session— I asked
							him if the House was adjourned or not— He said he had been <hi
								rend="italic">about</hi> to adjourn, but did not declare the House
							adjourned— I insisted that I had heard him declare the House adjourned.—
							He said he had been eight hours in the Chair, was very unwell, and
							scarcely knew <hi rend="italic">what</hi> he had done— This entirely
							disarmed me— The vote for adjournment was 124 to 73— About 8 O’Clock
							P.M— It was near 9 when I got home, utterly exhausted, and equally
							dispirited and desponding— The thought that an American house of
							Representatives should pass such a Resolution as the fourth, reported by
							the Committee of Ways and Means, mortifies me beyond expression— There
							was nothing more arbitrary or tyrannical in the domiciliary visits of
							Revolutionary France. It proves how feeble even in this Country are all
							the principles of Freedom, in collision with a current of popular
							prejudice or passion.</p>

							read the morning Service, for the first Sunday after Easter, and
							discourse from 1. Corinthians 6.20. “For ye are bought with a price:
							therefore glorify God in your body, and in your Spirit, which are
							God’s.” The doctrine of this chapter is that the Christian is not his
							own property, but belongs Soul and body to God—whence the Apostle draws
							an exhortation to moral practice. This illustration is an appeal to the
							reverence of the Corinthians for the sacred rights of property. But it
							is a figurative illustration— Property is of human institution and
							arises from the relations of men, with one another. There can be no
							relation of Property between Man and God— The Apostle therefore
							accommodates his discourse to the poverty of human language, and to the
							narrowness of human conceptions, and urges the abstinence from crime,
							under the sense of obligation to preserve the property of God— He
							rebukes them sharply too forgoing to Law with one another, before the
							unjust—or unbelievers, and asks why they do not sooner suffer themselves
							to be defrauded? This chapter has been the occasion of great usurpations
							by the ecclesiastical establishments of the Roman Catholic Church, and
							it is one of the numerous exemplifications of the gross perversion of
							the language of Scripture to the purposes of priestly avarice and
							ambition.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley gave notice that owing

						<p><date>7. VI. </date>Monday.— I finished the preparation of my manuscript
							so far as to send by my Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> to
							the National Intelligencer Office, about half of my intended Speech,
							with the extracts— Weather yet stormy.— At the House, it being the
							weekly day for receiving Memorials and Petitions, I found <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">Dutee J. Pearce</persRef> of Rhode-Island
							presenting Petitions from that State against the Bank of the United
							States, and against the restoration of the Deposites.— The call for the
							States was carried from Rhode-Island Southward through the Union—States
							and Territories—one hundred and forty eight Memorials Petitions, and
							authenticated Proceedings of public Meetings were presented.— Nearly one
							half of them being for or against the recharter of the Bank of the
							United States, and for or against the removal of the Deposites— In
							presenting these many of the members introduced them with short
							Speeches, and not unfrequently the Speech was against the purport of the
							Petition which it introduced. This is a singularity confined entirely to
							the Memorials and Petitions relating to the Bank of the United States—a
							subject of great party excitement and controversy.— The other subjects
							upon which the memorials are most numerous, are for Post-Offices and
							Post-roads, and Petitions for Pensions for Services during the
							Revolutionary War and since— <persRef ref="tracy-uriah">Uriah
								Tracy</persRef>
							<pb n="290" type="ms"/>thirty-years ago, used to say that the Soldiers
							of the Revolution claimants never died—that they were immortal. Had he
							lived to this time he would have seen that they multiply with the lapse
							of time— As Petitioners they are more numerous at every Session of
							Congress than before— And of late as some of them have died, their
							widows have begun to Petition, and this day there was a Petition from
							the Son of a deceased Pensioner praying that the Pension may be
							continued to him— There were also sundry Petitions from various parts of
							the Country for the abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia—
							These are always turned over to the Committee on the District, with a
							Chairman and a Majority of the Committee Slave-holders; and the House
							hear no more about them— <persRef ref="ellsworth-william">W. W.
								Ellsworth</persRef> of Connecticut this day presented one or two of
							these Petitions, and with much solemnity of manner said he wished the
							house to understand, that he concurred entirely in the views and
							Sentiments of the Petitioners, on this subject, and then moved that the
							Petition without reading should be referred to the Committee on the
							District of Columbia— There are Petitions for Appropriations for Roads
							and Canals, and other works of internal improvement—little encouraged at
							this time— Resolutions of State and Territorial Legislatures—among which
								<persRef ref="lyon-lucius">Lucius Lyon</persRef>, the territorial
							Delegate from Michigan presented Resolutions of the Legislative Council
							requesting that a census of the Territory may be taken, and that they
							may be authorised to hold an extra Session—referred to the Committee on
							the Territories— Also a Memorial concerning the Southern Boundary of the
							Territory, in controversy with the State of Ohio—lies on the Table—
								<persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gales</persRef> called me out, and spoke of the manner in which he
							proposed to print my intended Speech, in the Intelligencer, in such sort
							that it may be made up into a pamphlet— He gave me as a sample a copy of
								<persRef ref="wilde-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wilde’s</persRef> Speech— <persRef ref="corwin-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Corwin</persRef> of Ohio called me out
							and said he believed, if I wished to make my Speech on the deposite
							question, one of the members from the State of Ohio who voted with the
							majority would move a reconsideration of the second Resolution to give
							me the opportunity to speak— I declined for various reasons—one, that I
							was unwilling to accept a privilege not to be extended to others.
							Another, that I would be under no obligation, which the member making
							the offer might reproach me with, if he should dislike my Speech— A
							third was the useless waste of time in delivering a Speech which would
							not change one vote, after the question to which it applies has been
							decided by yeas and nays.—</p>

							At the House, among the Reports of Committees, was a Resolution, by
								<persRef ref="johnson-richard">Richard M. Johnson</persRef> from the
							Military Committee that in consequence of the time which has elapsed
							since the establishment of the present system of discipline for the
							army, and the improvements which have taken place in military science,
							it is expedient to have a revision of said system, and therefore, that
							the <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of War</persRef>, be directed to
							cause a revision thereof to be made, and the same to be reported to
							Congress at its next Session— This Resolution was read and agreed to by
							the House without opposition, and without one word of comment— It is a
							job for <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef>, who has
							laid this Country under regular contribution, for this same pretence of
							improved military discipline, for the last twenty-years—ever since the
							pacification of Ghent—as if military discipline was intended for nothing

							upon <persRef ref="mardis-samuel">Mardis’s</persRef> Resolution
							concerning the deposites in the State-Banks till the expiration of the
							first hour— Then <persRef ref="cramer-john">Cramer</persRef> continued
							his Speech upon the commutation Pension Bill, but soon gave way to
								<persRef ref="polk-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Polk</persRef>, who moved to proceed to the orders of the day and
							then to go into Committee of the whole upon the General <pb n="291"
								type="ms"/>Appropriation Bill. <persRef ref="hubbard-henry"
								>Hubbard</persRef> of New-Hampshire in the Chair— Polk moved to
							strike out an addition of 500 dollars to the Chief Clerk in the
							Department of State, which was done. <persRef ref="vinton-samuel"
								>Vinton</persRef> from the Committee on Patents moved an Addition of
							500 dollars to the machinist, and 300 dollars addition to the Messenger
							of the Patent Office— Rejected— I moved to strike out the clause, for a
							temporary Clerk in the Department of State, for one year, for arranging
							and preserving the Archives of the Department, with a Salary of 1400
							Dollars.— This gave rise to a debate which continued till about 4
							O’Clock, when the Committee rose, and reported that they had come to no
							Resolution—the house then adjourned— I addressed the Committee two or
							three times, on the motion to strike out the appropriation for an
							additional temporary Clerk, for one year—considering it as a shabby
							artifice to get in by indirection one Clerk more to transact the
							business of the Department. <persRef ref="vance-joseph">Vance</persRef>

							strike out the Appropriation for a temporary additional Clerk in the
							Department of State for one year was debated till half-past four

								<persRef ref="brown-john7">John W. Brown</persRef> of New-York,
							which after being much discussed he withdrew, upon a motion of H. Binney
							to strike out the word preserve and insert the words “to make an index”

								ref="binney-horace">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Binney</persRef>
							spoke twice in favour of the Appropriation, intimating that he did so,
							having assented to it in the Committee of Ways and Means— <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> made a long Speech in
							favour of my amendment, and was bitterly replied to, by <persRef
								ref="hawes-albert">Hawes</persRef> of Kentucky and by <persRef

								ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> spoke three or four times, and
								<persRef ref="archer-william">Archer</persRef> of Virginia made a
							warm Speech in honour of the <persRef ref="mclane-louis">Secretary of

							and the vote to strike out the clause as amended by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Binney’s motion was 89 to 70. The
							Committee rose, and the House, near 5. adjourned— My mind was deeply
							moved by these two days of debate.— The immediate object of which was
							very small, but the principle which it involved I thought of the deepest
							importance— Within the last five years Congress has been led into and
							irregular confused mode of connecting with the Appropriation Bills a

							movement is encouraging; but the evil usage will be constantly
							returning; and some nice discrimination will be necessary, to avoid
							excluding small expenditures of no importance, without admitting others—
							I took <persRef ref="stansbury-arthur">Stanbury</persRef> the Reporter

						<p><date>14. VI. </date>Monday.— In the Globe of this morning there is an
							Editorial Article headed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams and the
							Speaker, evidently written or dictated by the <persRef
								ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker Andrew Stevenson</persRef> himself—
							He controverts none of the facts stated in the Introduction to my
							Speech, but throws the blame of all his abuses in the Chair upon the
							House, and denies that there, was any collusion between him and <persRef
								ref="mason-john5">John Y. Mason</persRef> to give him the floor— The
							Article closes with a promise to take up the substance of my Speech
							hereafter, but expresses an opinion that the Speech itself should be
							prosecuted as a libel—adding—“but we are no lawyers.” In the House the
							day was consumed in receiving Memorials and Petitions; and Resolutions,
							and proceedings for and against the removal of the deposites, and the
							Bank of the United States— <persRef ref="gorham-benjamin">Benjamin
								Gorham</persRef> presented a Memorial from Boston, praying for the
							establishment of a Warehousing System; referred to the Committee of the
							whole House—before which there is a Bill for that purpose— I presented a
							Memorial of the President, Officers and board of Managers of the Howard
							Institution in the City of Washington, praying for an Act of
							incorporation—referred to the Committee on the District of Columbia—
								<persRef ref="huntington-jabez">Huntington</persRef> of Connecticut
							presented a petition from that State praying a Law granting an appeal or
							writ of error, from the Circuit to the Supreme Court of the United
							States in all cases where the matter in dispute or the sum for which
							judgment is recovered exceeds 500 dollars— There are many other
							Petitions to the same effect— The Speaker presented Resolutions of the
							Legislature of Pennsylvania, calling upon Congress to act definitely on
							the subject of weights and measures, by establishing with as little
							delay as possible the necessary Standards, and furnishing each of the
							State Governments, with authentic copies of the same—referred to the
							Committee of Ways and Means. Among the multitude of Bank and deposite
							Memorials <persRef ref="burges-tristam">T. Burges</persRef> of <pb
								n="295" type="ms"/>Rhode-Island presented one from the County of
							Providence, complaining of distress, signed by 3400 names, and <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef> presented a
							Counter-Memorial, which he moved should be read as it was— Burges then
							moved that the Memorial presented by him should be read, but the Speaker
							looking steadily to another part of the house, did not or would not hear
							Burges. He repeated the motion five or six times, with a voice as loud
							as he could raise, but the Speaker took no notice of him, called for
							Connecticut and went successively through all the States as far as
							North-Carolina, when the proceedings of a meeting at Morgantown, Burke
							County, North Carolina, in favour of a restoration of the deposites and
							a recharter of the Bank of the United States, presented by <persRef
								ref="graham-james4">James Graham</persRef>, occasioned an incident.
							There was an insulting allusion to an expression used by <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef> of Georgia, in a recent debate
							in the Senate, of contempt for <hi rend="italic">Pot</hi>-<hi
								rend="italic">house</hi> Memorials— They said that his Speech coming
							from so courteous a person could be accounted for only upon the
							supposition that it was delivered under extraordinary exhilaration, but
							whether proceeding from the Pot-house or the Palace, they did not know.
								<persRef ref="wayne-james">James M. Wayne</persRef> of Georgia,
							asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham to withdraw this memorial
							but he declined— Wayne then moved that it should not be received, on
							account of the insult contained in it upon a member of the Senate— At
							the motion of <persRef ref="mckinley-john">M’Kinley</persRef> of
							Alabama, Wayne’s Motion, lies on the table till next Monday.— <persRef
								ref="mckim-isaac">M’Kim</persRef> of Baltimore presented to the
							House Instructions to him, from a portion of his Constituents, to vote
							for the restoration of the deposites to the Bank of the United States—
								<persRef ref="evans-george2">Evans</persRef> of Maine, in presenting
							a Memorial from Gardner and Pittston in that State, for the restoration
							of the Deposites and the recharter of the Bank of the United States,
							moved its reference to the Committee of Ways and Means, with
							Instructions to report a Resolution, declaring that a Bank established
							by authority of Congress is necessary and ought to be established— It
							was near five when the House adjourned— I was informed that <persRef
								ref="dennis-littleton">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dennis</persRef> a member of the House from Maryland was extremely
							ill, and not expected to survive the day.</p>

								>Peyton</persRef> then moved his Resolutions as Amendment of

								>Turrell</persRef> of New-York moved to lay the whole farrago, on

								<persRef ref="clayton-augustin">A. S. Clayton</persRef> from the

								<persRef ref="jarvis-leonard">Jarvis</persRef> called up his
							Resolution for enquiries into the causes of the breaking up of sundry
							Banks in the District, which he had modified to include enquiry into the
							condition of the Bank of the Metropolis.— Beardsley made a Speech
							against instituting any enquiry into the affairs of the Metropolis, or
							other depository Banks. This led to a debate till the hour expired—
								<persRef ref="gamble-roger">Gamble</persRef> of Georgia had moved to
							suspend the rule which confines the reception of Memorials and
							Petitions, after the first 30 days of the Session, to Mondays, for the
							purpose of receiving and referring memorials and Petitions without
							debate—but the House refused. The Orders of the day were called—
								<persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> presented a Report and Bill
							N. 443. regulating the deposite of the public monies in certain local
							Banks. The Bill was twice read and Polk moved its reference to the

								ref="ewing-john">Ewing</persRef> moved that the whole, together with
							sundry sayings of the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>
							be referred to a select Committee of one member from each State, with
							Instructions to Report a National Bank— The <persRef
								ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker</persRef> declared this motion not in
							order— I instantly made it a question, and the Speaker recanted, and
							admitted Ewing’s motion, but said he could not discuss it— I questioned
							that too, and the Speaker allowed Ewing to discuss. Polk soon made a
							question of order which the Speaker decided against him— He then
							implored Ewing to let the Bill lie over, and bargained with him to let
							the Cumberland road Bill come up next after the general Appropriation
							Bill—upon which Ewing gave up the floor— <persRef ref="burges-tristam"
								>Burges</persRef> moved an Instruction to make the Banks pay
							interest upon the deposites— <persRef ref="binney-horace"
								>Binney</persRef> and <persRef ref="stewart-andrew"
								>Stewart</persRef> opposed this and Burges withdrew his motion— The
							Speaker laid before the house a Letter from the <persRef
								ref="taney-roger-brooke">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> with
							the returns of Commerce and Navigation to the 30<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of September 1833— Ten thousand copies ordered to be
							printed— Also a Letter from the Secretary of War, with copies of the
							reports and surveys of harbours on lake Erie; called for by the House on
							the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript"
							>t.</hi>—referred to the Committee of Commerce— Then followed the
							Committee of the whole House on the State of the Union <persRef
								ref="hubbard-henry">Henry Hubbard</persRef> in the Chair—on the
							general Appropriation Bill.— Long tiresome debate; and very disorderly
							proceedings, the Speaker being absent from the House. Upon some question
							it was found there was no Quorum voting; Hubbard chairman of the
							Committee of the whole called <persRef ref="speight-jesse">Jesse
								Speight</persRef> of North-Carolina to the Chair to act as Speaker,
							and reported to him the fact that there was no Quorum in Committee of
							the whole. <persRef ref="evans-george2">Evans</persRef> of Maine, moved
								<pb n="301" type="ms"/>to adjourn, which was rejected by yeas and
							nays 53 to 87—twenty members more than a Quorum— Speight then as Speaker
							left the chair and Hubbard as chairman of the Committee of the whole
							resumed it, without any vote of the House— The debate dragged along till
							the Committee was again found without a Quorum— Hubbard again called
							Speight to the Chair as Speaker, and reported to him the fact of no
							Quorum in Committee— I moved to adjourn, which was rejected by yeas and
							nays 39 to 86. only five more than a Quorum— I moved a Call of the
							House. Speight refused to put the question. I appealed from his decision
							as Speaker, he refused to entertain the motion, and without vote of the
							House again left the Chair, which was again resumed by Hubbard as
							Chairman of the Committee of the whole—but from that time no Quorum
							could be formed; several of the Minority keeping their Seats, or passing
							without the Bar, that they might not be counted, at the vote by
							Tellers—so as that a Quorum should be made— The majority, finding at
							last that they could not thus drive the Bill through the Committee of
							the whole gave it up. Evans renewed his motion to adjourn, and the House
							was adjourned, without even reporting from the Committee of the whole
							their third failure to make a Quorum— In these proceedings, every thing
							was disorder and confusion—all owing to the absence of the Speaker from
							the Chair, and a dogged determination of the Administration majority, to
							force the Bill through the Committee of the whole.</p>

						<p><date>27. V:30. </date>Sunday.— Wintry gale, cold and clear— Morning at
							the Presbyterian Church: heard <persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> from Psalm 78.8. “and
							might not be, as their fathers, a stubborn, and rebellious generation; a
							generation that set not their heart aright, and whose Spirit was not
							steadfast with God.”— In the afternoon, at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s Church, <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the Evening
							service, for the fourth Sunday after Easter, and preached from Romans
							14.1. [“]Him that is weak in the Faith receive ye, but not to doubtful
							disputations.”— The publication and distribution of my suppressed Speech
							absorbs my time to such excess, that it usurps upon my Correspondence,
							my Journal, and my Memory. I receive Letters every day which I find it
							impossible to answer— Several this morning. It occupied much of the day,
							to make out the list of persons to whom I send copies of my Speech—and
							to revise <persRef ref="stansbury-arthur">Stanbury’s</persRef> Report of
							my Observations in the House on the Appropriation Bill last Wednesday.
							Among the Letters received this morning, was one from <persRef
								ref="humbert-jonas">Jonas Humbert Sen<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi></persRef>, a Baker in New-York, four pages folio. He appears
							to be a Politician, Philosopher Theologian and Patriot. A Letter from
								<persRef ref="foster-john4">John W. Foster</persRef> a Bookseller at
							Portsmouth, New-Hampshire, enclosing a Prospectus for the publication of
							Sermons by <pb n="304" type="ms"/><persRef ref="parker-nathan">Nathan
								Parker</persRef> D.D. of that place— One from <persRef

							County, Massachusetts concerning the claim of <persRef
								ref="lobdell-ebenezer">Ebenezer Lobdell</persRef>—and one from
								<persRef ref="adams-richard3">Richard Adams</persRef> of Kensington
							near Philadelphia, asking me to send him copies of sundry public
							documents, and one of my own Speech— I took from the Library a <persRef

								ref="thomson-alexander2">Thomson’s</persRef> English translation of
							that author, for a passage in the life of <persRef ref="vespasian"

						<p>Before the meeting of the House, <persRef ref="binney-horace">H.
								Binney</persRef> shewed me a Letter from <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">John Sergeant</persRef>, concerning the
							proceedings of the Bank investigation committee at Philadelphia— When
							the House met, the Clerk, <persRef ref="franklin-walter">Walter S.
								Franklin</persRef>, at the motion of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Binney obtained leave of absence for four or five days on account of the
							death of <persRef ref="franklin-samuel">his father</persRef>.
							Immediately after the Journal was read the <persRef
								ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker</persRef> gave the floor to <persRef
								ref="hall-thomas">Thomas H. Hall</persRef> on a Memorial from the
							County of Edgecombe in that State, presented by him this day fortnight.—
							He made a very tedious Speech of two hours, and then moved that the
							papers should be printed and lie on the table. The memorial from Burke
							County was also at the motion of <persRef ref="graham-james4">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham</persRef> laid on the Table.
							The Speaker then called Georgia, and <persRef ref="gamble-roger">Roger
								L. Gamble</persRef> made some remarks on a memorial from Savannah
							against the removal of the deposites which he had presented on the 14<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>— The
							memorial was now read, and after his Speech upon it was laid on the
							table and ordered to be printed— <persRef ref="white-edward">Edward T.
								White</persRef> presented a deposite Memorial from Louisiana, with
							some pungent remarks on the present condition of affairs— <persRef
								ref="osgood-gayton">Osgood</persRef> asked leave of the House, to
							make a Speech upon a memorial from Lowell which he presented; but the

								ref="davis-warren">Warren R. Davis</persRef> introduced to me,
								<persRef ref="wilson-john3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wilson</persRef>, late Governor of South-Carolina. After the

							finish a Speech, begun last week, Friday, upon a motion by him, that the
							Protest of the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President of the United

							be not received— <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Southard</persRef> spoke to me of an Article in the

							notice it. I said no. He spoke also of a proposed appointment of a
							Committee of the Senate, to investigate the Affairs of the Bank of the
							United States, and said he had been asked if he would serve as Chairman
							of such Committee—and that <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>
							was willing to be one of the Committee— <persRef ref="darlington-edward"

							notice that I should ask leave of the House to-morrow to introduce a
							Bill; but he did not approve of it and said that by the rules <pb
								n="305" type="ms"/>of the House it could not be done— After the
							reading of the Journal I rose to give notice of my intention, to ask
							leave of the House to introduce a Bill to-morrow—but the Speaker said I
							was not entitled to the floor, and the house would not grant it—
								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> asked leave
							to offer a Resolution of enquiry of the <persRef ref="barry-william"
								>Postmaster General</persRef>, about the number, names and duties of

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lincoln asked again the suspension of the
							rules, that it might be considered now. I asked for the yeas and nays,
							which were 111 to 68. not two thirds, and the Resolution lies over— At

								>Campbell P. White</persRef> asked to take up the Bill 255.
							regulating the value of certain foreign silver coins, but on a question

							in it slowly made, till the Committee rose after some discussion of an

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jackson</persRef>— Conversation
							with them upon the condition of Anti-masonry, in our own State of
							Massachusetts, and in others— At the House, immediately after the
							reading of the Journal, I gave notice of my intention to ask leave of
							the House to-morrow, to introduce a Bill prohibiting the Corporations of
							the Cities in the District from issuing promissory Notes or Bills of any
							denomination less than ten dollars.— The <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew"
								>Speaker</persRef> might have told me, as he did yesterday that I
							was not entitled to the floor; but he did not, and my notice was given
							with leave of the House— By the rigid rules of the House, every member
							is so hemmed in that he cannot open his lips without leave obtained by a
							formal vote— <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> of Tennessee from
							the Committee on the judiciary, reported a Bill N. 455. further to amend
							the judicial system of the United States, (by extending the Circuit
							Courts)—read twice, and committed to the Committee of the whole on the

								>Corwin’s</persRef> amendment to <persRef ref="mardis-samuel"

								>Galbraith</persRef> of Pennsylvania then took the floor for
							to-morrow. Then a Resolution of enquiry offered yesterday by <persRef
								ref="mercer-charles">C. F. Mercer</persRef> for a paper concerning
							the Potowmack Bridge was taken up and adopted— The House went into
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union. A Bill, regulating the
							value of certain foreign silver coins, was passed in Committee— Then
							Bills to continue the Commissions on French and Neapolitan claims— The
							General Appropriation Bill followed, on an Amendment proposed by
								<persRef ref="dickerson-philemon">Philemon Dickerson</persRef> of
							New-Jersey to the amendment proposed by <persRef ref="selden-dudley"
								>Dudley Selden</persRef>— After a discussion of two hours, both the
							Amendments were rejected— <persRef ref="foot-samuel">Samuel A.
								Foot</persRef> of Connecticut moved to strike out the item of
							Salaries for Ministers to Great Britain and Russia, and to reduce the
							Appropriations 18000 dollars. He supported it by a short Speech,
							assigning his reasons. I sustained the motion upon entirely different
							grounds— <persRef ref="davis-warren">Warren R. Davis</persRef> of
							South-Carolina had yet other reasons which he gave but I could hear only
							part of what he said— What I did hear, and what he said with great
							feeling was this—turning towards me he said well do I remember the
							enthusiastic zeal with which we reproached the administration of that
							Gentleman, and the ardour and vehemence with which we laboured to bring
							in another— For the share that I had in those transactions, and it was
							not a small one, <hi rend="italic">I</hi>

							the Committee of Ways and Means, and especially <persRef

							with great <pb n="306" type="ms"/>earnestness of the appropriation— I
							rose to reply but it was past 5.—the Committee rose, and the House
							adjourned— I find myself deeply and unexpected involved again in this
							debate; and greatly to my mortification.</p>
