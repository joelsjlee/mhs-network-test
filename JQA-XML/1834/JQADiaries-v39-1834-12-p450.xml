						<p>I walked to the Capitol, and took my Seat in the House of Representatives
							about 11 O’Clock this morning; and after an hour of greetings, among the
							members of the house with one another. At Noon <persRef ref="bell-john"
								>John Bell</persRef> of Tennessee the Speaker took the chair, and
							the Clerk of the House <persRef ref="franklin-walter">Walter
								Franklin</persRef> called over the roll of names of the members of
							the House, by States; beginning with Maine; and in each State
							alphabetically. The new members elected since the last Session, were
							called over separately, after the rest, and were called up at the left
							hand of the Speaker’s chair and he administered to them the Oath to
							support the Constitution of the United States. He then announced that
							188 members had answered to their names.— A message had been received
							from the Senate, that they had formed a Quorum and were ready to proceed
							to business and had appointed on their part a Committee of notification
							to the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="mckinley-john">M’Kinley</persRef> of Alabama, moved the
							appointment of a Committee of notification on the part of the House to
							the President; and then a <pb n="451" type="ms"/>message to the Senate
							to inform them of the Quorum in the House. <persRef ref="ward-aaron"
								>Ward</persRef> of New-York, moved the Resolution for the supply of
							an equivalent for three daily Newspapers to the Members; and the
							Resolution that the daily hour of adjournment of the House till
							otherwise ordered should be 12. O’Clock Noon.— The House adjourned soon
							after one O’Clock— Among the new members, of whom there was the very
							unusual number of eleven, was <persRef ref="letcher-robert">Robert P.
								Letcher</persRef> of Kentucky, whose election was so stubbornly
							contested by <persRef ref="moore-thomas3">Thomas P. Moore</persRef> at
							the last Session—<space/><persRef ref="robertson-john2"

							New-York; and <persRef ref="ferris-charles">Ferris</persRef>, who come
							in the place of <persRef ref="lawrence-cornelius">Cornelius

								<persRef ref="selden-dudley">Dudley Selden</persRef>, who resigned
							because he had differed from the party which had chosen him, and failed
							as a Candidate for re-election— <persRef ref="lytle-robert">Robert
								Lytle</persRef>, did the same at Cincinnati Ohio, and was re-elected
							by a plurality of about 50 votes; but it is said his election will be

						<p>My Grand-child <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> was this

								ref="greenleaf-william">W. C. Greenleaf</persRef> came over from
							Georgetown to assist in making out the Inventory of furniture, and
							personal effects in the house— The weather was foul and I rode to the
							Capitol but walked back— In the House of Representatives, the only
							business done, was the reading of the annual Message from the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President of the United States</persRef>: which
							occupied an hour and a half, and was very tedious— It consisted chiefly
							of invectives against France, and the Bank of the United States, and an
							argumentative Dissertation against appropriations for internal
							improvement. Immediately after the reading <persRef ref="connor-henry"
								>Connor</persRef>, of North-Carolina moved that it should be
							referred to a Committee of the whole House on the state of the Union,
							and that ten thousand copies of it, and of the accompanying Documents
							should be printed for the use of the members of the House—and then about

							walked to the Capitol— Immediately after the House was called to order

								Casey</persRef> a member from the State of Illinois announced the
							decease of his Colleague <persRef ref="slade-charles">Charles

							wear crape for a month in token of respect for his memory— <persRef
								ref="janes-henry">Henry Jaynes</persRef>, a new member from Vermont,
							then moved a similar Resolution of Respect for <persRef
								ref="deming-benjamin">Benjamin F. Deming</persRef>, a member from

							Deming, upon whose character M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jaynes
							pronounced a <pb n="452" type="ms"/>short panegyric— Both the

							and I came home; stopping to return <persRef ref="hawes-albert">A. G.
								Hawes’s</persRef> visit on my way— He lodges at <persRef ref="u"

							and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Speight</persRef>.
							Hawes told me a strange Story about a mortal disease peculiar to
							Kentuckey called the milk disease, and which he says is more surely and
							rapidly fatal than the Cholera, and sweeps off whole families— Supposed
							to be occasioned by the Cows feeding upon poisonous mushrooms— It is not
							always easy to ascertain when Hawes is serious, and when he mystifies— I
							received a morning visit from <persRef ref="binney-horace">H

							First woollens for the Season— The inflammation of my left eye renders
							writing painful and difficult but I cannot suspend it. <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Wolfendale</persRef> came with
							a proposition to take the part of the House in Pennsylvania, not
							occupied by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Doyne</persRef>; for a year— I promised to send her an answer. At
							the House; a multitude of Petitions, Memorials, and Resolutions were
							received— The Resolutions offered by <persRef ref="lewis-dixon"
								>Lewis</persRef> of Alabama, for enquiring whether the Public Lands
							should be sold for 25 and 50 Cents an Acre, were rejected only 37 voting
							for them, even upon a second trial— There was a Message from the
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>, with an answer
							from <persRef ref="lafayette-george">George W. La Fayette</persRef> to
							the Letter from the President to him, communicating the Resolutions of
							Congress adopted at the last Session, honorary to the Memory of <persRef
								ref="lafayette">his father</persRef>.— Supplementary Report from the
								<persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> on
							the keeping and disbursing of the public Revenue—10000 copies to be
							printed.— The Bills ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, which
							were reported to the house from the Committee of the whole last Friday—
							There was a joint Resolution reported by the Committee on the public
							buildings, that a Committee be appointed to contract with four American
							Artists, for four historical pictures to fill the four vacant frames in
							the Rotunda; the subjects to be selected by the Committee in
							consultation with the Artists— I somewhat inconsiderately moved to
							strike out the word four, so as to leave it discretionary with the
							Committee to employ one or more Artists, observing that if four
							different persons must be engaged, to paint four pictures, there would
							be danger that a part of the work would not be worthy of the place, or
							of the dignity of the Nation— I doubted if four native Artists could be
							found of eminence in the profession so transcendant, as to ensure the
							performance of four master-pieces— This brought up successively three
							members of the reporting Committee <persRef ref="jarvis-leonard">Leonard
								Jarvis</persRef>, <persRef ref="wise-henry">Henry A. Wise</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="ward-aaron">A. Ward</persRef>, who with great
							vehemence opposed my amendment, and insisted that great Painters were in
							this Country, in such abundance, that the only difficulty would be in
							making the selection— <persRef ref="burges-tristam">T. Burges</persRef>
							of Rhode-Island supported my motion, but rather directed his remarks to
							the Selection of the Subjects, and was very sarcastic upon the arguments
							of the members of the Committee; especially upon Wise; who replied with
							more passion than wit— I thought my motion would have been voted down by
							a sweeping majority; but on taking the question 104 voted for it, and
							not 30 against it— The selection of the subjects then came up again, and
							in the midst of the debate <persRef ref="clayton-augustin"
								>Clayton</persRef> of Georgia moved to adjourn which was carried—
								<persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef> was here this Evening, and left with me an account of
								<persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef> with my

							the agreement between the three heirs of <persRef ref="hellen-thomas"

							Directors of the Bank of Washington, to distribute equally between them
							his Stock in that Bank without the trouble and expense of

						<p>On my way to the Capitol I stopped at the Office of the Franklin

						<p>Weather raw and chilly, and the Streets wet— I rode to the Capitol and

							withdrew his motion at Clayton’s request to allow him to reply to
							Rencher, which he did by disclaiming all intention to disturb the

								>Binney</persRef> made a speech in favour of the Resolution—

							was adopted without opposition, and <persRef ref="peyton-balie"
								>Peyton</persRef> thanked me after the adjournment, for making the

								>th.</hi> of last month before the Hebrew Orphan Society, of Abi
							Yetomim, by <persRef ref="levy-jacob">J. C. Levy</persRef>, their

							Society for the conversion of the Jews; and adds two impertinent
							remarks, charging that Society with ignorance of the Hebrew character,
							and conjecturing that I had taken things on the Representation of others
							because there are no Jews in New-England— If I ever belonged to a
							Society for the Conversion of the Jews, I had entirely forgotten the
							fact— I may have been called upon for a contribution to some such
							Society, and thus had my name recorded as a member of it without
							intending it— But it evidently gave great disturbance to the Synagogue,
							and has seriously alarmed them for the rite of circumcision— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Levy’s Address is a compound of common
							places upon Benevolence, of complaints of Persecution upon the Jews, and
							of gloriole upon the Abi Yetomim Society at Charleston, celebrating
							their 33<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> anniversary, and the Dedication
							of their Hall which their liberality has enabled them to build— It is a
							good sample of Jewish tenacity, coupled with a laudable zeal of Charity—
							As to the conversion of the Jews, the People of Charleston might be much
							edified by a Forensic Conference between J. C. Levy, and <persRef

						<p>Overslept myself till broad daylight, which in my present state of

							my second and abridged Oration upon the Life and Character of <persRef

							therefore consider it as passed, and send it to the Senate for
							concurrence. When the Resolution offered yesterday by <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lincoln</persRef>
							to call upon the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> for
							information of the State of the Negotiation respecting the North Eastern

								>Gorham Parks</persRef> opposed its passage in a long, acrimonious
							Speech against its passage, professing at the same time to be altogether
							indifferent about it and objecting especially to the latter part of it—
							His object seemed to be to vent his spleen, against the State of
							Massachusetts, and to rouse the party feeling of the Administration men
							to put down the Resolution— <persRef ref="evans-george2">Evans</persRef>
							of Maine answered him with a mild, temperate, playful and cutting
							severity, exposing the inconsistencies and profligacy of the party in
							Maine, which have used this controversy as an Engine against the last
							Administration, and are now tamely sacrificing the territory of the
							State itself in servile submission to the present Administration Evans
							among other things noticed the boisterous nullification doctrines of the
							party in Maine, until the President’s Proclamation of December 1832,
							referring to debates in the Legislature in which he had opposed in vain
							those doctrines, and to the tameness with which they have been abandoned
							since the Proclamation— <persRef ref="foster-thomas2">T. F.
								Foster</persRef> of Georgia followed Evans with a spirited speech in
							honour of nullification— Lincoln replied fully to the objections of
							Parks— <persRef ref="smith-francis">F. O. J. Smith</persRef>, makes a
							Speech against that of Evans, but says he shall vote for the Resolution—
							The Orders of the day were called for at the expiration of the hour; but
							the house were so much amused by the debate on Lincoln’s resolution that
							they refused to pass to the orders, and the debate continued till past
							3. when the house adjourned over to Saturday— <persRef
								ref="beaty-martin">Beatty</persRef> of Kentuckey, nettled at the
							failure of his motion yesterday for a joint Resolution to adjourn over
							to Monday now opposed the motion to adjourn over Christmas day at-all;
							and called for the yeas and nays, but the house denied them— There is no
							trial of temper more provoking than that of conflicting with a majority
							of a deliberative Assembly; and none where a manifestation of temper is
							more useless and unwise— I have fallen into this error more than once,
							and occasionally made myself exceedingly obnoxious by it— The
							manifestation of temper must be most carefully distinguished from
							resistance to the will of a Majority, which is sometimes a duty of the
							highest order— Walk home in company with <persRef ref="jarvis-leonard"

						<p>A fall of Snow in the Night presented a white carpet on the ground this
							morning— Visit from <persRef ref="persico-luigi">Persico</persRef>, who
							asked me to return his contract for the execution of the two Statues of
							Peace and War; written by myself and the last act of my official Life as
							President of the United States— I promised to return it to-morrow,
							proposing to have in the meantime a copy of it made to keep— Persico
							invited me to go to his rooms on the Capitol hill, and see a collection
							of Pictures by some of the Masters of the Italian Schools, which he
							brought with him from Italy upon Speculation, and wishes to sell, and a
							marble bust of the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>, of
							which he proposes to make a present to him on the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January next— Persico is desirous of
							further employment by Congress, and wishes to make friends.— I advised
							him to visit <persRef ref="jarvis-leonard">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Jarvis</persRef>, chairman of the Committee on the
							public buildings, and <persRef ref="polk-james">M<hi rend="superscript"

							Means, and invite them to go and see his bust of the President, and to
							be careful not to omit making the present on the 8<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of January— Just then a renewed fancy took M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Persico, to make a marble bust of me— He
							had entertained this fancy while I was President, and when his being
							employed by the public depended upon me— Before he went to Italy he had
							taken the mould of this bust in clay, and when he had been there about
							two years, he sent me a cast of it in Plaster of Paris; with some
							enquiry whether I should prefer to have it in marble— I was then not in
							public life, and alike indifferent to Busts whether in Marble or in
							Plaster— I did not answer his Letter— He now begs me to give him one
							more sitting, that he may finish in higher perfection the model, and is
							fully determined to make the bust in marble and to send it to me— I
							desired him not to give himself that trouble, but he insisted upon it,
							and I have no doubt will persist in his determination, till he shall
							find it more convenient to desist from it—and he knows that for me the
							intention is equivalent to the deed.</p>
