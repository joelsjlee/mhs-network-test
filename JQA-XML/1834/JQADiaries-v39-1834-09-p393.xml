						<p>Persevering in my determination to refrain from the Garden, as from
							forbidden fruit, the working part of the day, I devoted the morning to
							the Diary, the Index and <persRef ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>—
							I should also have written one Letter, but the time was not sufficient—
							It began to rain about noon, and continued all the remainder of the day
							and Evening— After dinner, I visited the Garden and Nursery for a
							quarter of an hour, but the steady rain brought me back— <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came in while we were at
							dinner— There was a town-meeting at four this afternoon, upon the
							application of a road, through my land at the foot of Penn’s Hill; but I
							was prevented by the weather from attending— I read the part of the
							Military, and Naval Letters of the late War, which contains the
							despatches and Army Orders of <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General
								Brown</persRef>, all of the Summer of 1814— Also part of the first
							Volume of <persRef ref="sarrans-bernard">Sarrans’s</persRef> Memoirs of
							La Fayette; but the whole of his Career during the War of the American
							Revolution is contained in the first 28 pages, and is exceedingly meagre
							and unsatisfactory— I am yet wandering in quest of a point of view from
							which to consider his <pb n="394" type="ms"/>character as one consistent
							whole; but I cannot seize it— We diverted the Evening with two Rubbers
							of whist. <persRef ref="woodward-ebenezer">D<hi rend="superscript"

							and spoke of the petition for a road from the foot of Penn’s Hill to
							Braintree, which they think will be injurious to them—It will certainly
							be so to my property there— Hardwick proposed to me, to rebuild a
							ruinous wall from opposite his house to the Southeast corner of my
							Orchard; and give to the Town a slip sufficient to straiten the road,
							and render that asked for by the Petition unnecessary; but I did not
							think it would satisfy the Petitioners— Hardwick told me also, that
							there was a man who came and cut down a young walnut tree in the wood
							belonging to me, near his house, yesterday he saw him carry it away, but
							did not know who it was; and he intreated me not to name him as my
							informer— Field said that the town, at the meeting on Monday voted to
							oppose the grant of the road, and appointed the Select men, with
								<persRef ref="curtis-noah">Noah Curtis</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gourgas-john">John M. Gourgas</persRef> to appear in behalf of
							the Town before the County Commissioners— But Field wished to
							remonstrate in his own name, and that I should join him in it, which I
							told him I would readily do— But I must have a copy of the Petition, to
							be able to answer it— He said it was posted up at <persRef ref="u"
								>French’s</persRef> tavern and he would send me a copy of it— The
								<persRef ref="adams-thomas2">Lieut<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi></persRef> brought his Sister <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth"
								>Elizabeth</persRef> here, who stayed and dined with us— <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef> was better, but still
							confined to the chamber, and far from well— I was myself, much
							indisposed with sore lungs a threatened long catarrh, and half-blind
							eyes. The morning labour was irksome, and on visiting my Garden after
							dinner, the heat of the Sun was too scorching for laborious exercise. I
							employed <persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirk</persRef> to prepare the ground
							bordering on the Eastern fence of my Nursery; where I propose to set out
							slips of hazel and currant bush by way of experiment; and I planted in a
							new Earthen ware pot a Squantum Peach Stone, Pear Core, and 6 Apple
							Seeds— Evening <pb n="395" type="ms"/>I was forced to waste at Cards— I
							received this morning, a printed sheet in octavo pamphlet form with
							“Author’s respects” written at the corner of the first page; headed
							“Review of the Character of Jesus.” It is an argumentative attack upon
							the character of Jesus, his Morals, and his Religion— In the <persRef
								ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="paine-thomas">Tom Paine</persRef> Style— There is a statement
							that it is sent to the Clergy generally in Massachusetts, and to six or
							eight laymen on an average, in each town of the State— There is
							therefore party organization, no inconsiderable expense, and learning
							and talent, and systematic proceeding in this Crusade of Infidelity— I
							read the paper suppressing as well as I could my feelings of
							indignation; and asking myself, what can be the motive, and the end of
							these things?</p>

						<p>Another day of greater than Summer heat, and which unfitted me almost as
							much for writing, or even reading as for labouring in my garden. I did
							visit the Nursery, which is in a train of preparation to receive my
							slips of Hazel and of Currants— My Diary and Index left me no leisure
							for the character of <persRef ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beale</persRef> and <persRef ref="spear-william">William
								Spear</persRef>, were here about this Petition for a road through my
							Land. Spear said the Commissioners had been on the ground yesterday,
							with <persRef ref="humphreys-lemuel">Lemuel Humphrey</persRef> the
							Surveyor, and had marked out the road; and as we thought it advisable to
							see how they had marked it. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale
							promised to call on me at 3. O’Clock with his Chaise, and take me to the
							place— He came accordingly, and took me in the heat of a blazing Sun to
								<persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field’s</persRef> house— He was
							there with his Waggon, and Auctioneer’s hammer going to sell some Land
							late of <persRef ref="wood-william3">William Wood</persRef>, deceased,
							and adjoining my meadow— William Spear was also there, but the road had
							not been marked, and finding it useless to proceed, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale and I returned home— Beale and Spear
							had also spoken to me about the rent of my pews in the Meeting House;
							several of which have been occupied during the last year by persons who
							are now, unwilling or unable to pay any thing for it— Beale, as the
							Parish Treasurer had suffered them to take Seats in them for little or
							nothing before I took the pews from the Parish, and now they expect to
							have them as gratuitously. Spear told me there was no person would give
							the rents marked out in my list— He asked me, if he should get what he
							could for the year past, and give notice that they must for the future
							pay rent or quit the pews— I said yes, and that I would lease the pews
							at any reasonable rate— He said there were two persons who had offered
							12 dollars a year each, for two of the pews, which I told him I would
							accept— Harvey Field sent me a tax Bill for the year 1833 of 389
							dollars. 40 cents of which 150 dollars 20 cents are for parish tax— We
							visited this Evening at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale’s— <persRef

						<p>Showery the whole day and evening almost without intermission; and the

							14 with [symbols] Horse Plum Stones, Catherine Pear Cores, and Office
							Apple Seeds— My expedients hitherto for ascertaining the identity of the
							plant that comes up with the seed sown, and those seeds which will not
							vegetate at all have almost all failed— A very few of them have
							succeeded— One of the surest modes of ascertaining is that of planting

						<p>years, and have now nine Pots, with plants growing in them from Seeds and
							Stones which I planted in them last Autumn, But not having been duly
							attentive to mark the exact time of planting in each Pot, nor the
							particular seed deposited in it, I know not what they are, except
							generally as Apples, Pears, grapes, cherries, one Plum, and one Althaea—
							I propose this year to be more careful, and to record the peculiar seed,
							deposited in each Pot, and have numbered the Pots— Of the seeds
							committed this day to Pot 14. I have reason to believe that the Office
							Apples will come up; but none of the Cherries, Plums or Pears— At my age
							these experiments can do nothing more than gratify curiosity, and that
							to a very limited extent— Had I commenced them fifty years ago, and had
							the means of pursuing, multiplying, and improving upon them from year to
							year, I have no doubt I should have made useful, perhaps important
							discoveries, for the natural History and cultivation of fruit and forest
							trees— An insatiate curiosity, and untiring perseverance, are qualities
							as indispensable for this labour, to which I believe that a life, of
							incessant activity, of laborious exertion, and of powerfully excited
							intellect might be devoted with profit, pleasure, honour, and splendid
							success.— For me, the time is past. I can only point the way.— I had a
							morning visit from <persRef ref="gray-thomas2">D<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>Early this morning I went into Boston with <persRef

								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> House, we found him and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>— At ten O’Clock I
							went to the Council Chamber in the State House where I met a few
							acquaintance, and many Strangers— It was the anniversary of <persRef
								ref="lafayette">La Fayette’s</persRef> birthday and the day fixed
							for the Commemoration of his Life and Character; by the young men of
							Boston— A large procession civil and military was formed, which went
							from the State House to Faneuil Hall, where a splendid Oration of an
							hour and fifty-minutes was delivered by <persRef ref="everett-edward"
								>Edward Everett</persRef>— He commenced precisely at two O’Clock,
							and for lack of time, abridged his discourse, perhaps nearly an hour. It
							was received with universal applause, and in the delivery was often
							interrupted by long protracted shouts and hand-clappings, of exulting
							approbation— It was delivered, every word from Memory— His manuscript
							lying on the table, and he never once recurred to it— The Oration was
							preceded by a dirge of <persRef ref="handel-george">Handel</persRef>,
							with appropriate words in prose adapted to the Music— An admirable
							prayer by <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript"

									rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> Music by <persRef
								ref="webb-george">G. J. Webb</persRef>— It was past four O’Clock,

							Charles’s— <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							and <persRef ref="brooks-sidney">Sidney Brooks</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="brooks-frances">his wife</persRef> were also of the dinner
							party— We left M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s about seven
							in the Evening and returned home to Quincy, my wife very unwell, and
							after retiring to bed quite sick— I met this morning at the Council
							Chamber the Senators <persRef ref="mangum-willie">Mangum</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="ewing-thomas">Ewing</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="wilde-richard">R. H. Wilde</persRef> of the House of
							Representatives, <persRef ref="macomb-alexander">General
								Macomb</persRef>, and his two Aids de Camp— Wilde asked me, if I
							should be at home on Monday, and on my affirmative answer, promised to
							come out and see me that day— I had received this morning from <persRef
								ref="palfrey-john">Professor J. G. Palfrey</persRef>, two Sermons of
							his and a Review of one of them, all relating to the University— I
							thanked him for them, and he thanked me, for my Report on the
							disturbances, which <persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">Lieut<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Governor Armstrong</persRef> and two
							or three other members of the Board of Overseers, told me they had
							received this morning. <persRef ref="parker-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Parker</persRef> the County Attorney,
							said to me that if it would be agreeable to me, he would send in a copy
							of his argument on the recent trial of <persRef ref="kneeland-abner"
								>Abner Kneeland</persRef> for blasphemy— I told him I had seen with
							great interest in the public Journals a summary account of that trial,
							and <pb n="397" type="ms"/>should be highly obliged to him for a copy of
							his argument— I walked in the procession with <persRef
								ref="jackson-william2">William Jackson</persRef>, the Anti-masonic
							member of the National House of Representatives from the fifth
							Congressional District of this Commonwealth, who as we were walking,
							asked me what they should do at their Antimasonic State Convention,
							which is to meet next Wednesday at Boston to nominate Candidates for the
							Offices of Governor and Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Governor for
							the ensuing year— I told him I knew not what they should do, and was too
							certain they would not do what I should say— After some further
							conversation I said, I had some weeks since said to one of the leading
							Antimasons it was in my opinion the true policy of the antimasons to
							support the re-election of <persRef ref="davis-john4">Governor
								Davis</persRef>, and wished they would— That shortly after, the
							Gentlemen to whom I had said this mentioned it to another, who intimated
							a wish if that was my opinion, that I should not much divulge it, and I
							had accordingly forborne to speak upon the subject— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jackson did not concur with me in opinion,
							and thought it was impossible that the Anti-masons should support the
							re-election of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Davis— I said the only
							alternatives were to vote for <persRef ref="morton-marcus"
								>Morton</persRef>, which would merge AntiMasonry in <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jacksonism</persRef>; or to nominate a
							candidate of their own with a certainty of defeat. We discussed amicably
							this question till we came to the door of Faneuil Hall, without
							approaching to an agreement— I received at Boston this morning a Letter
							from <persRef ref="pasley-charles">C. H. Pasley</persRef> Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> of Royal Engineers in England, dated
							Chatham 20. June 1834— He has been publishing a work upon Weights and
							Measures, of which he presents me with a Copy, (but that was not with
							the Letter) and says he has done Justice to my Report made to the Senate
							of the United States in 1821. acknowledging that my historical account
							of English Weights and Measures, is more correct than any that has been
							given by any English writer; including the Reports of Committees of the
							House of Commons— This acknowledgment thirteen years after the
							publication of my Report was very gratifying to me— If either of my
							children or any of theirs should ever read this page, let me tell him
							that Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Pasley’s testimonial to that
							single point, the accuracy of my historical investigation of English
							weights and measures, is but one of many discoveries which he will find
							in my Report, if he will have the courage and perseverance to read, and
							examine it as he reads— He will find the History not only of English,
							but of Hebrew, Greek, Roman, and French weights and measures, traced to
							their origin, in the natural history of man and of human Society, such
							as he can find in no other writer, antient or modern— He will find a
							philosophical discussion of the moral principles involved in the
							consideration of weights and measures, and of the extent and limitation
							of its connection with binal, decimal, and duodecimal arithmetic, for
							which he might look in vain elsewhere; and if he should remark that not
							one of his Countrymen ever noticed these peculiarities of that Report,
							he may amuse himself by enquiring why and how it has happened— The
							Report from the day of its publication, has in this Country scarcely
							been known to exist; and this commendation of it, coming back from
							England is therefore the more welcome to me— The other Letter was from
								<persRef ref="davis-charles2">Charles A. Davis</persRef> enclosing a
							London Newspaper, with a very favourable review of <persRef
								ref="downing-jack">Major Jack Downing’s</persRef> Letters; as
							gratifying to him, as Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Pasley’s notice
							is to me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilde told me he had seen in a
							New-York paper, mention made of Pasley’s book, and of its remarks upon
							my Report. On our return home this Evening, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Adams went immediately to bed, very much indisposed.</p>

							against the laying out of the new road from the foot of Penn’s Hill,

							a Captain his Certificate appears not to be for so much as he has a

								Woodward</persRef> was here morning and Evening— I went with
								<persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirk</persRef> to Braintree to attend the
							Meeting of the County Commissioners, upon the Petition for the new Road.
							They met first at <persRef ref="arnold-ralph">Arnold’s</persRef> tavern
							in Braintree; but I met them on the way to <persRef ref="field-harvey"
								>Harvey Fields</persRef> house, at which point they proposed that
							the road should commence— I turned back and just as we reached the house
							there came up a thunder shower, followed by a succession of Showers
							which kept us there upwards of two hours— Harvey Field was not at home,
							but his father <persRef ref="field-joseph">Joseph</persRef> born 1749
							entertained the company much with his sallies of vivacity against the
							road— At an interval between the Showers, I went with the Commissioners
							over the ground of the proposed road through my Penn’s hill Orchard— Of
							the Commissioners there were <persRef ref="loud-samuel">Samuel P.
								Loud</persRef> of Dorchester, and <persRef ref="ellis-william2"
								>William Ellis</persRef> of Dedham—of the Petitioners, <persRef
								ref="capen-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Capen</persRef>

								>Lewis Bass</persRef>, <persRef ref="curtis-noah">Noah
								Curtis</persRef> and <persRef ref="gourgas-john">John M.
								Gourgas</persRef>. The Petitioners wanted a different road from that
							set forth in their Petition—and Minott Thayer, their principal Orator
							was very assiduous and argumentative with the Commissioners to persuade
							them, to lay out the road, as the Petitioners now wish it, and not as
							the Petition described— I stated briefly to the Commissioners that I had
							agreed with Harvey Field to join him in remonstrating against the
							invasion of his and my property; and as an inhabitant of the Town, I had
							signed their remonstrance against it— That for my individual property, I
							had entire confidence in the Commissioners— If they thought the road
							would be of public benefit; they would not consider me as opposing it;
							but as claiming the indemnity for my property taken, as secured to me by
							the Constitution— Minott Thayer made many attempts to draw from me an
							offer to give the Land which the road would embrace, in my Lots, and
							appealed to my public Spirit; to my liberality, and to my old affection
							for my native town of Braintree; to all which I responded with good
							humour and caution— The Commissioners then proceeded in their
							examination of the road, and I left them and came home— They agreed to
							meet at the tavern at four O’Clock this afternoon, to hear the parties:
							but I did not think it necessary to attend them there. The showering
							continued till about 2. O’Clock—and I lost by this excursion a great
							part of the day— After dinner I visited my Garden and Nursery, but the
							ground was so wet, and the atmosphere still so damp that I could not
							work with any Satisfaction— I planted a Perkins Nectarine Stone,
							Cling-stone Peach, and several purple grape seeds at the North-west
							corner of the Garden, and transplanted a seedling Pear-tree two Winters
							old, to their side, taking it from a double one in the opposite patch—

							looking above ground quite healthy, but with the taproot of every one of
							them bitten off, within half an inch of the surface— I set them out
							again in the Northwest corner patch of the Garden, but believe it not
							possible that they should live. I transplanted also, several other
							Apple-seedlings, and one white Beach into a row from a horse-chesnut
							stake to the fence in the Jargonel pear-tree patch— My seedlings come up
							in clusters very irregularly, and injure each others growth. I now for
							the first time undertake to arrange them in rows, and think it will take
							me at least the steady afternoon’s labour of one Month. There are
							scattered over the Garden and Nursery, perhaps 30 seedling trees,
							apparently Buttonwoods which have come up this Season, I know not how;

							himself on the mercy of the faculty— The Prosecution had therefore been
							withdrawn. Another had <pb n="401" type="ms"/>pleaded a noli-contendere,
							and had been sentenced to a fine of 20 dollars upon one Indictment, and
							30 dollars upon the other; and the third has absconded. About ninety
							Students have been admitted in to the several classes— Of the Junior
							Class, the whole of whom, excepting three, were dismissed as Sophomores,
							thirty-three have applied for readmission— Sixteen of them have been
							readmitted, and no decision has yet been made upon the rest— There was
							some disorder in the freshmen Class, the night before last; by a bonfire
							made in the College-yard; upon which the faculty met, and closed the
							term of probation of one Student detected in the act of making the fire—
							The number of the freshman Class is upwards of seventy, and there will
							be more than forty finally in the junior Class— I spoke to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy of the pamphlet sheet I had
							received under a blank cover; called a Review of the <hi
								rend="strikethrough">life</hi>
							<hi rend="strikethrough">and</hi> character of Jesus—and asked him if it
							had been sent to him— He said he had not received it—but that he had
							received several other pamphlets of the same stamp— I asked him if he
							knew who and what this faction of Atheists were; and how they were
							working— He knew not much about them; but said they had weekly Meetings
							on Sundays, at the federal Street Theatre; where the most unqualified
							Atheism was preached; of which he gave me a shocking Specimen. I asked
							him if he did not think that a steady watch should be kept, over the
							progress of this Spirit, with a view to counteract its mischievous
							tendencies— He said he did; but did not know how it was best to be
							counteracted— He told me that one of the principal persons of the
							Atheist crew was <persRef ref="greene-nathaniel">Green</persRef>, the
							Postmaster at Boston— <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							returned this Morning to Boston— I went through my indispensable daily

							came this afternoon from Boston, and told me they were about to purchase
							and become joint Editors of the New-England Magazine, a monthly
							periodical Journal, hitherto published by <persRef
								ref="buckingham-joseph">Joseph T. Buckingham</persRef>— They
							intended to make it political and literary, and they would need the
							assistance of competent persons in both Departments. They came to me
							therefore; to ask for counsel, and for any assistance that I might be
							disposed to give them, for the prosecution of their undertaking— This
							introduced a Conversation, in which I freely gave them my opinions, and
							advice— I said I sincerely wished they might succeed; and the reputation
							of the Magazine they were intending to purchase stood fair, though I was
							not a subscriber to it, and had seldom seen it— The principal difficulty
							which I believed they would have to encounter was the competition of
							similar Periodicals which were almost numberless. No one could tell how
							many there were; for most of them were so short lived, that they ceased
							to exist as they came into life, without notice or memorial— The
							North-American Review had now a standing of some years— The American
							Quarterly Review of Seven or Eight— But there had been a Southern, and a
							Western Quarterly Review, both of which I believed <pb n="402" type="ms"
							/>were now extinct, and of the monthly Magazines I knew scarcely one
							which was worth its cost of paper and type— I thought their greatest
							difficulty would be the competition with the North-American Review— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Howe said their publication was a monthly
							Magazine, and of a lighter character than the North-American Review—
							They neither intended nor anticipated any competition with that, but
							they rather hoped the two publications might mutually aid each other— I
							finally observed that my necessary occupation so totally absorbed my
							time, that it would be utterly impossible for me to supply them with an
							Article for publication, while my present engagements should continue;
							but I offered to subscribe for their Magazine, which D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Howe said they did not wish, until I
							should have an opportunity to judge of the character of the work— They
							took leave with my good wishes for their success. <persRef

							planted last fall a walnut, and remembered it this Summer, with anxious

							than one chance this year, and that she may have the pleasure of seeing
							the growth of a tree of her own planting.</p>

							conferred upon me by so respectable an authority, I concluded to go—to
							state with candour my insuperable objections to the scheme, and to
							decline the appointment as a member of the Committee— I was also
							commissioned to procure some articles of medicine and for the family,
							and particularly a house-maid to relieve <persRef ref="kirk-elizabeth"

								>Charles’s</persRef> Office, and charged him with all my
							Commissions— Then to the Meeting which it being half past eleven
							O’Clock, I expected to find organized, and in full deliberation— I found
							only 11 members of the Committee there, who immediately after I went in,
							were called to order, and I was chosen Chairman of the Meeting— <persRef

							to act as Secretary to the Committee, but requested to be excused; and
								<persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Robert C Winthrop</persRef> the

							to raise by subscription— He then in a few words assigned his objections
							to the project as it was voted at the <pb n="403" type="ms"/>Meeting of
							Alumni, and when he finished, I said I ought in candour to say that I
							concurred entirely with him in opinion— That I had attended the meeting
							with the intention of offering the same observations and of declaring
							the same purpose— This gave rise to an amicable debate of two hours, in
							which <persRef ref="story-joseph">Judge Story</persRef> set forth all
							the reasons which had induced the Meeting to confine the application of
							the funds to the object of diminishing the expence of education— In this
							debate Charles P. Curtis, <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett">Leverett

								Bigelow</persRef>, <persRef ref="gould-benjamin">Benjamin A.
								Gould</persRef> and <persRef ref="gardiner-william">William H.
								Gardiner</persRef> took part— No one except Judge Story appeared to
							approve this application of the funds which seemed to me a waste of
							them—a mere bonus to the merchants in Boston and to a few clergymen,
							throughout the State, to send their Sons to Cambridge, rather than to
							Amherst, or Williamstown, or New-Haven or Providence for Education; and
							I likened it to a Stage or Steam-boat competition, in which the parties
							underbid each other, for custom, till one offers to convey passengers
							for nothing, and the other to pay them, instead of receiving pay from
							them for their passage— Judge Story warmly urged M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Wainwright and me, not to withdraw from the Committee, least
							it should have so discouraging an effect, as to defeat the whole

							Wainwright would concur in that course, I would not withdraw from the
							Committee, but without interfering with the measures which the other
							members might adopt; be fully understood neither to approve them, nor
							expected in any manner to support them— It was then proposed to adjourn

							should be farther considered, and it was voted that the Secretary should

							Horses were put up. It is in an excessively narrow Lane, which was so
							choaked up with fire Engines, and Hose and fire companies, that I was a

							to the Stable; the man told me that at the first cry of Fire, my
							Coachman <persRef ref="wilson-john8">Wilson</persRef> had gone off with
							the Carriage and Horses, without saying where— I went to Charles’s
							house, stopping first at the Tremont Hotel, to leave a Card for <persRef
								ref="wilde-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R. H.

							also <persRef ref="whipple-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								William Whipple</persRef> of Providence, Rhode-Island, who asked for
							some Conversations with me, upon the election of a Senator of the United

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knight</persRef>, whose term

							and wishes for the election of <persRef ref="greene-albert">M<hi

							a <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> man— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whipple seemed to wish that I should give
							some advice to the Antimasons of Rhode-Island not to vote for a Jackson
							man; but I did not think it right to meddle with their Elections at-all—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilde came in while we were talking;

								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Field</persRef>;
							but Wilson had not been there, and Charles had left no message to be

						<p><persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife’s</persRef> illness
							continues with very little abatement; and still with extreme pain— My
							time is yet, not at my command, and my power of application suspended—
							Heard <persRef ref="farley-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Farley</persRef> in the morning from John 16.33— “I have overcome
							the world”—and in the afternoon from Job 17.<unclear>11</unclear>. “My
							purposes are broken off”—a text which affected me more than the
							discourse which followed; to which as to that of the morning I found it
							impossible to give due attention— I read the fourth Sermon of the 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef>, upon the severity of God— The text, Hebrews
							12.29. “For our God is a consuming fire”—and here I found the Preacher
							himself aware of the danger of the extent to which he had carried the
							doctrine of divine mercy, in the preceding Sermon, and which I had
							noticed last Sunday The express purpose of this one is to qualify that
							doctrine, by enlarging upon the divine Wrath, Vengeance or Justice—for
							there is after the manner of Saurin, a Metaphysical disquisition upon
							these terms, which require explanation, from the moment the reflection
							occurs that the deity cannot be affected by human Passions— Here as in
							many other instances, he states the difficulty with more energy than the
							solution, and remind me of a fly, sipping milk till he drops into the
							cup, and then swimming for his life without being able to get out—
							Saurin says that he cannot deny the possible sincerity of a death bed
							repentance, nor of course its efficacy to obtain pardon for the most
							atrocious crimes For he says that in about twenty thousand cases of such
							professed penitence of persons supposed dying but who have recovered,
							which he had witnessed or heard of; he has known two or three of real
							and effective reformation in after life— Altogether the two Sermons upon
							the divine mercies and the divine severity, do not form a clear and
							consistent system, nor are they satisfactory to my judgment.— How to
							reconcile them together and indeed all the attributes of the Godhead are
							beyond all mortal <pb n="405" type="ms"/>comprehension— Canst thou by

							came to pass a few days here; and her mother <persRef ref="adams-ann"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams</persRef> came this
							Evening to watch the Night. <persRef ref="adams-thomas2">Lieut<hi

							conversation with me, respecting the Administration upon <persRef
								key="adams-thomas">his father’s</persRef> Estate, and the damages
							awarded against the Lowell Rail-road Company, for passing through the
							Medford farm. The Company had offered only 150 dollars— The
							County-Commissioners had allowed 250. and upon an Appeal, the Jury
							increased the allowance to 300 dollars which carried the costs of suit—
							As the suit was in my name, the fee of the land being mine, a receipt or
							order from me is necessary to the fulfilment of the decision— He spoke
							also of the House and farm in Braintree which were my brothers, and
							which he mortgaged to me, for more than it was worth— He retained
							possession with my consent of both the Estates during his life time— I
							took possession of both after his decease, subject to the equity of
							redemption, by his Heirs— His wife’s right of dower had not been
							renounced; and I determined that she should have the rents and profits
							of the whole of both Estates, intending further that after her decease
							they should go to her surviving children, as tenants in Common— She has
							accordingly enjoyed the rents and profits of both Estates, since my
							brother’s decease, and I consider the property as hers for life.— It was
							her wish, and it is mine that the damages recovered from the Lowell
							Rail-road Company, should be applied to discharge my brother’s debt to
								<persRef ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Holbrook</persRef>— It is the wish of the family that the
							Administration upon the Estate by <persRef ref="gourgas-john">J. M
								Gourgas</persRef> should be closed— And if necessary that Letters of
							Administration de bonis non should be taken out by the Lieut<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> but that will probably will not be
							needed— There were two men here this Evening, belonging to the fire
							Company, owners of the “Adams” Engine, who asked my permission to place
							their Engine-shed upon a corner of my Quincy Meadow— They said they paid
							a heavy ground rent for the spot on which it was now located; that they
							had been obliged at considerable cost to remove it last year, and were
							now required to move it again— I told them they might place it upon my
							lot, either at the Northern or Southern Corner, and I would give them a
							lease for five or ten years, for a pepper Corn rent, subject to two
							conditions— That if I should sell or loose the lot, they must then make
							their terms for the use of the land thereafter with the purchaser, or
							with my Lessee— They will see me again upon the subject— My Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came out to dinner, and stays
							to Night— My morning was employed as steadily as I was able in writing,
							and after dinner in the garden— But I can give due attention to neither—
							I write with a mind absorbed in anxiety and alarm— I dig without method,
							spirit or heart— The time is now come that I should devote two or three
							hours of every afternoon to plantings, for the next Spring and Summer— I
							do accordingly plant and transplant, but so carelessly, that if I should
							live to return here next Spring, I fear I shall have no better
							recollection of my present plantations, than I have had after the
							interval of a Winter heretofore— The present affliction is almost an
							extinguisher of hope— Aequam memento servare mentem.</p>

							District; and the chief object of their call upon me was to ascertain
							whether it was my intention to decline a re-election to the House of

							Satisfaction at hearing this, and Solomon Lincoln said it was the
							general wish of the District that I should serve again: and that if I
							should decline, they would have great difficulty in agreeing upon a
							successor. M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bailey was nominated by the
							recent Anti-masonic Convention for Governor of the Commonwealth the
							ensuing year, and I told him that as they could not bring themselves to
							support <persRef ref="davis-john4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Davis</persRef>, they could not have made a choice more acceptable
							to me— He has accepted the nomination, but the evil consequence of that
							will be to prevent his re-election to the Senate of the State— He might
							indeed be voted for, to both the Offices at the same time; and as there
							is not a shadow of prospect that he will be chosen Governor and could
							scarcely fail of re election as a Senator, I was in hopes they would
							take that course— But he said he had no expectation of it, and did not
							believe it was the intention of any other person: as it would have the
							appearance of distrusting the success of the other election for
							Governor— <persRef ref="adams-john3;adams-thomas2">My two

								<persRef ref="beale-ann">Ann</persRef> were here this Evening, and
							this stream of visitors disconcerted again the premeditated course of my
							occupations— It would also have deprived me of all my daily exercise,
							but that I had spent an hour of the morning in my Garden— Walking into
							it just after Breakfast, with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B.
							Adams, she discovered a young snake, about two feet long coiled up on a
							bean vine in the central Alley. Her Son John Quincy killed it— Another
							had been killed yesterday, by <persRef ref="wilson-john8"
								>Wilson</persRef>, in the act of swallowing a small toad. I was
							obliged to snatch my hour for work in the Garden, which was therefore

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="farley-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Farley</persRef> in the morning from 2. Corinthians 5.17 “Therefore
							if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed
							away; behold all things are become new.[”] This was a discourse upon
							regeneration, a doctrine very simple in itself and essentially
							characteristic of the Christian religion, but which has been mystified
							into gross absurdity and fanaticism by theologians. In this as in many
							other instances the wildest and most extravagant nonsense has been
							converted into creeds and Articles of faith, by assuming figurative
							language in a literal sense— The subject is so hacknied, that I take
							little satisfaction in hearing it treated, whether in the <persRef
								ref="calvin-john">Calvinist</persRef> or in the unitarian
							exposition— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Farley’s afternoon text was
							from 1. John 4.16. [“]And we have known and believed the love that God
							hath to us. God is love: and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God,
							and God in him. 17. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have
							boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this
							world. 18. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear,
							because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.”
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Farley himself is in Love, and his
							Sermons are all amiable. I had read the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Sermon of the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, upon the impeccability of the
							faithful— This is one of the excellent class, and from the reading of
							which I ought to have received edification— But my mind is too much
							distracted by the illness at once of <persRef

							Bartlett Pear Seeds—and <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>
							after dinner planted a Perkins Peach and Nectarine Stone, and 10 purple
							grape seeds— I gathered also the remainder of Horse Plums on the two
							trees in the Eastern Enclosure; which were ripe and in high perfection—
							I received a Letter from <persRef ref="morris-charles">Commodore Charles

								>Christopher Gore</persRef>) would if applied to that purpose make
							large provision for that object, and that until it should be
							accomplished, it would be inexpedient to raise any fund by contribution
							from the alumni of the University— Judge Story made a warm and eloquent
							Speech in reply to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowell, repeating the
							arguments that he had urged at the last Meeting for cheapening the
							expense of Education, but observing that he was now satisfied that the
							whole project was impracticable, and that nothing could be done, he
							concluded by moving that the Committee should adjourn without day. I
							observed that as the Committee had been appointed by the Meeting for the
							discharge of a specific duty, I thought it would be incumbent upon them
							to make a report of some kind to the constituent body—That although I
							could not approve of raising a contribution for the object proposed by
							the Meeting; the purpose itself of raising a fund by the voluntary
							offerings of the graduates, to take effect at the period of the second
							century from the foundation of the College, and for the benefit of the
							University was one which I approved and cherished; and hoped might be
							still carried into execution— A report therefore might be made to the
							Meeting of next Commencement day, that the Committee finding the object
							prescribed by the last meeting impracticable, would recommend the
							raising of the fund for another object, and I would cheerfully
							contribute my aid and contribution to the erection of a building for the
							library. Three members of the Committee <persRef ref="white-daniel"
								>Daniel A. White</persRef> of Salem, <persRef ref="lyman-theodore"
								>Theodore Lyman</persRef>, now Mayor of Boston, and one other, had
							declined serving on the Committee— I proposed that the Committee should
							supply their places; but judge Story said that in that case he should
							also decline serving on the Committee and wished his place might also be
							supplied— After various remarks of several other members, it was finally
							voted to adjourn the Meeting of the Committee to the first Monday in
							August next, then to meet at 10 O’Clock in the morning at the same
							place, to make up a report to the general Meeting the day before the
							next Commencement— The Chairman, and the Secretary at the request of any
							two members of the Committee being authorised in the meantime, to call a
							special meeting of the Committee, if it should be necessary. The meeting
							adjourned before one O’Clock— I called again at Charles’s Office, and
							saw him; then paid a visit to <persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">Lieutenant
								Governor Armstrong</persRef>, whom I found at home; and then went
							and dined at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H. Foster’s— His
							brother at Portsmouth’s wife, his three sons, his son <persRef ref="foster-james3">James’s</persRef> <persRef ref="foster-caroline">wife</persRef> and
							<persRef ref="barnard-caroline">daughter</persRef>, and his daughters <persRef ref="foster-elizabeth2"
								>Elizabeth</persRef> and <persRef ref="foster-mary">Mary</persRef>
							were there— Louisa had gone out with John Quincy— At four O’Clock
								<persRef ref="gillet-simon">Gillet</persRef> took me up in the
							Stage, and I came home with eight women and three children besides
							outside passengers— He came round by the new Settlement in Roxbury where
							there are nearly thirty houses built since the last Spring, looking like
							a new created City— Reached home after Sunset and found Louisa Foster
							here.</p>

						<p>Walk to <persRef ref="holbrook-amos">Doctor Holbrook’s</persRef> house
							before Sunrise— The distance is 3 1/4 miles. which I walked in 53
							minutes and took the same time to return— I count one thousand of my
							paces to a Mile, and a second of time for every pace— At 17 minutes to a
							Mile, it makes 1020 seconds for as many paces— But the weather being
							cold this morning I walked at the rate of a mile in 16 minutes. D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Holbrook was not up— I requested his
							Servant man, not to disturb him; but when he should rise to say that I
							had called to ask him to visit <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> again, at his
							convenience in the course of the day— But to tell him that she was not
							worse than when he had last seen her— The man forgot the last part of
							his message, and the Doctor hearing that I had been at that early hour,
							to ask his attendance, hastened after me, and came within ten minutes
							after I got back from my walk. <persRef ref="turner-judith">Miss

							Garden, and the first fire for the Season was made in our dining
							room.</p>

								>r</hi></persRef> lived, and died—the remainder was through the

							quite ripe—wild Pears from three different trees; all small, and
							apparently of the same kind: and white crab apples—with all these I
							propose to make the experiment of planting— But I lost the day, for the

							health, with every tooth sound in his head— His temper is cheerful, and
							his Spirit still lively, but his memory much decayed, of which he is
