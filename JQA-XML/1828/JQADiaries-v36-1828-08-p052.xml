						<p>Intending to leave the City next Monday for a visit of about two Months
							to Quincy, I propose intermitting my morning rides on horseback until
							that time— <persRef ref="conner-benjamin2">Captain Conner</persRef> came
							to renew his solicitation for employment— His hopes had fixed upon the
							work for removing the Bar at the mouth of Merrimack river; and he has
							great confidence in certain mechanical inventions of his own. But
							neither the <persRef ref="southard-samuel">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef> nor the Chief Engineer thinks that he can be employed
							to advantage— They alledge his age and inefficiency as insuperable
							objections— <persRef ref="hoops-adam">Major Hoops</persRef>— Ecce iterum
							Crispinus—intent upon the great reform in the establishment of Military
							Store-keepers, and the indispensable necessity of allowing each of them
							a Clerk—but he is now here to receive his part of the provision made by
							the Act of the last Session of Congress, for the relief of certain
							Officers and Soldiers of the Revolutionary War— <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>
							brought again the Accounts of <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J.
								Ingersoll</persRef> and <persRef ref="randall-josiah">Josiah
								Randall</persRef>, for services as Counsel in the suits at
							Philadelphia, before the U.S. Circuit Court, relating to <persRef
								ref="thomson-edward">Edward Thomson’s</persRef> failure and frauds.
							He proposed a definitive allowance to each of them, to which I agreed—
								<persRef ref="porter-peter">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Porter</persRef> brought a Letter from <persRef ref="scott-winfield"
								>General Scott</persRef> declaring again his refusal to obey an
							order of <persRef ref="macomb-alexander">General Macomb</persRef>;
							insisting upon <hi rend="italic">his </hi>being Macomb’s superior
							Officer, and asking again for a trial by Court Martial. I desired Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Porter to notify the other members of the
							Administration now here to attend a Cabinet Meeting at one to-morrow.
								<persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brent</persRef> brought drafts of answers to the Notes from <persRef
								ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lederer-lewis">Baron Lederer</persRef>— The latter came and had
							a personal interview with me at which he gave me a copy of the
							full-power which he has received from the Austrian Government to
							negotiate a Treaty of Commerce with the United States. This has been
							consequent upon a prior correspondence between him and the Secretary of
							State— I told him that upon <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s</persRef> return to this City,
							a full-power would be given him to negotiate with him for a Treaty, and
							that it would afford me the highest gratification to establish the
							commercial relations between the United States and the Austrian
							dominions upon a mutually satisfactory foundation— General Macomb came
							and introduced <persRef ref="gratiot-charles">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Gratiot</persRef> who is now at the head of the
							Engineer Department— <persRef ref="persico-luigi">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Persico</persRef> introduced to me
								<persRef ref="persico-gennaro">his brother</persRef>, who is a
							teacher of drawing and resides at Philadelphia. I had much conversation
							with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, upon the Chesapeake and Ohio
							Canal, which is in some danger from the collision of local interests
							between the three Cities of the District, and the imperious claim of the
							Corporation of Washington that it should pass through the City— They
							have already agitated the question of transferring their whole
							subscription—a Million of Dollars, but upon which no instalment has yet
							been paid— A pro forma sale to an irresponsible broker, which would be
							equivalent to withdrawing their subscription altogether— I conversed
							also with General Macomb and Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Gratiot
							concerning the distribution of the Engineer Officers, upon the Surveys
							for internal improvement. I signed an order for the remission upon
							payment of all charges of the penalty upon <persRef ref="orne-r">R. E.
								Orne</persRef>, Master of the Barque Cavelier of Salem, for an
							excess of 2. Passengers from Havre to New-York. <persRef
								ref="graham-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham</persRef>
							sent me for signature 652. Land-grants.</p>

							will hereafter be given him. I told him that I would give M<hi

							in my power; but it was impossible for me to do any thing for him at
							this time— <persRef ref="thomas-william">William Thomas</persRef> is a
							Son of the late judge <persRef ref="thomas-joshua">Joshua
								Thomas</persRef> of Plymouth, and being a candidate for the
							appointment of Collector at that Port, comes here to obtain it by dint
							of personal solicitation. I had yesterday requested <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> to
							issue a Commission to <persRef ref="warren-pelham">Pelham W.
								Warren</persRef> in whose favour after full deliberation I had
							decided— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas was here twice, and
							finding on his first visit that the Commission had not been despatched
							endeavoured by argument to change my determination— Importunities of
							this kind are severe tests of Patience and Temper; and Thomas put mine
							to the trial— The harshness of a direct refusal is always painful, and
							sturdy Petitioners will persevere even after it is given. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas was not to be repulsed by the
							information that I had before he came—given directions that the
							Commission should be made out to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Warren—
							I was ultimately obliged to tell him that I saw no sufficient cause for
							revoking what I had done.— <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> took back the drafts
							of his provisional answers to <persRef ref="krudener-paul">Barons
								Krudener</persRef> and <persRef ref="lederer-lewis"
								>Lederer</persRef>, which I approved with a suggestion of some

									>r</hi> Pleasonton</persRef> called respecting the appointment
							of some Light-House keeper, and <persRef ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Watkins</persRef> with Letters from
							Baltimore— The <persRef ref="mclean-john2">Postmaster General</persRef>
							brought a remonstrance received, against the appointment of <persRef
								ref="langhorne-maurice">Maurice Langhorne</persRef> as Postmaster at
							Maysville Kentucky— I advised M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean to
							suspend for the present the reception of the Bond. <persRef
								ref="bulfinch-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bulfinch</persRef> called to mention that he proposed making an
							excursion for his health to the Western part of the State of New-York.
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fullerton</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Young</persRef> of Pennsylvania came
							as visitors, <persRef ref="ringgold-tench">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Ringgold</persRef> the Marshal to take leave previous to
							my departure— There was a Cabinet Meeting to determine upon the course
							to be pursued with regard to <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General
								Scott’s</persRef> Letter— <persRef ref="porter-peter">General
								Porter</persRef> read the drafts of two Letters to Scott—one short
							repeating the command that he should obey the commands of <persRef
								ref="macomb-alexander">General Macomb</persRef>, and the refusal to
							try either Macomb or Scott himself by a Court-Martial; the other
							assigning at some length the reasons upon which I consider Macomb as
							entitled to the command, and decline submitting the question to the
							decision of a Court Martial— These were both fully discussed— The Letter
							containing the argument was satisfactory, but we all agreed that it
							should be reserved to be used hereafter, perhaps in the form of a
							Report— The short Letter was approved, with an amendment, leaving out an
							intimation that in the event of Scott’s continued disobedience I should
							dismiss him from the army— I thought this unnecessary particularly as it
							appeared that Scott although professing to disobey Macomb’s Order had
							really carried it into effect. This fact however was left somewhat
							uncertain by the ambiguous tenour of his own Letter, and is to be <pb
								type="ms" n="54"/>ascertained by enquiry of <persRef
								ref="jones-roger">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Jones</persRef>— <persRef ref="wilson-john4">John Wilson</persRef>
							came again upon the subject of his claim, and of his application for

						<p>Heard this morning at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church
								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef>, from Luke 10.42— “But one thing is needful.” This
							was the best discourse that I ever heard from him— The one thing needful
							is the salvation of the immortal Soul— And the arguments of its
							immortality, and of its responsibility to future retribution are derived
							from 1. Reason 2. Conscience— 3. Nature. 4. Revelation— A very good
							division of the subject; and well sustained by a logically connected
							chain of deductions— After the Morning Service <persRef
								ref="english-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George B.
								English</persRef> called upon me, and repeated an application which
							he had made by Letter for a vacant appointment. I told him that after
							the painful necessity I had been under of revoking the commission with
							which I had charged him it was impossible that I should confer upon him
							any other Office until after an interval of at least several months it
							shall be ascertained that the same cause no longer operates to exclude
							him from the public service— He insisted that I had been misinformed and
							deceived respecting his habits—that he was not intemperate— That having
							been the other day very unwell, and having been weakened by loss of
							blood, a very small quantity of Spirit had affected him; but it was an
							accident which would not happen again; and he could prove by <persRef
								ref="eakin-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eakin</persRef> who
							had been for several months past a fellow lodger with him in the same
							house, that his general habits were of sobriety— I then told him that if
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eakin would write me a line to that
							effect, or call upon me and give me the assurance in person, I would
							give all proper consideration to his testimony— Within half an hour M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Eakin came, but instead of confirming
							English’s assurances, spoke only of his own embarasment, at being called
							upon by him to bear witness to his exemption from habits of
							intemperance; being at the same time told by him that his subsistence
							depended upon this testimony— He said it was extremely distressing to
							him to feel that the bread of a person for whom he had kind feelings
							should depend upon what he should say, and he scarcely knew what to say—
							I told him that was enough. There was no necessity that he should bear
							testimony against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> English, who probably
							laboured under the self-delusion, common to many unfortunate persons in
							the same condition of not knowing their own habits— In the Evening I
							heard <persRef ref="lothrop-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lathrop</persRef>, from Matthew 6.9. “Our father which art in
							Heaven.” A sensible discourse upon the character of the Lord’s prayer,
							with reference to the relation which it establishes between man and his
							maker, corresponding to that between a father and his Children— M<hi

							Commissioner of the General Land Office called, respecting the

								<persRef ref="wilson-john4">John Wilson</persRef>, for an
							appointment as surveyor to draw the line between the State of Louisiana
							and the Territory of Arkansas— Graham said there were two objections to

							makes the enquiry of him and repeats the command to Scott to obey all
							the Orders of General <hi rend="strikethrough">Scott</hi> Macomb as
							Major General of the Army of the United States.— I had some conversation
							with <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef>, on the subject of the vessel to be despatched
							upon a scientific and exploring expedition to the South Sea, and
							expressed to him my earnest wish that her departure might be effected

								Brent</persRef> came, and took them with respect to the Department

							Consuls— Taking of him a receipt for the number and kind of blanks left
							with him, with directions to return me when I come back all the signed
							Blanks remaining unused, and to keep and give me an account of all those
							that shall have been disposed of. This has been my constant practice,
							with respect to signed Blanks of this description— I do the same with
							regard to Patents and Land-grants, and it should be extended to
							Mediterranean Passports and Sea-Letters— But they are always signed in
							blank by the President, and the responsibility of their use rests at the
							Department of the Treasury— <persRef ref="u">Stabler</persRef> was a visitor— <persRef

								<persRef ref="wyer-edward">Edward Wyer</persRef> passed through
							Rossburg in a Hack from Washington in the Night— We left Rossburg at
							five A.M. and arrived at <persRef ref="merrill-john">Merrill’s</persRef>
							tavern at Waterloo 15 Miles. at 8. There breakfasted—rested our horses
							till half past eleven—and then rode to Baltimore and at 15 minutes past
							two, alighted at <persRef ref="barnum-david">Barnum’s</persRef> tavern—
							The morning was cloudy with a succession of light drizzling Showers, by
							which being on horseback I was not a little annoyed— And having been so
							long disused to this exercise, the ride of 27 Miles this day, following
							that of 9 last Evening was very fatiguing— I found myself also somewhat
							sore from <unclear>excoration</unclear>— We dined immediately after our arrival at
							Baltimore; and from four in the afternoon till near eleven at Night had
							a continual stream of visitors, almost all Strangers, but who came to
							shake hands with the President— In the Evening there was a Jackson party
							popular meeting, in the Square adjoining to Barnum’s house, at which a
							young man named <persRef ref="mcmahon-john">M’Mahon</persRef>, a member
							of the State Legislature, harangued the multitude for about three hours
							upon the unpardonable sins of the Administration, and the transcendant
							virtues of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef>— He
							was still speaking when I retired to bed, and I heard his voice like the
							beating of a mill-clapper, but nothing that he said. The meeting
							dispersed about eleven at Night. There was a similar Meeting of the
							friends of the Administration a few Nights since; and there are Ward
							Meetings or Committee Meetings of both parties, every day of the week—
							It is so in every part of the Union— A Stranger would think that the
							People of the United States have no other occupation than
							electioneering.</p>

							from the wharf to <persRef ref="head-joseph2">Head’s</persRef>
							Mansion-House in South third Street— They shouted continually as I went
