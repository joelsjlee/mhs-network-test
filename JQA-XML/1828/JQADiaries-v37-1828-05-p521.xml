						<p>Rainy morning again, and I walked alone. <persRef ref="williams-lewis"
								>Lewis Williams</persRef> a member of the House of Representatives
							from North-Carolina, introduced <persRef ref="fullerton-david">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fullerton</persRef>, heretofore a
							member of the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress from
							Pennsylvania, and now an applicant for any Office under the Government
							that will give him and his family bread— <persRef ref="dyer-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dyer</persRef> came and took
							back his papers, except his own petition— The question upon his title
							requires a judicial rather than an executive decision— <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> was
							here twice— He had prepared answers to Notes from <persRef
								ref="obregon-pable">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Obregon</persRef>
							on the Mexican Minister, and from <persRef ref="rebello-silvestre">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rebello</persRef> the Brazilian Charge
							d’Affaires— He postpones his departure for Philadelphia, till Sunday,
							that he may in the mean time sign the Treaty with Prussia. He spoke with
							great earnestness of the nomination to be made of a Minister to Great
							Britain, and urged anew the wishes and pretensions of <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef>; and the nomination
							of a Citizen of New-York to the Office of Secretary of War. All the
							friends of the administration are agreed that the political effect of
							the appointment of <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Webster</persRef> would be very unfavourable— The secret
							of Governor Barbour’s anxiety to go to England, is to save himself from
							the wreck— <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> has the same desire; and it is not inoperative upon
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s recent propensities to resign—
							As the rage of the tempest increases, and the chances grow desperate,
							each one will take care of himself— I know not that I could do better
							than gratify Governor Barbour, who has rendered faithful service to the
							Country; and whose integrity and honour are unsullied— In my own
							political downfal, I am bound to involve unnecessarily none of my
							friends— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay thinks that the appointment
							of Governor Barbour, would not have a bad political effect upon the
							Administration— In this he is greatly mistaken— The effect will be
							violent and probably decisive— But why should I require men to sacrifice
							themselves for me? <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> the Secretary of
							the Navy <pb type="ms" n="522"/>was also twice here— He wishes to
							appoint a Commander of the Squadron upon the Eastern Coast of South
							America, to relieve <persRef ref="biddle-james">Commodore James
								Biddle</persRef>, who must now come home. He mentioned <persRef
								ref="creighton-john">Captain Creighton</persRef>; but I thought it
							best to consider further, before fixing upon him— He wants judgment and
							discretion— <persRef ref="u">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Taylor</persRef> of Kentucky called and took leave. The bill for his
							relief has passed, and he says will enable him to pay a debt— <persRef
								ref="english-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								English</persRef> came to renew his application for further
							employment; but I could give him no encouragement. At one O’Clock, the
							Arkansas Cherokee Indians came with the Agent <persRef
								ref="duval-edward">Duval</persRef>, and their interpreter <persRef
								ref="rogers-james">James Rogers</persRef>— I had a talk with them in
							which the <persRef ref="blackfox">Black Fox</persRef> was the Speaker on
							their part— I told them it was my desire to do every thing for them in
							my power, and I particularly hoped that the Treaty prepared to be signed
							by the Secretary of War and them would be satisfactory to them. I
							referred particularly to the promises made to them by <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> in 1819. and assured them that we should take
							every proper measure for giving them substantial effect— The Black Fox
							after expressing his thanks to the great Spirit for the opportunity
							affording him and his brothers of the deputation to hold a talk with
							their great father, listened to all that I said, and then observed that
							he wished to answer it not in a hasty manner; but to have time to
							consider it; to which I readily agreed—and said I wished them to take
							all the time they would desire, and frankly to let me know all that they
							thought and all they wanted— <persRef ref="sequoyah">George
								Guess</persRef> is the inventor of the Cherokee Alphabet, by which I
							told him he had rendered a great service to his Nation, in opening to
							them a new fountain of knowledge— I found afterwards that he had sent me
							a copy of this alphabet, with a Letter intimating that it was thought
							the United States ought to give him a gratuity of 6000 dollars for his
							invention. <persRef ref="watts-beaufort">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Watts</persRef>, Charge d’Affaires to the Republic of Colombia,
							recently arrived upon a leave of absence was here, and gave me to
							understand that it was his wish and intention to return thither— I sent
							a Message to the Senate N. 29. with a Report from the Secretary of War,
							and documents relating to the removal of the Indian Agency from Fort
							Wayne. My Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> left us at 4
							O’Clock this afternoon, to return home to Boston. <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">His mother</persRef> and her Sister,
								<persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> W. S. Smith</persRef> accompany him as far as
							Baltimore— I gave him a tin box, containing 60 sinking Cork Oak Acorns,
							last received from Spain, about as many Post Oak Acorns, which I have
							kept over winter, and perhaps two dozen Brazilian Squash Seeds given me
							by <persRef ref="wyer-edward">E. Wyer</persRef>— All these George is to
							plant next week at Quincy— I visited the Nursery and found along the
							Northern border within the fence 36 trees, coming up between the Eastern
							end of the Nursery, and the row of transplanted cherries— Of these trees
							there are Oaks, Black Walnuts and one Chesnut discernable. As yet no
							Shagbarks— I wrote this Evening till near Midnight.</p>

						<p>The cold and rainy weather continues, and confines my morning walks still

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowrie</persRef> the Secretary of the

						<p>this as a notice that he was not to expect any thing hereafter— I said it
							would be better if he should—particularly as I had found by experience,
							that he construed into promises, every the slightest expression of
							kindness. He thanked me for my candour. <persRef ref="seymour-horatio"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seymour</persRef> a Senator from
							Vermont introduced a <persRef ref="u">Professor Hall</persRef> of
							Washington College Hartford, and <persRef ref="u">Professor
								Betton</persRef> of Princeton College. <persRef ref="king-josias"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King</persRef> from the

							Senator from New-Hampshire came to take leave— He is called suddenly and
							most inopportunely home to <persRef ref="bell-john2">his
								brother</persRef>, who is suddenly afflicted with a severe and
							dangerous illness— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell repeated the
							advice to leave the Mission to Great-Britain open till the next Session
							of Congress— <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef>
							came and mentioned a Resolution of the Senate, in their Executive
							capacity: calling for the confidential Inspection returns relating to
							the characters of the Officers of the Army— He thought it had been
							instigated by <persRef ref="wool-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Wool</persRef> the Inspector General, whom he thinks ambitious of
							having his Reports laid before the Senate— The Governor was annoyed also
							by base Newspaper paragraphs, and by a baser insinuation published by
								<persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef>, one of the members of the
							House of Representatives from Tennessee, charging him with suppressing a
							document relating to the case of the six Militia-Men— A Letter from
							<persRef ref="blount-willie">Willie Blount</persRef> then Governor
							of Tennessee, not found in the War Department—nor in the Archives of the
							Government of Tennessee; but of which Blount has given a certified copy
							from his private files; and which is so in opposition to the whole tenor
							of his other correspondence with the Department, at that time, that
							Governor Barbour firmly believes it to be a fabrication; and that
							although now certified by Blount, it was in fact never written by him—
							Governor Barbour told me, that he was going for two or three days into
							Virginia. <persRef ref="kerr-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="maxwell-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Maxwell</persRef> of the House of Representatives, of the Committee

						<p>In the garden I found but one now plumtree up in my eastern seedling bed.

							mentioned the appointment of a Minister to Great Britain, and assured me
							that he should cheerfully acquiesce in the assignment of it to any one

							Temple could be successful. <persRef ref="vanrensselaer-stephen">General

								<persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef>, a member of

								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>I found in the Southern seedling bed in the garden 25 Trees up from the

								ref="marvin-dudley">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marvin</persRef>,
							member of the house from New-York came to speak of a claim of <persRef
								ref="u">Merrill</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Baker</persRef>, upon
							the War Department— The question was upon a claim of indemnification for
							the loss by a violent tempest of certain timber, delivered by them
							according to an agreement at Oswego for the Lakes— The <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Secretary of War</persRef> doubting the
							propriety of the allowance referred the case to me for decision— I
							thought the allowance to be very equitable, but that the executive had
							no authority to make it. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marvin argued
							the case in behalf of the claimants, for more than an hour, but without
							changing my opinion— The executive can only hold the party to his
							contract— The dispensing power is in Congress— The contract was not
							among the papers and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marvin was not very
							certain as to its purport— He admitted however that there was in it no
							stipulation binding the United States, to bear the loss of disastrous
							accidents in the progress of its execution. <persRef ref="mclean-john2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean</persRef> the Postmaster
							General came upon a subject which is giving him and me great trouble—
							The recent appointment of a Postmaster at Philadelphia— My diary of 16.
							April shews how this was effected— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean
							went to <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Sergeant</persRef>, and told him he had concluded to remove <persRef
								ref="bache-richard">R. Bache</persRef> and asked if <persRef
								ref="sergeant-thomas">his brother</persRef> would accept the Office—
							John Sergeant answered that he did not know and desired time to consult
							him. The Postmaster General could not allow delay— Sergeant could not
							put a negative upon the offer of a lucrative Office to his brother, and
							told him that he was well qualified for the Office, and had for some
							years taken no part in politics— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean
							then came to me— Told me of his having already been to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> John Sergeant, who was desirous that his
							brother should be appointed, and had assured him that the appointment
							would be acceptable to all parties. By this statement he obtained my
							consent to the appointment: and a Letter was written to him and
							despatched by a special messenger the same day—though it seems his
							Commission was not sent, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean this
							day said he believed the Commission was not yet sent— But the
							appointment, when known in Philadelphia, produced an instantaneous and
							most violent fermentation among the friends of the Administration, and
							probably a fatal shock <pb type="ms" n="528"/>to the popularity of John
							Sergeant, who was supposed to have solicited the appointment for his
							brother— The conduct of the Postmaster General in this affair has been
							very severely censured in three successive Articles of the Democratic
							Press; and in the paper of Saturday last an Article of two Columns,
							arraigns him before the public, in terms which he has thought required
							him to come forth in his own defence— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							M’lean read to me a paper which he told me he had prepared to publish in
							a newspaper to-morrow. The Article in the Democratic Press, charges him
							with neglect of his official duties in not sooner removing the late
							Postmaster Richard Bache, and with deep and treacherous intrigue in
							effecting the appointment of Thomas Sergeant— The paper which he read to
							me was a defence upon both the points; and with regard to the default of
							Bache, he justifies himself sufficiently; at least so far as to shew
							that in declining to remove him heretofore he had acted with my
							concurrence. But in repelling the charge of intrigue and treachery to
							affect the appointment of T Sergeant he said that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> J. Sergeant had not solicited the office
							for his brother; but that he M’lean had fixed upon him of his own motion
							without any recommendation— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean
							that I had not read the Article in the Democratic Press—but that among
							the rumours circulated among the friends of the Administration at
							Philadelphia, it was assented that <persRef ref="ingham-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham</persRef> had recommended T.
							Sergeant; and that his Commission had been sent to <persRef
								ref="dallas-george">G. M. Dallas</persRef>, and that the deportment
							of those two men towards the Administration and personally towards
							myself made them singular Counsellors for appointments to Office under
							me— He acknowledged that these persons were very hostile to the
							Administration; and admitted with some embarrassment that some time
							since, he observed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham, that he
							should perhaps be under the necessity of removing the Postmaster at
							Philadelphia, and would wish to appoint a person fully qualified in
							every respect; and who belonged to and would be obnoxious to no party;
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham said he did not know where he
							would find such a man unless he took Tom Sergeant. But M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean said he had not considered this as
							a recommendation, and had not been influenced by it to the appointment—
							That he had not sent M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sergeants Letter of
							Appointment to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dallas but had written to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dallas, both as a near relative of
							Bache and as a lawyer, to secure the funds in Bache’s hands, so that
							there might be no loss to the public— I then said that as the Commission
							to T. Sergeant had not been sent, I wished him to return it for the
							present— That a full, effective, and bona fide examination of the
							transactions relating to the establishment and recent transfer of the
							Franklin Gazette would be necessary; and particularly whether S. D.
							Ingham, G. M. Dallas, and T. Sergeant or either of them have or ever had
							any pecuniary interest direct or indirect in it— The Gazette was first
							established as an adversary and rival to the Democratic Press— It was
							established ostensibly by Richard Bache at a large expense at a time
							when he was personally insolvent, and a defaulter as Postmaster to the
							amount of many thousand Dollars— It was afterwards commonly rumoured
							that T. Sergeant, Ingham and Dallas were all interested in the property
							of the paper— The Establishment has lately been sold—the Democratic
							Press alledges under a pledge that the Post-Office printing should be
							continued to it; and Sergeant since he has been in the Office, has
							refused to transfer the printing from that paper— These circumstances
							required a full and explicit and candid exposition of facts, which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean said he would immediately set about
							to obtain. He said that if the printing should be transferred he wished
							it might be transferred to <persRef ref="walsh-robert">Walshs</persRef>
							Gazette, and not to the Democratic Press— I told him that I did not wish
							to enter into any scramble <pb type="ms" n="529"/>of Printers for
							Official jobs, but wished the subject to be thoroughly cleared up, with
							reference to the public interest alone— I also desired M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean to omit from his publication every
							thing that was of a complimentary character to me— His professions and
							protestations both of personal respect for me, and of devotion to the
							Administration were warm, reiterated, and solemn; and he repelled with
							vehement indignation the charge of being hostile to the Administration—
							I told him that my confidence in him had been unqualified— That of my
							Satisfaction with his performance of his duties I had given evidence in
							more than one communication to Congress, and that I had adhered to him
							under frequent representations of circumstances of unpleasant character,
							but which I had not thought it necessary even to notice. I still
							confided in him, but thought he himself might in this affair have been
							misled, and hoped it would ultimately be satisfactorily explained—

							the flower seeds, and the <persRef ref="foy-john">gardener</persRef>
							prepared drills in the garden for the beans. I visited also the Nursery
							in the course of the day and found 116 Trees up in the North 28 in the
							west 42 in the South and 6 on the East border— They are coming up every
							day, and I expect there will be more than double these numbers in the
							course of another month— <persRef ref="wood-silas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r </hi>Wood</persRef>, a member of the House
							of Representatives came and spoke to me concerning the settlement of the
							accounts of    <persRef ref="gelston-david">Gelston</persRef> formerly
							Collector of the Customs at New-York— He claims some credits which the
							accounting Officers of the Treasury have not yet concluded to admit, and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gelston who is now eighty four years
							of age, and has already had one or two paralytic shocks is extremely
							anxious to have the accounts finally adjusted. The questions are to be
							submitted for my decision— <persRef ref="reed-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Reed</persRef>, a member of the House
							from Massachusetts came and introduced a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Angier</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u"
								>his Son</persRef> from Boston— <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whittlesey</persRef>, a member
							from Ohio came with a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thorn</persRef> also from that State— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whittlesey told me that he had been informed by <persRef
								ref="burch-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burch</persRef>,
							that <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef>, while President, had published at his own
							expence <pb type="ms" n="530"/>and caused to be distributed to each
							member of Congress a pamphlet, giving an account of the proceedings of
							the Government in the case of <persRef ref="burr-aaron">Burrs</persRef>
							conspiracy, and in which he mentioned the employment of <persRef
								ref="graham-john">John Graham</persRef> as a secret and confidential
							Agent— He asked me if I had a copy of that pamphlet. I had never heard
							of it before, and said I believed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burch
							must have been mistaken— There was an inofficial pamphlet, said to have
							been compiled under M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s
							directions, at the Department of State by <persRef ref="wagner-jacob"
								>Jacob Wagner</persRef>, and distributed among the members Congress
							in 1803. and an anonymous Examination of the British doctrines relating
							to neutral trade, written by <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef> then Secretary of
							State and communicated in the same manner, but I have no knowledge of
							any such pamphlet as that mentioned by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Burch. <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brent</persRef> was here just after M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whittlesey, and had never heard of this pamphlet. <persRef
								ref="stewart-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Stewart</persRef> came according to appointment at Noon. Her object
							was to prevail upon me to write to <persRef ref="hopkinson-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hopkinson</persRef> of Philadelphia,
							and urge him to induce her husband <persRef ref="stewart-charles"
								>Commodore Stewart</persRef> to make some adequate provision for her
							support— They have been these two years or more separated; after great
							imprudence, and not a little misconduct on both sides. On her part
							inexcusable extravagance and disgraceful expedients to raise money for
							which he has been made responsible—on his part harshness, intemperance
							and licentiousness— She spoke of him and his vices with great
							bitterness, said it was impossible she should ever live with him again;
							and all she desired was a yearly allowance for her support. She wished
							nothing unreasonable in amount—a thousand or even eight hundred dollars
							would content her for her <persRef ref="u">brother</persRef> would supply, whatever might further
							be necessary for her, but she would on no consideration whatever
							surrender to him <persRef ref="stewart-delia2">her daughter</persRef>.
							She shewed me a Letter from her brother, advising her to take this
							course and to acquiesce in any terms, which should have her daughter in
							her care. She was extremely urgent to obtain from me a promise that I
							would write to M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Hopkinson, but I only
							assured her that I would reflect upon the subject, and serve her if I
							should find it in my power. <persRef ref="roberdeau-isaac">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l</hi> Roberdeau</persRef> called to speak

								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> and <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>
							were here, and I spoke to them of the Postmaster Generals Statement, and
							the recent appointment of Postmaster at Philadelphia— Governor Barbour
							is highly exasperated at the conduct of <persRef ref="mclean-john2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean</persRef>, and earnestly
							advised his removal— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush had not read
							the Article in the Democratic Press, and was more cool. I received a
							Letter from <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> at Philadelphia, also advising the removal of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean— Governor Barbour spoke also of the
							approaching Report of the Retrenchment Committee, which as was to be
							foreseen will be a violent and inflammatory electioneering pamphlet—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush mentioned the receipt of several
							boxes of seeds and plants from <persRef ref="mullowny-john">Captain
								Mullowny</persRef> the consul at Tangier; the first <unclear>fruits</unclear> of the

							entirely satisfied with the nomination of <persRef ref="savage-john"
								>John Savage</persRef>, now Chief Justice of the State of New-York
							to be Treasurer of the United States. I told him that my own
							inclination, would have been to nominate him, but that a consideration
							of all the circumstances belonging to the case had led me to the
							conclusion that M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Savage was the person
							whom I ought to present to the Senate— He approved the nomination fully,
							and said he had not desired that his name should for a moment stand in
							the way of the cause to which he was devoted. He also mentioned the vote
							in the House of Representatives this day, for the passage to the third
							reading of a Bill, authorising the subscription of one Million of
							dollars in five annual instalments to the Stock of Chesapeake and Ohio
							Canal— It passed by the unexpected majority of 44 votes, and was very
							gratifying to the Inhabitants of the District— <persRef

								Marks</persRef> a Senator from Pennsylvania shewed me a Letter that
							he had received from an Editor of a Newspaper in the Western part of
							Pennsylvania, mentioning reports circulated industriously there, that
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> was an
							English woman, and others of similar character, but the more readily
							believed for their absurdity— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marks asked
							me to mention so much of the facts as would enable him to deny these
							ridiculous tales. I told him that I was married in London— That my wife
							was the daughter of <persRef ref="johnson-joshua">Joshua
								Johnson</persRef>, a native of Maryland, then Consul of the United
							States at London, and brother of <persRef ref="johnson-thomas3">Thomas
								Johnson</persRef>, a member of the Congress of 1774, first Governor
							of Maryland, after the Revolution, and appointed by <persRef
								ref="washington-george">General Washington</persRef>, a Judge of the
							Supreme Court of the US. with all which information M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Marks was much gratified. <persRef
								ref="wales-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wailes</persRef> a

								<persRef ref="thomas-jesse">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thomas</persRef> a Senator from Illinois spoke upon the subject of
							the Tariff Bill now before the Senate, and upon which they have sat
							yesterday and this day till near ten at Night— Thomas is now satisfied
							that the Bill will pass the Senate: he spoke also of the Postmaster
							General, and thought his removal would have an unfavourable effect upon
							the administration— He said there was an opinion abroad that the was
							unfriendly to the administration, and that he had himself mentioned this
							to <persRef ref="mclean-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>M<hi
									rend="superscript">’</hi>lean</persRef> who had declared to him
							in the most solemn manner that it was not so— He has also made time
							after time the same protestations to me— But I cannot be blind to the
							observation that his conduct has not always been conformable to his
							professions and in this last appointment of a Postmaster at Philadelphia
							it has been strongly marked with duplicity or with weak subserviency to
							the bitterest and most unprincipled enemies not only of the
							Administration, but of myself. <persRef ref="reed-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Reed</persRef>, a member of the House
							of Representatives from Massachusetts brought me several additional
							papers, relating to the case of <persRef ref="winslow-benjamin">Benjamin
								Winslow</persRef> of Brewster, Barnstable County a Smuggler in
							prison, whose petition to be discharged is warmly patronised by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Reed— I referred the Petition <persRef
								ref="blake-george">G. Blake</persRef> U.S. District Attorney,
							Massachusetts, whose Report is very unfavourable to the Petitioner and
							with it he encloses a Letter from Winslow, and his brother, to the
							Captain of his vessel advising him to save the vessel from seizure by
							perjury, both of himself and his crew. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Reed still warmly pleads for his discharge; on the allegation of his
							inability to pay the fine and costs; and I took the papers for
							consideration— <persRef ref="fry-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fry</persRef> was one of the Pursers in the Navy, displaced for
							having failed to give new Bonds within the time required by Law. He now
							applies for a reappointment; and states that he did give a new Bond
							which was accepted though a few days later than the Law required. This
							Bond however is not to be found, and Fry thinks it was delivered to
								<persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef>. He brought two recent Letters from him saying that
							he had made a long and thorough search among his papers for the bond,
							but had not found it. I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fry that the
							question of his re-appointment could only be considered when a vacancy
							should occur. <persRef ref="clarke-satterlee">Satterlee Clark</persRef>

								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							concluded with the Arkansas Cherokee chiefs; with his report concerning
							it, and a map and several explanatory documents to be laid with it,
							before the Senate <pb type="ms" n="533"/> I mentioned to <persRef

								Brent</persRef>, the wish to see <persRef ref="bradley-abraham">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Abraham Bradley</persRef>, the first
							Assistant Postmaster General; and he came— I made some enquiries of him
							respecting the recent appointment of a Postmaster at Philadelphia— It
							appears that 18 months or two years since when there was a prospect that
							it would be necessary to dismiss <persRef ref="bache-richard"
								>Bache</persRef>, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean had
							indicated an intention to appoint <persRef ref="norvell-john"
								>Norvell</persRef> or <persRef ref="sergeant-thomas">T.
								Sergeant</persRef> in his place—Norvell was the ostensible editor,
							and proprietor of the Franklin Gazette and <persRef ref="ingham-samuel"
								>Ingham</persRef> an endorser upon his protested paper— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bradley said that for the last 18 months
							he had time after time spoken to the Postmaster General of Bache’s
							increasing delinquencies— That in February he Bradley had written to
							Bache, urging to him the indispensable necessity of bringing up his
							arrears, to which Bache had answered that he would very shortly. That in
							March Bradley wrote again, to which <persRef ref="dallas-george">George
								M. Dallas</persRef> answered by a Letter to the Postmaster General
							himself which Bradley has not seen— Immediately upon the receipt of
							which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean immediately saw M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham, then <persRef ref="sergeant-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Sergeant</persRef> and then
							me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bradley intimated that Bache’s visit
							here last Summer, by satisfying M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean
							with regard to his politics, had very much mitigated M’leans severity
							with regard to his delinquencies— He thinks M’lean decidedly hostile to
							the administration, but he has no distinct knowledge of Inghams or T.

						<p><date>11. V.</date> Sunday.</p>
						<list><item>Ingersoll— Edward</item></list>
						<p>This morning I heard <persRef ref="bigelow-andrew">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow</persRef> at the Unitarian
							Church, from Galatians 5.13. “For brethren ye have been called unto
							liberty.” A controversial Discourse; asserting the superior excellence
							of the system of Independent Churches over all others as more congenial
							than any other to liberty— The preacher indulged himself in some severe
							remarks both upon the Protestant Episcopalian Church, for putting their
							Liberty, and their faith into the Custody of Bishops, and upon the
							Presbyterians for committing theirs to Presbyteries and Synods— He
							contrasted these with the freedom and simplicity of the Independents,
							who consider each church, as a body Independent of all others:
							exclusively competent to its own Government; and receiving neither
							discipline nor creed from any human authority other than themselves— In
							the afternoon I heard at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Johns Church
								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> who read the Evening prayer for the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>Sunday after Easter, and preached from
							Romans 8.33. “Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is
							God that justifieth. 34. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that
							died yea rather that is risen again, who is ever at the right hand of
							God, who also maketh intercession for us.” M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hawley’s text as usual contained his Sermon— In the Evening
							I heard M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow again, from 1. Peter
							2.21. “For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered
							for us, leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps.”— The
							doctrine inculcated was to follow the example of Christ— Between the
							morning and afternoon service I had a visit from <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward
								Ingersoll</persRef> of Philadelphia. He spoke of the late
							appointment of <persRef ref="sergeant-thomas">Postmaster</persRef> at
							Philadelphia, and of its pernicious effect upon the friends of the
							Administration. But his own opinions upon this occurrence were very
							moderate, and he thought the excitement upon the subject in Philadelphia
							had much subsided— He says that <persRef ref="mclean-john2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean</persRef> did write nearly two
							years since, that in the event of his removing <persRef
								ref="bache-richard">Bache</persRef>, he proposed to appoint <persRef
								ref="norvell-john">Norvell</persRef>, or T. Sergeant. That on the
							recent Sale of the Franklin Gazette Norvell did Guarantee to the paper
							the continuance of the Post-Office printing, and that this guarantee was
							an element in the price of the purchase— That <persRef
								ref="ingham-samuel">Ingham</persRef> is an endorser upon Norvell’s
							protested Notes, and in the Event of the failure of the Guarantee will
							be compelled to pay for Norvell’s insolvency. That Ingham is <unclear>or</unclear> has
							been interested as a proprietor of the Franklin Gazette, and furnished
							the Paper for it from his own manufactory— That the general opinion is
							that Bache’s delinquency is large, and that he has no effective
							bondsmen— Ingersoll had never heard that T. Sergeant was part proprietor
							of the Franklin Gazette, but he has been heavily ransomed as surety or
							endorser for Bache.</p>

						<p>Morning call from <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bailey</persRef>— <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickins</persRef> brought and left
							with me some of the plants, fruits, and seeds sent by <persRef
								ref="mullowny-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Mullowny</persRef> the Consul at Tangier to the <persRef
								key="rush-richard">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>— I set out in
							the Garden, 18 Cuttings of Vines 3 of Figs—and in a Seedling Pot 2.
							Palmetto seeds and 1. Stone of a Date— I found in the Southern seedling
							bed 21. Chesnuts up of a Row of 50 and 10 Oaks of a row of 50 planted
							the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October last, and 25 Black
							Walnuts of several rows planted the 31<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of
							October. In a seedling Pot two shoots of the Turpentine plant are coming
							out; and in the Nursery I discovered 8 Cork Oaks first appearing from
							the Spanish Acorns planted the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							March last— I assume therefore two Months of the opening Spring, as the
							period of vegetation for the Acorn— The Cork Oak leaves of the shoot
							correspond exactly with the form of those in the Plate of Michaux’s
							Book— <persRef ref="foy-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Foy</persRef> planted several rows of the white mulberry, and I
							planted 20 rows of Shell-barks, Pignuts, Black Walnuts and Cork-Oak
							Acorns, in the Nursery; westward of the row of transplanted cherries.
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> was here,
							and had a long conversation with me, upon the desire that he has
							conceived of going as Minister to Great-Britain. He said it had been
							suggested to him by some of his friends, and had not first occurred to
							himself. And he emphatically requested that his name might not for a
							single moment occasion the slightest embarrassment to me— I told him
							frankly my own feelings and difficulties, and the impressions of many of
							our friends.— I observed that some of the difficulties were clearing
							off, and there now remained in substance only two. One was the
							disappointment of a wish that I had constantly entertained that my
							administration from the beginning to the end of its term should be one
							body— The other was the hazard of supplying his place in the Cabinet—
							Considerations of a great moment seemed to require that the person to
							take his place should be a citizen of New-York; but the selection,
							between <persRef ref="porter-peter">P. B. Porter</persRef>
							<persRef ref="spencer-ambrose">Ambrose Spencer</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="sanford-nathan">N. Sanford</persRef>, with out mentioning
							others was perplexing.— I should however in the course of a very few
							days decide. He made some enquiries respecting the mode of living, and
							expenses of a diplomatic establishment in London, which I answered
							conformably to my observation and experience. The prospect which was
							thus presented to him, was not flattering. I told him it was my belief
							that the debt hanging so heavily upon the old age of <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>,
							was chiefly contracted by the expensive establishment of his household
							in London, after his return from Spain in 1805. He said M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe still owed a large debt to the
							house of Baring which he was utterly unable to pay— <persRef
								ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Watkins</persRef> was here, and shewed me a short Article, that he
							had written for publication relating to one of the numberless calumnies
							and forgeries now swarming in the newspapers against me; alledging a
							promise from me to <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Webster</persRef> at the time of the late election, to
							bestow Offices upon federalists, in reward for his support and
							influence—a charge trumped up in fifty different shapes, and false in
							all, having no other foundation than casual conversations, in which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster, and others having intimated that
							some federalists apprehended I should pursue a system of proscription
							against the federalists, I disclaimed every such disposition.— Watkins
							said he wished to be perfectly sure of the accuracy of the facts stated
							in his papers, and I told him they were perfectly correct— In the
							Evening, I had visits from <persRef ref="sergeant-john">J.
								Sergeant</persRef>, and from <persRef ref="parris-albion">A. K.
								Parris</persRef>, a Senator from Maine, with <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r </hi>Shepherd</persRef>, <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tappan</persRef>, and another
							person Citizens of that State— Sergeant read me part of a
							Counter-report, which he and <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett</persRef>, the minority of the
							Retrenchment Committee are <pb type="ms" n="535"/>preparing to be
							presented with the Report of the majority, which will be of the most
							violent, inflammatory and unjust character— Full of gross
							misrepresentations, reckless blunders and foul insinuations— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Parris spoke of the proceedings in
							relation to the North-eastern Boundary, as highly satisfactory to
							himself, and to the People of the State of Maine— I sent Message to the
							Senate N. 33. with the Treaty with the Arkansas Cherokees, a Report from
							the Secretary of War and documents— I also made the following entry on
							the proceedings of a Court Martial on private <persRef
								ref="carmichael-hiram">Hiram Carmichael</persRef>, 22. March 1828.
							tried for Mutiny, and sentenced to be shot to death— The Sentence of the
							Court is approved, and the penalty of being shot to death is remitted.
							The time of service of the Prisoner having expired let him be
							discharged, not with honour, from the army.</p>

						<p>I went again round by the Willow Oak trees that I had discovered last
							November— The pond of water by which they were surrounded last week has
							nearly dried up— I take it as an indication of the soil suited to the
							growth of this tree, which by its nature and habits seems to be in the
							vegetable kingdom, what the Mule is to the Animal. It is evidently a
							half breed, and leads to the enquiry where and how the mixture first
							germinates, and whether this tree itself can be propagated from its own
							acorn—none of those which I planted from it last November have come up—
							I find this morning six of the trees near together— In November I had
							found only three— Two or three of the nine apple-trees which had come up
							in my Seedling pot 12. 2. were this morning killed by a stroke of the
							Sun, though it was not warm. I lost a number last Summer in the same
							way— They will in the course of a half an hour, as if they were plucked
							up from the ground— A number of the white mustard seeds which had fallen
							accidentally into the same Pot and germinating. In the Nursery I found
							12 of the Cork Oaks from Spain coming up in apparently vigorous shoots.
							My success in that experiment is encouraging. May it continue! This
							morning before Breakfast, <persRef ref="wilson-james3">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilson</persRef>, the member of the
							House from Pennsylvania, introduced a person, whose name escaped me;
							from his own district, a <persRef ref="u;u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Welby</persRef> from
							Washington County, Maryland, and a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hughes</persRef> of Georgetown.
							Afterwards <persRef ref="barber-noyes">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barber</persRef>, member from Connecticut, came with a <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas</persRef> of
							New-London, and <persRef ref="ingersoll-ralph">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Ingersoll</persRef>, with <persRef ref="edwards-ogden"
								>Judge Edwards</persRef> of New-York— An insane man, who said he has
							for forty-two years gone by the name of <persRef ref="forman-john"
								>Forman</persRef>, but that it was not his real name, announced
							himself to me as a Messenger from God Almighty— He began by asking me if
							I believed in the Bible— I told him that before he had a right to ask me
							that question, he must shew me his Commission. He said if I had a Bible
							at hand he would do that immediately. I put into his hand the Bible
							which I keep habitually on my writing Table, and he opened it to the
							twelfth Chapter of Revelation, which I read aloud. He pointed to the
							fourteenth verse, and said that was his Commission. “And to the woman
							were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the
							wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and
							times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.” He said the woman
							was The United States of America, and the great eagle was her standard—
							That the two wings of that eagle were given her to fly, and the time was
							now come when she must fly again into the wilderness, and be nourished a
							time, and times—and half a time—for which purpose he had come to me—
							There seemed to be method in this madness; but his discourse was
							wandering; and I could not bring him to a point as to the object of his
							Mission. <persRef ref="robbins-asher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Robbins</persRef>, the Senator from Rhode-Island, came to introduce
							a young Man by the name of <persRef ref="u">D’Wolfe</persRef>, and I
							told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forman, that I had not time to
							receive more of his communication at this time; but would see him if he
							would call again to which he readily assented and went away. <persRef
								ref="sloane-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sloane</persRef>
							the member <pb type="ms" n="536"/>of the House from Ohio was here, and
							conversed with me concerning the <persRef ref="mclean-john2">Postmaster

								<persRef ref="fendall-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fendall</persRef> from the Department of State, brought me the
							papers relating to the case of <persRef ref="smith-john11">John

							habitual intemperance: and remaining in jail from inability to pay the

							lassitude, which I suffered twice this day; once about noon, which
							continued nearly three hours, and again after dinner— Extremely
							oppressive and disabling me both for writing and reading—</p>

								<persRef ref="woodcock-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							his message or Mission to me was— He said he had been appointed by God,
							to effect the gathering of the Jews— And that I could give him great
							assistance in accomplishing the object. I told him I would answer him
							decisively upon that point— I could do nothing to assist him— He said
							then God would operate by the means of others—for he would surely effect
							his purpose; of which I said I was fully convinced— He went away without
							making any difficulty— <persRef ref="armstrong-robert">Lieutenant

						<p>In riding yesterday I had taken a sprain which I was apprehensive would
							for some days disable me from continuing this exercise—but I found
							myself so much relieved this morning that I mounted again my pony and
							rode with John to the Penitentiary— It is in a state of advancement
							sufficient to be completed this Season— In the garden I found no new
							vegetation except of weeds— In my seedling Pot N. 2 a large plant shews
							itself at the surface which I do not know. In glass Tumbler N. 2. Two
							oranges, planted 4 April, one appearing at the surface— Their taproots
							extending down the sides of the glass are already two inches long. In
							the Nursery I find 15 Cork Oaks and 5 Willow Oaks— The Cerasus
							Canadensis—Ash leaved maple, and Bladder Senna. In the Yard the
							Straggling Oaks planted 12 November, are 25— There are Hundreds of the
							Oaks planted both last Autumn and this Spring by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Foy up— The Dutch Elms given by <persRef ref="taliaferro-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Taliaferro</persRef> are almost all, say    in leaf. <persRef
								ref="giusta-antoine">Antoine’s</persRef> Apple-<unclear>pumice</unclear>, and pear

							are flourishing; and I shall leave the Nursery here in as fine a
							condition as I could desire. <persRef ref="johnston-josiah">M<hi

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> was here

							Baltimore renewed an application for some appointment in the Custom
							House; for which he brought several earnest and respectable

							has a new trouble with these Arkansas Cherokee Chiefs— There was a
							Treaty between them and the Osages, negotiated under the sanction of the
							United States, and by which they stipulated in case of any cause of
							complaint between the two tribes, to rely for satisfaction upon the
							United States— Recently a Cherokee, <persRef ref="u">brother</persRef>
							to <persRef ref="graves-thomas">Graves</persRef> one of the Chiefs now
							here, has been murdered by an Osage— The Cherokees demand the punishment
							of the murderer, or declare their determination to apply the Law of
							retaliation. The Osages declare they are ready to deliver up the
							murderer to the authority of the United States, but we have no tribunal
							that can try him for the murder; nor authority to deliver him over to
							the savage Justice of the Cherokees— I thought that the demand should be
							made of the Osages to deliver up the Offender to us; and then that we
							should ransom him from the revenge of the Cherokees, by a payment of
							money to Graves, requiring him and his tribe to renounce their
							resentment—and this course is to be taken— <persRef ref="brent-daniel"

							<unclear>claim</unclear> to be appointed Paymaster of the Marine Corps; and gave me his

								>R. Bache</persRef> the late Postmaster at Philadelphia, <pb

							request a full and particular statement of the circumstances upon which
							he has given these intimations, and I asked him for a copy of that part

							1826— The Committee upon the Message relating to the Assault upon

						<p>In the Garden, the four Rows of Brazilian Beans, all begin to vegetate.
							Many flowers are coming into blossom— The Tulip Tree and Locust, are in
							full bloom— In the Nursery I discern 24 of the Spanish Post-Oaks, and
							two new shoots from the ground— The most flourishing trees are the black
							Walnuts. Riding this morning with <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef>, I found near the Willow Oaks, a Large Sweet gum, or
							Liquid amber tree— <persRef ref="letcher-robert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Letcher</persRef> member of the House from Kentucky,
							introduced <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ashby</persRef> of that State— <persRef ref="watkins-george">George
								Watkins</persRef> brought drafts of two Notes from <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, one
							to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>, and one to <persRef ref="lawrence-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence</persRef> at London, upon the
							North-eastern boundary Convention— I retained the draft to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin— <persRef ref="martindale-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Martindale</persRef>, member of
							the House from New-York came and took the papers of a <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Salomon</persRef>; being a
							memorial from himself, and a multitude of earnest recommendations of him
							for an appointment, in the Custom-house at New-York— I said all the
							subordinate Custom-House appointments were made by the Collector
							sometimes at the Recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury. But
							Martindale said the place that Salomon had in view was that of Surveyor
							of the Port, in the expectation that <persRef ref="thompson-jonathan"
								>Jonathan Thompson</persRef> on the present Collector would be
							removed, and <persRef ref="stagg-peter">Peter Stagg</persRef> the
							present Surveyor appointed in his place. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Martindale warmly urged this measure, which he said would be necessary
							to secure the faithful execution of the new Tariff Act— The Collector
							Thompson, he said, and every Officer of the Customs under him, with the
							exception of Stagg the Surveyor, was notoriously and vehemently opposed
							to the Tariff, and to the American policy, which it was equally
							notorious, was favoured by a great majority of the People of the State
							of New-York. The collector, and all his subordinates were also known to
							be hostile to the present Administration, and their influence brought to
							bear against it was enormous— I observed that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Thompson professed to be faithful to the Administration, and
							although I had not much reason to trust his professions, yet there was
							no act of his known to me which would justify me in removing him from
							Office— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay was here, and I suggested to
							him the propriety of modifying a paragraph of the draft which he had
							prepared of a Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, to
							which he assented— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had much
							conversation with me on the subject of the <persRef ref="mclean-john2	"
								>Postmaster General</persRef>, whom he urged me very earnestly to
							remove, and to appoint <persRef ref="morrow-jeremiah">Jeremiah
								Morrow</persRef>, in his place. The evidences of M’lean’s double
							dealing and treachery to the Cause of the Administration, have
							multiplied upon me till it would require the credulity of January on the
							Tale, to believe him honest or faithful— Yet I am convinced it would be
							extremely impolitic at this time to remove him. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay spoke also of the appointment of a Minister to
							Great-Britain and to the Republic of Colombia— His proposal is that
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> should be
							nominated for the Mission to England, and <persRef ref="porter-peter"
								>General Peter B Porter</persRef> of New-York to be Secretary of
							War, in his place. He is also very solicitous that <persRef
								ref="robertson-george">George Robertson</persRef> of Kentucky, or
								<persRef ref="harrison-william">General Harrison</persRef> should be
							appointed Minister to Colombia— My own impression is that there is no
							necessity for the ap- <pb type="ms" n="541"/>appointment of a Minister
							to Colombia, and that it would be advisable to postpone the appointment
							of a Minister to Great-Britain; at least until the next Session of
							Congress. I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay to notify the
							other members of the Administration to meet here at one O’Clock next
							Monday, to consider this subject— <persRef ref="perry-nathaniel">N. H.
								Perry</persRef> is a purser in the Navy—a brother of the late
								<persRef ref="perry-oliver">Commodore Perry</persRef>, and is now
							applying for active employment in the frigate Hudson soon to sail for
							the Mediterranean— Gov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour enquired if
							I had come to a decision, upon the mission to Great-Britain— I told him
							I had requested a Cabinet consultation, next Monday, preparatory to the
							determination— He expressed a disinclination to be present at this
							Meeting, and I assented to his being absent— He desired that the
							decision might be made, without regard to his wishes—and said that what
							I had told him of the indispensable expense of the English Mission had
							almost dissuaded him from the undertaking of it; but that upon
							conversing with <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Rush</persRef> he had concluded that with rigid economy
							he might get along— <persRef ref="wilde-richard">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Wilde</persRef> a member from Georgia came and made some
							enquiries relating to the claims of Citizens of that State for indemnity
							from Creek Indian depredations, upon which in 1822. <persRef
								ref="preston-james">Governor Preston</persRef> of Virginia had acted
							as Commissioner. Some of those claims, particularly for interest, or
							increase of the property lost were rejected— The fund appropriated for
							payment of the claims by the Treaty was not entirely absorbed by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Prestons adjudications, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilde now in behalf of the Georgian
							claimants revives the question of interest, increase or damages for
							detention— He requested a revision of the claims and read to me extracts
							from two written opinions of <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> the Attorney
							General—one in the case of these claims in which he expresses himself
							very decisively against the demand of Interest, and the other in the
							case of the Slave indemnity Commission where he argues with equal energy
							in its favour. I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilde that I would
							cheerfully give my attention to any representation which he should make
							in behalf of these claims— <persRef ref="wilson-james3">M<hi

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="bigelow-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bigelow</persRef> this morning, from Revelation 21.6. “And he said
							unto me it is done.” Upon this text taken from one of the last chapters
							of the Books of Scripture, the occasion was taken by the preacher to
							pass in review the design and object of the whole Bible, including all
							the Scriptures both of the Old and the New Covenants; which he did with
							much force of reasoning and of Eloquence— In the afternoon I attended
							with <persRef ref="clark-susanna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Clark</persRef> and her daughter <persRef ref="clark-susan"
								>Susan</persRef> at S<hi rend="superscript">t. </hi>John’s Church
							and heard <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray</persRef>
							read the Evening prayer for the Sunday after Ascension day, and preach
							from Psalm 9.10. [“]And they that know thy name will put their trust in

							from Luke 9.53. “And they did not receive him, because his face was as
							though he would go to Jerusalem.” <persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson

							has learning and ingenuity— He has travelled much in Europe, and added

							those of Study— He writes well, but like most of the Cambridge Scholars
							is not fortunate in his delivery— His cadences are monotonous <pb
								type="ms" n="542"/>and his voice rather harsh. He partly reads his
							Sermons, but occasionally turns over his notes and repeats or

						<p>Visited the Garden— I find in my Eastern Seedling bed 21. Shellbark
							trees, two of which appear to be now first coming up— There were 20 when
							I came back last October several of which at the opening of this Spring
							appeared to be dead; but they are now all putting out fresh leaves— In
							the Southern Seedling bed, where I found last October 28. I now discover
							only 18. the rest have disappeared— Of the last fall plantations—the
							Black walnuts, Chesnuts and White and Chesnut Oaks continue to come up—
							The black walnuts put out vigorous shoots and grow rapidly; their stem
							is conical. The Chesnuts through up a very slender stem, and put out
							alternately one narrow long leaf. The Oaks shew the leaf first, and when
							the stem is from one to two inches out of the ground cease to grow, and
							spread out large thin broad leaves upon which the insects commence forth
							with their depredations— The willow Oak shoots up a whitish stem, about
							the diameter of a knitting needle, and puts out from it an appropriate
							leaf— I find one of these in the Southern seedling bed— The Spanish Cork
							Oak of which I this day discover 39. in the Nursery comes up with its
							proper leaf on the top of its stem, looking like the head of a cabbage
							in miniature— I rode with <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>

								Ringgold</persRef> came with numerous recommendations, for an
							appointment to a judicial Office in Florida; under an Act of Congress
							which has not yet been passed— There was a Cabinet Meeting, attended by

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef>; at which I presented for consideration the
							Questions, whether a Minister to the Plenipotentiary Rank should now be
							nominated for Great Britain and for the Republic of Colombia— If so, who
							should be nominated— I expressed my own opinion that it would be
							advisable to postpone both these appointments at least until the next
							Session of Congress— This was not however the opinion of any member of
							the Administration— They were all of opinion that it was advisable to
							appoint to both those Offices now— That <persRef ref="barbour-james"
								>Governor Barbour</persRef> was the most suitable person to be
							nominated for the mission to England— <persRef ref="harrison-william"
								>General Harrison</persRef> the Senator from Ohio, for the Mission
							to Colombia, and <persRef ref="porter-peter">General Peter B.
								Porter</persRef>, Secretary of War in the place of Governor Barbour—
							My principal objection to the appointment of him was that in the present
							state of Affairs it would be a change of position by the Administration,
							very disadvantageous to them— I said it would be universally considered
							by friend and foe as an abandonment of the Administration by Gov<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour, and as a Surrender of the cause—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay made an argument to shew that it
							might be otherwise; but it seemed to me, not to be a matter of
							reasonable discussion, but of feeling. Then as to the appointment of
							General Porter for his Successor, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							thought it would have an important political effect, in conciliating the
							State of New-York— I thought the political effect would be pernicious—
							We should be without a single vote in the cabinet from the Southern
							Section of the Union— All North of the Susquehanna River, and of the
							Western Country by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay— I therefore
								proposed    <persRef ref="gaston-william">Gaston</persRef> of
							North-Carolina, and <persRef ref="williams-john">John Williams</persRef>
							of Tennessee, or either of them to be considered as candidates for the
							Office of Secretary of War— None of them would be desired so earnestly
							as General Porter— <persRef ref="spencer-ambrose">Ambrose
								Spencer</persRef> was also mentioned, but General Porter was
							unanimously preferred. For the mission to Colombia—General Harrison of
							Ohio, and <persRef ref="robertson-george">George Robertson</persRef> of
							Kentucky were mentioned, and although Robertson was believed to be on
							the whole the best adapted to the place, the concurrent opinion was that
							Harrison would be the most suitable appointment— I mentioned the
							communications made to Congress in 1823. and 1824. that it would not be
							necessary to continue Ministers of Plenipotentiary rank in the
							South-American States; and also the formal notification from the
							Colombian Government, that they should keep hereafter only a Chargé
							d’Affaires in the United States— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard
							expressing upon this some doubt; the meeting was adjourned till
							to-morrow at two O’Clock— Joseph Blunt and his brother <persRef

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Breese</persRef> the District Attorney
							of Illinois was here. He made me a present of a petrified pear found in
							Monroe County in the State of Illinois in 1826. It has the shape and
							size of a S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Michaels pear, and became
							petrified, apparently as it fell from the tree, without decaying It is
							split in two, and the core is of a separate and different induration
							from that of the pulp. It is flattened on the side upon which it lay on
							the ground, and bears a faint impression of a leaf upon which it must
							have lain. I asked him if other petrifactions were common at or near the
							place where this was found, but he did not know. <persRef
								ref="metcalfe-thomas">General Metcalfe</persRef>, member of the
							House from Kentucky and <persRef ref="merwin-orange">M<hi

							the State, and offer himself to the people, and solicit their votes— The
							election is to be held next August, and his competitor has already made
							his canvassing tour— Metcalfe is nevertheless sangwine in his
							expectations of success. Merwin came to speak of the District Attorney
							in Connecticut <persRef ref="huntington-hezekiah">Huntington</persRef>,
							against whom he said I should receive new complaints, he said he
							believed there could be little doubt of his negligence and incapacity,
							but that as the term of Commission will expire next February it would
							perhaps be most advisable to wait for that time, rather than dismiss him
							from office now. I told him that was my intention unless some flagrant
							act of misconduct should in the mean time be proved against him. The
							adjourned Cabinet Meeting was held from two to four O’Clock. Present the
							Secretaries of State, <persRef key="rush-richard">Treasury</persRef>,
							War and the <persRef ref="southard-samuel">Navy</persRef>— The questions
							concerning the appointments of a Secretary of War, and a Minister to the
							Republic of Colombia, were again considered— That of the appointment of
							a Minister to Great-Britain was observed as decided, and therefore not
							discussed. <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef>
							concurred in the opinions of the other members of the Administration,
							which were still as they had been given yesterday— He thought that
								<persRef ref="porter-peter">General Peter B. Porter</persRef> should
							be nominated as Secretary of War, in preference to <persRef
								ref="spencer-ambrose">Ambrose Spencer</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="gaston-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gaston</persRef>
							<pb type="ms" n="545"/>or <persRef ref="williams-john">John
								Williams</persRef> of Tennessee; and that <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">General Harrison</persRef> should be
							nominated for the Mission to Colombia, in preference to <persRef
								ref="robertson-george">George Robertson</persRef>— I restated my
							objections to the appointment of any Minister to Colombia, and the
							grounds of my preference of John Williams as Secretary of War, and
							strongly marked my doubts whether the appointment of General Porter
							would have a favourable effect even on New-York—but standing alone in
							all these opinions I finally acquiesced in all the arrangements
							proposed— In every one of them to my view, the public interest is made
							subordinate to individual accommodation. Governor Barbours situation in
							the Administration is irksome, because the prejudices of his State are
							against him; and as he is a man of fair and honourable mind, I am well
							pleased to give him the opportunity to withdraw his stake from the issue
							of contest— Porter is devoted to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, and has taken the lead
							in the New-York Legislature of the friends of the Administration— But
							his party in New-York is feeble, and a great majority of the people of
							the State will not approve his appointment— Harrison wants the Mission
							to Colombia much more than it wants him, or than it is wanted by the
							public interest— These men will all discharge the duties of their
							offices faithfully, to the best of their ability— Nothing would induce
							me to compromise on that point, but in all short of that, the right must
							in this as in numberless other cases yield to the expedient. The only
							possibility left me is to terminate the Administration in harmony with
							itself; and for the sake of that I acquiesce in these measures against
							the whole tenour of my own judgment. <persRef ref="clark-susanna">M<hi

						<p>For the first time I believe in more than three years that I have resided
							in this House, I was confined the whole day to it by unceasing rain. It
							abridged somewhat the number of my visitors— <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> was here, and consulted with me upon several
							subjects relating to the Administration of the Navy Department— Upon the
							longstanding claim of <persRef ref="anderson-william2">Major
								Anderson</persRef> of the Marine Corps to Brevet promotion— The
							decision has been postponed until this time because there has been a
							proposal before the Senate, almost the whole of this Session, for
							abolishing Brevet appointments altogether— It is however apparent that
							this measure will not now pass. I concluded therefore to send to the
							Senate the Brevet Nominations, and sent the Message nominating Major
							Anderson to be a Lieutenant Colonel by Brevet— I sent also a Message
							with nominations of the Staff Officers of the Marine Corps, and with it
							the opinion of the <persRef ref="wirt-william">Attorney
								General</persRef>, that the Law requires the appointment to these
							Staff Offices should be made by nomination of the President, with the
							concurrence of the Senate— It is strange that this should be a question;
							but it is one of much difficulty— The three Offices are now held under
							appointments by the <persRef ref="henderson-archibald"
								>Commandant</persRef> of the Corps, who by virtue of having
							exercised the power to appoint, claims the right to dismiss, and insists
							upon displacing <persRef ref="kuhn-joseph">Captain Kuhn</persRef> the
							Paymaster, to put <persRef ref="freeman-william">Captain
								Freeman</persRef> in the place— We have resisted this little impulse
							of passion; and from questioning Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Henderson right to remove Kuhn, have come to disbelieve his power
							lawfully to appoint— I now sent in the nominations, to take the sense of
							the Senate upon them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard had a
							Letter from <persRef ref="bainbridge-william">Commodore
								Bainbridge</persRef>, earnestly soliciting for <persRef
								ref="bainbridge-theodore">his nephew</persRef> a Commission as
							second Lieutenant in the Marine Corps—of which I also sent in the
							nomination— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard had sundry papers
							concerning the claim of <persRef ref="fry-henry">Henry Frye</persRef>,
							to have been for the last ten years a Purser in the Navy, and that he
							should receive arrears of pay during the time when he was out of the
							Service— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard thinks he has not the
							shadow of a valid claim, and I concur in that opinion. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard had a statement of facts by
								<persRef ref="crowninshield-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crowninshield</persRef>, showing the futility of Fry’s pretensions
							and that he was as importunate and unreasonable ten years since as he is
							now— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard was also perplexed with a
							private Act of Congress, recently passed, directing him to settle an
							Account <pb type="ms" n="546"/>of <persRef ref="barton-willoughby"
								>Willoughby Barton</persRef>, upon the same terms on which a similar
							contract of another man had been settled— But the services of the other
							contract were not the same; and the same allowance would be giving the
							same thing for Articles essentially different in value— I said I thought
							the proper construction of the Act of Congress would be to consider it
							applicable only with respect to particulars in which the equivalents to
							be given or performed by the contractors were the same— He said he
							should so construe it, though Barton had produced Certificates from
							members of the Committee who reported the Bill that this was not their
							intention. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard spoke of a Sloop of
							War, to be despatched for the Mediterranean. The Consul at Smyrna
								<persRef ref="offley-david">Offley</persRef> has sent to the
							Department of State, a paper in Arabick, purporting to be from the Reis
							Effendi at Constantinople, declaring the willingness of the Turkish
							Government to negotiate a Treaty of Commerce with the United States— I
							propose to send a joint and several Full Power to Offley and <persRef
								ref="crane-william">Captain Crane</persRef> now commander of our
							Squadron in the Mediterranean, to negotiate such a Treaty. The principal
							difficulty will be to preserve the Secret; and it will be necessary to
							proceed in the business with great caution— I must also take it almost
							intirely upon myself— <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef> by the advice of his physicians intending
							to leave the City immediately after the adjournment of Congress, and to
							relax from attention to public business— <persRef ref="white-joseph"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White</persRef> the Delegate
							from Florida, came to recommend several persons for appointments in that
							Territory under Acts of Congress which have passed the two Houses, but
							have not yet been presented to me for my signature— One is the
							establishment of a District Court at Key-West for which a Judge,
							Attorney and Marshal must be appointed— Another is for a Law Agency
							respecting Land titles— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White gave me his
							opinions upon the respective merits of several Candidates for these
							places, and left their names with me— <persRef ref="derrick-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Derrick</persRef>, brought me a
							draft of a Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay to <persRef
								ref="preble-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Preble</persRef>
							the boundary Agent, which I approved— <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> came to mention the
							indispensable necessity he is under of employing additional assistance
							of one or more Clerks, for carrying into Execution the Act of Congress
							in favour of the Revolutionary Officers, and proposed for that purpose a
								<persRef ref="dickins-francis">Son</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="dickins-asbury">Asbury Dickins</persRef>, which I approved—
								<persRef ref="maury-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Maury</persRef> from the Navy Department, brought me a form of

							also mentioned that in the list of nominations as confirmed by the

							Clay introduced to me <persRef ref="carroll-william2">General

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay to give notice to <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">General Harrison</persRef>; that I should
							nominate him to the Senate to-morrow as Minister to the Republic of
							Colombia. I sent to the House of Representatives Message N. 13. with

								Betts’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="betts-frederick">brother</persRef>, and is now, she says
							quite destitute, as are all the family— There is no vacancy to which I

							the Mail Contractors who visited me last October on my return from
							Quincy— Wyant was originally from Hagerstown Maryland; but now resides
							200 miles West of S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Louis Missouri, and now
							for the first time visits the city. <persRef ref="abdulrahman">Abduhl
								Rahaman</persRef> the emancipated moor, brought me a subscription

							came again with the list of Commissions to be made out, and to rectify
							the error in the names of two Midshipman, nominated for Lieutenants.
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> brought
							again an account of <persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">T. L.

								<persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef> some years since—that the President has no
							controuling power over the accounting Officers of the Treasury—an
							opinion perfectly concurring with mine; and conformably to which I have
							invariably acted. I desired the Governor to send me a copy of the
							opinion which he did— I sent this day Message to Congress N. 13. with
							the Proclamation of the Treaty with the Eel-river or Thornton party of
							Miami Indians— Message to the House of Representatives N. 14. with the
							Correspondence relating to the arrest and imprisonment of <persRef
								ref="baker-john2">John Baker</persRef>— Messages to the Senate N.
							37. with Nominations for Brevet promotions in the Army—and N. 38 with
							nominations to Army promotions, and also nominations of James Barbour as
							Minister to Great Britain, and of <persRef ref="harrison-william"
								>William H. Harrison</persRef>, as Minister to the Republic of
							Colombia— It was perhaps scarcely remarkable that these nominations,
							together with that of <persRef ref="porter-peter">General Peter B.
								Porter</persRef> as Secretary of War were announced not only in the
							Telegraph of this Morning; but in the Baltimore American— If this
							government can keep any Secrets it is not of those for which faction and
							envy are upon the watch. Governor Barbour assured me that he had not
							divulged any portion of the secret—of which I have no doubt— The Senate
							this day passed the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Bill, with two subsidiary
							Bills for giving it effect; to this great joy of the People of the
							District— A Cannonading Salute was fired at Georgetown, and another in
							the city upon this occasion— The confinement of these two days, with the
							continued rain of yesterday and this day till noon, affected my
							health—the distraction of business and of visitors gave me a headache
							which disqualified me for writing— After dinner I took a Solitary walk
							towards the upper Georgetown Bridge, and on my return finding myself
							compulsively idle retired about ten to bed.</p>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> was here, and
							spoke of the necessity for him to go from here immediately after the
							close of the Session; and he complained that since his return from
							Philadelphia, to his laborious duties, he found his health again
							sinking— I told him I would take the business of the proposed
							negotiation with Turkey, into my own hands, and should want the aid of a
							Confidential Clerk in the Department of State to assist me. He mentioned
								<persRef ref="fendall-philip">Fendall</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef>, and I fixed upon Fendall as he
							is acquainted with the French language, of which probably much use must

								Ringgold</persRef> brought me an additional recommendation for

							presented as an original document upon Oath presented by <persRef
								ref="thorpe-william">William Thorp</persRef> to sustain his claim as

							water-mark <pb type="ms" n="549"/>in the paper was dated 1818. Cutts was
							for referring the claimant to the penitentiary, but I told him he might
							possibly give some explanation of the facts. In the mean time his

							T. L. M’Kenney’s unsettled Account— Told me that <persRef
								ref="cass-lewis">Governor Cass</persRef> had been incredulous of the
							charge of 2000 dollars paid in presents to Indians; and that Cass had
							left with <persRef ref="wing-austin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="randall-josiah">Josiah Randall</persRef> for compensation as
							Counsel for the Government in the cases of <persRef ref="thomson-edward"
								>Edward Thompson’s</persRef> frauds— I had a long conversation with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush upon the affair of the Post
							Office, at Philadelphia, which become more and more complicated and
							perplexing— There is evidence of frauds committed by the late Postmaster
								<persRef ref="bache-richard">Bache</persRef>, and strong suspicions
							implicating the subalterns now in the Office— The position of the
							present Postmaster is very awkward as relates to the frauds of his
							Predecessor, and he can scarcely be a suitable person strictly to pursue
							the investigation— I incline to require his removal, and the appointment
							of another person in his place; and consulted with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush concerning it— I have received a
							Letter from the <persRef ref="mclean-john2">Postmaster General</persRef>
							in answer to my questions, which is far from satisfactory with regard to
							the facts and far from removing suspicions. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rush inclines to the opinion that it would be advisable to
							put the responsibility of removing <persRef ref="sergeant-thomas">T.

								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> came with information
							that the Senate had unanimously advised and consented to his appointment

								Wing</persRef> the Delegate from Michigan came successively to speak
							of the appointment of Commissioners to treat with the Winnebagoes, and
							other tribes of Northern Indians for which a Bill had passed both Houses
							of Congress— They were both anxious that the Commissioners should be
							appointed as soon as possible; and the negotiation forthwith
							commenced—hostilities by the Winnebagoes being apprehended— As the Bill
							had passed the House of Representatives, the appointment of the
							Commissioners was given to the President—the Senate inserted the clause,
							requiring the concurrence of their own body—reduced the appropriation
							from 25 to 15000 dollars with a discretionary power to the President to
							apply part of the reduced sum to a Treaty with the Choctaws— I told
							Duncan that I proposed <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Governor Cass</persRef>
							of Michigan should be one of the Commissioners, with which he expressed
							himself satisfied, and recommended <persRef ref="clark-william">Governor
								Clark</persRef> of Missouri and <persRef ref="menard-pierre">Pierre

							whether I intended that Cass should be a Commissioner, and I said I did—
							He then with some apology asked if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							M’Kenney was to be also a Commissioner— I answered no— He said that his

							the appointment would be only upon the contingency that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">’</hi>Kenney
							should not be joined in the Commission— He said that Cass was upon very

							accounts involved in difficulties he was not willing to incur the same
							hazard again— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutts had told me this

							to his appointment on the score of character— <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> was
							here, and I had again a long conversation with him, upon the state of
							the Post-Office at Philadelphia— He had sent me a fresh Letter from
								<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J. Ingersoll</persRef>, shewing
							new evidence of frauds, on the part of the last Postmaster <persRef
								ref="bache-richard">Bache</persRef>— A thorough scrutiny into the
							management of the Office for the last three years appears to me to be
							necessary, and <persRef ref="sergeant-thomas">T. Sergeant</persRef> the
							brother in Law of Bache, ought not to be there while the examination is
							carried on— But T. Sergeant is a man of respectable character which
							would be hurt by the removal of him from Office under these
							circumstances— He is brother to <persRef ref="sergeant-john">John
								Sergeant</persRef>, one of the ablest, purest, fairest men in
							Congress, a warm and most efficient friend of the Administration— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush still thinks it most advisable to
							make the <persRef ref="mclean-john2">Postmaster General</persRef>
							sensible that <hi rend="italic">his</hi> duty imposes upon him the
							obligation of suggesting it to T. Sergeant the awkwardness and delicacy
							of his situation, and the propriety of his retiring from it— I must
							reflect upon the subject further— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard, and <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>Ellis</persRef> and <persRef ref="bateman-ephraim"
								>Bateman</persRef>, and the members of the House of Representatives
							Forward and Maxwell, the joint Committee of enrolled Bills— Among them
							was the Bill authorizing a Treaty to be held with the Winnebago and
							other Indians, immediately after signing which I sent in to the Senate.
							Message N. 41. nominating Lewis Cass and Pierre Menard as the
							Commissioners. They were immediately confirmed. <persRef
								ref="lowrie-walter">W. Lowrie</persRef>, Secretary of the Senate
							brought me Resolutions of that body confirming the nominations of
								<persRef ref="macomb-alexander">General Macomb</persRef>, as Major

							sent this morning Message to the Senate N. 40. Nominating <persRef
								ref="porter-peter">Peter B. Porter</persRef> of New-York as
							Secretary of War and some others—a motion was made to act upon them
							immediately; but the rule of the Senate requiring an interval of one day
							could be dispensed with only by unanimous consent, and an objection was
							made— In the course of the Evening <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">Gen<hi

							not presented to me this Evening— The two Houses shortly afterwards
							adjourned, to meet again at 6 O’Clock Monday Morning. I took M<hi

						<p>A visit from <persRef ref="thomas-jesse">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thomas</persRef>, the Senator from Illinois, detained me from the
							morning service at Church. Thomas came to take leave, and spoke to me
							again with much solicitude respecting the <persRef ref="mclean-john2"
								>Postmaster General</persRef>, whose removal he very earnestly
							deprecated— He also told me that he had estranged himself entirely from
							his Colleague, <persRef ref="kane-elias">Kane</persRef>, who he said had
							acted with great duplicity, and whose conduct he thought was influenced
							by the failure of his project to obtain the Office of Postmaster at
							New-York for <persRef ref="kane-elias2">his father</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="smith-samuel2">General S. Smith</persRef>, Senator from
							Maryland followed. This Gentleman’s political course is by a winding
							Stair; and during the Session of Congress now expiring has been less
							hostile than that of many others; less even than his own at other times—
							He spoke of the appointment of <persRef ref="macomb-alexander">General
								Macomb</persRef> as Major General, and of <persRef
								ref="scott-winfield">General Scott’s</persRef> threat of
							disobedience; approving the former and indignant at what the termed the
							folly of Scott— <persRef ref="drayton-william">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Drayton</persRef> of South-Carolina, <persRef
								ref="dorsey-clement">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dorsey</persRef>
							of Maryland, and <persRef ref="newton-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Newton</persRef> of Virginia with <persRef
								ref="newton-cincinnatus">his Son</persRef>, likewise came and took
							leave— I attended the afternoon service at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s Church— <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the Evening
							prayer for Whitsunday, and baptised four children— <persRef
								ref="chase-philander">Bishop Chase</persRef> of Ohio preached the
							Sermon, from <pb type="ms" n="552"/>Acts 24–24.25. “<persRef
								ref="felix-antonius">Felix</persRef> sent for <persRef ref="paul"
								>Paul</persRef> and heard him concerning the faith in Christ— And as
							he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix
							trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a
							convenient season I will call for thee.” This is one of the most
							remarkable incidents in the history of Paul, and has formed the text of
							eloquent discourses— The Bishop whose language is full of feeling and
							barren of ornament applied the guilty consciousness, and evasive
							postponement of Felix, in the most direct manner to his hearers— The
							roughness of his discourse and the affectionate kindness of his manner
							remind me a line in some English Poets— “We angry Lovers mean not half
							we say— After dinner <persRef ref="mitchel-thomas2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mitchell</persRef>, a member of the
							House of Representatives from South-Carolina called to take leave. He is
							a good tempered, well-educated, and intelligent man, who would be
							friendly to me, and to the Administration, but for the prejudices of his
							Constituents— In the Evening, I heard <persRef ref="bigelow-andrew">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow</persRef>, from 2. Timothy
							4.3. “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine.
							(the remainder of that verse omitted.) 4. And they shall turn away their
							ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.” The Sermon was
							controversial—Ingenious—earnest—occasionally eloquent but being the
							second part of this morning’s discourse, I had only a partial view of
							his subject. The harshness of his voice, and the monotonous cadences of
							his delivery much impair the force of his composition.</p>

						<p>The two Houses had adjourned to meet at 6. this Morning— I rode up to the
							Capitol with my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>, and found
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> there. Thirteen enrolled Bills had been sent to
							me yesterday which I had signed. The Senate this Morning confirmed the
							nomination of <persRef ref="porter-peter">Peter B Porter</persRef>, as
							Secretary of War, and all the other nominations that I had sent
							excepting the army brevet promotions, which were laid upon the table—
							There is a growing opinion that all breveting in time of Peace ought to
							be abolished, and a proposition to that effect has been before the
							Senate great part of this Session; but not definitively discussed— I
							immediately wrote to General Porter tendering to him the Commission of
							Secretary of War— About half past Seven O’ Clock a joint Committee,
								<persRef ref="macon-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Macon</persRef> and <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury</persRef> of the Senate, and
								<persRef ref="dickinson-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dickinson</persRef> and <persRef ref="wright-john">John C.
								Wright</persRef> of the House of Representatives came and informed
							me that the two House, unless I had any further communication to make to
							them were ready to adjourn. I requested them to present my respects to
							the Houses and inform them that I had no further communication to make—
							They immediately afterwards adjourned, and I rode round by the Navy Yard
							home— Several of the members of both Houses came and took leave of me at
							the Capitol, and in the course of the day the Senators <persRef
								ref="king-william2">King</persRef>
							<persRef ref="mckinley-john">M’Kinley</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="chambers-ezekiel">Chambers</persRef>, and the members of the

								<persRef ref="strong-james">Strong</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef> called and took leave at my
							house. The day was otherwise one of crowded and multifarious business—
								<persRef ref="nourse-charles">Major Nourse</persRef> the Chief Clerk
							of the War Department came for directions concerning it— A Letter of
							Appointment as acting Secretary of War was made out for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard and signed. <persRef
								ref="jones-roger">Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>
								Jones</persRef> the Adjutant Gen<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>
							brought me the draft of a General order announcing the appointment of
								<persRef ref="macomb-alexander">General Macomb</persRef> as Major
							General of the Army; and requiring all Officers and Soldiers of the Army
							to obey, and respect him as such— He said that as <persRef
								ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef> had intimated some
							intention of active <pb type="ms" n="553"/>disobedience, in the event of
							General Macomb’s appointment, this Order would mark it more strongly— He
							shewed me the 61<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> and 62<hi
								rend="superscript">d. </hi>Articles of War, upon which Scott’s
							pretensions to command are founded, but which appear to me to be
							decisive against them— I thought it however proper that the Order should
							issue, and look the draft for consideration. I told Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jones that General Macomb should resign
							his Office as Chief Engineer and accept in writing that of Major
							General— The Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> also brought me a list of
							promotions, consequent upon General Macomb’s removal from the Engineer
							Department which I took for consideration. <persRef
								ref="derrick-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Derrick</persRef> brought me a draft of a Letter from <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="pinkney-charles">C. Pinkney</persRef> now at
							Baltimore, informing him that it had been necessary to appoint at
							Secretary to the Mission at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg,
							in his place; which I approved— I signed and gave to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard his Letter of Appointment as
							acting Secretary of War, and gave him the Adjutant General’s draft of an
							Order to the Army and list of promotions, for consideration— I also
							observed that I proposed to send him a Letter, directing the issuing of
							the General Order, to be placed on the Records of the War Department,
							and in the Evening I accordingly wrote such a Letter— <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> called, and spoke of
							his arrangements for his departure upon his mission— He asked me to
							accept his Saddle Horse, for which he expects to have no further use,
							and sent him this Evening to my Stable— I sent for <persRef
								ref="mclean-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean</persRef>
							the Postmaster General, who came and I had a long conversation with him
							respecting the Post-Office at Philadelphia. I told him that the attempt
							of <persRef ref="bache-richard">Bache</persRef> to draw the funds of the
							public from the Bank, after he had been removed was essentially a fraud—
							That I must confidentially say to him, that the conduct of his Agent
								<persRef ref="u">Simpson</persRef>, and of <persRef ref="u"
								>Newman</persRef> the Chief Clerk of the Post-Office, had been very
							exceptionable on that occasion, and that of <persRef
								ref="sergeant-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T.
								Sergeant</persRef> the new Postmaster at least very inefficient. I
							told him that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sergeant’s position was a
							very awkward one in the conflict between his public duties and his
							private sympathies, and that I thought he ought voluntarily to withdraw
							from it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean said he wished to God he
							had never been appointed to it, but added that Simpson was a man of most
							excellent character, in whom he had unbounded confidence; he was
							perfectly sure there could have been no remissness in him— I told him of
							the repugnance of Newman to making the affidavit which was necessary to
							obtain the injunction to the Bank, which arrested the payment of Bache’s
							checks, and that Newman had said Simpson knew of this sum deposited in
							Bache’s private Account in Bank, and did not wish it to be meddled with—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean said it was impossible. If
							Newman had said so he must have misrepresented Simpson’s conduct; and he
							repeated his declarations of entire confidence in Simpson, as an honest
							and religious man— I advised him to enquire into the facts, and to have
							both Simpson and Newman examined upon Oath concerning them which he
							promised to do. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean was still
							extremely anxious to justify the Department from any laches in this
							affair, and somewhat disposed to cast upon <persRef
								ref="bradley-phineas">Bradley</persRef> the Assistant Postmaster
							General the extraordinary indulgences which have been allowed to Bache—
							As yet this affair thickens as it proceeds— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Mercer the member of the House from Virginia, called on me a
							second time this Evening to speak upon the subject of General Scott and
							General Macomb— Mercer is a Virginian and a friend of Scott— He is also
							very unfriendly to Macomb, of whose character he spoke in very
							disparaging terms. Said that his courage was very doubtful— That
								<persRef ref="snelling-josiah">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Snelling</persRef> averred that his conduct at Plattsburg had been
							contemptible. That his pretence of being a Citizen of New-York was
							false; because he was born in the territory of Michigan— That as Chief
							Engineer his conduct had occasioned all the difficulties in the Surveys
							for internal improvements. That he had degraded himself by accepting the
							office of Chief Engineer with a rank of Colonel, and that the nomination
							of him had turned 25 votes in the House of Representatives in favour of
							abolishing the Office— He proposed therefore that at the demand of
							General Scott, a Court Martial should be assembled, and that General
							Macomb and General Scott should engage to abide by their decision— I
							heard him entirely through, and then observed <pb type="ms" n="554"
							/>that I had been compelled to examine the question of rank, between
								<persRef ref="gaines-edmund">Generals Gaines</persRef> and Scott,
							and had seriously perused all that they had written on the subject of
							their controversy— That I had come to the conclusion that the conclusive
							argument was on the side of General Gaines, but I had as long as
							possible avoided deciding the question. It was however decided by the
							appointment of Macomb, for the same principle invoked by Gaines against
							Scott was good for Macomb against Gaines; and of this he was so sensible
							that he had cheerfully acquiesced in the appointment of Macomb— I took
							the Senior Officer in the Line of the Army— I considered the brevet as a
							privilege of distinction honourable to him who obtained it by gallant
							atchievement, but invidious in its effect to set aside the Seniority of
							others— This invidious portion of its operation ought in justice to be
							limited to the Letter of the Law, and not extended by construction— The
							Law specifies when brevet rank shall give command over an Officer senior
							by Commission— It excludes from such command, whenever it is not
							expressly given— It is given only to regimental Officers; it is silent
							with regard to General Officers and silence withholds command— I shall
							not therefore submit this question to a Court Martial— I had decided it
							myself, and would disapprove the proceedings of any Court-martial, which
							should so decide— General Scott must take his own course, and I shall
							take mine as my duty may require. The question cannot be decided by a
							Court-martial, for every Officer upon it would be interested in the
							issue on one side or the other— The board of Officers convened by
								<persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef> at the close of his administration had declined
							answering it, on that account— As to Macomb’s character I had never
							known any thing against him, and I viewed in a different light, his
							descending to take the character of Commander of the <hi
								rend="strikethrough">faithful</hi> Engineers— As an honourable
							submission to the laws of the Land— That if Macomb was born in Michigan,
							he was a Citizen of the State of New-York, and by that means had been
							first nominated to the Senate for the army Mercer replied that the case
							was more difficult than he had imagined— That his object had been if
							possible to pacify and conciliate the parties; and that Scott’s
							alternative would be to resign his Commission— This has been a
							harrassing day; but I perceived a tamarind heaving up the earth in the
							centre of tumbler N 2. and I planted in Tumbler N 1. 3. whole Hautboy
							Strawberries.</p>

						<p>Session of Congress, the Execution of which is devolved much to his
							annoyance, instead of the Secretary of War to whose Department it more
							properly belongs— He had now two questions upon the construction of the
							Act, concerning which he consulted me— The Act provides for Officers to
							whom half-pay for life, was promised by Resolution of Congress of 21.
							October 1780, which extended to Officers who should continue in service
							to the end of the War—one question was whether it would apply to
							Officers who entered the service after the passage of the Resolution—
							The other question was whether the act included the Officers in the
							medical department, who were not named in the Resolution of 21. Oct<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1780. but for whom a similar provision
							was made by a Resolution of 17. January 1781. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush that if it was a penal Statute I
							should not consider it as embracing either of these descriptions of
							Officers; but as it was beneficent and remedial, I thought it should be
							construed to include them both— He was of the same opinion— Of the
							medical Officers there are very few surviving, but one of them is
								<persRef ref="cutting-john">J. B. Cutting</persRef> now a Clerk in
							the War Department. <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef> was here at the same time with M<hi

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor of New-York recommended the
							employment of a person named <persRef ref="u">Curry</persRef>, now here;
							from Kentucky— <persRef ref="macomb-alexander">General Macomb</persRef>
							came and made his acknowledgements to me for the appointment of Major
							General, and said he had sent in his Resignation to the War Department
							as Chief Engineer and had received his new Commission— He said he had
							twice met accidentally <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General
								Scott</persRef>, who had omitted to return the usual salutations of
							civility— I desired General Macomb to furnish me with a list of all the
							Surveys now making, and of the Engineers employed upon them; and I gave
							him the applications of sundry members of Congress for two new Surveys
							requesting him to designate Engineers to enter upon them. <persRef

							the Engineer Corps; which I approved and gave to <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> to be carried into execution— I had intended
							yesterday to plant the Spanish Cork Acorns but was prevented by a heavy
							thunder shower followed by copious rain which continued the whole
							Evening— I visited the Garden and Nursery this day— Noticed in the
							Nursery the first appearance of the Shellbark Hickories planted last
							Autumn— They came exactly one Month later than the Oaks and Black
							Walnuts; and chesnuts and two Months later than the Apples Peaches,
							Plums and Apricots— In the garden the Black walnuts are still coming up,
							and in the Eastern Seedling bed there is one shellbark of last year’s
							plantation now first appearing. There are two Tamarinds up in in
							Seedling Pot N. 1.— I planted in Tumbler N. 3. four whole hautboy
							Strawberries, and in Tumbler N. 4. Six Kernels from the House Yard
							Cherries, breaking the Stones to take them out— I have also sown a row
							of last years gooseberry seeds, and a row of Strawberry seeds in
							Seedling box N. 3. and the seeds of one Hautboy Strawberry. Of my
							various plantations in pots and boxes, I find Apples, Oranges and
							Tamarinds come with great facility— But I have as yet succeeded with

						<p>I took this morning a ride of about fourteen Miles; but found my horse so
							often tripping, as to give me a significant warning of the probable
							consequences of indulging myself in this exercise, which however is
							otherwise precisely that which I need. Its effect is to fatigue me so
							that for an hour or two from about noon, and again about as long in the
							evening I am overpowered with lassitude; but the remainder of the day am
							fresh and vigorous— <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> called upon me
							after Breakfast upon business both of the War and Navy Departments. The
							first object requiring attention is the Instructions to <persRef
								ref="cass-lewis">Governor Cass</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="menard-pierre">Pierre Menard</persRef>, the Commissioners for
							treating with the Winnebago and other Tribes of Indians, upon the
							purport of which we agreed. I enquired when the Sloop of War bound to
							the Mediterranean would be ready to sail; and he said in not less than a
							Month— <persRef ref="ringgold-james">James G. Ringgold</persRef>,
							appointed to the Office of United States Attorney in Middle Florida,
							came to return his thanks and take leave— I sent for <persRef
								ref="cutts-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Cutts</persRef>
							the second Comptroller to speak of the still suspended account of
								<persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">T. L. M’Kenney</persRef>. I gave him
							the papers left with me by <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor
								Barbour</persRef>, among which is an account with specific items, as
							I had required, but amounting to upwards of a thousand Dollars more than
							the former Account. I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutts that
							this was altogether inadmissible; but that as in the former account the
							principal if not the only difficulty was an unvouched charge of more
							than 2000 dollars for presents to the Indians—as vouchers for such
							charges never had been given, and as it would be scarcely just to
							require of M’Kenney that which never had been required of other Indian
							Treaty Commissioners, the suggestion of Governor Barbour might be
							followed, and M’Kenneys own Affidavit taken for a voucher— He had also
							procured a paper signed by several members of Congress, among whom some
							from Tennessee and Georgia, declaring the account to be reasonable, and
							recommending that it should be allowed; which Cutts said he would also
							make a voucher— <persRef ref="fullerton-david">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>There was a numerous party who visited this day the great Falls of the

								>Abigail S. Adams</persRef> was one of the Company. They returned
							this Evening, when she received the news of the death of her Grandfather
								<persRef ref="harrod-joseph">Joseph Harrod</persRef>, at Haverhill:
							at 80 years of age— I rode this morning about 14 Miles and was two hours

							dangerously— <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> was
							here— I had written to him that I must pay him for the horse, to which
							he consented— He spoke of the preparations for his departure, and made
							some enquiries as to his course of proceeding, on his arrival in
							England, upon which I gave him such information as was in my power— He
							spoke of numerous persons who had applied to go with him as domestics
							and Secretary’s— He asked a furlough for <persRef ref="vinton-john"
								>Lieutenant Vinton</persRef> late Aide de Comp to <persRef
								ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef> that he might accompany

							his Negotiation with the Sublime-Porte. <persRef ref="cutts-richard"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutts</persRef> the Comptroller

								<persRef ref="lee-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							others; particularly one from <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi

								James Cooley</persRef> our Chargé d’Affaires at Lima in Peru— He
							died on the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February, and it is
							remarkable that this is the third of our diplomatic Representatives in

							political intercourse commenced; besides <persRef ref="graham-john">John

							the Spanish Cork Oak Acorns last received from New Bedford; and some
							English walnuts and dry appleseeds.— Also in seedling box N. 5. 10 dry
							Apple seeds, none of which I expect will come up— We had this day the

						<p>We rode this morning round by the Navy Yard, and Eastern Branch Bridge—

									>r</hi> Hall</persRef> from New Hampshire brought me a Letter of

							had applied without success to him, and desired a word of interposition
							from me. <persRef ref="beard-william">Captain Beard</persRef> was an
							Officer in the late War and came as an invalid to apply for an

							Superintendency of the Penitentiary, but that office has not yet been

							observed to him that I believed the discharge of the duties of those
							Offices, required persons of sound health and vigorous Constitutions.
								<persRef ref="white-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								White</persRef> the Delegate from Florida, came and took
							leave—expressing himself gratified with the recent appointments in the

							brought me as I had requested Lists 1. of examinations and Surveys now
							under operation, under the direction of the Engineer Department; 2 Of

							the Surveys which have been completed, and reported to Congress under
							the Act of April 1824. <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor
								Barbour</persRef> came and took leave; intending to go to morrow for

								Brent</persRef> brought me the first Volume of the Codex juris

								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> brought a Memorial signed by the President’s of
							seventeen Insurance Companies and Offices in Boston requesting that a
							public armed vessel may be sent for the protection of our Commerce in
							the East-India Seas— He said it could only be done, by withdrawing a
							vessel from the force employed upon some other Station, which I advised
							him to do. The memorial complains of piratical depredations recently
							committed in those Seas— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard read me
							also two Letters, one from a <persRef ref="snelling-william"
								>Son</persRef> of <persRef ref="snelling-josiah">Col<hi

							from <persRef ref="mercer-charles">C. F. Mercer</persRef> the member of

							with the Chippewas, Winnebagoes and other Tribes of North western
							Indians. Snellings Letter gives interesting information respecting the
							dispositions of those tribes— Mercer’s affirms that there are now six
							thousand white people, miners intrusively settled upon those Lands, upon
							the Indian territory and urges the necessity of removing them by
							military force. He mentions also various circumstances relating to the
							State of the United States troops on those frontiers which call for
							animadversion and <pb type="ms" n="559"/>reform— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r </hi>Southard had also a Letter from <persRef
								ref="hendricks-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Hendricks</persRef>, a Senator from Indiana, requesting that in
							this Negotiation, the Indian title to certain Lands within that State,
							might be treated for— The Act provides only for the extinction of Indian
							titles to lands in Michigan, and Illinois—and gives a discretionary
							power to the President to apply part of the appropriation to treat with
							the Choctaws— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard doubted whether it
							would admit of treating for Lands in Indiana; but M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hendricks’s Letter supposes it may be done
							without additional expense. I said the Commissioners might be instructed
							to include it in their Negotiation if it could be effected without, or
							at moderate expense. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard read me
							also a Letter from <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General
							Scott</persRef>, addressed through him to me as Commander in Chief of
							the Army, demanding the arrest and trial of Gen<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi> Macomb, for having assumed command over him, his superior
							Officer, and if that should be refused he demands a trial by Court
							Martial himself for his refusal to obey the orders of General Macomb,
							and advises how the Court Martial should be composed. We conversed upon
							the manner in which this Letter should be answered—and concluded that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard should make a draft refusing
							the arrest of General Macomb; and also declining to try General Scott
							himself by a Court Martial. I desired also that the Letter should order
							General Scott to repair to his Post at the expiration of his furlough—
							This afternoon <persRef ref="foy-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Foy</persRef> sowed in the Nursery the wheat and Barley received

						<p>My horse was not quite so lame this morning as the preceding days, we

								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> were here together, and we conversed upon the

								Scott</persRef>, the draft of which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Southard had not yet prepared— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard
							took the papers which he had left with me relating to the purchase of a
							private claim to land on the Island of Santa Rosa near Pensacola, upon
							which it is proposed to erect a fortification. The question is whether a
							part of the appropriation for the fortification may be applied to the
							purchase of the claim— I thought it might— M<hi rend="superscript">r
							</hi>Clay read the draft of a Report to me on the payment of 1500
							dollars last year for a confidential mission to the Island of Cuba— The
							report of the retrenchment Committee contains on this subject insidious
							and scandalous misrepresentations In 1827 after <persRef
								ref="cook-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook</persRef> had
							ceased to be a member of Congress, and intending to go to the Havanna,
							as a last resource for the restoration of his health, he was employed on
							a secret agency for confidential communication with <persRef
								ref="vives-don">General Vives</persRef> the Governor of that Island—
							It was then menaced with invasion, by the forces of Mexico and Colombia,
							and as we had been informed by a secret project of <persRef
								ref="canning-george">G. Canning</persRef> then the British Secretary
							of Foreign Affairs. <persRef ref="randall-thomas2">T. Randall</persRef> had been employed on a similar Agency
							during the Administration of <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>, the same had been
							offered by my direction in 1826 to <persRef ref="robertson-thomas"
								>Bolling Robertson</persRef>, by whom it was declined— There was a
							peculiar convenience in employing M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook,
							because his intention to go to the Havanna being known his departure
							would excite no public curiosity to betray the secresy of the Mission.
							He went accordingly, upon the same compensation which had been allowed
							to Captain Randall, and to other informal agents to South America— He
							took a confidential Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay to
							Governor Vives; had several personal interviews with him, and on the
							approach of Summer, returned to this Country with a confidential answer
							from Governor Vives to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clays Letter,
							which the Governor requested he would deliver with his own hands— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r </hi>Cook was on his way to this city, for that
							purpose when he was taken ill with a new disorder of which he died— He
							had received 1000 dollars advance on his departure, and had drawn a bill
							for 500 dollars before his death which was paid. <pb type="ms" n="560"
							/>In the retrenchment Committee, the Chairman <persRef
								ref="hamilton-james3">Hamilton</persRef>, with the air of mystery
							announced that a Citizen, who did not wish his name to be known had
							informed him that five thousand Dollars of Secret Service money had been
							paid to Daniel Pope Cook.— The majority of the Committee thereupon went
							into an investigation of the whole transaction, and examined witnesses,
							and demanded information of the Register of the Treasury concerning the
							payment, and of the Secretary of State, of its object— But when offered
							a confidential communication of it, declined receiving it— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r </hi>Clay’s Report contains a Statement of
							facts relating to the expenditures on Secret Service the tendency of
							which is to rectify the false exhibit of them made by the majority of
							the Committee— He left it with me for consideration. <persRef
								ref="barnum-horace">Captain Barnum</persRef> came to complain of
							some transaction of the <persRef ref="mclean-john2">Postmaster
								General</persRef> with him; upon which I requested him to make a

							surveying Lands, which he some time since exhibited to me— <persRef

							rows in which there were planted about four hundred— Some of the Acorns
							were from Malaga, and some from Bilbao; and there appear to be two or
							three varieties of the tree that have come up. I found also some further
							appearances of first vegetation—A Tamarind—Three shoots of the Persimmon
							at the North west corner of the Nursery, cracking the ground at the
							surface, but not yet out—and near them another plant not sufficiently
							discovered to shew what it is— Also on the South side four shoots from
							my plantation of 11. April. Two of them Persimmons, and two not yet
