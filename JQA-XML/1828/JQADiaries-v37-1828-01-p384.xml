						<p>My first visitor was <persRef ref="briscoe-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Briscoe</persRef>, who came to solicit
							an appointment in behalf of <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef>. The next
							was the <persRef ref="lowrie-walter">Secretary of the Senate</persRef>,
							who brought the confirmation of the nominations of the Directors of the
							Bank of the United States, and a few others— From Noon till 3. O’Clock,
							the New-Year’s Drawing-Room was held, and as numerously attended as on
							any former occasion— About two thirds of the Members of both Houses of
							Congress, and all the foreign Ministers now in the City were present.
							The scruples of the late Ministers from France and Russia seem to have
							been personal, and not sustained by their Governments— <persRef
								ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="vaughan-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Vaughan</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="huygens-bangeman">Chevalier

								Obregon</persRef>, the <persRef ref="menou-charles">Count de
								Menou</persRef>, <persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron
								Stackeberg</persRef>, and <persRef ref="rebello-silvestre">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rebello</persRef>. All the Heads of
							Departments and their families, the subordinate Officers of Government,
							civil, military and naval; and many hundreds of private Citizens of this
							place and all the neighbouring regions— All the open rooms were crowded
							and overflowing.— The day was uncommonly fine, and the weather
							temperate— <persRef ref="dickinson-julia">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs.</hi> B. O. Tayloe</persRef> thanked me for the lines I had
							written in her Album, which was returned to her this Morning. At three
							O’Clock, I withdrew from the Room with <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> to my writing Chamber,
							and signed the order for the release of <persRef ref="thomson-edward"
								>Edward Thompson</persRef> from prison, upon the back of the
							certificate of the two Physicians— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush
							read me a Letter from <persRef ref="mcduffie-george">G.
								M’Duffie</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means,
							asking for his more detailed Views, regarding the modifications of the
							Tariff, and alterations of duties upon Woollens, Hemp, Iron, fine
							Cottons, Teas and Wines. He had brought with him the second of <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">W. H. Crawfords</persRef> Letters to
							him written last Winter and Spring, and promised me copies of both— The
							Legislature of Georgia have nominated Crawford as a Candidate for the
							Office of Vice-President. The Legislature of the last year had already
							nominated <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> for
							the Presidency— <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"

									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Frye</persRef>, and <persRef ref="hellen-thomas">T. J.
								Hellen</persRef> dined with us. The family in the Evening after M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett retired amused themselves at
							Cards. I returned to my Chamber, and under weariness insurmountable
							persevered in writing until near Midnight, when I closed the Diary of
							the departed year, with prayer for blessing on that now commenced—
							Especially for strength proportioned to its trials.</p>

								Pleasonton</persRef> came with a Letter from <persRef
								ref="grinnel-cornelius">C. Grinnell</persRef> enclosing sealed
							proposals for supplying Oil for all the Light Houses of the United
							States, with a request that he would open them only at a Meeting with
							the <persRef key="rush-richard">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>— The
							contracts are for five years; and for the last fifteen have been held by
								<persRef ref="lewis-winslow2">Winslow Lewis</persRef>— Pleasonton
							was in some agitation, and said he considered it as an insult. I thought
							it little less myself, but told him it was probably not so intended. The
							imputation was that if he should open the proposals otherwise than in
							presence of the Secretary, Lewis would get a knowledge of them and
							underbid.— This implies a suspicion of Pleasonton’s integrity and was
							justly offensive to him. He seemed disposed to send back to Grinnell,
							who he said was a very respectable man, the sealed proposals with a
							passionate answer. I advised him simply to send them back with a notice,
							declining to comply with the condition, an unusual in the course of
							business; leaving Grinnell if he pleased to send his proposals directly
							to the Secretary of the Treasury— <persRef ref="tharp-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tharp</persRef> came and I returned
							him his papers, together with my own decision upon his memorial, which I
							read to him. <pb type="ms" n="385"/><persRef ref="clarke-satterlee"
								>Satterlee Clark</persRef> was a paymaster in the Army—dismissed by
							order of <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef> in August 1824—as a defaulter—under the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> Section of the Act of 31. January 1823.
							for having passed one Quarter without settling his Accounts— He was
							reported as a debtor to the amount of more than 15000 dollars, for which
							he has had three trials upon the suit of the Government—one Report of
							Referees, and two Verdicts of Juries in his favour. The verdict of the
							last Jury, the high respectability of whom is attested by the <persRef
								ref="tillotson-robert">District Attorney Tillotson</persRef>, is
							accompanied with a certificate that they find a balance of more than
							eleven thousand Dollars due to Clark— The failure to produce his
							accounts for Settlement in time, he attributes to a dangerous illness
							under which he was labouring— He now brought a certificate from the
								<persRef ref="hagner-peter">3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								Auditor</persRef> that his account had been credited, with the
							balance which had stood against him and also the Report of him as a
							defaulter, by the <persRef ref="towson-nathan">Paymaster General
								Towson</persRef> in July 1824. the very day, Clark says, on which by
							the Law, he could make this Report—and the Letter from <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">J. C. Calhoun</persRef> written in August 1824.
							informing him that the President had directed that he should be
							dismissed. Clark said he did not consider this as a dismission, and that
							he claimed still to be in the service. He said that <persRef
								ref="oakley-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Oakley</persRef>, and <persRef ref="storrs-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Storrs</persRef>, were preparing
							written opinions to that effect— I told him that if he should bring me
							those opinions, I would give them deliberate consideration; and with a
							disposition to do him all possible Justice—considering him as an injured
							man. He complained bitterly of the oppression that he had suffered— Said
							it had cost him more than four thousand dollars, and had held him up for
							four years before the Nation as a fraudulent defaulter and peculator of
							public monies— That it had driven him from absolute necessity into a
							party consisting of as great scoundrels as lived upon earth— These were
							his own words and they are entirely characteristic— He meant the Jackson
							party at New-York, with whom he has been acting to the full extent of
							his power— His principal motive for assuming the Jackson Livery was to
							secure a Jury favourably disposed to him, and he succeeded— His motive
							now for making such honourable mention of his associates is to
							propitiate me to this claim of his, to be recognized as yet in the
							public Service.— <persRef ref="noland-william2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Noland</persRef> was a neighbour of <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s</persRef>
							in Loudoun County—and was in 1824 appointed by him a Receiver of Public
							Monies in Arkansas. His term of four years will expire next Spring, and
							I had included his name in the list of renominations to be sent to the
							Senate— But he declines a reappointment, and returns to his old
							residence in Virginia— He told me that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe had sold his Albemarle Slaves to pay a debt due to <persRef
								ref="astor-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Astor</persRef> of New-York.
							The purchaser, who assumes the debt is <persRef ref="white-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> White</persRef> the Delegate from
							Florida. He said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe had yet another
							debt to the Bank at Richmond, contracted by his purchase of a House at
							Paris, when he was Minister to France in 1794. which house he afterwards
							sold at a sacrifice— I had always before heard that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe had made a profit on the sale of
							that place, which was a confiscated emigrant Estate; purchased by him,
							and paid for in Assignats when they were at the lowest stage of
							depreciation. <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker</persRef> the Minister of the Presbyterian Church, called upon
							me, having just returned from his tour to Boston, where he says he has
							made a considerable collection for the Church— He thinks the debt of the
							Society to the Bank of the United States will be settled. There was a
								<persRef ref="u">Spanish woman</persRef> who came for charity coming
							from Philadelphia, with her husband and four children— She told me in
							French a long Story of their banishment from Spain for Politics, and
							then from South-America as Spaniards. Her own family, she said was
							Roland, and she was of French descent and Education— <persRef
								ref="fendall-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fendall</persRef> came from the Department of State, with the
							Certificate of the two physicians concerning the health of <persRef
								ref="thomson-edward">Edward Thompson</persRef>, and my order upon it
							for his discharge from prison— He asked upon what process he had been
							imprisoned. It was upon a Confession of Judgment. I asked M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fendall, to apply at the Treasury
							Department for Thompson’s Petition, and to annex it to the certificate
							upon which my order was drawn. Evening party at <persRef

							came to renew and urge the recommendation of <persRef ref="duer-john"
								>John Duer</persRef> as District Attorney for the Southern District
							of New-York— He mentioned several of the other Candidates who have been
							recommended, with strong objections against them— Of <persRef
								ref="edwards-ogden">Edwards</persRef> he said that his decisions as
							a judge had given so much dissatisfaction that there had been serious
							talk in the Legislature of removing him— Of <persRef ref="u"
								>Maxwell</persRef> that he was odious to all parties, though he
							believed it was only because he had done his duty. Of <persRef
								ref="ogden-david3">David B. Ogden</persRef> that he was obnoxious as
							a federalist, and <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> had
							told him that if he should be nominated he would use all his influence
							against him, in the Senate— Of <persRef ref="blunt-joseph"
								>Blunt</persRef> that his forward officiousness and Vanity
							indisposed against him all the Bar— I told the General that <persRef
								ref="tillotson-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tillotson</persRef> the present Attorney had not declined a
							reappointment, and that as the expiration of his Commission was at hand,
							I had sent in his name to the Senate for re-appointment— The General
							thought he was utterly incompetent for the Office, and said he had been
							originally appointed only because he was a family connection of <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>.
							He spoke also of <persRef ref="myers-moses">Moses Myers</persRef>, the
							man whose nomination it was expected would be opposed in Senate, but
							which they have confirmed— Van Rensselaer said he believed their only
							objection against him was that he was an honest man— The first in that
							Collectorship for many years. The General has a very indifferent opinion
							of <persRef ref="wright-silas">Silas Wright</persRef>, the new Member
							from that District whom he considers as a tool of Van Buren, and who he
							says offered himself to him, as his Land Agent— He gave me as an example
							of the observation he had made about the Collectors at Oswegatchie, that
							during the late war one of his tenants applied to him for a loan of
							money for erecting an Establishment there for the Sale of Salt. “To
							smuggle into Canada,” said the General—“but how are you to escape the
							vigilance of the British authorities in the Province?” “Oh! there will
							be no difficulty with them”—[“]and how of the Collector?”— [“]Why, to
							tell you the truth, the Collector, is to be in partnership with me.”—
							The General, who is himself an honest and honourable man, testifies to
							no superfluity of political Virtue in the State of New-York— <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> brought papers, of
							applications from Indians, for permission to sell Lands reserved to them
							by Treaty— <persRef ref="knight-nehemiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Knight</persRef> Senator from Rhode-Island, came to speak of the
							appointment of a Surveyor at the Port of North Kingston. He recommends
								<persRef ref="holloway-william">Holloway</persRef>, or <persRef
								ref="hammond-pardon">Hammond</persRef>—says the last is the best
							qualified— <persRef ref="todson-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Todsen</persRef> came to solicit the appointment of Agent at the
							African Colony—which he says he should prefer to a renomination as
							assistant Surgeon in the Army— I referred him to the <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hall</persRef> came to
							solicit a Clerkship for <persRef ref="u">her husband</persRef>— She told
							me they had some months since removed to this City, for the purpose of
							procuring an Office— This is presumptive evidence of his unfitness for
							any— <persRef ref="ellis-powhatan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ellis</persRef> of the Senate and <persRef ref="forward-chauncey"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forward</persRef> of the House
							of Representatives of the Joint Committee of Enrolled Bills, brought me,
							for signature making partial Appropriations for the Support of
							Government during the year 1828 Providing for the pay and expenses of
							the two Houses of Congress; which I examined and signed. The first of
							the Session— The Evening was chiefly absorbed by successive visits from
								<persRef ref="catlett-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Catlett</persRef> of Alexandria, and <persRef ref="everett-edward"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett</persRef>— Catlett came
							to ask for a word from me to the judges of the Supreme Court to bestow
							the Office of Reporter of their decisions upon <persRef
								ref="lee-richard3">Richard Henry Lee</persRef>— I told him it would
							give me pleasure to serve M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee but that it
							was an appointment in which I could not with propriety interfere, and I
							had understood the Judges had already promised their suffrages to
								<persRef ref="peters-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richard
								Peters jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> a very worthy
							friend of mine whom I had already assured of my wishes <pb type="ms"
								n="387"/>for his success— He said there were only three of the
							judges who had promised their votes to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Peters, but that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee would certainly not
							wish me under these circumstances to intercede for him— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett spoke to me of a Resolution
							proposed by <persRef ref="hamilton-james3">James Hamilton</persRef> of
							South-Carolina, to the House of Representatives, for refunding all the
							monies paid upon Convictions under the Sedition Law—of the
							Constitutionality of which he asked my opinion— I said that not having
							been in the Country when that Law was enacted, I had never examined that
							question; but I had seen nothing unconstitutional in it— I had however
							no doubt that an Act of Congress declaring Unconstitutional an Act of a
							preceding Congress, Unconstitutional would itself be— He said that
								<persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Barnard</persRef> a new Member from New-York who boarded in the same
							house with him had told him he intended to reply to Hamilton upon this
							Resolution. With regard to the Vice-Presidency he said, it was settled
							that <persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef> would be nominated by
							the Harrisburg Convention— I received yesterday from <persRef
								ref="hall-basil">Captain Basil Hall</persRef> a Note enclosing
							Letters of introduction of himself written in March last, by <persRef
								ref="porter-agnes">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Agnes
								Porter</persRef>, and <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> at London—two
							pamphlet publications by the Society for the diffusion of useful
							knowledge: which he had mentioned at the Institute dinner—and three
							small elegant Volumes, of his own Travels, published by the late
								<persRef ref="constable-archibald">Archibald Constable</persRef> of
							Edinburg, in whose name, Captain Hall presents them— I this day answered
							his Note— There was a dancing party this Evening, at the Dutch Minister
								<persRef ref="huygens-bangeman">Huygens’s</persRef>, attended by
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef>, <persRef

								<persRef ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef>, the Russian

								>Constantine</persRef>— On presenting the Letter the Baron said it
							had been despatched under a persuasion that the information of an Event
							so interesting as well to the domestic happiness of the Emperor, as to
							the stability of his Government. I answered by assuring him of the
							pleasure with which I received this communication— I added that the

							every thing that affected the happiness of the Emperor, as well in his
							family, as in the affairs of his People, and that they judged no Event
							could more auspiciously contribute to this effect, than this accession
							to the Imperial family; none could therefore be more gratifying to them—
							He said he Should take the highest satisfaction in transmitting to his
							Government these Assurances— I then asked him how he found this climate
							agree with his health— He answered well; and said he would encourage
							himself in the expectation that it would so continue, notwithstanding
							the warnings that he had received—and they were many— He lamented that
							his hearing had so much suffered, as to deprive him of much
							satisfaction, and of the means of making himself so agreeable as he

								Woodcock</persRef>, a member of the House of Representatives from
							New York, came to solicit a Commission in the Army, for the <persRef
								ref="hughes-george2">Ex-Cadet Hughes</persRef>— The same who was
							dismissed last Summer, by Sentence of a Court-Martial, and who was then
							so long and perseveringly pressed upon me then by himself, and by
							others; particularly by <persRef ref="anderson-joseph">Judge
								Anderson</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodcock spoke of
							him as a youth poor and friendless, for whom he had obtained admission
							at the Academy, and referred to the very creditable manner in which he
							had passed through the course of Studies, and the final examination for
							the degree—having at the close of his term, ranked as the fifth in his
							Class I told him that this was true; but that the Reports upon his
							conduct were as unfavourable as those of his ability and proficiency
							were otherwise. That on his trial as well as on the occasion which
							produced it he had manifested a worse than contumacious Spirit— That the
							grant of a Commission to him now would have a pernicious effect, upon
							the discipline of the Academy. Events were too recent, and the danger to
							the Institution was too great to overlook what had passed— It was
							painful to me to refuse the applications in his favour, having a respect
							for his talents, and a strong feeling for his distressed situation; but
							a sense of duty to the Academy, and to the morals of all the young men
							now there, must be a paramount consideration— He asked, if he might
							write to him that good <pb type="ms" n="389"/>conduct for a time would
							lead to a more favourable result— I said I could in candour authorize no
							such expectation in my time— What his prospects might be with others I
							could not foresee— I said I had not come to my determination before
							without consulting the <persRef ref="thayer-sylvanus"
								>Superintendant</persRef> of the Academy, whose impressions were
							very decided against any relaxation from the decisions, excluding this
							young man from the army— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodcock spoke
							also upon one or two other subjects— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bust</persRef> was a stranger from the
							Western part of New-York— A casual visitor of curiosity— <persRef
								ref="mallary-rollin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mallory</persRef>, a member of the House from Vermont, and <persRef
								ref="wing-austin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wing</persRef> the
							Delegate from Michigan came together. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wing said that the agreement for the exchange of Offices between
								<persRef ref="witherell-james">Judge Witherell</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="woodbridge-william">Secretary Woodbridge</persRef> was
							now so far completed that he wished the nominations to be made without
							delay. I said I would send them in to the Senate on Monday.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wing wished that the Commissions might so
							be given that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbridge should be chief
							Justice, but the Law recognizes no such distinction. I thought however
							his Commission might be first dated— He said he should hereafter
							recommend a person for the Office of Collector now held also by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbridge— <persRef ref="lowrie-walter"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowry</persRef> the Secretary of
							the Senate brought me a Resolution asking information concerning the
							troubles on the Northeastern boundary— <persRef ref="newton-thomas">M<hi

							and <persRef ref="stanbery-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Stanberry</persRef> a new Member of the House from Ohio came
							together— They spoke of an Act of the last Session of Congress, granting
							a Section of Land to the State, for aiding to make a Canal. There is
							some question upon the construction of the Act, of which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ruggles stated that a written

								Bell</persRef> the Senator from that State, mentioned a claim of
								<persRef ref="mcneil-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

						<p><date>6. V:30.</date> Sunday.</p>
						<p>Heard this morning <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kent</persRef>, from Genesis 1:26. “And God said, Let us make man,
							in our image, after our likeness.” The Sermon was a panegyric upon the
							human character, well composed and high wrought— The preacher considered
							all disparaging representations of human Nature, as incorrect both in
							fact and principle, and particularly disapproved the theory which
							denominates man a worm of the dust— But he did not look at the other
							side of the picture— Man as a physical being is a machine of animated
							matter, fearfully and wonderfully made—with wants which must be supplied
							to preserve his existence; and Passions which must be indulged for the
							preservation of his species— The power over the rest of Creation is in
							his hand: an instrument without which the intellect of Angels would not
							avail to give him dominion; but which God has given also to the Ape
							species, as if to shew how little it avails itself, without the
							intellect to direct and controul its use. By his material composition
							man belongs to earth— By the power of thought, man’s nature is Angelic,
							and in proportion as Heaven or Earth predominates in the person of each
							individual his character is glorious or debased. Man in his perfection
							is little lower than the Angels; but without the exercise, or with the
							perverted exercise of mind is <pb type="ms" n="390"/>is little better
							than a worm of the dust— In his actual condition the Scriptures consider
							man as a fallen and degraded being— The sentence pronounced upon him was
							“dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return[”]— A degraded being he
							still remains by his Passions and his Vices— From these no mortal is
							wholly exempt; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kent’s picture of
							human nature seems to me overcharged with light as much as the
							Calvinistic Creed is overdarkened with shadows— Between the Services,
								<persRef ref="blunt-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph
								Blunt</persRef> of New-York called to pay a visit. In the afternoon
							at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church <persRef
								ref="keith-reuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Keith</persRef> of
							Alexandria read Prayers for the second Sunday after Christmas, omitting
							the Psalms of the day, and the Lesson from the Old Testament. It was the
							day of the Epiphany, but he did not read either the Lesson or the
							Collect assigned to it in the Prayer Book— He preached from Proverbs
							14.32 “The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous
							hath hope in his death.” A plain, well written and earnest discourse,
							contrasting the death bed Scenes of the wicked and of the righteous.—
							This passage is remarkable as one of those in the Old Testament,
							indicating the belief of a future state of retribution— I read in the
							Evening some of the Letters of <persRef ref="voltaire-francois"
								>Voltaire</persRef>— Le Mondain, to which they refer, and the
							subsequent Poems in defence of that profligate Plaisanterie. I also read
							some of <persRef ref="montgomery-james">Montgomery’s</persRef> Songs of
							Zion, which are versions of Psalms—not sufficiently vivid—</p>

							should be appointed the Agent to them, instead of <persRef
								ref="brevoort-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="cutts-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cutts</persRef> the second Comptroller, brought an Account presented
							for Settlement by <persRef ref="clarke-satterlee">Satterlee
								Clark</persRef>, which was not among those brought forward by him on

							that it could not be passed to his Credit, because he avowed that he had
							other claims, and they ought all to be brought forward, before this
							should be settled. But Cutts said he did not see that he could refuse a
							Settlement of this account upon the single ground that Clark had other
							claims— I concurred, in this opinion— He shewed me also an Account of
								<persRef ref="towson-nathan">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Towson</persRef>, the <unclear>Pay</unclear> Master General, who has received upwards
							of 1300 dollars, for Quarters and fuel—upon the Authority of the Army

							has refused to allow this charge in the account of <persRef
								ref="cross-t">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Cross</persRef> who
							made the payment to Towson— Hagner considers this army Regulation, as
							contrary to Law, and therefore void—and has endorsed upon the account a
							reference to all the Acts of Congress relating to the Paymaster Generals
							Office— Cutts said he was of the same opinion, the Paymaster General
							being a Civil Officer with a fixed Salary—and therefore could <pb
								type="ms" n="391"/>claim no allowance for Quarters and fuel— My own
							opinion was the same— <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef> called and spoke of a Note, he had

							of the Vice-Presidency. The <persRef ref="bonaparte-joseph">Count de

								<persRef ref="blunt-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							about one third filled with water; and by placing under it a lighted
							lamp of Alcohol, soon set it boiling and the machinery in Motion. It
							went very well, and with great rapidity. He took the steam channel to
							pieces, and shewed its construction— Its peculiarity consists in four
							apertures with valves, two of which are opened, and two are shut, by the
							same rising and descending stroke of the Piston. It simplifies very much
							the machine, and he says makes it impossible for the boiler to burst;
							which is not so clear— He is like most of our inventors in this Country
							very illiterate, and makes strange avock of the king’s Henglish. He is
							also like other inventors greatly captivated with his own achievement,
							and apparently with more reason than many others. The Steam engine is

								M’Kenney’s</persRef> Indian tour, of which he had a printed copy. I
							declined the subscription but agreed to take a copy of the Book.
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Everett</persRef> came at the request of <persRef
								ref="vanrensselaer-stephen">General Van Rensselaer</persRef> to
							speak of the appointment of U.S. District-Attorney for the Southern
							District of New-York. I thought I had sent in the name of <persRef
								ref="tillotson-robert">Robert Tillotson</persRef> for
							re-appointment, but found upon examination that it had been omitted— His
							commission expired the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month— I
							told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett that before nominating
							another person I should deem it necessary to ascertain, whether
							Tillotson desired to be renominated, and also to apprize him that there
							would be objections against his re-appointment, which would require
							explanations from him. I had also some conversation with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett, about a resolution, offered
							yesterday in the house of Representatives by <persRef
								ref="hamilton-james3">James Hamilton</persRef> of South-Carolina,
							that <persRef ref="allston-washington">Alston</persRef> should be
							appointed to paint a Picture of the Battle of New-Orleans, to fill one
							of the vacant Pannels in the Rotunda of the Capitol—one of the Reasons
							that he assigned for which was that Alston, and <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, were both natives of
							South-Carolina— This picture was part of the Canvas for Jackson, and
							Hamilton, who fancies himself equal to five <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero’s</persRef>, flourished in a Speech about Alston’s restoring
							the Augustan age of painting— <persRef ref="ingersoll-ralph"
								>Ingersoll</persRef> of Connecticut moved to strike out the name of
							the Painter, leaving the selection of him to the Library Committee, to
							whom Hamilton proposed that his Resolution should be referred. Hamilton
							finding that his South-Carolina feather had tickled a tender point,
							ungraciously enough agreed to accept this amendment of Ingersoll—
								<persRef ref="kremer-george">Kremer</persRef> of Pennsylvania was
							delighted with the proposal to empannel the Battle of New-Orleans; but
							moved as an Amendment that the Artist should be employed also to paint
							another Picture to be placed alongside of the Battle namely the Hartford
							Convention, in secret Session— The Speaker pronounced this amendment to
							be not in order— Everett proposed an Amendment enlarging the Powers of
							the Committee, to the filling of the four vacant pannels, and <persRef
								ref="storrs-henry">Storrs</persRef> moved that in the Selection of
							the Subjects there should be a due proportion of the tribute paid to the
							naval Achievements of our History— After the hour allowed by the Rules
							for debating Resolutions was passed, Hamilton moved a suspension of the
							rule <pb type="ms" n="393"/>to continue the debate— <persRef
								ref="randolph-john">Randolph</persRef> came into the House, just in
							time to say I hope not— There was a considerable majority for suspending
							the Rule; but not two thirds; so that the House adjourned leaving the
							whole subject afloat— The subject was this day resumed and occupied the
							House the whole day— The amendments were all rejected by considerable
							majorities, and the Resolution itself by a vote of 103 to 98— <persRef
								ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef>
							was here and made some enquiries concerning the Treaty with Sweden, and
							some claim of an allowance in the Accounts of <persRef
								ref="appleton-john">J. J. Appleton</persRef> while he was Charge
							d’Affaires in Spain— <persRef ref="bryan-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bryan</persRef> Member of the House from North-Carolina,
							introduced <persRef ref="mcdonald-duncan">General M’Donnell</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mason</persRef> of

								<persRef ref="allen-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. H.

							the Papermaker at Philadelphia, presented me a Ream of his Folio Post,
							and a Ream of his Letter-paper; pay for which he declined to receive.
								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> called with several papers relating to Appointments
							of sundry Officers of the Customs— He also spoke of the nomination of
							himself for the Vice-Presidency at the recent Harrisburg Convention; and
							enquired what my impressions were respecting it.— He said his own course
							in relation to it would much depend upon my views, and those of the
							members of the Administration— I told him candidly that so far as I had
							been consulted by the friends of the Administration, I had advised that
							the Selection should be made of a Citizen residing South of the
							Potowmack— This had been fully considered; and had ultimately been
							judged not indispensable. The Harrisburg Convention having made the
							nomination, I hoped it would be universally accepted, and supported; and
							I assured him that no nomination could have made more pleasing to me— I
							added that I had received his Letters at the interval of a year from
							each other expressing his wish to retire from the Treasury Department,
							and for a Mission abroad— So far as these wishes were founded upon the
							state of his health, the overcharge upon him of public duty, I felt
							every disposition to gratify him, but that speaking as his friend I
							thought his own interest, and that of the Nation would be much better
							served by his remaining in this Country, instead of his going again
							abroad— He had more opportunities of bringing himself advantageously
							before the Public— He was daily acquiring a character in the mind of the
							Nation and assuredly no such Reports as his, had appeared from the
							Secretary of the Treasury since those of <persRef
								ref="hamilton-alexander">Hamilton</persRef> had been made— He
							appeared to be much affected by these words of kindness and expressed
							his readiness to acquiesce in the nomination— <persRef

							in full confidence and frankness my opinion of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Raguet’s conduct; and the history of his successive
							appointments as consul, informal political Agent, and Chargé d’Affaires—
							The rashness and violence of his proceedings and correspondence before
							his final explosion— The total want of judgment in the occasion that he
							took to demand his Passports and come home— The danger of War that he
							had incurred, and the embarrassment, into which he had drawn this
							Government, by his heedless impetuosity— I said that believing his
							motives to have been pure and patriotic, I had sustained him to the
							utmost extent of my power and conscience— I had passed no censure upon
							him— I had so stated in my message to Congress, and in the subsequent
							Correspondence with the Brazilian Government I had avoided any avowal of
							dissatisfaction with him, which would have given them a triumph, over
							him— But to replace in diplomatic service abroad a man <pb type="ms"
								n="394"/>of such a temper and want of judgment who took blustering
							for bravery and insolence for energy was too dangerous— I could not in
							conscience do it— There might be no necessity for saying this to him— It
							may suffice to say there is no vacant office to which he could be
							appointed; But if he is disposed to have explanations and public
							disclosures I shall not object to them; and I said if M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Marks wished a more specific idea of the
							character of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Raguets Correspondence, and
							would call at the Department of State, it would all be shewn to him— He
							said he had information enough, and should simply inform M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Raguet that there was no vacant Office—
								<persRef ref="lowrie-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowrie</persRef> the Secretary of the Senate brought me five

							relating to the Slave Indemnity Convention, may be published without
							detriment to the public Service. <persRef ref="dwight-henry">Col<hi

							the second Comptroller brought some Accounts of <persRef
								ref="mckenney-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								M’Kenney</persRef>, for expenditures in his Indian Negotiations
							which Cutts thought not sufficiently vouched. There was a lumping charge
							of near 5000 dollars for travelling expenses and presents to Indians
							without specification or voucher—but an order upon it for payment by the
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Secretary of War</persRef>— Cutts said
							this never had been the practice, but was a new pretension of M’Kenney’s
							within a year or two— He thought it not warranted by Law, and could not
							pass the account. The pretension was that the whole appropriation for
							contingencies of the War Department was a discretionary fund at the
							disposal of the Secretary and requiring no voucher for settlement but
							his order— Cutts said the expenditure was no doubt discretionary but the
							account must be vouched like others. I thought him right, and desired
							him to make a written statement of his objection to M’Kenney’s Account.
								<persRef ref="adams-jacob">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jacob

							recommending <persRef ref="platt-james">James Platt</persRef> for the
							Office of Postmaster at that place— Storrs himself joined in the
							recommendation, and denied that Platt was an opposition man, which I
							told him I had heard said, and which I added was rather the objection of
							our friends than mine— Two persons, I believe members of the House of
							Representatives from Tennessee, came with a Petition signed by the
							District Judge, Clark, Attorney, Marshall, and many other respectable
							names, and enclosed to me, in a Letter signed by the two Senators from
							Tennessee, <persRef ref="white-hugh">White</persRef> and <persRef

							sentenced last June by the U.S. Circuit Court to ten years imprisonment
							for stealing from the Mail while acting as Postmaster a Prize Lottery
							ticket of 1000 dollars— The reasons assigned are his youth, respectable
							connections, wife and children, poverty, and especially his state of
							health, and probable death before long— After stating to these
							gentlemen, the aggravated nature of the Offence, and the danger of
							relaxing the punishment of it, as well as my resistance to other
							applications of a similar character, I said the Signatures were so
							respectable and the arguments from the mans state of health so urgent,

								Southard</persRef> called this morning with two papers, connected
							with a Report of an amended System of Navy Regulations that he is
							preparing in answer to a Resolution and Call of the Senate at their last
							Session— He is going to-morrow to Baltimore, and thence to Annapolis to
							visit the Delaware Line of Battle ship. At S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t</hi> John’s Church <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Mason</persRef> a Clergyman from Virginia read Prayers
							for the first Sunday after the Epiphany, and <persRef
								ref="ducachet-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ducachet</persRef> of Norfolk preached from Daniel 5.5.6–25.30— 5.
							[“]In the same hour came forth a finger of a man’s hand, and wrote over
							against the Candlestick, upon the plaister of the wall of the king’s
							Palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. 6. Then the
							king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that
							the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against
							another. 25. And this is the writing, that was written MENE, MENE,
							TEKEL, UPHARSIN. 30. In that Night was <persRef ref="belshazzar"
								>Belshazzar</persRef> the king of the Chaldeans slain”— The
							divisions of the discourse were drawn from the first words of the text
							“In the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> hour”—what hour?— The hour of his
							security— The hour of his danger— The hour of his heedless and
							sacrilegious indulgence— The hour of his ruin— With an eloquent
							exposition of each of these properties as appertaining to that hour the
							preacher interwove an historical account of that astonishing Catastrophe
							of the Chaldean Empire—taken partly from the context in this 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi>. Chapter of Daniel, and partly from
							cotemporaneous profane history— In remarking upon the kings security he
							described the Wall of Babylon as surrounding the City 350 feet high and
							37 feet thick, with gates of iron, well guarded with soldiers— In
							illustrating the hour of danger, he described the manner in which the
							City was taken, by draining the bed of the Euphrates, and by marching
							two divisions of the besieging army from the two opposite points of the
							City, till they met at the royal palace— In commenting upon the hour of
							luxurious indulgence, he reprobated severely the sacrilegious use of the
							holy vessels taken by <persRef ref="nebuchadnezzar"
								>Nebuchadnezzar</persRef> from the Temple of Jerusalem, and spoke
							with solemn rebuke of the practice of dissolute and riotous banqueting
							by men in public Stations— The discourse closed with a vivid and
							forcible application of the subject to the unrepenting Sinners among his
							auditory, whom he conjured to lay all the instructions of this awful
							example to their hearts—“and then, live unrepenting if you can, and die
							unrepenting if you dare.” The very closing words of a Sermon that I
							heard at Albany in 1818 from the late <persRef ref="larned-sylvester">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Larned</persRef> of New-Orleans— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ducachet’s delivery is excellent, and his
							Sermon was heard with great interest, and the deepest attention— After
							the morning Service I had a visit from <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Blunt</persRef>, who urged me
							with logical argument, and persuasive importunity to nominate him for
							U.S. District Attorney for the Southern District of New-York. He also
							borrowed the third Number of the American Quarterly Review— In the
							afternoon Prayers were read at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							Church by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ducachet, and the Sermon was
							preached by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mason, from Job. 19.25. “For
							I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter
							day, upon the Earth. 26. And though after my skin worms destroy this
							body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. 27. Whom I shall see for myself,
							and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.”— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Mason considered this text as a direct prophesy of the
							Advent of Jesus Christ, and a direct assertion of a future State, and of
							the Resurrection of the body— So it is considered in the burial Service
							of the Church of England. In the English Bible the passage scarcely
							admits of any other Construction, but it is not so in the original. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Mason’s Sermon however was upon the
							certainty of a future State, as revealed in the Scriptures; for the mode
							of which he cited the memorable passage of <persRef ref="paul">S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef> 1. Corinthians
							15.42.43.44— The Subject of the Discourse is no doubt of the deepest
							interest, but was not treated in a manner so affecting as the fate of
							Belshazzar had been made in the morning. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Mason’s composition though good is not equal to that of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ducachet— His most vigorous efforts leave
							his hearer cold— I did not attend Church in the Evening. <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S. Adams</persRef> dined at <persRef ref="elliot-william">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Elliot’s</persRef>— An incipient inflammation in my
							left eye, discouraged me for the first part of the Evening, but I
							afterwards read <persRef ref="thomson-charles">Thomson’s</persRef>
							Translation of Job 19.25.26.27. and <persRef ref="hewlett-john"
								>Hewlett’s</persRef> Comment upon that part of the English Bible—
							Neither sustains M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mason’s construction</p>

								<persRef ref="thompson-smith">Judge Thompson</persRef> had called

							Clay to write to <persRef ref="tillotson-robert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Tillotson</persRef>, and ascertain whether he intended
							to decline a re-appointment, or to risk a re-nomination. <persRef
								ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef> called upon me, in the
							deepest dejection of Spirits; and told me that he came for that
							purpose—he had about six years since a parolytic shock, and has been
							ever since in very precarious health— Still flattering himself with
							hopes of recovery, until about two months past when he had again a
							severe attack, which has left him in this state of prostration and
							despair He told me that he wished his earthly Scene was over; and should
							terminate it himself but that it was his duty not to desert his Post;
							and intimated that he would resign his Commission, but that his
							Circumstances are such that it would leave his family destitute—and said
							he had not opened his lips, in this respect to any human being, except
								<persRef ref="browne-pamela">his wife</persRef>; but he thought it
							would be proper, that he should make known this his sense of his own
							Condition to me. I endeavoured to cheer him, by attributing this
							pressure upon his Spirits, to the weather which for several weeks has
							been and still continues damp, and gloomy, and full of fogs and vapours;
							and said that with the return of a clear sky and bracing atmosphere, he
							would recover his Spirits, and better health; and at all events he would
							be prepared to receive the dispensations of Providence with composure
							and firmness—</p>
					<lg>	<l>Why should I grieve, when grieving I must bear?</l>
						<l>And take with guilt, what guiltless I may share.</l></lg>
						<p>he appeared to be partially soothed with these observations, the justness
							of which he admitted: and he asked me if I had read his answer to a Call
							from the House of Representatives, asking about the reasons, authority
							and expense of a late dislocation and exchange of Stations, between the
							two divisions of the army; made by his Orders—a movement which has met
							with some censure— I had read his answer, which bears some indications
							of a wounded Spirit— I had a visit from a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Goldsborough</persRef>, who said he
							had been introduced to me at Baltimore, and also here. He is employed as
							a contractor at the fortifications in progress at Old Point Comfort
							Fortress Monroe, and fortress Calhoun. <persRef ref="nourse-charles"
								>Major Nourse</persRef> called for the proceedings of the Militia
								<pb type="ms" n="399"/>Court-Martial at Mobile in 1814.— I had them
							not—and he afterwards called and told me that he had found them—
								<persRef ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef> was here in the
							Evening— He spoke of the next New-York annual Election which he observed
							would be a general one, for Governor, for the Legislature—for Sheriffs,
							for Congress, and for Electors of President and Vice-President— He
							believed the success of all would depend upon the Selection of Candidate
							for Governor, the Spirit of the New-York Elections having always
							governed by local feelings. He said it was understood that the combined
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">Clinton</persRef> party had fixed upon the
							Comptroller <persRef ref="marcy-william">Marsy</persRef> for their
							Candidate, and he thought the best person to oppose him by the friends
							of the Administration would be Judge Thompson— That he might perhaps
							feel some reluctance at giving up his Office as Judge of the Supreme
							Court, for the uncertain prospect of an election which if successful
							would be only for two years, and at the end of that time might leave him
							destitute— It had occurred to him, Taylor, that from the intimacy that
							had subsisted between Judge Thompson and me, as Associates in the last
							Administration, I might perhaps have some influence in forming his
							determination, and particularly by presenting to him the prospect; that
							if after two years Service as Governor, he should not be re-elected, an
							Office of adequate indemnity should be given him under the Government of
							the Union— I said this was a proposal, upon which I should wish for time
							to reflect, before giving a definitive answer. In its first aspect it
							appeared to me liable to objections, first as an unsuitable interference
							in the Election of Governor of New-York— Secondly, as it would require a
							pledge from me to Judge Thompson, which in itself might be deemed
							exceptionable, and which it might not be in my power to redeem. His
							place upon the Bench if vacated, must be immediately supplied, by a
							Citizen of the same State or section of the Union; which would
							necessarily exclude him, until a new vacancy of that same seat— The
							Offices of Collector and Postmaster at New-York, were scarcely to be
							thought of for him; nor was there any prospect to be relied upon that
							they or either of them would be vacant at the time— What Office was
							there that I could give him reason to expect? He said a foreign Mission—
							I replied that I could have no certainly that there would be any Mission
							abroad vacant at the time, and if there should, I could scarcely engage
							it in anticipation, so as to preclude myself from Selection of the
							person to fill it. And this consideration was the more forcible,
							inasmuch as Judge Thompson’s life and experience have not been
							diplomatic— I said also that Judge Thompsons situation was favourable
							for being a Candidate, as in the event of failure he would still hold
							his present Office, and could not be removed from it— Even in the event
							of failure, he would come so near to success that it would rather add to
							his standing in Society; and in the event of success it could scarcely
							be doubted that he would be secure of re-election— There was much more
							of this Conversation, and Taylor said he should give up the idea of
							pursuing his suggestion further— I said that Judge Thompson would be an
							excellent Candidate for them, and I had no doubt would prove an able
							Governor; and I indicated to him a source of influence to persuade him,
							of which he said he would avail himself: and I urged him, if Judge
							Thompson should decline, to think of <persRef ref="sanford-nathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanford</persRef>— He said the
							feelings of the friends of the Administration in New-York, were
							embittered against Sanford; not only from his persevering, and
							inflexible refusal to take any part in the measures which they were
							pursuing to sustain the Administration, but for his vote at the
							commencement of the present Session of Congress with regard to the
							choice of a Printer to the Senate— I said the vote was susceptible of
							explanation— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanford was not unfriendly
							to the Administration, though he had not chosen to make active exertions
							as a friend— But if elected Governor of New-York, he would have no
							Spirit of hostility to the Administration, and the neutrality of his
							course hitherto, would perhaps be more favourable to his success than if
							he had been more anxiously devoted to our Cause— Taylor did not seem to
							be convinced; but the subject may be resumed— I received a Letter from
								<persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, with his Account— The
							last two days I have suffered with an inflammation of my eyes, which
							threatens to disqualify me for reading and writing— That is from all the
							consolation that I can promise myself in my remnant of life— Received
							Letters from <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef> announcing
							the death of <persRef ref="boylston-ward">Ward N. Boylston</persRef>. at

							at Tiffin— He also enquired if I had come to a determination upon his
							claim for compensation, upon the Settlement of Indian Superintendence
							Accounts. I had not. <persRef ref="lowrie-walter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowrie</persRef>, Secretary of the
							Senate brought me four Resolutions of that body confirming appointments;
							one of them that of <persRef ref="myers-moses">Moses Myers</persRef>,
							Collector at Norfolk, against which <persRef ref="tazewell-littleton"
								>Tazewell</persRef> made ineffectual opposition— <persRef
								ref="leffler-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Leffler</persRef>, member of the House from Virginia introduced a
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ray</persRef> from
							that State, who was of the late Convention at Richmond. <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">Judge Thompson</persRef> called, and I spoke
							with him concerning the appointment of a District Attorney for the
							Southern District of New-York— He told me that he had written to
								<persRef ref="tillotson-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tillotson</persRef>, as he had promised <persRef key="clay-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, to enquire
							whether he wished to be renominated, but had not received his answer.
							But he said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tillotson had repeatedly
							told him he should decline a renomination— I then enquired of Judge
							Thompson his opinion, concerning the several candidates who had been
							recommended. <persRef ref="duer-john">John Duer</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="blunt-joseph">Blunt</persRef>, <persRef ref="edwards-ogden"
								>Ogden Edwards</persRef>, <persRef ref="ogden-david3">D. B.
								Ogden</persRef>, <persRef ref="tallmadge-james">Tallmadge</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="u">Baldwin</persRef>— He said they were all well
							qualified, but he thought the best appointment, upon the whole, would be
							judge Edwards— He spoke favourably of all excepting Duer, and nothing to
							his disadvantage; but that the signatures of so large a number of the
							New-York delegation in the House of Representatives, were obtained by
							the solicitations of <persRef ref="duer-william">William Duer</persRef>,
							of Albany, and by the exertions of Verplanck and Bunker, family
							connections of the Duer’s— He added that judge Edwards had varied in his
							inclination for the Office of Attorney, until several those who would
							prefer him had signed in favour of Duer—but that four or five of them
							had declared they would have recommended Edwards in preference, had they
							known he was a candidate— In the Evening I received from Judge Thompson
							a Letter to him from Tillotson declaring that he wrote by the same mail
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, requesting not to be
							renominated— I had morning visits also from <persRef ref="powell-alfred"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Powell</persRef>, who introduced
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Steenberger</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Arthur</persRef>, from Virginia. The Address of the

								ref="johnson-chapman">Chapman Johnson</persRef>, and much admired.
								<persRef ref="weems-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John W.
								Weems</persRef> brought me a Letter from his father <persRef
								ref="weems-john">John C Weems</persRef> a member of the House from

								ref="cobb-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cobb</persRef>,
							Senator from Georgia came to urge the transmission to Congress as soon
							as possible of a Message, concerning the boundary between Georgia and
							Florida— I told him that I would send the message as soon as two copies
							of the Papers and of the map should have been made out; and they were
							now making— He said he had supposed this would occasion some delay and
							he had brought back the copy of papers which I had sent to him and his
							Colleague, which might serve for one of the copies to be sent to
							Congress— <persRef ref="thomas-jesse">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thomas</persRef>, a Senator from Illinois came to have conversation
							with me; but on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s coming in shortly

							relating to the complaints of <persRef ref="rebello-silvestre">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rebello</persRef>, the Brazilian
							Chargé d’Affaires, to answer his Notes— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay mentioned that when the Senate shall have acted upon the
							Northwestern boundary Convention with Great-Britain, it would be
							necessary to send a messenger with the ratified Conventions— He said
							there was a young man named <persRef ref="u">Herbert</persRef>,
							recommended by <persRef ref="washington-bushrod">judge
								Washington</persRef>, a relation of his and my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, whom <persRef

								Adams</persRef> had requested him to send— He was altogether willing
							to send him, but thought he could not do it without my consent. I said
							we would wait to decide, until we ascertain what the Senate will do with
							the Northwestern boundary Convention; but painful as it is to me to
							controul the wishes of my wife, I cannot consent to this proposal—
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> brought me
							the papers respecting the accounts of <persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">T.

							for a Court of Inquiry on a Quarrel between him and <persRef

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Asa Rogerson</persRef> the

							transmitted as he said by <persRef ref="macon-nathaniel">M<hi

							who opposed his appointment, upon which I declined gratifying him, but
							told him he should not be condemned without an opportunity to justify
							himself: which he said was all he asked— Resumed my writing in the
							Evening; with great difficulty. Party at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay’s— None of our family out— Signed Ratification of Treaty with

						<p>Returning from my daily morning walk round the Capitol Square, I met a

							President’s House to see me— I shook hands with him; told him I was glad
							to see him and enquired his name— He said it was <persRef ref="u"
								>Skinner</persRef>, that he belonged to a Cotton factory near
							Baltimore— There were many there, and they had told him that if he came

							This Correspondence with the governor, he said was voluminous, and the

							I thought the extracts would be sufficient— <persRef

									>r</hi> Graham</persRef> to give the final order for its

							and <persRef ref="storrs-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Storrs</persRef> upon the question of his removal as a Paymaster in

								ref="cutts-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutts</persRef>,
							the second Comptroller came with the volume of the Army Laws, and some
							Accounts of <persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">T. L. M’Kenney</persRef>, of
								<persRef ref="duval-william">Governor Duval</persRef> of Florida,
							and of the Indian Agent <persRef ref="tipton-john">Tipton</persRef>, and
							stated to me the principles of his objections to their Accounts; but I
							had not had time to read the papers relating to this Controversy, left

								ref="edwards-ogden">Ogden Edwards</persRef> to Duer, dated in

							declaring a probability that <hi rend="italic">he</hi>, would not apply

								ref="morsell-james">Morsell</persRef>, and of the <persRef

							dissuaded him from it, by saying that there was in this Country so
							little taste for Medals, that it would certainly be an unprofitable
							labour to him— He said he did not expect profit from it— But the
							Portrait was so admirable as a Representation of Old Age, that he wished
							to try the efficacy of his own Art in exhibiting the same thing. He
							would work upon it at his leisure; and without regard to or expectation
							of profit. I told him he should then have the Portrait; on condition of
							taking care that it shall receive no damage. He said he should want it
							for several months— <persRef ref="white-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="rodgers-john">Commodore Rodgers</persRef> came with
								<persRef ref="pinkney-edward">Edward Pinkney</persRef>, who is here

							He came to me to enquire if I could do any thing to save him— He has
							fallen into habits of intemperance. A young man of admirable parts; of
							quick perception, of great ingenuity and of elegant accomplishments,
							lost by this fatal propensity— I told his brother that I had done, and
							would yet do every thing for Charles that I could consistently with my
							own duties— That his place as Secretary of <pb type="ms" n="404"/>the
							Legation to Russia, had not been filled though he had been now nearly
							six months, in this Country— That he had no intention of returning to
							Russia, as he informed me that his physician had told him he would
							certainly lose his life if he should remain in that climate— That I had
							within a few days for the first time received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="middleton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Middleton</persRef>, concerning him, and speaking of him in the most
							delicate and friendly manner— That the appointment of a Secretary to
							that Mission could not be long delayed, and that the possibility of
							bestowing any other appointment upon Charles Pinkney must depend upon
							his recovering entirely from his present habits— He asked if he might
							say this to his brother— I said certainly— He might assure him that
							nothing could be done for him while he gave himself up to such
							indulgences— Edward was anxious to be authorised to give him
							encouragement in the event of his reformation— I said I could give no
							expectations unless in the event of a total change of his habits, and I
							feared they were too deeply seated— <persRef ref="roberdeau-isaac"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Roberdeau</persRef>

								ref="platt-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James

								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> took the papers
							relating to the demand of <persRef ref="greene-george">Lieutenant
								Greene</persRef> for a Court of Enquiry. I thought it should be
							granted, for which I gave my reasons. That it could not be refused
							without denying him Justice— His claim under the Circumstances seemed to
							me a demand of positive right. Considerations of delicacy must give way
							before it— But if the Report of the Court of Enquiry should be against
							him I thought he might be dismissed without a Court Martial— We had also
							conversation upon the claim of <persRef ref="clarke-satterlee">Satterlee
								Clark</persRef> to be still a District Paymaster. The Opinions of
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Oakley and <persRef
								ref="storrs-henry">Storrs</persRef> rest upon the single
							consideration of the deficiency of Evidence. Clark has nothing but the
							Letter of the <persRef ref="nourse-charles">Adjutant General C. J.
								Nourse</persRef>, informing him, by Order of the Secretary of War,
							that the President had directed he should be dismissed from the Service—
							Oakley and Storrs say that the Act of dismission could be performed only
							by the President, and must be authenticated of Record as much as the
							Commission— But defect of evidence does not warrant the negation of the
							act— And Governor Barbour observed there was ample proof of the Act, in
							the subsequent appointment of another paymaster in the place of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark— I propose to refer the Papers to
							the <persRef ref="wirt-william">Attorney General</persRef> for his
							opinion— We spoke also of the question, of the second Comptroller
								<persRef ref="cutts-richard">R. Cutts</persRef>, upon the Accounts
							of <persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">T. L. M’Kenney</persRef>, <persRef

								>Mahon</persRef>, called for my answer— I told him that after full
							deliberation I had made up my mind that I could not consistently with my
							own sense of duty comply with the request of the Petition. The offence
							was stealing from a Letter in the mail, while acting as Post-master, a
							Lottery ticket entitled to a prize of 1000 dollars; a complicated crime,
							combining theft, and a breach of confidential public trust. A crime so
							dangerous in its consequences, and to which there is so great exposure
							of temptation, that Society has scarcely any guard against it, excepting
							in the severity of the punishment. That ten years imprisonment was
							scarcely adequate to it— That the respectability of the family and
							connections of the criminal shewing only the weight of influence bearing
							in his favour, afforded no sound reason for relaxation. that the only
							consideration urged in the petition which had induced me to hesitate was
							the state of the Prisoner’s health, and the danger to his life from
							confinement. But upon mature consideration I had concluded that this
							would still not justify a pardon, unless by assuming as a principle that
							in all cases sickness should operate as a discharge from prison—a result
							which the law certainly never contemplated. This man was sentenced only
							last june— The term of his imprisonment is for ten years— The risk of
							sickness and of death in such a term must apply to all cases, and a
							discharge of this man from prison now would be almost equivalent to a
							total remission of his punishment. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell
							admitted the force of these reasons, and said he would state them as
							correctly as he was able in answering the persons from whom he had
							received the Petition. I desired him to add that I had been equally
							rigorous upon every other applications for remission of punishment upon
							convictions for this offence; and that it would have been infinitely
							more agreeable to me, if I could have complied with the prayer of the
							Petition— <persRef ref="foot-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							and the Commissioner of the General Land-Office, concerning the issuing

						<p><date>20. IV:30.</date> Sunday— Sun rose 7:11.</p>
						<p>Heard this morning <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kent</persRef>, from James 1:13. “Let no man say when he is tempted,
							I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil; neither
							tempteth he any man.” In explaining the text he observed that, the word
							rendered in our translation to tempt, is used in the new testament, and
							particularly in this Epistle of James, with two distinct significations;
							under one of which it denotes trial of any kind; and under the other,
							its proper sense the trial of seduction to Sin— The Discourse was
							argumentative, and its object was to prove that there is no excuse for
							Sin— That there is inconsistency and hypocrisy in the pretence of those
							who would palliate their evil ways by imputing them to an overruling
							necessity. That the doctrine of the total depravity of human nature
							refutes itself; inasmuch as it acknowledges a consciousness of right and
							wrong, as universal in the being whom it changes with universal
							depravity— He alledged that without this consciousness there could be no
							depravity, and referred to the principle established in Courts of
							Justice, with regard to the acts of insane persons; who could never be
							convicted of crimes— He urged with great force this consciousness of
							right and wrong; first as a demonstration that the natural character of
							man was good; and that he commits evil only by doing violence to his
							nature; and secondly that there is no excuse for Sin. That man cannot
							throw off his moral responsibility, but is and must be an accountable
							creature— This is a good moral doctrine; but there are also great and
							powerful propensities in the heart of man to evil. These are admitted
							and asserted with so much emphasis in the Scriptures, that the general
							doctrine of goodness as appertaining to human nature, is not more
							countenanced than that of total depravity— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Kent’s mind is ingenious and he is not ineloquent. The
							principal defect of his oratory is too much effort, both in
							pronunciation, and in gesture. There should be very little action in the
							reading of a written discourse— In the afternoon at the Presbyterian
							Church I heard M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>    from Luke 14.17. “And
							sent his servant at supper-time to say to them that were bidden Come;
							for all things are now ready.” This discourse was not written; and not
							much meditated— It was Calvinism, but of the most moderate and mitigated
							character. He read only part of the Chapter and of the parable, and
							commented only upon the invitation, and not upon the indignation or
							compulsion or exclusion with which it closes. The argument of the
							discourse was the application of the parable of the Supper to show the
							sufficiency of the Gospel dispensation to all the wants and purposes of
							man— Between the Services I called to see <persRef key="rush-richard"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>, who has been for
							some days confined to his chamber by indisposition. I received from him
							yesterday, enclosing one to him from his physician D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sim, advising him to withdraw from all
							attention to public business for a time, as absolutely indispensable in
							the present condition of his health. I told him that I not only
							consented to it, but added my earnest exhortations to those of <persRef
								ref="sim-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Sim</persRef> that
							he would. I received this day a Letter from <persRef

							sustain him, but was in favour of the ratification. Tazewell is however
							now absent, and it will be some time before he returns: it may therefore
							be two or three weeks, before the Senate will act definitively, upon the
							Convention— I have no reliance—either upon the good faith, or
							consistency of Tazewell; but I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell,
							there was no occasion for hurrying the decision of the Senate— He said
							that upon the North-Eastern boundary Convention the <persRef
								ref="holmes-john">Senators</persRef> from Maine had been strongly
							inclined to oppose its ratification, untill <persRef ref="chandler-john"
									>Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Chandler</persRef> was
							alarmed by the fear of his own responsibility in the event of its
							rejection— They did not venture therefore to push the opposition to that
							point; but contented themselves with voting alone against the advice to
							ratify. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell said that notwithstanding
							the friendly professions towards the Administration, he has no
							confidence in him— He will watch the signs of the Times, and will
							declare ultimately for the strongest side. Of such Summer friends I have

							with the communications received from the <persRef ref="forsyth-john"
								>Governor</persRef> of Georgia, relating to the boundary between
							that State and Florida— Part of the papers were read; as were the Act of
							Congress of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May 1826— The
							passages of <persRef ref="ellicott-andrew">Ellicott’s</persRef> Journal
							shewing the line as drawn by him and the Spanish Commissioner <persRef

								<persRef ref="randolph-thomas">T. M. Randolph</persRef> late
							Commissioner on the part of the United States, announcing the suspension
							of proceedings by him and the Georgia Commissioner, by order of the
							Governor of that State. The question discussed was whether the message
							should express any opinion; or recommend to Congress any measure; or
							should be a mere communication of the papers— The latter was thought the
							most advisable, and I struck out the general recommendation which I had
							inserted in the draft of such measures as might conciliate the rights
							and interests of the United States and of the Territory of Florida, with
							those of Georgia— <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor
								Barbour</persRef> brought with him the Treaty, recently concluded
							with the Creek Indians, ceding to the United States all the remnant of

							the House— There were among them some Letters from <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>; and question was
							made whether they should be sent with the rest— I thought not, as they

							Cherokees in Georgia have now been making a written Constitution; but
							this imperium in imperis is impracticable; and in the instances of the
							New-York Indians removed to Green Bay, and of the Cherokees, removed to
							the Territory of Arkansas, we have scarcely given them time to build
							their wigwams before we are called upon by our own people to drive them
							out again. My own opinion is that the most benevolent course towards
							them, would be to give them the rights and subject them to the duties of
							citizens as a part of our own people. But even this the People of the
							States within which they are situated will not permit— M<hi

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dupont</persRef> of Delaware
							told me he had come to give any information to the Committee on
							Manufactures that they might desire, but he appeared hurt that they had

							the object of the majority of the Committee was, to defeat any measure
							favourable to the manufacturing interest, but to manoeuvre so as to save

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler</persRef> introduced

							shew their zeal in contributing to it— Governor Barbour brought two

						<p><persRef ref="vanrensselaer-stephen">General Van Rensselae</persRef>r and
								<persRef ref="dickinson-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dickinson</persRef> called this morning to speak of the appointment
							of a District Attorney at New-York. They had heard that I was inclining
							to nominate <persRef ref="tallmadge-james">General Tallmadge</persRef>,
							and came to make representations against him— The only reason that they
							assigned was that the appointment would produce a bad political effect:
							Tallmadge as they said having lost the Confidence of all parties. I
							reminded them that within three years he had been elected by the People,
							almost unanimously, Lieutenant Governor of the State, and said the turns
							of popularity in that State were so sudden and complete that it would
							not be surprizing if within three years he should be with equal
							unanimity elected Governor— That I knew nothing that he had done to
							forfeit his popularity—that his standing as a public man was more
							distinguished than that of either of his competitors— That his
							qualifications for the Office were unquestioned, and that however
							irresolute or wavering his general political character may have been, he
							had not been so to me; as on two important and critical occasions he had
							been a decisive and most efficient friend to me— These Gentlemen did not
							reply to my reasoning, but left me quite unconvinced of its force—
								<persRef ref="livingston-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							appointment of <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Webster</persRef>, as Minister to Great-Britain on
							account of his political conduct during the late War. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sloane that I should make no nomination,
							certainly till near the close of the present Session of Congress, in the
							meantime, thanking him for this communication, I should always be glad
							to see him whenever he might incline to give me his opinions upon any
							subject of public interest— At two O’Clock <persRef ref="hall-basil"
								>Captain Basil Hall</persRef>, came with <persRef
								ref="hall-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hall</persRef>,
							and their infant daughter, <persRef ref="hall-elizabeth2"
								>Elizabeth</persRef>, two years of age— He had requested me last
							evening to permit him to bring her to see me, to which I had consented—
							Captain Hall is an Officer in the British Navy who has published an
							account of the Loo Choo Islands, and a Book of Travels in Chili and
							Peru— He is now going through the United States with the intention of
							publishing an Account of his tour— He brought me Letters of Introduction

							has left at Boston and at Philadelphia, have not been favourable, and he
							is equally unsuccessful in making friends here. <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> was
							here and spoke of the appointment of a District Attorney in New-York. He
							also told me that about thirty of the manufacturers now here from

							unexpectedly <persRef ref="niles-hezekiah">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Niles</persRef> of Baltimore rose, and in their name
							pronounced a formal address to him— There was a young man from

							Session of Congress with <persRef ref="bell-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef>, the Senator, but whom

								ref="blunt-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Blunt</persRef>

								Brent</persRef> of Louisiana, came to speak in behalf of <persRef
								ref="knight-simeon">Simeon Knight</persRef> an Ex paymaster who
							claims to be still in that capacity in the service— He had brought me
							the day before yesterday a memorial and documents in support of this
							claim— He was in the year 1820 by one order from the War Department sued
							as a defaulter, and held to Bail at New-Orleans, for 40000 dollars; and
							by another directed to come to Washington and settle his accounts— He
							could not obey the last Order, his bail and the Court at New-Orleans
							having refused him permission to come— But when the suit was finally
							tried the jury found a verdict in his favour— He then came and reported
							himself as for Service— But in the meantime by the Law of 15. May 1820
							limiting the term of service of Paymasters to four years his commission
							had expired in May 1821. and another paymaster had been appointed in his
							place— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent that the Law was
							positive, and left me no discretion in the case. He said he had told
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knight that this was his opinion, but
							he observed upon the hardship of these proceedings which had ruined
							Knight, who was one of the best officers that ever had been in the
							Service— <persRef ref="richardson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Richardson</persRef>, a member from Massachusetts came with <persRef
								ref="bates-john">J. A. Bates</persRef>, who applies for an

									>r</hi> Bell</persRef>, a Senator from New-Hampshire, shewed me
							a Letter from Pennsylvania, proposing a subscription for the purchase
							and setting up of a German Newspaper in support of the Administration;
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell enquired if I should be willing
							that my Son should contribute to this object— I told him that on a full
							consideration of the real nature of the transaction I thought it my duty
							to decline— I said that how far the employment of money to promote the
							success of the election might be proper in others was not for me to
							determine— I could only lament the necessity if it existed; but to apply
							money myself for the promotion of my own election, was I thought
							incorrect on principle; and I had invariably avoided it— Others I knew,
							were less scrupulous— It was a widely circulated, and I had no doubt
							well-founded belief, that <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt
								Clinton</persRef> in 1812. had incurred expenses to promote his
							election as President of the United States which have crippled him with
							debt to this hour, and from which he will never be extricated. He paid
							not only for newspapers; but for agent-emissaries, and even for
							itinerant preachers— I had been solicited to do the same thing and
							declined—not from pecuniary considerations, but because I could not
							approve the thing— <persRef ref="dorsey-clement">M<hi rend="superscript"

							printing and supply of Stationary to <persRef ref="binns-john">J.

								ref="rogerson-asa">Rogerson</persRef> the Collector at Elizabeth
							City for a marine hospital there— It has much the aspect of a job— A

							Key-West, which had been taken by an English public vessel, from a
							Spanish Slave-trader, and run ashore within our jurisdiction— There is a
							complaint from the Captain of the British vessel, against the <persRef

							Counter complaint of the Collector against him. I have no doubt it will
							prove a troublesome affair.— I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							still more likely, if I should give him the written order that he
							desired. That his undertaking was not at my request, as he knew I had
							rather dissuaded him from it; convinced that in a Country where there is
							no taste for medals, he could not expect to be paid for his labour on

							Baker</persRef>—who preached from the floor, and took for his text the
							dying words of the <persRef ref="payson-edward">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Payson</persRef> of Portland, an account of whose death he said he
							had just been reading. They were from Hebrews 12.22.23. “I am going,[”]
							said D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Payson, “to mount Sion, and unto the
							City of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable
							company of Angels,— to the general assembly and Church of the first
							born, which are written in Heaven; and to God the judge of all, and to
							the spirits of just man made perfect.” This Sermon was on the same
							Subject as that of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wiswall in the
							morning, but it was treated in a different manner— The first was
							argumentative, to prove the fact—the last was hortatory to secure the
							enjoyment— What the condition of our future existence will be, or where;
							or how has not been revealed, and is yet incomprehensible— That it will
							be reason and revelation concur to shew— <persRef ref="everett-edward"

								Cutts</persRef> called this morning to speak of the Accounts of
								<persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. L.
								M’Kenney</persRef>, on his last Indian Missions— While he was here
							the Secretary of War came in; and we examined the subject all together—
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barbour</persRef> had passed the Accounts of M’Kenney I believe
							inadvertently, and Cutts declined passing it without vouchers—. The
							allowance was very reasonable, but much of the expense of presents to
							Indians and for travelling was of a nature not to admit of regular
							vouchers— There was a balance standing against M’Kenney upon the Books
							of one of the Auditors of the Treasury of about 2159. dollars; but he
							alledges a larger balance upon the books of another Auditor, in his
							favour, from which it may be set off— I finally proposed that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> M’Kenney should state a regular account
							specifying the charges for presents to the Indians, the charge for
							travel and the allowance to himself. The question in this case was of
							some difficulty— The Secretary of War had passed a lumping Account of
							M’Kenney’s— The <persRef ref="anderson-joseph">Comptroller</persRef>
							calls for vouchers. M’Kenney insists that the Secretary has an absolute
							controul over the appropriation for contingencies, both in the
							application of the fund, and the Settlement of Accounts— Governor
							Barbour appears to entertain the same opinion; but I incline to think
							the Comptroller is in principle correct— <persRef ref="southard-samuel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> called, with
							a plan of an Island opposite the Navy Yard at Pensacola, covered with
							live Oak, a part of which is public property; but there are 1600 Acres
							of it belonging to <persRef ref="white-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> White</persRef> the Delegate from Florida, <persRef
								ref="brackenridge-henry">judge Brackenridge</persRef>, and another
							person— It is offered for sale upon reasonable terms, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard had thought the authority to
							purchase such Lands had been given by the Act of the last Session, for
							the gradual improvement of the Navy: but on examining the Act he found
							it was not— He had partly agreed upon the terms of purchase with judge
							Brackenridge and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White when he discovered
							his want of authority— He thought it very desirable that the purchase
							should be made, and I advised him to see <persRef ref="hayne-robert"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hayne</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="hoffman-michael">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hoffman</persRef>, the Chairmen of the naval Committees of the two
							Houses of Congress, and to propose to them to pass an Act giving the
							necessary authority— <persRef ref="peters-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Peters</persRef> came, and introduced
							his friend <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jennings</persRef> of Philadelphia. <persRef ref="furst-moritz"
								>Moritz Furst</persRef> came twice, and again earnestly solicited
							the loan of <persRef ref="adams-john">my fathers</persRef> Portrait, for
							the purpose of engraving from it the die for a medal— I finally
							consented that he should have it, and took his receipt for it. Had it
							safely packed in a box, and sent by <persRef ref="giusta-antoine"
								>Antoine</persRef> to his lodgings. <persRef ref="knight-simeon"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knight</persRef> the
							ex-paymaster came for my decision upon his memorial and claim; and I
							told him that the Law was imperative: and his commission had expired in
							four years from its date: that is in May 1821. He then asked, if I could
							not nominate him to the Senate for a new appointment: and I told him I
							would consider of it in the event of a vacancy; assuring him that my own
							disposition towards him was altogether favourable— <persRef ref="u"
								>Tryon</persRef> was a pedlar of Almanacs, religious tracts, and
							popular pamphlets, of whom I took <persRef ref="taylor-jeremy">Jeremy
								Taylor’s</persRef> life of Christ and a couple of Almanacs. <persRef

								Jones</persRef> introduced <persRef ref="dearborn-greenleaf">Captain
								Dearborn</persRef> of the army; who has some complaint to make about

								ref="smith-walter2">Lieutenant Walter Smith</persRef> setting forth
							a similar grievance— <persRef ref="clarke-satterlee">Satterlee
								Clark</persRef> also brought me his memorial to which I told him I

							and <persRef ref="storrs-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							could not have happened unless he had been previously displaced—

							nothing in recommendation of the appointment. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Radcliff was old and needy, and the office would doubtless

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Forbes had not so far as I knew, any
							intention of resigning his place— I spoke to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Sanford of the appointment of District Attorney at New-York
							and told him I had finally concluded to nominate <persRef
								ref="duer-john">John Duer</persRef>— He spoke of him as being
							perfectly well qualified; but said the nomination was made—leaving me to
							infer, that if it had not been made he should have thought another

							political effect of the appointment might be. The only objection against
							Duer is old federalism— <persRef ref="buchanan-james2">M<hi

								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, published
							by <persRef ref="hill-isaac">Isaac Hill</persRef>, Editor of a Newspaper
							in New-Hampshire. It is that while in Russia, I attempted to make use of
							a beautiful girl to seduce the passions of the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef>, and sway him to
							political purposes— This is a new form of Slander—one of the thousand
							malicious lies which outvenom all the worms of <persRef
								ref="niles-hezekiah">Nile</persRef>, and are circulated in every
							part of the Country, in newspapers and pamphlets. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett the incident upon which this tale
							was raised. That when we went to Russia, a very beautiful girl, a native
							of Boston named <persRef ref="godfrey-martha">Martha Godfrey</persRef>
							went with us, as Chambermaid to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef> and nurse to our Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> then a child two years old. Soon after our
							arrival at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg Martha wrote a
							Letter perhaps to <persRef ref="u">her mother</persRef>, relating
							Stories that she had heard there of the Emperor’s amours and
							gallantries. This Letter having been sent to the Post-Office, was
							according to the custom there opened, and sent as a curiosity to the
							Emperor, who was diverted with it and shewed it to the <persRef
								ref="elizabeth-alexeievna">Empress</persRef>— They both felt a
							curiosity to see the girls who had written this Letter; and some of the
							Ladies of the Court who had visited M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Adams having seen Charles, with his nurse, had spoken to the Empress of
							both in such manner as still further to excite her curiosity— The
							Empress had a Sister then living with her, the <persRef
								ref="katharine-amalie">Princess Amelia</persRef> of Baden— She
							expressed a wish to see Charles, and he was sent one morning to her
							Apartment in the Palace— Martha his Nurse went with him; and while they
							were in the Princess’s Apartment, the Emperor and Empress both went
							there, and passed perhaps ten minutes in talking to the child, and at
							the same time they had an opportunity of seeing the Nurse, whose Letter
							had afforded them some amusement— It is from this trivial incident, that
							this base imputation has been trumped up— There never was any other
							foundation for it— Martha Godfrey was a girl of irreproachable conduct—
							She returned to the United States with <persRef
								key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

							said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bates had not been informed of this

							of the line of other business; and I said that I should in the event of
							a vacancy do for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bates what I could,

								ref="sergeant-john">J. Sergeant</persRef> member of the House from

							for several days, upon resolutions offered by a new member from Kentucky
							named <persRef ref="chilton-thomas">Chilton</persRef>. This man after
							two trials was elected by a majority of forty or fifty votes, upon the
							strength of declamations at the stump against the wasteful extravagance
							of the Government, with promises that if elected, he would undertake a
							reform. Accordingly within a week after taking his Seat, he offered his
							Resolutions; first declaring the necessity of retrenchment; to save
							money for paying off the public debt—and secondly proposing reductions
							of expenditure, not only in the executive Departments, but in the
							Contingencies of the two Houses of Congress, and in the pay of the
							members— This movement has disconcerted the party, to which Chilton
							belongs, by bringing up for discussion general charges of abusive
							applications of public monies, not only by the Executive, but by the two
							Houses of Congress; not only by the present, but by past
							Administrations— Their project had been to point this battery
							exclusively at this Administration, upon some such charge as 50 dollars

								<persRef ref="ingham-samuel">Samuel D. Ingham</persRef> of

							all general investigations, they have asserted and insinuated, every <pb

							Huntington having then been called upon for his defence, by two
							successive Letters in March and April solicited allowance of time and
							promised a defence, proving perjury upon his accusers— Since which he
							has not been heard from. I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent

							unless his defence should be immediately forwarded, I should proceed to
							act on his case upon the documents before me— <persRef
