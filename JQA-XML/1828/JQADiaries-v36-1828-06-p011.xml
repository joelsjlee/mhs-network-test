						<p>I sent for <persRef ref="bomford-george">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Bomford</persRef> to speak with him of a man named
								<persRef ref="copeland-thomas">Copeland</persRef>, who was employed
							at the armoury at Harper’s ferry, and was dismissed for making frivolous
							and groundless charges against the <persRef ref="stubblefield-james"
								>Superintendent</persRef>. He is now applying to me for other
							employment, and I sent to Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Bomford to
							enquire into the circumstances of his case. He said he had since his
							dismission employed him occasionally, and would again if opportunity
							should occur— But he was a bad tempered man, and he could not give him a
							permanent appointment because there was nobody in the public service
							willing to be associated with him. Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Bomford promised me some white mulberry-trees of which he has many from
							the seeds sown in the Summer of 1826— <persRef ref="jones-roger"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jones</persRef> the Adjutant
							General, brought over the Letter of <persRef ref="scott-winfield"
								>General Scott</persRef> to him, asking a leave of absence from his
							command for 20 days, and the answer— Scott’s Letter is private, and asks
							not a furlough to be announced in general orders, but this short leave
							of absence, which by order of the Secretary of War was granted. I told
								Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jones, that I must ask for copies
							of both the Letters, because I should now limit the time of General
							Scott’s leave of absence, and it was therefore necessary to authenticate
							the time and manner of his obtaining it— General Scott was pursuing such
							a course that I thought it probable these Letters would all be
							published— He asked his leave of absence to visit his family who were
							about to embark for France— I told Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Jones that he might inform General Scott that I had required a copy of
							his Letter asking for the leave of absence— <persRef ref="foy-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Foy</persRef> came to complain of
								<persRef ref="elgar-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Elgar</persRef> the Commissioner of the Public buildings, who
							proposes to reduce the width both of the border and of the gravel walk
							within the railing of the Capitol Square on the western side; which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Foy thinks will have a bad effect on the
							whole enclosure— He thinks M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elgar
							encroaches upon his domains and calls for my interposition. He spoke
							also of work to be done at the yard of this house; and I promised to see
							and advise with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elgar— <persRef
								ref="porter-peter">General Porter</persRef> came with <persRef
								ref="delafield-joseph">Major Delafield</persRef>, and spoke of the
							disingenuous proceeding of <persRef ref="barclay-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Barclay</persRef> the British
							Commissioner under the seventh Article of the Treaty of Ghent— Major
							Delafield undertook with my assent to draw up a statement in reply to
							that part of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barclay’s Report— It appears
							that both parties have abandoned <persRef ref="mitchell-john"
								>Mitchell’s</persRef> Map which is acknowledged to be incorrect of
							the topography of those regions— The adjourned Cabinet Meeting was held
							at one. Present <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Rush</persRef>, General Porter, and <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef>— General Porter had the draft of a Letter in
							answer to the last from General Scott— It varied a little, as we thought
							with improvement upon that which was proposed yesterday— In refusing the
							furlough which he asks till next April, it states that the reasons which
							he assigns for asking it are conclusive against its being granted— And
							adds that as the Order from the War Department granting him leave of
							absence was not limited in time, I had thought proper to fix the 25<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July next as the term, and that I
							expected he would by that day have returned and resumed the Command of
							the Western division of the army. One or two slight modifications were
							necessary, which were pointed out; and with them <pb type="ms" n="12"
							/>General Porter is to despatch the Letter this Evening— After the
							Meeting was over I had much conversation with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rush upon the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, and with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard upon the proposed exploring
							Expedition. The By-Laws of the Corporation have been reported and
							adopted, and the Salary of the Officers is fixed— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush thought they might have dispensed
							with a Treasurer; but that was not agreed to. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard said he believed <persRef ref="wadsworth-alexander"
								>Captain Wadsworth</persRef> would decline taking the command of the
							Expedition—and he was perplexed to find a substitute for him. There was
							much and I hope not useless discussion of various topics connected with
							the fitting out of the expedition— I visited the Garden before Riding
							and the Nursery afterwards with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Foy— The
							unknown trees are a Cane, A Button wood, a Plum, of peculiar character,
							and several grape-vines. The Evening was extremely sultry, and
							afterwards a rain gust with winds from the East.</p>

						<p>There was a heavy shower of Rain in the Night, and this morning was fresh
							and cool. I swam 15 minutes in the Potowmac from the Rock, and rode to
							the Eastern branch Bridge; whence I returned round the Capitol Square in
							29 minutes— I infer the distance 3 1/4 miles— The Sun came out soon
							after breakfast, and the heat for the remainder of the day and Evening
							was intense— <persRef ref="bainbridge-theodore">Theodore
								Bainbridge</persRef> newly appointed a Lieutenant in the Marine
							Corps, called, having just arrived to report himself to the <persRef
								ref="henderson-archibald">Commandant</persRef> of the Corps.
								<persRef ref="mercer-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mercer</persRef> introduced a <persRef ref="harrison-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> William B Harrison</persRef>, a
							revolutionary Officer residing in his District, who now solicits the
							appointment of keeper of the Penitentiary—an Officer not yet established
							by Law. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harrison brought sundry
							recommendations and a printed Statement of his own dated at Soldier’s
							Repose, of all the Battles and Sieges of the Revolutionary War in which
							he bore a part. He has been familiar with the Penitentiaries of two or
							three of the States, and he thinks that the appointment of a
							Superintendent of the one now building here would be expedient now,
							though not yet provided for by Law. <persRef ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Watkins</persRef> told me there was an
							appointment of a Postmaster to be made at Maysville, Kentucky— That it
							was an exceedingly important Office, and unless care should be taken he
							was afraid the <persRef ref="mclean-john2">Postmaster General</persRef>
							would appoint an inveterate enemy to the administration— <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef>
							the Mayor of the City read me a Letter from <persRef ref="cutts-charles"
								>Charles Cutts</persRef> late Secretary to the Senate stating his
							desperate condition, and intreating his influence to obtain for him the
							appointment of Navy Agent at Portsmouth— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gales said the place was not suited to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cutts; but that if <persRef ref="decatur-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Decatur</persRef> now the Navy Store-keeper could be
							appointed Agent, Cutts would be well-suited to take his place as
							Store-keeper— Gales said that Cutts’s removal from the Office of
							Secretary to the Senate, was a trick of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>Van Buren’s</persRef>, and that he was a better Secretary than the
								<persRef ref="lowrie-walter">one</persRef> they have now— I said
							there had been some unfortunate rumours respecting the habits of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutts— Gales said there had been some
							foundation for them; but that for two years before his displacement from
							the Senate, he had reformed. This day there was a great public dinner
							given by the Citizens of Georgetown to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Mercer to which I was invited; but on the established usage declined
							attending. <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S. Adams</persRef>
							painted my Seedling pot N. 1. with the Tamarind, and Persimon growing in
							it— The seed lobes of the Tamarind, have this day fallen from the tree,
							now just one month up. They had shrunk up almost to nothing— I planted
							one Persimon seed and 1. Yard Cherry Stone in Box N. 4. and 1. Persimon
							seed at the Centre of Pot N. 5 surrounded by a Circle of dry Strawberry
							seeds.</p>

								Southard</persRef> brought several recommendations in favour of
								<persRef ref="long-george2">George Long</persRef> as Navy Agent at
							Portsmouth New-Hampshire— He said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Long
							himself was here, and had sundry good reasons for claiming the
							preference for himself. But as I had given the direction for the
							appointment of <persRef ref="sherburne-john2">J. N. Sherburne</persRef>
							before M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Long’s claim appeared, I saw no
							sufficient cause for changing that determination— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard proposed to employ <persRef
								ref="reynolds-jeremiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Reynolds</persRef>, to visit Nantucket before the exploring
							expedition shall be fitted out, to obtain there and report all the
							preliminary information which can be acquired from the Navigators of
							that place who have frequented the Southern Ocean in whaling ships, and
							which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard expects will be
							considerable and very useful. To this I agreed. The expense to be
							defrayed in the first instance from the Contingent fund of the Navy
							Department; but I advised that an Account should be opened with the
							Expedition to which ultimately every expense incident to it should be
							charged, so that those which may be incurred before the next Session of
							Congress, may be included in the estimates for the ensuing year—
								<persRef ref="wyer-edward">Edward Wyer</persRef> brought me some
							<unclear>Pacane</unclear> Nuts, which he said must be sowed the next Month, which I
							suppose is a mistake. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Long brought me a
							Letter of Introduction from <persRef ref="gorham-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> B. Gorham</persRef>, the member of
							Congress from Boston. He set forth all his claims to the Navy Agency at
							Portsmouth— His father was a distinguished member of Congress during and
							after our Revolution. He himself was an Officer in the army through the
							whole Revolutionary War—and an owner of privateers during the last War
							with Great-Britain— He had also something to say against M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sherburne— I told him I hoped some
							occasion might occur hereafter, when I should have it in my power to
							serve him— <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brent</persRef> was here with a draft of a Letter from him to
								<persRef ref="rodney-thomas">T. M. Rodney</persRef>, commercial
							Agent at the Havanna, but now at Wilmington Delaware. I suggested some
							modification of the Letter, with which is to be enclosed a copy of an
							anonymous Letter to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef>, containing charges against Rodney— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent brought also several Recommendations
							of a <persRef ref="owen-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Owen</persRef>, for the appointment of Commercial at Principe in the
							Island of Cuba; to whom I directed that a Commission should issue.
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> La Vergne</persRef>
							of Louisiana was here. His Negotiation for a Loan at New-York, for the
							use of a Bank at New-Orleans has failed, by disagreement about the
							terms—but he has been advised to make the experiment at London, and is
							about to embark for England— His companion young <persRef ref="u"
								>Villeré</persRef> became homesick and returned to New-Orleans— I
							sent for <persRef ref="elgar-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Elgar</persRef>, and spoke to him of <persRef ref="foy-john"
								>Foy’s</persRef> complaint, of Elgar’s intended contraction of the
							border and gravel walk round the enclosed iron railing, on the West side
							of the Capitol— Elgar mentioned to me his reasons for this contraction,
							which I thought not sufficient. He asked me to take at some time a view
							of the spot which I promised I would do— He said <persRef
								ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rufus King</persRef>
							whose gardener Foy had been, and at whose recommendation he had been
							employed here had given him a high character as a Gardener, in every
							respect, except in the laying out of grounds. In that, he followed the
							fashion of a century back, without knowledge of modern improvements— I
							said he had laid out my Nursery much to my satisfaction; and I thought
							had a competent knowledge to lay out any grounds upon a small Scale— I
							visited the garden this morning— Planted in the Eastern seedling bed 1.
							Row of 36 whole Honey Cherries— Of this experiment I shall not witness
							the result— My last years pot raised Apple-tree at the North-east corner
							of the garden, after a check upon its vegetation of about 20 days and
							putting out four lateral twigs is now shooting up again—and is 22 inches
							tall. One apple of this years growth in the Eastern Seedling bed is 18
							inches high, also taking a second shoot after a check— Tallest plum tree
							31 inches. Peach 29. <pb type="ms" n="14"/>In a box in the garden, where
							about the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May I planted 2 date
							Stones, and I forget what else, not minuted, I see a plant up this
							morning, but know not what it is—nor does <persRef ref="ousley-john"
								>Ouseley</persRef>. The white mustard seed in the bed is 3 feet high
							and in full blossom. That in Box N. 5 is not half that size but one of
							its plants has blossomed—four small fawn coloured Petals—Tetrandria
							Monogynia— The Shagbark planted in Pot N. 2 has come up— I planted in
							Pot N. 5 round the Peach tree 13. fresh Orange-seeds— I had the Cherries
							picked from the bearing tree in the yard, to be sure of productive
							Stones. Visited the Nursery. No new Cork Oaks since the 16<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi>— Trespassing Cattle had been along the
							whole South border—trampled down several trees, and crop’d off the tops
							of others, especially some flourishing peaches Evening intensely
							warm—yet I wrote.</p>

							would open to a blossom— The unknown plant in the box unchanged since
							yesterday— The Coffee seeds unfolding into leaves, looking sickly— In

							planted 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> June, under the white Mustard
							seed, which shades it. The orange comes up, pointed like a pin almost
							white, which shoots up in two or three quick vegetating days like the
							present from half an inch to an inch and a half quite straight—turns to
							a deep green, opens at the point and spreads out two Circular or oval
							seed leaves, spoon-formed, from which shoots out a long Orange-leaf
							proper— There oftentimes come up two stems, one shorter than the other,
							from the same seed— The difference in the rapidity of growth of plants
							of the same kind is a puzzle. I rode this morning to the rock— Thence
							went in the boat to the channel of the river—plunged in, swam 15 minutes
							and returned to the Rock. Rode to the Capitol. Found <persRef
								ref="foy-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Foy</persRef> at his

							west side of the Capitol, and saw that as now making they were too
							narrow— After breakfast <persRef ref="porter-peter">General
								Porter</persRef> called with a long Letter from <persRef
								ref="radcliff-jacob">Jacob Radcliff</persRef> of New-York
							recommending a secret Negotiation for a commercial Treaty with the

							They said they proposed to go from Georgetown in Steam-boats to the

							six O’Clock in the Morning, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales

							was the theme, with an occasional admission of the necessity also of
							good works— The composition and the delivery of this person were very
							good; making allowance for a certain dogmatism, natural enough to the
							minister of an infallible Church. The sermon was argumentative, but the
							statement of the adversary argument was somewhat contemptuous and
							scornful— Another Priest read the prayers and took the communion— Part
							of the Music performed was <persRef ref="watts-isaac">Watts’s</persRef>
								100<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm. In the Evening, at the
							Unitarian Church I heard <persRef ref="brooks-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks</persRef>, from Matthew 6.10.
							“Thy kingdom come”— There was a meekness in the manner of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks which contrasted with the
							peremptory tone of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harold— The weather
							was sultry through the day, with occasional thunder and fresh
							breezes—one sudden and terrific thunder bolt fell near the house;
							perhaps in the river. There appeared in Seedling box N. 4. Tangier
							Oranges 6. 7. 8 planted 15 May— a 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> in Pot
							N. 4. planted 3. June, and 2. Oranges in Tumbler N. 4. planted the 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month—since which this is only
							the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> day— This must be nearly the
							shortest possible time for the shoot to appear from an orange seed—to
							which the midsummer <unclear>heat</unclear>, the frequent watering, and the lodging of
							the seed barely beneath the surface of the ground, all contributed.
							Fresh orange seeds are the easiest of plants to raise; and besides those
							that I have lost by drowning, there are now near twenty up in my Pots
							and boxes, all of which have appeared since the 12<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of this Month— There appears this afternoon in seedling
							Box N. 4. a whitish shoot pointed like a Sail Needle— I think it one of
							the date Stones, planted 15. May— As for Cherries Apricots, Plums,
							Strawberries, Raspberries, Currants, Gooseberries and all the small
							seeded fruits, I begin to despair of ever raising them in Pots or boxes.
							The Apple and Peach grow in the garden beds, about twice as fast as they
							do in Pots. The white Mustard seed in the garden bed is two feet and a
							half high, in full blossom and going to seed— That in my box N. 5 is
							none higher than a foot, just beginning to blossom, and the stems all so
							weak at the root that they cannot stand straight—perhaps because I left
							the seeds on the surface of the ground to take root of themselves— The
							quantity of water to be supplied from day to day to the plants in the
							pots and boxes is a perplexity— When to shelter them from the Sun is
							another.</p>

						<p>The eighth day in succession of my river baths— I rode to the rock; swam
							15 Minutes, and then rode to the Navy-yard— Overtaken by a shower, near
							the Capitol, and took shelter under one of the Arches— Found <persRef
								ref="persico-luigi">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Persico</persRef>
							the Italian Sculptor there; and went up to view his work at the
							Pediment, of which I furnished him the design— He is now upon the last
							figure—Hope; and thus far his execution is very satisfactory— His Eagle
							had been indifferent in the drawing; better, but not good in the model—
							In the work itself, it is the pouncing bird— He called my attention to
							the anchor, and said I had told him the anchor of his model was a dutch
							Anchor. He had therefore gone to <persRef ref="tingey-thomas">Commodore
								Tingey</persRef> and taken for his model a true Anchor of a Ship of
							War— And now said he, whenever a Sailor looks at this Pediment, he will
							say, how exact the Anchor is! He said he should paint the Scales in the
							hand of Justice white. They must be painted to prevent their taking the
							rain, making verdigrease and dropping it upon the Stone figures. He says
							he expects to finish the work in about two Months— <persRef
								ref="macomb-david">Judge Macomb</persRef> of Florida, was here, to

								>Alexander Macomb</persRef>, father of the <persRef

							passed at the last Session of Congress might be detained at the
							Treasury—for satisfaction of a claim which he judge Macomb has in right
							of his father, against old Alexander Macomb’s Estate. He said an
							injunction had issued from the Circuit Court to the Secretary of the
							Treasury, not to make the payment, but <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> had told him he should
							disregard the injunction— Judge Macomb that his only resource for
							recovering any part of his claim, was to obtain it from this grant; and
							asked my interposition with the Secretary of the Treasury— I promised to
							converse with him concerning it— <persRef ref="thomas-unknown4">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Thomas</persRef> the late appointed Suttler was here, with gossiping talk of an
							hour and a half— <persRef ref="porter-peter">General Porter</persRef>
							came and introduced an old man named <persRef ref="u">Stewart</persRef>,
							from the Western part of New-York, a Revolutionary Officer who served
							through the whole War, and who took the opportunity of the grant made to
							him at the last Session of Congress, to pay a visit to the City—
								<persRef ref="stewart-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Andrew
								Stewart</persRef> the member of the House of Representatives from
							Pennsylvania, likewise called— He has been chosen one of the Directors
							of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, and comes to attend their
							Meetings. <persRef ref="delafield-joseph">Major Delafield</persRef>
							called to take leave and brought back General Porter’s Report upon his
							difference with the British Commissioner on the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Article of the Treaty of Ghent— He spoke again of the
							necessity of a reply to the disingenuous misrepresentations of <persRef
								ref="barclay-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barclay’s</persRef> Report, and said he would prepare it on his
							return to New-York. He also offered his services for any further public
							employment to which he may be deemed competent. <persRef
								ref="bouligny-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bouligny</persRef> the Senator from Louisiana, brought several
							Letters recommending a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brainard</persRef> for the recently vacated office of Surveyor of
							the Port of New-Orleans; and he requested that the appointment might be
							deferred for a few days to give time for all the candidates to present
							their respective claims— I received shortly before dinner a note from
								<persRef ref="ringgold-tench">Marshal Ringgold</persRef> with a
							Letter from <persRef ref="skinner-john">J. S. Skinner</persRef>, the
							Postmaster at Baltimore, informing him that <persRef key="monroe-james"

							with me in the Evening, and promised to dine with me to-morrow. He has

								Monroe</persRef> with her daughter <persRef ref="monroe-maria">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Gouverneur</persRef> near New-York,
							where she is to pass the Summer. We conversed upon indifferent topics,
							and upon European Politics; without touching upon the present state of
							our own affairs, or the convulsive agitation of the public mind, at the
							approach of the Presidential election— He is going to attend a Meeting
							of the Visitors of the University of Virginia. <pb type="ms" n="17"/>I
							planted 12. Orange seeds in Tumbler N. 2. adding to it a little fresh
							earth— It is the same where a Tamarind, two grapes and 9 Oranges, after
							promising vegetation all successively died of dropsy. One of the two
							Oranges which came up yesterday in Tumbler N. 4. died this day from the
							same cause. A 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Tangier Orange came up in
							Box N. 4. A first in Pot N. 3. planted 3. June—a 3<hi rend="superscript"
