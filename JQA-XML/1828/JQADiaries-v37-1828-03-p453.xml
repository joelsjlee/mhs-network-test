								Thompson</persRef>, a member of the House of Representatives from

								<persRef ref="u">Brook</persRef>; the other, I did not retain— M<hi

							says he does not expect to recover— <persRef ref="robertson-j">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Robertson</persRef> the Collector at

								Allen</persRef> of Florida, with a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bull</persRef> of Ohio. One of the
							members from Tennessee, perhaps <persRef ref="blair-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Blair</persRef>, introduced a man from
							that State, by the name of <persRef ref="u">Green</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="archer-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Archer</persRef>, member of the House from Virginia, came to speak of
							the appointment of Major General, and of his friend and constituent
								<persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef>— He said that
							although younger than the General, he had been his Schoolmate and was
							his friend— He had felt it due to him, to enquire whether any measure on
							the part of his friends would be necessary to present the merits of his
							claim to promotion— I said that for the present, there would not— That
								<persRef ref="gaines-edmund">General Gaines</persRef> had been here
							in person to urge his claims. I had told him, that if I should
							ultimately come to decide between him, and General Scott, I should not
							make up my mind against the Latter, without giving him the same
							opportunity of representing his claims, personally or in writing— But
							there were other competitors for the Office; in and out of the Army—and
							there were propositions before both Houses of Congress for abolishing
							the place altogether— Until they should be disposed of, I should make no
							nomination; and if the Office should be retained, the question will not
							be decided without long discussion, nor within time to deprive General
							Scott of the opportunity to say all that he may wish in support of his
							own pretensions— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Archer said he had
							expected this would be my course and was satisfied with it. <persRef
								ref="whittlesey-elisha">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whittlesey</persRef>, a member of the House from Ohio, came to
							enquire concerning the case of <persRef ref="eaton-r">Robert
								Eaton</persRef>, an old petitioner for the remission of penalty; but
							the papers relating to it could not immediately be found. <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> called and spoke of
							his Report to the House of Representatives, in answer to a call,
							concerning the appointment of Cadets—from which it appears that <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							while Secretary of War had made appointments not only for the year
							1825—all to take effect after he left the Department; but for the years
							1826, 1827, and one for the year 1828. and this is the president of the
							Senate, who declines calling to order a drunken ribald, of a member, for
							want of authority, and the political puritan, who proposes to the deaf
							and dumb, to define the distinction between power and right. I asked
							Governor Barbour about the pettish Resolution offered yesterday by
								<persRef ref="wickliffe-charles">Wickliffe</persRef>, to the House.
							He said that the papers called for by the Resolution of 19. December
							1826 had been all prepared, and ready to be sent as long since as the
							close of the last Session of Congress— But that from inadvertence the
							Resolution had not been recollected at this Session, and that was the
							only reason why they had not been sent— <persRef ref="cutts-richard"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutts</persRef> the second
							Comptroller called with a budget of Accounts, of Indian Agents, which he
							thought exceptionable— There was one particularly of <persRef
								ref="crowell-john">John Crowell</persRef>, the Agent with the
							Creeks, in which were numerous and somewhat heavy charges, all
							recommended for allowance by <persRef ref="mckenney-thomas"
								>M’Kenney</persRef>; but which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutts
							thought inadmissible, and which Cutts said were not warranted by any
							usage. He repeatedly stated that these Indian contingencies were the
							only accounts upon which the Administration would be vulnerable; and
							they would be so, if M’Kenney should be allowed his range unchecked— He
							was traceable every-where, and no where responsible— I disliked myself
							the appearance of the charges to which he objected advised him to remain
							firm to his duty; and requested him to make out in writing a Statement
							of all the points upon which he thought a controul of the expenditures
							was necessary. He promised that he would. <persRef ref="harbison-massy"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Massy Harbison</persRef>,
							announced herself as the widow of a <persRef ref="harbison-john"
								>Soldier</persRef> in <persRef ref="stclair-arthur">General S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Clair’s</persRef> army, when he was
							defeated by the Indians in November 1791— She has published a small book
							containing an account of her sufferings from Indian captivity after that
							Disaster, and the murder by the Savages of two of her infant children
							before her face— She said her husband had a pension, from <pb type="ms"
								n="454"/>the United States, till his death, a few years since, and
							that she had come here with the hope of obtaining some assistance from
							the Government, or at least some aid from individuals by the sale of her
							book— She had a wish to see <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs </hi>Adams</persRef>, who was now too
							unwell to receive her; but who I said if she would call again some day
							next week, would if well enough, gladly see her— <persRef
								ref="hull-isaac">Commodore Hull</persRef> was also here—he came from
							Philadelphia with <persRef ref="allen-h">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								H. Allen</persRef>, and having now a project to go and pass a year
							or two in Europe, hinted to me a wish to be employed by the Government
							to visit the naval Arsenals there.</p>

						<p><date>2. VI:15.</date> Sunday— Rain.</p>
						<p>Heavy Rain, continued almost the whole day— I attended the morning
							service at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church. <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read prayers for the Second Sunday in Lent. The Sermon was preached by
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Aisquith</persRef>
							from near Annapolis— The text was from John 3:16. “For God so loved the
							world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
							him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” What is the meaning
							of the term <hi rend="italic">loved</hi>, as an attribute of God,
							towards the World?— What is the world, as here used? If God loved the
							World, was the gift of his only begotten Son, the only way in which that
							Love could be manifested? what is the precise idea conveyed by the terms
							only begotten Son, as applied to God? How could belief in the Son of God
							save the believer from perishing, and confer upon him everlasting life?
							These are hidden mysteries buried under this text, to the explanation of
							which the Preacher did not approach— Life is enjoyment—animated
							existence is a gift of God, demonstrating his goodness—intellectual life
							given to man is a yet choicer blessing, granted on this planet to man
							alone— Everlasting life is the perpetuation of this blessing; and how
							that shall be effected in the mystery revealed in the Scriptures:
							imperfectly disclosed however to the imperfect understanding of man— We
							now see it as through a glass darkly—but then face to face— Existence
							itself and duration, are incomprehensible things. That they should be
							everlasting is not more unintelligible than that it should be— Matter
							undergoes perpetual mutation but is never destroyed—why not the same of
							mind? It is in the gospel that we must seek for proofs of our
							immortality— “Even so, come, Lord Jesus.”— These words from Revelations
							22.20. formed the text of the afternoon discourse, which I heard from a
							Stranger at <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker’s</persRef>. They are with the exception of the Salutation the
							closing words of the New Testament, and of the Bible, and the comment
							upon them was ingenious, solemn and affecting. The preacher drew the
							partition of his Sermon from the various considerations under which the
							coming of the Lord Jesus is desirable— The day was without interruption;
							but I did not occupy it so industriously as I should have done, even in
							meditations upon my own Condition, and in seeking the things that belong
							to my own peace and Salvation— Spent the greater part of the Evening in
							the chamber of <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>,
							who is yet very feeble, and scarce able to leave her bed—</p>

								ref="richardville-john">John B. Richardville</persRef>, and one from

							had seen these before, and told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones I
							did not like them— The Art itself though superior to that of engraving
							upon wood is essentially inferior to that of engraving upon Copper
							plate— But of these Portraits the originals, painted from Doggett, were
							not in Stuart’s best manner. The engravings were made after copies,
							taken by I know not whom—made in France; with a gloss of the mannerism
							of inferior French Artists, and they have metamorphosed, the five grave

								<persRef ref="parris-albion">Parris</persRef>, relating to the

							Agents, of whom <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> shall be one, and the other a Citizen
							of Maine— They persist in pressing <persRef ref="preble-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Preble</persRef>, though objectionable
							by his hostility to the present Administration—and they object
							decisively to <persRef ref="holmes-john">J. Holmes</persRef> whom I had
							mentioned— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had told them, that I
							would assent to any person upon whom the delegations from Maine and
							Massachusetts; or even the Senators from those two States should agree—
							I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, that since I had last seen
							him, a person whom I believed to be the very best man in the State for
							the Office had been recommended to me, by <persRef ref="winthrop-thomas"
								>Lieutenant Governor Winthrop</persRef> of Massachusetts, and by the
							late Senator <persRef ref="lloyd-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								James Lloyd</persRef>, and through them by <persRef
								ref="williams-reuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Reuel
								Williams</persRef> of Maine— I meant <persRef ref="bridge-james"
								>James Bridge</persRef> of Augusta, one of my oldest, and in early
							life, most intimate friends. I had indeed almost lost sight of him for
							near forty years, but know that by his talents, his information, and the
							course of his life he must be peculiarly fitted for this particular
							service— And if he would accept the place there was not an individual in
							the State, in whose able and faithful performance of its duties I should
							place more implicit confidence— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							observed that he had a long Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin, who was willing to be employed in this Agency, but wished it
							might be established by Law; which I thought also necessary. I advised
							that the measure should be proposed, either by General Chandler in the
							Senate or by <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Everett</persRef>, as Chairman of the Committee of
							Foreign Relations in the House— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay left
							with me for my perusal, a Letter from <persRef ref="todd-charles">C. S.
								Todd</persRef> to him, mentioning the opinions of his late father,
							the <persRef ref="todd-thomas">judge</persRef>, and his father in Law,

							Presidential election, and also of conversations between M<hi

							the Summer before the election came on— Also a copy of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clays own Letter to <persRef
								ref="blair-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Blair</persRef>,
							dated 8. January 1825, which at the late inquisition, before the Senate
							of Kentucky, Blair refused to produce; and from which Letter he says
							they have pretended that the bargain would be proved— And a Copy of the
							Letter which he has written to <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">W.
								H. Crawford</persRef>, in answer to one lately received from him. He
							spoke also of the answer he had prepared to a Letter from the Chairman
							of the Committee upon the Expenditures of the Department of State, which
								<persRef ref="watkins-george">George Watkins</persRef> afterwards
							brought me from the Department, and which I read— It refers to two

						<p>This day commencing the last year of my public Service was clear and

							from the Department of State the two Statements of its contingent
							expenses, which I had requested yesterday— <persRef ref="smith-william2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef>, a Senator from
							South-Carolina, introduced a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Levy</persRef> from that State, but now from New York— I
							had yesterday received a Letter recommendatory of him from <persRef
								ref="sullivan-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Sullivan</persRef> to which he referred— <persRef key="clay-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> was here, and I
							returned to him the Letters he had left with me for my perusal— He asked
							my opinion with regard to the publication of his Letter to <persRef
								ref="blair-john">Blair</persRef>, which I thought might be
							expedient, though it is precisely one of those Letters, the production
							of which is so justly and severely reprobated in the divine Philippic of
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>— It is dated the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> of January 1825 the day before his
							interview with me at my house, when he declared to me his determination
							to vote for me at the approaching election—and seven days after <persRef
								ref="letcher-robert">Letcher</persRef> had explicitly informed me
							that such would be the vote of the majority of the Kentucky Delegation—
							The Letter is written as he says with too much levity— The criticism to
							which it is liable is that its object was to impress his friend with an
							elevated idea of his own importance— He represents the <hi rend="italic"
								>friends</hi>, of all three of the Candidates; then before the
							house, as courting him with great anxiety, and he represents mine as
							addressing him with tears in their eyes— This was meant by him only as a
							joke, upon my infirmity of a watery eye; but malignity will give it a
							construction, as if intended to insinuate that in these overtures of my
							friends I myself participated— If this was his suspicion, he will be
							abundantly punished by that which will befall himself by the publication
							of the Letter— It is indeed insinuation of suspicion, perhaps not
							unnatural in the situation which he then held: but utterly without
							foundation. No friend of him had ever been authorized by me to avow the
							slightest wish that he should vote for me; but his friend Letcher had
							seven days before explicitly told me that the majority of the Kentucky
							Delegation were irrevocably determined to vote for me— The tendency of
							the Letter will not be to remove the unjust suspicions, which malice and
							political profligacy have cast upon him, but it will give them no
							confirmative proof, and the suppression of the Letter, would pass for
							proof with all those disposed so to receive it— The publication of the
							Letter will be the best because the frankest course; but it will prove
							nothing except the treachery of the friend to whom it was written. The
							divulging of private and confidential Letters is one of the worst
							features of electioneering practices among us—Though often tempted and
							provoked to it, I have constantly refrained from it. <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Proud</persRef> and <persRef

						<p><persRef ref="elliot-s">Elliot</persRef> is a Son of <persRef

							Letter of Introduction to <persRef ref="leslie-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Leslie</persRef> the Painter— <persRef

								</hi>Southard</persRef> came to converse with me concerning
							despatches received from <persRef ref="kearney-lawrence">Captain
								Kearney</persRef>, commanding the Sloop of War, Warren in the
							Mediterranean, who he said had been taking measures of great energy for
							the suppression of Pirates among the Greek Islands: and some of his
							proceedings bore a resemblance rather strong to the descent of <persRef
								ref="porter-david">Commodore Porter</persRef> upon the Island of
							Porto-Rico— I had not received the papers, and although they were
							afterwards brought to me— I had not this day time to read them— <persRef
								ref="rodgers-john">Commodore Rodgers</persRef> brought me a Letter
							to him from <persRef ref="offley-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Offley</persRef> our Consul at Smyrna— It is in somewhat of a
							querrulous tone, manifesting a high sense of his own influence with the
							Turkish Government: with hard intimations, that all our commerce with
							Turkey has for many years been carried on through his influence, and
							that he has never received for it any thanks— He says his services have
							never been either approved or disapproved— Speaks with bitter contempt
							of the Greeks, whom he represents as a mere Nest of Pirates; and with
							severe ridicule of the contributions levied in this Country to sustain
							the Greek cause. He insinuates that if he were duly authorised, he could
							conclude a favourable Treaty for us at Constantinople, in a very few
							days. I told Commodore Rodgers while thanking him for the perusal of the
							Letter, that the prejudice in favour of the Greeks, in this Country, was
							so warm, that even the attempt to negotiate with the Turks would meet
							with censure— To effect any thing at this time would be impossible—
							Rodgers himself, and all the commanders of our armed vessels in the
							Mediterranean have great abhorrence and contempt for the Greeks— Rodgers
							told me that he believed the <persRef ref="pasha-ibrahim">Capitan
								Pacha</persRef>, with whom he had conferred was now the Grand
							Vizier, and I had seen in the Newspapers, that the Commander of the
							Turkish Squadron, at Navarin, had been appointed Capudan Pacha— <persRef

							Sons I believe of the <persRef ref="pringle-james">Collector</persRef>
							at that place— I had received advice from Charleston of their intended
							journey to this place, and of the suspicions that they were coming upon
							political purposes— <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Rush</persRef> was here with Sunday papers, from the

							in Rhode-Island— He spoke also of the Letters from Mess<hi

								>Madison</persRef> and <persRef key="monroe-james">Monroe</persRef>,
							declining to stand as Candidates to serve as Electors of President and
							Vice President, at the next Election. He thought the Letter of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, would be liable to be criticised—
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> brought me a
							printed proclamation of <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Governor
								Forsyth</persRef> of Georgia, declaring the jurisdiction of the
							State to be extended over the lands now occupied by the Cherokee Tribe
							of Indians— <persRef ref="lowrie-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowrie</persRef>, the Secretary of the Senate, brought me two
							Resolutions of that Body, one confirming three nominations, and the
							other not advising and consenting to the Ratification of the Treaty
							which I had sent to them at the last Session between the Seneca Indians,
							and certain Citizens of the State of New-York— <persRef
								ref="barrell-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barrell</persRef> came and had some conversation with me upon the
							subject of his Report, and of the Message with which I communicated it
							to the Senate. He thinks it cannot be contested that the Madawaska
							Settlement was within the territorial jurisdiction of the Province of
							New-Brunswick— We had this Evening our seventh Drawing Room for the
							Season— Company numerous, but the rooms less crowded than they have
							sometimes been— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef>
							went down, but was so unwell that before the evening was half over she
							was obliged to leave the company and return to her chamber— I spoke to
								<persRef ref="sprague-peleg">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sprague</persRef> of Maine about the appointment of an Agent, a
							Citizen of Maine, to join with <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> to arrange and
							prepare the evidence to be laid before the arbitrator upon the boundary
							question— I told him that <persRef ref="bridge-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bridge</persRef> had been recommended
							to me for that appointment, and that I inclined strongly in his favour—
							He seemed much more favourable to <persRef ref="preble-william">Judge

								>Bird</persRef>— <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> brought a bundle of
							additional despatches received from the Mediterranean for my perusal. I
							had this morning read those he had left with me before— The Grecian
							Islands have again become the resort and the receptacles of Pirates as
							from time immemorial they have been, whenever the condition of the
							neighbouring Continents has been convulsed— The robberies are now
							committed under the Greek or the Ionian flag. The Commissions are sold
							at a low price— The system of Piracy is organized under a single leader,
							and is perpetrated in large boats called Trattos. The Pirates skulk from
							Island to Island in that Archipelago. A boat is fitted out in one
							Island; the plunder is carried to another, thence exported to a third,
							and is sold in open Market even at Smyrna— <persRef
								ref="kearney-lawrence">Captain Kearney</persRef> retook parts of
							Cargoes, Sails and rigging, robbed from several American and from one
							Austrian Vessel; took and destroyed several piratical boats, blew up the
							house of the principal Pirate on the Island of Andros, and at Mycom
							threatened to fire upon the town if they did not deliver up some of the
							Pirates, and of their booty— His demand was addressed to the Governor
							and Primates of the Island. Who they were does not appear, and there is
							no answer from them, but persons styling themselves Vice-Consuls of
							France, England, and Sardinia, sent Kearney a remonstrance against his
							threat to fire upon the town, and he did not carry it into execution.
							But His officers landed from a boat, and took several of the Pirates in
							the woods, and one was sent off to him by the inhabitants— It appears
							that upon these Islands, there is no regular and responsible Government,
							and that those summary measures of Kearney may have been warranted by
							necessity— They require however deliberate consideration— I returned to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard the papers of <persRef
								ref="freeman-william">Captain W. H. Freeman</persRef> of the Marines
							claiming brevet promotion for gallant conduct in the action with the
							West-India Pirates in 1822, when <persRef ref="allen-william2"
								>Lieutenant Allen</persRef> was killed. The claim is also fortified
							by attestations of Freeman’s good conduct on board the frigate
							Constitution upon Two Occasions during the late War with Great-Britain—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard however is of opinion that
							the whole does not constitute a sufficient claim for a brevet. I
							requested him to make me a written report upon the case, and also upon
							that of <persRef ref="anderson-william2">Major Anderson</persRef>, who
							has a similar claim— I sleep on the bergere—</p>

								O’Sullivan</persRef> came to tell me the tale of her distresses; and
							the pressure of her pecuniary wants— A loan of a few hundred dollars
							would relieve her from much embarrassment, and she would doubtless be
							able in six or nine months to repay it— Her rich wardrobe had been
							seized and sold for almost nothing in Kentucky; and since she saw me
							last, her lodgings at Baltimore had been broken into, by a sheriff and
							her furniture sacrificed to pay trifling debts. She shewed me a Letter
							from <persRef ref="coale-e">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Coale</persRef> of Baltimore mentioning these facts to her; and
							advising her if she could pay her debts to return to that place— I asked

							New-Orleans— Ut cum ratione insanias—reasoning madness, seems to be the
							misfortune of this woman— Her case deserves compassion, but it scarcely
							is possible to render service to her— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r </hi>Lowe</persRef> had sent me a number of
							Letters recommending him for the appointment of Clerk in the
							Post-Office— He came now to solicit my influence with the <persRef
								ref="mclean-john2">Postmaster General</persRef> in obtaining it, in
							the event of the passage of a Bill now before Congress, authorising the
							appointment of several additional Clerks in that Department. He said the
							Postmaster General had told him the President had earnestly recommended
							some person to him, and that the President’s recommendation must be
							decisive— I told him he must have mistaken the Postmaster General, for I
							did not recollect that I had ever recommended any person to him for a
							Clerk’s appointment. He said it was while <persRef key="monroe-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef> was President—
							I declined interfering and he took back his papers. <persRef
								ref="fitch-stephen">Stephen Fitch</persRef> a man having the
							appearance and manners of a quaker, came and told me that he had come
							hither with <persRef ref="redjacket">Red Jacket</persRef>, and two
							others of the New-York Seneca and Oneida Indians: to complain of wrongs,
							in regard to the purchase of their Lands— That he himself had been
							extremely anxious to see me; and although he had been advised not to
							come, and told that I should probably not receive him, he had yet
							determined to make the experiment, and Red Jacket was equally desirous
							to see his father the President. I told him that I had been glad to see
							him, and would with equal pleasure— But that any complaint or
							representation that they had to make with regard to the Lands must be to
							the Department of War— I had this day sent to the Senate Message N. 23.
							with all the papers addressed directly to me, relating to these
							complaints of the New-York Indians— I sent them in answer to a
							Resolution of the Senate, requesting all the papers, relating to the
							Treaty made by <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Governor Cass</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">T. L. M’Kenney</persRef>, of the
							Butte des Morts, last Summer, with the Winnebago and Menominie Indians,
							which is now before the Senate— The direct access to the President, in
							all their transactions with this Government, and especially in the
							representation of all their grievances, they take greatly to heart: and
							with much more reason than the white hunters—that is office hunters—
							This access I have never denied to any one of colour; and in my opinion
							of the duties of a Chief-Magistrate of the United States it ought never
							to be denied— The place-hunters were not pleasant visitors or
							correspondents and they consume an enormous disproportion of time— To
							this personal importunity the President ought not to be subjected; but
							it is perhaps not possible to relieve him from it, without seducing the
							man from the intercourse of the people more than comports with the
							nature of our Institutions. <persRef ref="patterson-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> William Patterson</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="lorman-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lorman</persRef> of Baltimore, came as a deputation from their great
							Railroad Company—with a Letter from the President, <persRef
								ref="thomas-philip">Thomas</persRef>, requesting that the Engineers
							in the service of the United States who have already been employed as
							assistants in their preliminary surveys, might be directed to continue
							with them— I told them I was entirely disposed to comply with their
							request, but referred them to the <persRef ref="barbour-james">Secretary
								of War</persRef>— <persRef ref="clark-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clark</persRef>, a member of the House from Kentucky
							called and spoke of the approaching Elections in Kentucky— That of
							Governor and for the Legislature of the State, will be in August, and
							its issue will be decisive of the result of the subsequent choice of
							Electors of President and Vice-President which will take place in
							November— He said there was a Pamphlet written by <persRef
								ref="ingham-samuel">Samuel D. Ingham</persRef>, against me, printed
							here at the commencement of this Session of Congress, and of which many
							thousand copies <pb type="ms" n="460"/>had been sent by members of
							Congress franked into Kentucky and all the Western Country. He thought
							it related to my old accounts— And he asked me, if I could not find time
							to write an answer to it, which might be circulated in like manner— I
							told him that the pamphlet was not upon my accounts, but another <hi
								rend="italic">Slander</hi>, representing me as a monarchist— That it
							was a publication by a Jackson-electioneering Committee at Philadelphia—
							That it had been answered by <persRef ref="roberts-jonathan">Jonathan

								Seymour</persRef> the Senator from Vermont introduced a young man,
							from Port Tobacco in Maryland, named <persRef ref="u">Davis</persRef>,

							Seymour asked me if there was any prospect of a new diplomatic
							appointment abroad for <persRef ref="allen-heman2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Heman Allen</persRef>. I told him
							there was no Mission of the Rank of Minister Plenipotentiary to which I
							could appoint him for the present— <persRef ref="watkins-george">George

							from <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, upon the subject
							of his agency in relation to the North-eastern boundary arbitration;
							which I approved— <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Brent</persRef> was here twice—the first time, with a
							Letter from <persRef ref="walsh-charles">Charles Walsh</persRef> of
							Baltimore, repeating an old application for a diplomatic appointment— He
							now wishes for that of Charge d’Affaires to the Republic of Colombia, in
							the place of <persRef ref="watts-beaufort">Beaufort T. Watts</persRef>
							who is returning home— The second was with a speech which <persRef
								ref="campino-joaquin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Campino</persRef>, the Minister from Chili proposed to deliver to
							me, on his presentation, with a translation— In that interval <persRef
								ref="smith-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef>,
							member of the Senate from South-Carolina came <pb type="ms" n="461"/>and
							introduced a young man, named <persRef ref="u">Thomas</persRef>, as a
							nephew of the late <persRef ref="gaillard-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r </hi>John Gaillard</persRef>. He has however not been in

								>Bartholomew Wistar</persRef> and <persRef ref="battle-samuel"
								>Samuel Bettle</persRef> are two Quaker companions of <persRef
								ref="robson-elizabeth">Elizabeth Robson</persRef>, the female
							preacher, from England. They came to inform me that they had obtained
							permission for her to preach to-morrow in the Hall of the House of
							Representatives, and to request my attendance— About two O’Clock M<hi
								rend="superscript">r </hi>Clay came and presented to me Don Joaquin
							Campino, who delivered his Letter of Credence as Minister Extraordinary
							and Plenipotentiary from the Republic of Chili— He addressed me in very
							few words in Spanish, which were explained to me, by his interpreter—and
							which comprized only a small part of the Speech which he had delivered
							in writing— The Speech was complimentary to the United States, and
							personally to me, expressing the grateful acknowledgment of the Chilian
							Government that the United States had been the first power which had
							recognized the Independence of Chile, and to send them a Minister— In
							return it observed that he was the first Minister ever sent by Chili to
							a foreign power—apologised for the delay of this reciprocation—expressed
							the satisfaction of his Government with the conduct of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Allen, during his residence among them,
							and also with that of <persRef ref="larned-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Larned</persRef> now the Charge
							d’Affaires—it finally expressed the earnest wish of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Campino that while residing here, he might
							be instrumental in cementing the friendly relations between the two
							Governments. I answered briefly every part of his speech as if he had
							delivered it first expressing my regret at not being able to speak to
							him in his own language, I desired his interpreter to say that the
							People and Government of the United States had witnessed with deep and
							constant sympathy the arduous struggle of the People of Chili for
							National Independence. They had taken pleasure in being the first among
							the Nations to recognize that event, and in sending the first diplomatic
							Mission, which had ever been received in Chili— I desired him, in
							writing to his Government to say that I had learnt with the highest
							satisfaction that our late Minister, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Allen, had so conducted himself during his residence as to have secured
							the approbation of the Chilian Government; and that our present Chargé
							d’Affaires M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Larned had also made himself
							acceptable, as I hoped and trusted he would continue to do— For the
							Sentiments of personal respects, and kindness, tendered from the
								<persRef ref="pinto-francisco">President of Chili</persRef>, to
							myself, I requested him to say that I received them with much
							sensibility and with a cordial and reciprocal return— I joined also very
							sincerely in the wish of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Campino, that
							his Mission might contribute to improve the intercourse and friendly
							relations between the two Countries— That his reception and treatment
							here, might render his residence among us as agreeable as possible, and
							that on finally returning home, he might carry with him an opinion of
							our Country still more favourable than that with which he had come— The
								<persRef ref="perez-jose">Secretary of Legation</persRef> as well as
							the interpreter came with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Campino. The
							Audience was over in ten minutes; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay remained with me a short time after the Minister and his Legation
							had withdrawn— He mentioned a new Candidate for the Office of
								Treasurer—<persRef ref="savage-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Savage</persRef>, now the Chief Justice of New-York— The motives
							suggested for this appointment are political; and one of them is to
							prepare for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Savages being brought forward
							as the Candidate for the Office of Governor of New-York— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r </hi>Clay spoke also of the Mission to England,
							and named <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef>, <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor
								Barbour</persRef> and <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef>, as persons perhaps
							inclined to accept it— In fitness for the Office M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Webster stands pre-eminent— The political considerations at
							the present moment are unfavourable to his appointment— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said that if Governor Barbour should
							be appointed he would certainly not remain more than a year or two in
							England; and he thought it would be best, if M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Webster would postpone his pretensions for that time; but
							that after what had passed, if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster
							should insist upon it, he thought he should be appointed— <persRef
								ref="whittlesey-elisha">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whittlesey</persRef>, a member of the House of Representatives from
							Ohio, introduced a young man from the State of New-York, by the name of
								<persRef ref="u">Taylor</persRef>— <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef> of Massachusetts came
							and passed a couple of hours with me this Evening: His object was to
							make a proposition, in the first instance not very distinctly disclosed,
							but which I chose immediately to understand, and to meet in a manner
							altogether explicit. He ultimately informed me that it had been
							suggested to him by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster— He said that
							the Election of Governor, and of the Legislature of Kentucky would take
							place next August— That the great and decisive struggle of the <pb
								type="ms" n="462"/>parties would be at that election, which would
							decide the fate of the subsequent election of electors of President and
							Vice-President, in November. These Electors, by a recent act of the
							Legislature, are to be chosen by a general ticket throughout the State—
							Immense exertions are making by the opposition party to carry this
							Election of August— They spend much money, and there is an indispensable
							necessity of concentrating them in the same manner— Now M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey’s question to me was whether I had
							a sum from five to ten thousand dollars, that I was disposed to give,
							without enquiring how it would be disposed of, but which would be
							employed, to secure the Election of <persRef ref="metcalfe-thomas"
								>General Metcalfe</persRef> as Governor of Kentucky next August— I
							answered that there was a sentiment, expressed first by the late
								<persRef ref="lowndes-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowndes</persRef>—much repeated since, by <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> and his friends
							though not practiced upon by them, but hitherto invariably observed by
							me; that the Presidency of the United States was an office neither to be
							sought nor declined— To pay money for securing it directly or
							indirectly, was in my opinion incorrect in principle— This was my first
							and decisive reason, for declining such a contribution— A second reason
							was that I could not even command a sum of five thousand dollars,
							without involving myself in debt for it— And a third was that if I once
							departed from the principle, and gave money, there was no rule either of
							expediency or of morality, which would enable me to limit the amount of
							expenditure which I ought to in cur— I could certainly appropriate half
							a million dollars to the same object without transcending any Law, and
							with as much propriety as I could devote 5000 to the election of a
							Governor of Kentucky— M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Bailey seemed
							surprized to hear that I could not raise five thousand dollars without
							borrowing—and said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster had told him,
							I had a large sum, fifty or sixty thousand dollars lying dead, in a Bank
							at Boston— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baily candidly the
							state of my affairs— That the expenses of my family, and the support of
							my three Sons now absorb very nearly the whole of my public Salary— That
							all my real Estate in Quincy and Boston is mortgaged for the payment of
							my debts— That the income of my whole private Estate, is less than 6000
							dollars a year, and that I am paying at least 2000 of that for interest
							upon my debt. Finally that upon going out of Office in one year from
							this time, destitute of all means of acquiring property, it will only be
							by the sacrifice of that which I now possess that I shall be able to
							support my family— I note as a remarkable incident this proposition to
							me to contribute five or ten thousand dollars to carry the election of a
							Governor and Legislature of Kentucky— The mode of expenditure is by the
							circulation of newspapers, pamphlets and hand-bills— It is practiced by
							all parties, and its tendency is to render elections altogether venal.
							The coincidence of <persRef ref="clark-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clark’s</persRef> proposal that I should write a
							pamphlet in answer to <persRef ref="ingham-samuel">Ingham’s</persRef>
							Slanders about my Accounts, with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s
							opinion that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster if he insists upon
							it should be appointed to the Mission of Great Britain, and with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster’s proposal that I should spent
							five or ten thousand dollars upon the election of a Governor of
							Kentucky, is perhaps all accidental; but in the operations of parties
							objects of great dissimilarity to each other are often connected by
							imperceptible links together.</p>

						<list>
							<item>Sergeant— John</item>
						</list>
						<p>I heard <persRef ref="robson-elizabeth">Elizabeth Robson</persRef> preach
							at the Capitol, in the Hall of the House of Representatives— Her text
							was Ephesians 5–1. “Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear Children.
							2. And walk in Love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given
							himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling
							savour.” She repeated these words without announcing in what book of
							Scripture they were, but said they had occurred to her reflections while
							she was sitting there— This implies that she had waited for the
							outpourings of the Spirit for the extemporaneous suggestion of a text—
							That she had taken no thought of what she should say— Yet she discoursed
							without interval or hesitation for about an hour upon those words— This
							power of unpremeditated speech is neither very rare nor very valuable;
							but is of great use to those who possess it— In Elizabeth Robson it
							consists in the faculty of stringing together a succession of passages
							from Scripture, principally from <persRef ref="paul">Paul’s</persRef>
							Epistles, which she has committed to memory, and through which her
							discourse <pb type="ms" n="463"/>runs like a line of peck thread through
							a row of pearls. Her manner is earnest and affectionate, and the tone of
							her voice falls into cantation— Her eloquence and Genius are not of so
							high an order as those of <persRef ref="livermore-harriet">Harriet
								Livermore</persRef>, but she more cautiously avoids giving offence
							to her hearers. When she had finished her Sermon and sat down, a great
							part of the auditory thought she had finished, and were going away; one
							of her male companions however gave notice that the services were not
							concluded, and asked indulgence for a short and quiet pause—after which
							she kneeled and made a very fervent prayer, and then her friend
							signified that the meeting might separate— After I returned home,
								<persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sergeant</persRef> called and passed an hour with me— In the
							afternoon I heard at the Presbyterian Church <persRef ref="baker-daniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>, from
							Revelations 20.1. “And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the
							key of the bottomless pit, and a great chain in his hand. 2. And he laid
							hold on the dragon, that old Serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and
							bound him a thousand years. 3. And cast him into the bottomless pit, and
							shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the Nations
							no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled; and after that he
							must be loosed a little season. 4. And I saw thrones, and they sat down
							upon them: and judgement was given unto them—and I saw the souls of them
							that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God,
							and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had
							received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they
							lived and reigned with Christ, a thousand years.”— This was a sermon
							upon the Millennium, in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker’s liveliest
							manner— He began by explaining as well as he could what the millennium
							meant—and detailed the opinions of the Commentators as to the time when
							it is to commence— Observed that some thought it would begin in the year
							1866. others, and he believed more correctly 150 years later— He gave an
							animated description of the Millennium, a time when there will be much
							more and much better preaching than at present, better hearers, more
							prayer meetings, more revivals of religion, and generally a much better
							condition of Society. But that which in the goodness of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker’s Nature, seemed to delight him most
							was a conclusion to which the hopes of the Millennium have brought him,
							that an overwhelming majority of the human race will finally be saved—a
							theme not so congenial to the harsh calvinistic doctrines of the
							Presbyterians— Bakers heart is always ready to escape from them— There
							was this Evening the shock of an Earthquake—the first which I ever
							distinctly noticed at the moment when it happened— I was writing in this
							book, when the table began to shake under my hand, and the floor under
							my feet. The window shutters rattled, as if shaken by the wind and there
							was a momentary sensation as of the heaving of a ship on the waves— It
							continued about two minutes and then ceased— It was about eleven at
							Night— I immediately left writing, and went to my bed chamber, where
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> was in bed,
							much alarmed; having felt the shock, without knowing what it was— It had
							no further consequences.</p>

							and received them this Evening— I had this day so little interruption of

							Reform, published by himself a pamphlet, with Notes— It is like all his

							came about nine O’Clock, upon which I immediately withdrew— <persRef

							the second Comptroller came after breakfast with a number of papers—
							Among them was a draft of a circular Letter that he has prepared to all
							the Indian Agents, enclosing to them extracts from the Laws relating to
							the Settlement of Accounts— They Direct that the Settlement of them all
							shall be at the Treasury— Cutts had directed the Indian Agents to
							transmit their Accounts to the second Auditor, and had stated to them
							that they were not authorised to transmit them to the War Department— I
							advised him to strike out that paragraph, from his Letter; one of the
							Acts of Congress expressly authorising the Heads of Departments to
							require from the subordinate Officers such returns as they may think
							proper— He said he would strike out that paragraph— I advised him also
							to submit the Letter to the inspection of the Secretary of War before he
							should send it—which he promised he would— He shewed me also several
							Accounts of Officers, commanding at Posts—charging considerable sums for
							medical attendance upon their families. He spoke of this as an abuse
							that was creeping in, and growing to a head— I requested him to allow of
							no such innovations, and told him I would sustain him in refuting them.

							Chiefs and Head men of a part of the Tribe of Miami Indians—to be laid

								>Professor Mansfield</persRef> who resigns asking a furlough till
							the first of August, and his resignation to take effect then— Also two
							Applications from Indians, for my approbation of Sales of Lands reserved

							Resolution of the House of Representatives, upon the Cherokee
							Constitution, but his Report relating to it not yet prepared— <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Rush</persRef>
							brought me several papers from the Treasury Department— One concerning a
							charge of malversation, against the <persRef ref="gilman-samuel2"
								>Collector of the Customs</persRef> at Castine— This was a Letter
							from the persons who had made the charge, retracting it—not indeed very
							graciously; for after acknowledging that they had been shewn by the
							Collector proof of the correctness of his conduct in the transaction,
							which they had denounced as fraudulent, they insinuate that they
							withdrew the charge rather for want of evidence than from belief that it
								<pb type="ms" n="466"/>was not well-founded. I mentioned to M<hi

							against the <persRef ref="shaw-jonathan">Register</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="perry-andrew">Receiver</persRef> at Sparta, Alabama which are
							now before me, and the impression they have made upon my mind, together
							with other Circumstances, that a very vigilant eye is needed somewhere
							to watch over the entire administration of our Land-laws. I asked him if
							he had noticed that there was now a Bill in passage before Congress
							repealing the Law that requires the annual examination of the
							Land-Offices— He said he thought this repeal, would leave a
							discretionary power to have the examinations made, whenever the
							President might think proper, and that it would thus be more
							advantageous than the annual examinations for which the Officers might
							always take care to be prepared— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush
							spoke also of the donation of a Township of Land in Florida, to the
							Kentucky Deaf and dumb Asylum, and of a contest upon the construction of

							against a Court-Martial consisting of some of the most distinguished

							Jacket himself and other Chiefs of the Nation, against the late Sales of

							is an old man— I should suppose him about sixty— I told him that I was
							glad to see him—and to hear his talk. That I wished him to make known to
							me all his complaints— That after hearing them, I would reflect upon
							them, and consider them; and if I should find them just, and it should
							be in my power to remove them I would do so— He made me a Speech after
							the Indian fashion which Henry Johnson interpreted— He said he thanked
							the <pb type="ms" n="467"/>Great Spirit, for having prospered his
							Journey, so that he could now see and speak with his great father the
							President— That his concern was about the Lands that belonged to the
							Seneca Nation in the State of New-York—that fraudulent means had been
							used to obtain from some of the chiefs the late Cession of their Lands,
							and their consent to remove out of the State of New-York; to which he
							and other chiefs were greatly averse. He particularly desired that if
							they could not succeed in their wishes to a greater extent they might at
							least be suffered to remain in possession of the Tonnewanda Lands— He
							left with me a plan of the Tonnewanda Creek, on which was marked a
							reservation of 12800 Acres— I told him I would examine his papers, and
							asked him to call on me again after a few days— <persRef ref="wool-john"
								>General Wool</persRef> was here for two purposes— One to object,
							which he did very earnestly against a recent order from the War
							Department by which a number of the Officers who have been engaged in
							the Surveys, and engineering service, are ordered to their Regiment, and
							to the School of Artillery practice— Wool spoke in very disparaging
							terms of this School; where he said the Officers would and could learn
							nothing— And he said that for the Survey’s, many of the Officers who
							would now be ordered upon them would be incompetent to the service— and
							so indeed would all in comparison with those, who have been already been
							long engaged upon it— His second purpose was to recommend his own claims
							to the appointment of Brigadier General, in the Event that the
							appointment of a Major General, should by making way for one of the
							Brigadiers, leave a vacancy of that rank to be filled— <persRef
								ref="robinson-jeremy">Jeremy Robinson</persRef> came, and occupied
							about an hour in renewing his old claims of compensation for Services in
							Chili and Peru, and his Solicitations for further and new Employment—
							Three years since I had actually appointed him with the sanction of the
							Senate, and signed his Commission as Consul at Rio de Janeiro— Earnest
							remonstrances against this appointment, upon charges affecting his
							integrity induced me first to withhold and then to revoke that
							Commission— He returns to the charge two or three times every year,
							always smooth-tongued and regardless of rebuffs— <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> sent me the proceedings of the Court Martial upon

								>r</hi> Southard says there is another Charge against him of
							perjury— I spoke of the case of the ex-midshipman F. Green, who had been
							with him this morning, and to whom he told me that he had said much the
							same as I had— <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> called and spoke of a confidential despatch received
							from <persRef ref="everett-alexander">A. H. Everett</persRef> in
							Spain—which gave him some uneasiness also of a Treaty of Limits which
								<persRef ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poinsett</persRef> has concluded at Mexico— He likewise mentioned a
							Note in reply to one from <persRef ref="vaughan-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r </hi>Vaughan</persRef>, concerning the
							disturbances on our North-eastern boundary— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay told me that since Saturday he had a conversation with
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> respecting the Mission to Great-Britain— That M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster somewhat earnestly desired it,
							being forty-six years of age, and if to go abroad at-all, wishing not to
							postpone it until altogether past the prime of life— But as <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef>, who is very anxious
							to go upon the same Mission would certainly not stay more than one or
							two years, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster is quite willing to
							postpone his pretensions to the appointment for that time— I asked M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay if he had thought of any person to
							supply the place of Governor Barbour in the Administration— He named
								<persRef ref="porter-peter">General P. B. Porter</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="spencer-ambrose">Ambrose Spencer</persRef>— One of
							those two, and he thought no other— The Mission to England is probably
							now desired both by Governor Barbour and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Webster, and also by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, as a harbour
							from the Storm— I cannot blame them— The majority of the people in their
							respective States, are inveterately opposed to the Administration: and
							there is scarcely any condition so mortifying as that of being in a
							minority at home— I read this Evening three passages in <persRef
								ref="milton-john">Milton’s</persRef> Paradise regained, and wrote
							some observations upon them to my Son <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef>, who had noticed them in his last Letter— I made
							an effort also to read some pages in <persRef ref="hyde-edward"
								>Clarendon’s</persRef> History, but found the time failing me so
							that I was obliged to give it up— Two days ago, I omitted to mention
							that <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									rend="superscript">r </hi>William Ironside</persRef>, a Son of

							the Department of State— He wishes for a similar appointment— Another

						<p><date>16. V:45.</date> Sunday.</p>
						<p>Heard this Morning at the Unitarian Church <persRef ref="blanchard-ira"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Blanchard</persRef>, a new
							Candidate, from Romans 12.3. “For I say through the grace given unto me
							to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than
							he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to
							every man the measure of faith.”— The subject of the Sermon was
							humility— And it was a well written dissertation temperately delivered;
							but without any thing remarkable either in the matter or manner. In the
							afternoon I attended at the Presbyterian Church, and heard <persRef
								ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>
							from Matthew 22.40. [“]On these two commandments hang all the Laws and
							the prophets.” This was a fervent exhortation to Christian Love and
							Charity— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker has a sufficient command
							of words, and although he preaches without notes, never falters or
							hesitates in his discourse— But his choice of language is scanty and
							without force or elegance, and the warmth and earnestness of his manner,
							contrasts with the poverty of his imagination— In the course of his
							Sermon he gave notice that he should preach at this house, probably for
							the last time next Sunday— That he had accepted an invitation to settle
							at Savannah in Georgia, to which place he should remove— He intreated
							his hearers to believe that he had not acted on this matter
							precipitately, but, that the proposal had been before him and under his
							consideration upwards of two Months. He prayed with great unction that
							the Spirit of Love and Concord might abound and prevail in the Society;
							and that the Lord would shortly send them another Pastor <pb type="ms"
								n="470"/>after his own heart— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker
							had mentioned to me last Summer the probability that he should ere long
							remove from this City— After a long interval without news from Europe,
							as not unfrequently happens, at this Season, of the year we had this day
							advices for a full month from the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of
							January to the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February from
							London— Ministerial Revolutions have happened both in France and
							England— I was without interruption from visitors this whole day; but an
							interruption of another kind, absorbed my time— A Letter from my Son
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, contained an
							extract from an Epistle of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>
							to <persRef ref="lentulus-publius">Lentulus</persRef>, to the moral
							principle of which Charles takes exception— I first sought the Epistle,
							and found it ad Diversos 1.9. Then in <persRef ref="melmoth-william"
								>Melmoth’s</persRef> Translation where it is 2.17. and read both the
							original and the Translation— It is the vindication of his conduct upon
							the first triumvirate of <persRef ref="pompey">Pompey</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="crassus-marcus">Crassus</persRef>: a long and deeply
							interesting Letter— Strongly marked with the character of the writer’s
							mind, and probably intended as his defence before the tribunal of
							posterity of his own course on a most critical and difficult period in
							the history of his Life.</p>

								>General Scott</persRef>— <persRef ref="thomas-jesse">M<hi

							Illinois came, and conversed with me upon the State of Affairs in

							be done to conciliate <persRef ref="pope-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> John Pope</persRef>, who he said had a very great regard
							for me— I said I would do anything just and honourable to conciliate
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Pope, but that he had of late
							used singular means to manifest his regard for me— He was a member of
							the Senate of Kentucky; and that body had recently with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r </hi>Pope’s full assent constituted itself into
							a Court of inquisition to try me, upon a charge of corruption, and sent
							for persons and papers; inviting ex parte depositions and garbled
							statements, where the parties inculpated could have no opportunity to be
							heard, and where the testimony given and the testimony suppressed was
							alike adapted to promote groundless slander. <pb type="ms" n="471"
							/>Thomas told me that he himself intended at the close of his present
							term of service to decline a re-election to the Senate, and to remove
							into the State of Ohio— That he had now separated himself entirely from
							his colleague <persRef ref="kane-elias">Kane</persRef>, who he was
							satisfied was an insincere man— That he should in future oppose him, and
							would prostrate him, though with great reluctance, for Kane was indebted
							to him and to his friends for all that he was— Thomas spoke also of
								<persRef ref="edwards-ninian">Governor Edwards</persRef> of
							Illinois; as doubtful whether for or against the Administration— As far
							however as he could ascertain, favourable. <persRef ref="baker-daniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef> the Minister
							came to inform me of his intended removal to Savannah, and to make
							proposals for the arrangement of his concerns with me to which I readily
							agreed. He read me part of a Letter to him from <persRef
								ref="marks-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marks</persRef>
							the Senator from Pennsylvania, making enquiries concerning my
							subscriptions to pious and charitable Institutions; of which I told him
							I had little to say. He made also some enquiries concerning my religious
							opinions, and particularly concerning my ideas of the Trinity— I spoke
							to him as freely as I did with the General of the Jesuits at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg— Told him in substance what I
							had written to my Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>— That
							I was not either a Trinitarian or a Unitarian. That I believed the
							Nature of Jesus Christ was superhuman—but whether he was God, or only
							the first of created beings was not clearly revealed to me in the
							Scriptures— He lent me a small printed pamphlet by a <persRef
								ref="tappan-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis
								Tappan</persRef> of Boston, who has lately been converted, from
							Unitarianism to Orthodoxy, and who is now desirous of making proselytes
							to his new faith— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker was in extasies
							at this pamphlet, which he thought full of the milk of kindness, and
							altogether lovely; but which I thought illiberal and even libellous—
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> paid an evening visit to me, and also to the
							Ladies. He spoke of the result of the recent election in New-Hampshire,
							as more flattering than the event will probably warrant. Yet there is
							reason to hope it has been more favourable than I had expected. In
							Elections promising first accounts are almost invariably dashed with
							final disappointment.</p>

							the United States— I assented to this but desired M<hi

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay the expediency of suspending for

								<persRef ref="white-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								White</persRef> the Delegate from Florida came to enquire concerning
							the grant of a Township of Land to the Kentucky Asylum for the Deaf and
							Dumb— I had read this morning, all the papers relating to this
							controversy which had been sent to me from the Treasury Department— The
							Act of Congress provides that the Land shall be selected under the
							direction of the Secretary of the Treasury— He has decided, according to
							a practice before established, that land equivalent in quantity to a
							Township may be selected, from various Townships, in parcels of four
							Sections each— Against this decision, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							White vehemently protests in behalf of Settlers on the Lands, with whose
							occupation this arrangement severely interferes— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> White that <persRef key="rush-richard"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> had executed the
							Act, according to the construction which had prevailed in practice,
							though it was not the Construction that I approved— That at this stage
							of the business, I could not refuse to issue and sign the Patents for
							the Land; but their legality would be a fit subject for a judicial
							decision— White acknowledged that he had expected this decision, and
							that I could not properly decide otherwise— I told him that I had
							considered this picking and culling of a section here and a section
							there, to make up the amount of one Township, as no better than a pious
							fraud— <persRef ref="bell-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bell</persRef>, the Senator from New-Hampshire came and spoke of the
							appointment of a District Attorney of the United States <pb type="ms"
								n="473"/>in that State— The place has been some Months vacant, and
							the appointment has been postponed, from political considerations. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r </hi>Bell named four persons who have been
							recommended, and stated the character and pretensions of each of them— I
							told him I was disposed to nominate any one of them whom he should
							definitively prefer— He said he would confer again with some of the
							members of the Delegation, and ascertain if they could agree upon any
							one; of which he would inform me— He spoke of the recent Election in
							New-Hampshire; the accounts from which continue flattering— <persRef
								ref="letcher-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Letcher</persRef> a member of the House from Kentucky, introduced
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shadburn</persRef>
							of Bairdstown in that State— M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Clay was
							here, and complained much of the state of his health—expressing his
							fears that he may not be able to hold out even for a few months— He
							spoke of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rochester, and thought it would
							be most expedient to instruct him to proceed to Guatemala; the Letters
							from the Consul at Omoa, <persRef ref="u">Phillips</persRef> expressing
							much solicitude for his arrival, in the hope that his presence might
							afford protection to the persons and property of our Citizens there.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rochester has been so long at home,
							waiting for a passage, that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay thought
							it would be more satisfactory to him, and also to the public mind, that
							he should go to the place of his destination, rather than that his
							Mission should now be abruptly terminated. But he agreed that it would
							be advisable shortly to abolish the Mission to the Central Republic; and
							the rather because he had this day received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="gonzalez-pedro">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gonzalez</persRef>, their Charge d’Affaires in this Country, now at

							home, though with a promise to come back, as soon as he shall be
							authorised thereto by his Government— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay mentioned also the increasing uneasiness of our North-eastern
							frontier, where some fresh disturbances have taken place; and where he
							proposed that a detachment of troops should be ordered— I desired him to

						<p>After my daily morning walk round the Capitol Square, I walked partly
							round the garden— Vegetation is in progress, but <persRef
								ref="ousley-john">Ouseley</persRef> complains of the morning frosts.
							There is yet no appearance of flowers. The blossoms of the Peach are
							however beginning to open— My trees which came up last year from the
							stone give no sign of life: but the self-planted wild cherries, which
							shed their leaves only in December, are already putting forth fresh
							ones— The Lombardy-Poplar aments are beginning to fall from the trees—
							After breakfast two men came, one of whom invited me to visit the wild
							beasts of which there is an exhibition in the City— The other had a
							machine which he called a knife, and said was made by <persRef ref="u"
								>Conrade</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Muckle</persRef> of
							New-York— In a hollow cubic, pen knife handle, with two subsidiary parts
							fitting in to its centre, like the tubes of an Opera Glass there were
							great numbers, he said 365, one for every day in the year, of pen knife
							blades— A curious show, but of no earthly utility— A <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Campbell</persRef> brought me a
							subscription paper for a republication at Philadelphia of <persRef
								ref="lingard-john">Lingard’s</persRef> History of England— I
							declined subscribing, but told him I would take a set, if the work was
							complete— <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> called
							respecting the appointment of a professor of Philosophy at West-Point—
							The present <persRef ref="mansfield-jared">Professor Mansfield</persRef>
							asks a furlough till the first of September and that <unclear>. .
								.</unclear> resignation may then take effect— Governor Barbour
							brought also with him an original Letter <unclear>da</unclear>ted
							October 1812, from <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef> to <persRef ref="campbell-george">George W.
								Campbell</persRef>, then a Senator from Tennessee, demanding the
							removal of <persRef ref="dinsmoor-silas">Silas Dinsmoor</persRef>, then
							an Indian Agent, because he had stopped a Negro trader who was passing
							through the Indian Country; he not having a Passport— Jackson was so
							highly incensed at this that he wrote to G. W. Campbell, requiring him
							to call upon the Secretary of War, and give him warning that if Dinsmoor
							should not be immediately removed, the <pb type="ms" n="474"/>people of
							the West-Tennessee would burn him up in his agency— This Letter and
							several others relating to the same Subject have lately been found at
							the War Department in the searches for the correspondence concerning the
							execution of the Tennessee Militia men at Mobile. Another motive too has
							spurred the search for some of his original Letters— In the Legislature
							of Louisiana last Spring, some of his partizans got up a Resolution
							inviting him to attend in person the anniversary celebration of the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January at New-Orleans— He caught
							eagerly at this bait, and went with a numerous train of attendants, from
							Nashville to New-Orleans in the dead of Winter, to exhibit himself in
							pompous pageantry— His reception was equivocal; with a laborious effort
							of magnificence, and mortifying indications of ill-will and disgust
							among the people— Deputations were sent from various other States, from
							Meetings of his devotees to meet him at the celebration, and five or six
							Addresses of fulsome adulation were delivered to him, to which he
							returned answers of cold and high wrought rhetorician eloquence— These
							Answers were all written by <persRef ref="lee-henry3">Harry
								Lee</persRef>, who has become an inmate in his family, and attended
							him to New-Orleans— As they were in an ambitious and Court-dress Style,
							some of his impudent Jackalls fell into extasies in the Newspapers at
							his eloquence and fine literary composition; and they were boldly
							claiming for him the reputation of an elegant writer— But the General in
							one of his raving fits, had sent one of his Nashville white-washing
							Committee’s pamphlets on his matrimonial adventures, to <persRef
								ref="force-peter">Peter Force</persRef> Editor of the National
							Journal, and had written with his own hand, though without signing his
							name, on the title page, about four times insulting to Force, and
							grossly insolent to the Administration— Coarse, vulgar and false in its
							invective, it was couched in language worthy of Antient Pistol, and set
							all grammar and spelling alike at defiance— When the Panegyries upon the
							composition of answers to the New-Orleans addresses began to thicken,
							and the peal of parasitical applause to swell, Force published literatim
							the manuscript note sent him with the Nashville Committee Report, and in
							a very short commentary marked the contrast between the wording of the
							Note, and the tawdry elegance of the Answers to the addresses— On the
							day of Force’s publication, <persRef ref="white-hugh">White</persRef>
							the Senator and <persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> a member of the
							House from Tennessee, called at his Office, and asked to see the
							pamphlet with the note— It was shewn them, and to the enquiry whether
							they recognised the hand-writing of the Note they answered with
							equivocation and evasion. The Liars of the News papers were more bold;
							they denied that the manuscript note was written by Jackson, and treated
							as infamous calumny the assertion that it was— This has stimulated to
							the discovery of more of Jackson’s autograph Letters, and among the rest
							is this one to G. W. Campbell— It is still more ferocious than barbarous
							in Style and composition. It has got <unclear>wind</unclear> among the
							friends of the Administration, and some of them are struggling to get it
							into Light— It is evidently from the same hand as the Note on the
							pamphlet sent to Force— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs

								>Lieutenant Courtnay</persRef>— The General for the first time spoke

							for the present Administration— He has hitherto so far as I have known
							maintained an exemplary neutrality. <pb type="ms" n="475"/><persRef

							five Millions of dollars of the principal. The estimate of revenue for
							the first and second Quarters of the present year, and its present

							call a meeting of the Commissioners of the sinking fund; and expect the
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Vice President</persRef> would renew his
							proposition to drain the Treasury by a larger payment—which could not be
							made without exposing us to a deficiency, in the event of any sudden

								Baker</persRef>, the Presbyterian Minister came, with <persRef

							leave of me previous to his departure for Savannah, to settle the
							interest of his two Notes to me, and to give me earnest and affectionate

							believe in the Doctrine of the atonement, which is to sound

							returned him <persRef ref="tappan-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lewis Tappan’s</persRef> Letter, with thanks; but without giving him
							my opinion of it: M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Baker in his zeal means

							that they have the best of the argument— <persRef ref="brent-daniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> brought be from

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef> came to renew

								Appleton</persRef>, an application for permission to <persRef
								ref="appleton-john">his Son</persRef>, Charge d’Affaires at

							not be granted—that I had found it necessary so far as depended upon me
							to break up that practice into which our diplomatic Officers abroad,
							were falling, of coming home upon leave of absence— It was an affair of
							recent origin, first commenced by <persRef ref="russell-jonathan"
								>Jonathan Russell</persRef>, who returned from Sweden in 1816. and
							since followed by <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="hughes-christopher">Hughes</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="anderson-richard">Anderson</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Everett</persRef>— It was attended with great
							inconvenience to the public Service, and I had declined granting
							permission to <persRef ref="middleton-henry">H. Middleton</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="everett-alexander">A. H. Everett</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="forbes-john">J. M. Forbes</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="watts-beaufort">B. T. Watts</persRef>. I said it had never been
							the principle of our Government to consider the Missions abroad, as life
							Establishments. <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Jefferson</persRef> thought no American ought ever to be

							Plenipotentiary to Spain, in place of <persRef ref="humphreys-david"
								>David Humphreys</persRef>, recalled on account of long absence from
							the United States. I concurred in this principle so far as to think that
							when an American in the public Service abroad, is anxious to come home
							he should come definitively, and I had adopted it as a general Rule to
							grant no leave of absence— <persRef ref="knight-simeon">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Knight</persRef> the ex-paymaster came
							again for a decision upon his claim; and had now a written opinion of
								<persRef ref="jones-walter">Walter Jones</persRef> to sustain him— I
							told him that he must submit all his papers to the accounting Officers,
							and if they had any question regarding the allowances to be made to him;
							they would submit the same to me— <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor
								Barbour</persRef> called and left with me copies of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson’s</persRef> Letter to <persRef
								ref="campbell-george">G. W. Campbell</persRef> written in September
							1812. and a note subjoined by him to a Letter from a man named <persRef
								ref="u">Gordon</persRef>, complaining that he had been stopped in
							travelling through the Indian Country by <persRef ref="dinsmoor-silas"
								>Dinsmoor</persRef>— The note repeats the declaration that if

							the project of the <persRef ref="chandler-john;holmes-john" type="multi"
								>two Senators</persRef> from Maine, to pass an act of Congress
							authorising the appointment of Agents; as the Executive could appoint

							suggestion of <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Clay</persRef>— That I was aware I could appoint agents without

								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							he had sent them to me— That I understood there was some Resolution upon
							the subject, now before the House of Representatives, but what Congress
							would do upon it I knew not— In the mean the Act of Congress making the
							grant had expressly subjected the selection to the Direction of the
							Secretary of the Treasury— It had been made accordingly. I regretted
							exceedingly that <pb type="ms" n="477"/>it had come in collision with
							the pre-emptive claims of Settlers, and thus given rise to
							dissatisfaction and ill-will; but if any right had been encroached upon
							it was a matter for the decision of a judicial decision, and not for
							mine— As at present advised. I should not feel justified in withholding
							the grants— <persRef ref="slade-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							in <persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">T. L. M’Kenney’s</persRef> Report to

							But under this feint attack upon M’Kenney there was an amendment wedged

							expose to public view, the ferocious Letter of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="campbell-george">G. W. Campbell</persRef>, with all its sins of
							orthography, and of Syntax upon its head— The Stratagem was believed to
							be necessary to get the Resolution passed—for had the General’s Vassals
							in the house known of the existence of the Letter, they would have voted
							down every attempt to produce it— Governor Barbour observed that besides
							the numerous unequivocal misspellings, such as Goverment, Solem,
							Secratary, gurantee, reguard &amp;c there were others probably though
							not certainly misspelt, and about which he was doubtful how to direct
							that the copy should be made— I advised that wherever it was doubtful
							the copy should always be made correct. <persRef ref="cass-lewis"
								>Governor Cass</persRef> of the Michigan Territory paid me a visit,
							and spoke with much feeling of the aspect of political affairs— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r </hi>Clay was here, and I mentioned to him that
							Governor Barbour proposed sending four companies of Soldiers to the
							North-Eastern frontier, for the Protection of the Inhabitants— M<hi

							would nominate <persRef ref="bridge-james">James Bridge</persRef>; and I
							wished these gentlemen to know it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							said it would perhaps be better not to inform them of this determination
							and I acquiesced, for the present. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							recurred again to the appointment of a Minister to Great-Britain, and we

							Governor Barbour and <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef>, all of whom are
							desirous of the appointment— Rush and Barbour really wish it as shelter
							from the Storm, with which they are in fear of being overwhelmed—
							Webster wants it in the ardour of ambition— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay that I would wait till the close of
							the Session of Congress to make the nomination— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay urged also a nomination of a Minister to the Republic

								ref="jones-richard">Richard Jones</persRef> keeper of the
							floating-light, at Ocracoke 9 feet shoal, North-Carolina, with a Salary
							of 500 dollars a year— Immediately after dinner I planted in the Western

								>Blanchard</persRef>— <persRef ref="baker-daniel">Baker’s</persRef>
							Valedictory.</p>
						<p>Heard this Morning at the Unitarian Church, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Blanchard from Acts 2.23. “Him, being delivered by the
							determinate Counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by
							wicked hands have crucified and slain.” A short historical account of
							the miraculous incidents of the day of Pentecost; the occasion upon
							which the speech was made by <persRef ref="peter">Peter</persRef>, from
							which these words were taken, introduced the discourse—which was an
							argument upon the position in the text that the crucifixion of Jesus was
							predetermined in the Counsel of God— There was cogent reasoning and
							affecting sensibility in this argument—an ingenious development of the
							causes by which the crucifixion of Christ became the most operative
							means to the propagation of the Gospel— It was a powerful and
							instructive Sermon, and riveted the attention of the Auditory— In the
							afternoon, I heard at the Presbyterian Church M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Baker’s valedictory to his flock— From 2. Corinthians 13.11.
							“Finally, brethren, Farewell— Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one
							mind, live in Peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.”—
							The Sermon was all contained in the text; and was affecting even by its
							extreme simplicity— Repetitions of affectionate farewell to the various
							classes of his hearers; to the members and elders of the Church, to the
							Sabbath school teachers and children, to the young and the aged of the
							Society; to his coloured brethren in the gallery, and finally to his
							unconverted brethren, with general fervent exhortations to harmony and
							union and among them all, constituted the whole Discourse, which was not
							written— It was preceded by the baptism of two children, a girl about
							six years old, named Susannah, and a boy of three or four, named William
							Daniel Baker, a compliment I suppose paid to him by the Parents on his
							departure— After the service he came down from the pulpit, and many of
							the hearers took leave of him personally, among whom I was one— He is a
							man of kind and friendly affections, whose creed is always at
							cross-purposes with his heart— I was occupied all the remnant of the day
							in writing observations upon my old accounts— I had an evening visit
							from <persRef ref="letcher-robert">R. P. Letcher</persRef>, member of
							the House of Representatives from Kentucky, whose principal object was
							to recommend the nomination of <persRef ref="robertson-george">George Robertson</persRef>, as Minister
							Plenipotentiary to the Republic of Colombia— He said he had mentioned
							him to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>, who had referred him to me. He also cautioned me
							against the appointment of any federalist to a distinguished Office at
							this time. He anticipates a successful election of Governor, and for the
							Legislature of Kentucky next August, and on the success of that Election
							depends that of the subsequent November, for the electors of President
							and Vice-President, not only in Kentucky but in all the North-western
							States, and in New-York— Letcher says they will carry <persRef
								ref="metcalfe-thomas">Metcalfe</persRef> for Governor, by a majority
							of 8500 votes, but it is evident that the face of his hopes is much
							fairer than that of his expectations— Mine deceive me not.</p>

							M’Duffie made this Report without so much as ever reading it to the

							expostulated with M’Duffie for his course of proceeding in this manner,
							but to no purpose— The three Seneca Indians, came to take leave, and
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> came in
							while they were here— <persRef ref="redjacket">Red Jacket</persRef>,
							delivered a long talk, which was interpreted by <persRef
								ref="johnson-henry3">Henry Johnson</persRef>— The purport of it was
							to renew the solicitation that the Lands reserved to the Seneca Indians
							in New-York may not be taken away from them; nor they compelled to
							remove to Green Bay— With this was united a supplication, that another
							Agent may be sent to them, than <persRef ref="parish-jasper">Jasper

							charged him with having defrauded them of great part of their annuity—of

							persons might be appointed to investigate these
								<unclear>charges</unclear>, which they said could easily be proved—
							I told them I would cause an enquiry, into them to be made; and would do
							what ever might be in my power for their relief— The Senate have
							declined advising the ratification of the last Treaty of cession, in
							consequence of which I told them that I should not ratify it— Governor
							Barbour spoke to me of the vacant mission to Great-Britain, as one which
							his friends thought suitable for him; and which he said would be
							desirable to him, as he had a curiosity to visit Europe— But he said if
							I had any other arrangement in view, he would not have his pretensions
							interpose for an instant to embarrass me; and he had a very sincere
							distrust of his own qualifications for the service— He thought a Citizen
							of New-York might be desirable; but in the Chaos of their Politics, it
							would scarcely be possible to fix upon any one who would give
							satisfaction— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush might perhaps be
							willing to return to London—but how would this operate upon his

						<p>Sent Message N. 7. to the House of Representatives, with a Report from

							the Resolution of 25. Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> calling for the
							Instructions from the Confederation Congress to the Ministers who
							negotiated the definitive Treaty of Peace of 1783. and the
							correspondence with the British Government, relating to the boundary— I
							signed 33. commissions to Navy Officers and 9 Land-grants— <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> who has been some days unwell, called with a
							large budget of papers, relating to business of the Navy Department— He
							proposed several measures to be taken, for preserving from depredation
							the public Lands in Florida, covered with live Oak; but where great
							quantities of the wood are cut down and carried away, by trespassers,
							with and without pretensions of title; and particularly by claimants
							under the spurious title of Hackley— M<hi rend="superscript">r
							</hi>Southard proposed that the Officers of the Navy and the Captains of
							the Revenue Cutters on the Southern Stations should receive renewed
							Instructions to keep a watchful look out for the preservation of the
							growing wood, from being pillaged—and that the Commissioner of the
							Land-Office should reserve from Sale the Lands stocked with Live-Oak— He
							spoke also of the applications for remission of sentences of all the
							Officers of the Navy, tried by the late Court-Martial of Philadelphia—
								<persRef ref="carter-william">Master Commandant
								Carter</persRef><persRef ref="spencer-william">Lieutenants
								Spencer</persRef>, and <persRef ref="foster-william4"
								>Foster</persRef>, and <persRef ref="green-farnifold">Midshipman
								Farnifold Green</persRef>— The case of Spencer is the only one, in
							which I thought there was reason for remitting the remainder of the
							Sentence— It was suspension for a year, of which about four Months have
							elapsed— But a subsequent charge of perjury has been brought against
							him: which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard thinks should
							preclude the remission of his Sentence, but should not be brought to
							trial. It is founded on a mistake of fact in his deposition: not put
							upon a point material to the issue— I said that having concluded upon
							remitting the unexecuted part of the Sentence of suspension, unless some
							cause should appear to the contrary, if this charge of perjury was too
							frivolous for the notice of a trial, it would hardly be justifiable to
							allow it the influence of barring the remission of the sentence of
							suspension— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard left with me the
							papers relating to the trial of <persRef ref="mooers-john"
								>Mooers</persRef>— The perusal of which may lead to a more
							deliberate determination, with regard to the remission of the remnant of
							Spencer’s Sentence— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard had also a
							copy of a Letter from <persRef ref="thompson-smith">his
								Predecessor</persRef> in the Navy Department, shewing that a brevet
							promotion of <persRef ref="freeman-william">Captain Freeman</persRef> of
							the Marines had been expressly declined, immediately after the
							performance of the service for which it is claimed: and he mentioned to
							me the purpose of nominating for promotion four Masters Commandant, and
							ten Lieutenants. <persRef ref="slade-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Slade</persRef> came to speak again of the desire of

							with me: to which I assented, but with the proposal that M<hi

							could make himself master of the subject, and he wanted the office
							exceedingly—and then he told me of his large family, his services and

								>Governor Barbour</persRef> shewed me a second Letter that he has

							one of the electioneering members of Congress from Kentucky, who divides
							his time between the propagation of Slander upon me, and the
							white-washing of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
							Jackson</persRef>— He wrote some time since to the Secretary of War,
							asking for a list of the names of all the Officers and Soldiers,
							executed by the Sentences of Court-Martials, ever since the commencement
							of the War of Independence— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour
							answered him, that as a Member of Congress he should have access to all
							those documents; but that to furnish Statements of them, at the call of
							an individual member, was not usual, and must consume much time— But
							that by moving a Call for them by a Resolution of the House, he could
							obtain them. Wickliffe replies that he is averse to Calls for papers by
							Resolutions of the House— That he wants these papers to vindicate the
							reputation of a distinguished Candidate and fellow Citizen which has
							been assailed, and most earnestly intreats to be furnished with the
							Statements— His aversion to calls by Resolutions for papers, is because
							he knows these would produce documents in no wise advantageous to his
							Hero; and while opposing the calls moved by others he cannot with a very
							good grace move for them himself; and his earnest intreaty for these
							Statements, as a private individual, is for the sake of having them
							refused, to use the refusal as a double topic of Slander upon the
							Administration, and of argumentative defence of his Candidate— Governor
							Barbour thought it would be best to furnish the Statements that he
							requests, which I observed he might do in consideration of the avowed
							motive to defend the character of General Jackson— <persRef

								Stackelberg</persRef>, and of despatches received from <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">A. H. Everett</persRef> at Madrid, and from
								<persRef ref="brown-james">James Brown</persRef> at Paris— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan was anxiously averse to the
							contemplated military movement on our part, of stationing four companies
							of Infantry on the borders of the disputed territory, and expressed a
							strong desire that this dispute might yet be adjusted by direct
							negotiation, and without recourse to an arbitrator— He was also much
							concerned at the Report of the joint Committee of the Legislature of the
							State of Maine, which denies the right of the United States to submit to
							any arbitration the Territories of the State— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay had conferred on the subject of the arbitration with
							Baron Krudener— Informed him that the <persRef ref="nicholas-i">Emperor
								Nicholas</persRef> would be named on our part. That we hoped he
							would accept the Office: and a general idea of the subject of the
							controversy has been given by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay to the
							Baron— His interviews with Baron Stackelberg have had reference to a
							question upon the construction of an Article in our last Treaty with
							Sweden, made by the Norwegian Government—The latest despatch received

						<p>In my walk this morning round the Capitol Square, I found <persRef

							and observed the approaches of Spring vegetation— The oval cups at the

							Snowy Medlar is already shewing a head of white blossoms. The roseate
							hue of the peach blossom is just bursting out, and the Scarlet maple is
							disclosing its first leaves The evergreen of the cedar assumes a rusty
							hue— The balm of gilead fir is unchanged and the claw pointed leaves of

								<persRef ref="watkins-george">George Watkins</persRef> brought me

							has prepared to it— This intercourse is now favoured by the British

								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> was here,

						<p>After my usual morning walk I visited the garden, to observe the process
							of vegetation— On the Capitol Square I remarked the Tulip trees, coming
							into leaf— The leaves come out in their peculiar shape—miniatures of
							their future and full grown size— In the garden, the peaches are in open
							blossom— The plums all-white have not yet begun to open— The Jonquil
							yellow, and periwinkle blue are the only flowers in bloom, and the
							Shepherd’s purse weed— The Lamium or Archangel plant covers the ground—
							In my two seedling beds, I find only a part of the Shag barks that came
							up last Summer, alive, and only two or three of them shew sign of
							life—but the self planted wild-cherries, some ten inches long, are
							covering themselves with leaves— The Lilac is in full leaf, and its
							clusters of flower are forming— My two apple-trees which I raised from
							seed in Pots last Summer, and transplanted to the garden in November,
							are alive about four inches long, and have put forth leaves from their
							tops— None of the Stones or seeds which I planted last Summer, yet
							appear. <persRef ref="nourse-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nourse</persRef> the Register of the Treasury called after

							And also copies of the settled accounts of the other Ministers from the
							United States, on the Mediation and Ghent Missions— I asked him some

						<p>The thermometers in my Eastern chamber were all this day at about 70 of
							<persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef>— I had of course no fire in my cabinet— In walking round the
							Capitol Square; the only new observation that I made was that, on all
							the young white Elms, there were still pending remains of the last years
							leaves—sear and yellow— There were none upon any others; except the
							Evergreens— On my visit to the Garden yesterday, I had discovered in the
							Eastern seedling bed, one plant, just up from the ground, but whether a
							weed or a tree, I could not discern— This morning I found twelve or
							fifteen which had come up since yesterday, some of which I ascertained
							to be Plums, and Apricots— One peach, and one probably a cherry— All
							from Stones which I had planted last May, June and July— I mark the
								28<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March therefore in this
							climate, for the first coming up of Stone fruit trees planted the
							preceding Season; and from this experiment I conclude, that the best
							time for planting the Stones of fruit, is immediately after they are
							ripe but it would seem they do not come up the same Season— <persRef
								ref="graham-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham</persRef>
							brought for my approbation a deed of <persRef ref="turnbull-george"
								>George Turnbull</persRef>, a half-breed Choctaw Indian to <persRef
								ref="johnson-benjamin">Benjamin Johnson</persRef>, of a section of
							Land reserved to Turnbull by the Treaty of Doak’s stand in 1819. and a
							subsequent Treaty concluded at Washington in 1820.— This Deed like most
							of the others of these Indian reserved lands is very loosely executed—
							It is dated 17. May 1827 and conveys Lands of which Turnbull’s grant
							from the United States was dated only the 15<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of this Month— After some hesitation I approved it with a
							special endorsement— <persRef ref="foot-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Foot</persRef>, a Senator from Connecticut came to
							enquire whether I had come to any decision upon the complaints against
							the Official conduct of the District Attorney in that State <persRef
								ref="huntington-hezekiah">H. Huntington</persRef>— I told him that I
							was waiting for his defence which he had repeatedly promised since last
							April— He had informed me that his object was to prove wilful perjury
							upon his accusers— I had thought it proper therefore to indulge him
							liberally with time but I had caused notice to be given him, that if he
							should not within a short time forward his promised defence, I should
							proceed to decide upon it, on the papers before me: and if he M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Foot thought it necessary I would do so—
							But the judicial powers of the President were so defective to try
							impeachable Offences, that unless some special reason should be
							assigned, for my proceeding to a decision, I should rather than remove
							Huntington, suffer his commission to expire as it would in the course of
							a year, and not nominate him for re-appointment— Foot said perhaps that
							would suffice— He knew that Huntington had prosecuted one of the
							witnesses against him for perjury; and he believed with good cause—but
							the man had died while the suit was pending— There had long been
							complaints against Huntington, and he supposed the Government was well
							apprized, of his incompetency for his Office— <persRef
								ref="lowrie-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowrie</persRef>
							the Secretary of the Senate brought me a Resolution, confirming the

								Adlum</persRef> came to offer me some of the wine of his last years

							900 Gallons having made 1000 Gallons the year before— But last year the
							Negroes robbed him of all his early <pb type="ms" n="485"/>grapes, and
							brought them for sale to the Washington Market— He makes all his wine
							from our native grapes, and considers the Catawba, as preferable to all
							the others— He says that his wine improves by age, and that he has some
							of the vintage of 1821. returned him from New-York much ripened in
							flavour. His juice of last year was 1140 specific gravity—water being
							1000. and at 1125 it needs no addition either of brandy or sugar—
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> brought a

								<persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> was here and
							spoke of the appointment of <persRef ref="knapp-gilbert">Captain
								Knapp</persRef>, whom he recommended for the Revenue Cutter on the
							Lake— He has been unwell confined to his house since Monday, and says he
							must shortly absent himself for a time— He had called a Meeting of the
							Commissioners of the sinking fund this morning; but could not obtain a
							quorum. His proposal is to pay off five Millions of Dollars of the
							principal of debt on the first of July, and he wants the authority of
							the Commissioners for that measure. <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">M<hi

							any measure should be taken that the members of the Columbian Institute
							should attend the funeral of <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton</persRef> to-morrow— We
							concluded that it would be more advisable for that Society to take some
							other method of manifesting its respect for the Doctor, who was one of
							its original members and founders.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							told me that he intended to offer the superintendence of the Patent
							Office to <persRef ref="niles-hezekiah">H. Niles</persRef> of Baltimore—
							I said I should be well satisfied with this appointment, if M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Niles, possessed the qualifications
							necessary for the performance of its duties, which were of a very
							peculiar character— I said I had been solicited by several persons to
							aid in obtaining it for them; but would mention only the name of
								<persRef ref="elliot-william2">William Elliot</persRef>, the Clerk,
							who has done most of the business for some years and was eminently
							qualified, by his knowledge of mechanics and of all the mathematical
							Sciences— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said an objection to
							Elliot was his being an Englishman born; and that there was great
							complaint of the disproportion of foreigners in the public offices— I
							did not press the subject farther— After dinner I planted 15 rows of
							English Walnuts, Black walnuts Shagbark’s, Chesnuts, Persimmon and
							Catalpa seeds— Evening oppressively warm.</p>

						<p>Thermometer continued at about 70— I visited the garden, and found in
							each of my Seedling beds, Eastern and Southern, fifteen Shag barks of
							the last years growth— On the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							October I found 21 in the Southern, and 20 in the Eastern bed— But
							several of them had but just come up, and I suppose have perished in the
							winter. Of those that remain, not more than one half appear as if they
							would revive, and five or six only look healthy— Of the last Summer’s
							plantation, there are in one row 3. and in one 5 plums just above the
							grounds—in one row three Apricots— 1. white heart and one red heart
							cherry, and 3. which I could not ascertain— In all sixteen, many of
							which appear to have broken in piercing through the surface of the
							ground— I find also some of the stones washed up, and lying unchanged on
							the ground— There are 17 of the self-planted wild cherry trees in the
							Southern bed; about half of which are vigorous— The rest puny. I heard
							at the Unitarian Church <persRef ref="stetson-caleb">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r </hi>Stetson</persRef> of Medford from
							Titus 2 14. “Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all

							works.” The argument of the discourse was in substance the same as that
							of <persRef ref="blanchard-ira">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Blanchard’s</persRef> Sermon of last Sunday Morning; the manner in
							which, the Death of Christ contributed essentially to the propagation of
							the gospel— M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Stetson was a Classmate of my
							Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> at Cambridge; but was
							graduated a year after him— At one O’Clock I went to the House of the
							late <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Thornton</persRef>, and attended his funeral— He was buried at the
							Eastern Branch grave-yard—the funeral service was performed by <persRef

							and <persRef ref="ringgold-tench">M<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Ringgold</persRef> the Marshall rode with me to the yard. There
							was a procession of perhaps fifty Carriages. Returning home, I left
							judge Cranch at his own House, and sent the Carriage home with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ringgold— A heavy shower of Rain overtook
							us in the avenue, about half way between the Capitol and home <pb
								type="ms" n="486"/>I became acquainted with D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Thornton, upon my first visit to Washington in October 1801
							He was then in middle age, with high Spirits, great wit and humour, and
							recently appointed by his friend <persRef ref="madison-james"
								>Madison</persRef> to the Superintendency of the Patent Office— I
							have been ever since that time on friendly terms with him, and for eight
							years he was in office under me, while I was Secretary of State— The
							Doctor was a man of learning, of genius, of elegant accomplishments and
							of very eccentric humours— His last years were of straitened
							circumstances and afflicted with disease— The death of persons with whom
							we have long been in habits of intimacy, reminds us forcibly of our own
							approaching end: a thought of which I would never lose sight— It was
							past four O’Clock when I got back from the funeral, and I did not again
							attend Church. <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Everett</persRef> was here in the evening; and took the

							upon his four simultaneous Missions, and those to me upon mine— Also the

							Everett said he had received a Letter from <persRef ref="sprague-joseph"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Sprague</persRef> of Salem
							enquiring if I was the author of a song against <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							of 1802— He said <persRef ref="hill-isaac">Hill</persRef> of the
							New-Hampshire Patriot had published it in a hand bill the very day of
							their recent election— This is another example of <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">Jonathan Russell’s</persRef> atchievements.
							It appears from a notice of a Newspaper printed at Castine, that the
							Note in the pamphlet, which so basely perverted the name and story of
								Mar<unclear>tha</unclear> was furnished by Jonathan Russell, and
							attempted to publish it in the paper and afterwards in the New-York
							Enquirer: but was in both those cases rejected— Everett said he had
							heard that his exposure of the Slander in Congress had been useful—
							Everett says <persRef ref="randolph-john">John Randolph</persRef> told

							Slanders— He thinks it perhaps an invasion of his Province.</p>

							himself, for which purpose he also left with me a Letter— <persRef
								ref="walsh-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Walsh</persRef>
							came to take leave; proposing to depart for Philadelphia to-morrow
							Morning. He gave me what he intended as an explanation of his own
							course, as Editor of the National Gazette, in relation to the
							approaching Presidential Election— The paper avows a constant preference
							of me, and treats me universally with respect; but it discountenances
							all attacks <pb type="ms" n="487"/>upon the character and conduct of
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, and classes
							under the general imputation of Slander, all allusion to any of the
							censurable parts of his history. It exhibits constantly an hostile
							spirit to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>, and very often under a show of candour has much more
							the appearance of a masked foe than of a friend to the administration—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walsh seemed anxious to obtain my
							approbation to this system of Editorial Deportment— I told him that
							whether he should as Editor of a Paper take any part or lean to either
							side in the election was altogether for his consideration: but that the
							savage and profligate character of the War waged against the
							administration and personally against me, not only by the partizans, and
							party Newspapers of General Jackson, but by himself, could not be met by
							moderation and magnanimity— That his own course had given perhaps more
							dissatisfaction to my friends than to me. That the great objection to
							it, was in its bearing upon his own character—laying him open to the
							suspicion and charge of insincerity. He was very anxious to justify
							himself from this imputation—his argument was plausible and evidently
							satisfactory to himself— But his real motives were disclosed in
							incidental remarks, of the bearing of which he did not appear to be
							at-all aware— He warmly disclaimed asking or wishing any thing for
							himself—and said that his editorial emoluments were so much more
							lucrative than any thing that he could derive from the public service,
							that there was no appointment that he could accept— This was not his
							language to <persRef ref="everett-alexander">A. H. Everett</persRef> in
							the Spring of 1825 but I suppose he believes what he says now— He
							distinctly told me that he had very great offers from the opposite party
							and that he had resisted them; but he did not tell be my whom they were
							made, nor what they were— <persRef ref="jonson-benjamin">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson</persRef> somewhere comments
							upon great offers and sturdy rejections— He said also that one half the
							readers of his paper were of the opposite party; and I told him that
							this was the very fact upon which I had considered his course without
							displeasure. He said also that he could have nothing in common with
							those in Philadelphia who plumed themselves upon being the special
							supporters of the Administration; and particularly with <persRef
								ref="binns-john">Binns</persRef>— This I also understood before.
							Finally M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walsh told me that talking
							yesterday with two of General Jackson’s most distinguished supporters he
							asked them whether in the event of his election as President, he would
							have it in his power to carry into effect the principles of his
							recommendation to put down the monster party, and let in the federalists
							to an equal share of power; and they answered that they thought he would
							not—at least, not immediately— Walsh is personally friendly to me, from
							a congeniality of literary tastes and pursuits: but his vanity, and his
							ambition warp him to the opposition; and perhaps his interest draws in
							the same direction. <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Rush</persRef> was here, having again been disappointed
							of forming a meeting of the Commissioners of the Sinking fund by the
							discourtesy of <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Vice President
								Calhoun</persRef>— His pretence this day was that the Senate were in
							Session. He had not even that on Saturday— <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> came principally to say that <persRef
								ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Watkins</persRef> was anxious to have <persRef ref="force-peter">P.
								Force</persRef> appointed Superintendant of the Patent Office— In
							which event Watkins would resign his own Office, and become Proprietor
							and Editor of the National Journal— I told M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard that the appointment was at the disposal of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r </hi>Clay, and that I believed he had fixed his
							mind upon another person— M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Southard spoke
							of the Officers under sentences of Court Martials, and are praying for
							remissions of their Sentences. He is averse to granting them in any
							case— I wrote part of this Evening but with great difficulty and little
							efficiency.</p>
