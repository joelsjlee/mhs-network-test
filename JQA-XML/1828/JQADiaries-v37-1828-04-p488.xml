						<p>Walking round the Square this morning I met <persRef ref="hellen-johnson"
								>Johnson Hellen</persRef> who walked home with me. I visited the
							Garden, but found nothing new to observe. No new shoots of Trees from
							the ground— no further growth of those already up. <persRef
								ref="wilson-james3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilson</persRef>
							a member of the House of Representatives from Pennsylvania came with
								<persRef ref="beatty-james">James Beatty</persRef>, the man who had
							been here ten days since to solicit contributions for a Methodist Church
							at Waynesburg. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilson now vouched for his
							integrity— <persRef ref="slade-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Slade</persRef> from the Department of State, came with a full power
							to <persRef ref="tudor-william2">W. Tudor</persRef>, to negotiate a
							Commercial Treaty or Convention with Brazil, and Instructions to him,
							and to <persRef ref="larned-samuel">James Larned</persRef> Charge d’Affaires in Chili— A man named <persRef
								ref="barron-samuel">Samuel Barron</persRef> came to beg for a
							contribution— <persRef ref="foot-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Foot</persRef>, a Senator from Connecticut to recommend <persRef
								ref="freeman-william">Captain Freeman</persRef> of the Marine Corps,
							for a brevet promotion— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Foot the
							reasons which had constrained me to decline a nomination of Captain
							Freeman, the chief of which was that it was declined by <persRef
								key="monroe-james">my Predecessor</persRef>, immediately after the
							gallant service for which Captain Freeman claims the brevet was
							performed— <persRef ref="bell-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bell</persRef>, Senator from New-Hampshire came to say that he
							thought the best nomination for District Attorney in that State, would
							be <persRef ref="christie-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Christie</persRef>— He also intimated an apprehension, that there
							would be danger of much obloquy to the Administration in the Event of
							the appointment of <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Webster</persRef> as Minister to Great-Britain— He said
							he had within these few days perceived that the opposition were very
							desirous that he should be nominated; and <persRef ref="cobb-thomas"
								>Cobb</persRef> had said that if he should not be he would go with
							them— M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Bell said that <persRef
								ref="mcneil-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								M’Neill</persRef> had applied to him for aid to obtain the
							appointment of Brigadier General, in the event of the nomination of
								<persRef ref="scott-winfield">Scott</persRef> or <persRef
								ref="gaines-edmund">Gaines</persRef> as Major-General, and the
							resignation of the other— But M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Bell said
							he hoped and believed the Office of Major General would be abolished,
							and he had recently heard accounts not very favourable of Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> M’Neill’s political propensities—
								<persRef ref="knapp-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Knapp</persRef> came to make application for the Appointment of
							Superintendant of the Patent Office— He removed here from Boston, about
							a year and a half since, and has practised Law, half edited the National
							Journal and delivered Lectures upon literary History, and last Saturday
							a Masonic Eulogium upon <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt
								Clinton</persRef>: but he has not much prospered, and ends as he
							began, by wanting a place. I told him the appointment was to be made by
							the Secretary of State. That the applications for it had been very
							numerous— That I had recommended one person to <persRef key="clay-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, but I believed
							he had fixed upon another; and probably the appointment was already
							made— He said his chance was then hopeless— <persRef ref="barbour-james"
								>Governor Barbour</persRef> brought me several conveyances of Lands
							reserved by Treaties to Indians, for my approbation and consent— two of
							which I signed—one from <persRef ref="jutreace-baptiste">Baptiste
								Jutreace</persRef> of Potawatamie descent, to <persRef
								ref="bell-daniel">Daniel Bell</persRef> 1/2 Section, reserved by
							Treaty of 16. Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1826. Sold 21. Dec<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1826. and one <persRef
								ref="godfrey-louis">Lewis Godfrey</persRef>, Miami to <persRef
								ref="roebuck-ruel">Ruel Roebuck</persRef>, reserved by Treaty of 6.
								Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1818. Section N. 5. out of six
							reserved. Sold    Governor Barbour left also several others: also a
							Letter from <persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">T. L. M’Kenney</persRef>
							recommending that only an extract of a Letter, instead of a Copy, from
								<persRef ref="crowell-john">J. Crowell</persRef> the Agent with the
							Creek Indians, and relating to the conclusion of the last Treaty with
							them of 15. Nov<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>1827. A copy of the Letter,
							and the extract which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kenney thought
							should be sent in to the House of Representatives, in answer to their
							Call, were with M’Kenney’s Letter— There were <pb type="ms" n="489"
							/>also several affidavits additional to prior testimony, defensive of
							Crowell’s character against charges heretofore brought against him—
							Governor Barbour told me that in printing the Letter from <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="campbell-george">George W. Campbell</persRef>, sent last week
							to the House of Representatives, <persRef ref="gales-joseph"
								>Gales</persRef> and <persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef>
							have corrected all the spelling; which they say is according to an
							established rule in the printing of all public documents— <persRef
								ref="miner-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Miner</persRef>,
							a member of the House from Pennsylvania, introduced <persRef
								ref="bevan-matthew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bevan</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ralston</persRef>
							from Philadelphia, as persons deputed by the petitioners for a
							Breakwater in the Delaware River, for which a Bill has passed the
							Senate— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Miner expressed an apprehension
							that the Bill would fail in the House, by not being reached in the order
							of business before the close of the Session. <persRef
								ref="baldwin-loammi">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baldwin</persRef> called to take leave; going to-morrow for Norfolk—
							He spoke of a jealousy extensively prevailing there, because the works
							had been commenced for the Navy-Yard at Charlestown, sooner than upon
							those at Norfolk— That bitter sectional prejudice cannot be eradicated—
								<persRef ref="hamilton-archibald">Major Hamilton</persRef> came to
							renew his application for an appointment; and told me over again the
							story of all his services, and of his dismission from the Office of
							Collector at Pensacola, as a defaulter; which I had already several
							times heard and read—a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>    of Georgetown
							introduced two persons by the names of <persRef ref="u">Carvin</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="u">Bechtell</persRef>, as friends of his from
							Washington County Maryland— They are of a Settlement originally German,
							near Hagerstown, and Bechtell speaks more German than English; though a
							native of this country— I spoke with him in German not much worse than
							his own— <persRef ref="trumbull-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Trumbull</persRef> called and invited me to visit the Capitol, and
							see the decaying condition of his Pictures in the Rotunda—I promised to
							meet him there at half past six O’Clock to-morrow Morning. <persRef
								ref="robinson-jeremy">Jeremy Robinson</persRef> came to renew his
							application for employment; and brought me several justificatory, and
							apologetic certificates and recommendations from some members of
							Congress and other respectable persons— The perseverance of this man is
							proof against any rebuffs, and there is so much meekness in his
							endurance, and so much calmness in his fortitude, that he takes hold of
							my compassion when he can never recover my esteem— He wishes to be
							Superintendent of the Patent Office, or any thing that will give him
							some of the crumbs that fall from the public table— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r </hi>Clay was here and read me a Letter from
								<persRef ref="niederstetter-ludwig">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Niederstetter</persRef>, the Prussian Charge d’Affaires, complaining
							of <persRef ref="hopkinson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph
								Hopkinson</persRef>, as having committed a violation of his
							diplomatic privileges by writing him insulting Letters— The
							correspondence related to certain pictures, to which the Prince Royal of
							Prussia, as patronizing the artist who painted them, had some claim, and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Niederstetter acted as his agent— The
							Pictures were at the House of the Academy of fine arts at Philadelphia,
							of which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hopkinson is President— The
							correspondence concerning the pictures had become so acrimonious that
							Niederstetter wrote the directors, declining further communication with
							Hopkinson, and asking it through any other person— Hopkinson then wrote
							him a very offensive Letter, that of which he now complains— I thought
							it manifested more anger than wisdom, and a lack not only of respect for
							the representative character of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Niederstetter but of courtesy due to a Stranger imperfectly conversant
							with our language. What provocation may have been given by the previous
							correspondence does not appear— And however we may regret such an
							altercation, we have no means of affording redress— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said he had also been in conference
							with <persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron Stackelberg</persRef>, upon
							the question raised in Norway on the Construction of an Article in the
							recently concluded Treaty—where the Tonnage duties are graduated,
							according to the distance of the voyage performed— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay thinks Stackelberg not sure of the
							precise operation of the Norwegian regulations himself, and requested
							him to write him a note upon the subject— Niederstetter has received a
							full power to negotiate a commercial Treaty on the principle of
							reciprocity— M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Clay mentioned also an
							Instruction to W. Tudor, to remonstrate against an Ordinance of the
							Brazilian Government requiring our vessels at Montevideo to give Bonds,
							not to go to Buenos-Ayres: and Tudor is instructed if necessary to state
							to the Brazilian Government, that our Naval Officers would be instructed
							to resist it— I said the threat might be held out, that before giving
							the Instruction to the Naval Officers the authority must perhaps be
							asked from Congress.</p>

						<p>I met <persRef ref="trumbull-john">Colonel Trumbull</persRef> as I had
							agreed with him, at half past six this morning at the Capitol, and
							inspected his Pictures, in the Rotunda— They are all damaged already
							with mildew— The Declaration of Independence very considerably; and
							unless some remedy to this disease can be discovered, they will all
							perish, he says within ten years— I think in less time— There are three
							arched door ways at the Eastern front of the Capitol without doors and
							never closed— All the dampness of the atmosphere throughout the year
							enters by those openings into the crypt or lower Story, thence ascends
							through the central circular opening into the rotunda, which having no
							other windows than the sky-light is never visited by the Sun— This
							dampness of the atmosphere thus having no issue necessarily deposits
							itself on the sides of the Wall, and upon the Pictures suspended on
							them— Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Trumbull’s opinion is that the
							central opening on the floor of the Rotunda, and the three arched door
							ways below must all be closed. We met there <persRef ref="kane-elias">E.

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bond</persRef> heretofore Governor of
							the State of Illinois, and another person— Col<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi> Trumbull shewed me also in the chamber of the Columbian

							the Death of <persRef ref="montgomery-richard">Montgomery</persRef>;
							with an unfinished battle of Princeton, and a small copy of which has
							made this Winter of the Surrender, by <persRef ref="washington-george"

							<persRef ref="dwight-henry">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Dwight</persRef>, and <persRef ref="ogden-david3">D. B.
								Ogden</persRef>— And he asked me to give him a sitting next Summer
							when he expected to be here again— Returning home I looked into the
							Garden, and found in the Eastern Seedling bed, one fresh plum tree,
							shooting up— After Breakfast <persRef ref="butman-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Butman</persRef> a member of the House
							of Representatives from Maine called and had a long conversation with me
							upon the troublesome question of our Eastern Boundary. He spoke of the
							Report of <persRef ref="barrell-samuel">S. B. Barrell’s</persRef> having
							had a very unfavourable effect upon the popularity of the Administration
							in Maine, and of the exertions made by the opposition to make an
							instrument of this controversy against the Administration. He
							particularly referred to the proceedings of the two Senators from Maine,
								<persRef ref="chandler-john">Chandler</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="parris-albion">Parris</persRef> to engross to themselves the
							credit of all that the Administration has done in support of this
							interest, and to represent the administration itself and its friends as
							cold or luke warm in the cause— They have it seems obtained from the
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Secretary at War</persRef> a Letter to
							them, signifying that the four companies of troops to be stationed on
							the borders of the State, are to be sent <hi rend="italic">there,</hi>
							at their request— They have acted without consulting the members of the
							Delegation from Maine in the House, and Butman said that he and <persRef
								ref="sprague-peleg">M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Sprague</persRef>
							thought it desirable that a larger force than four companies should be
							sent— I said I should readily agree to increase the detachment, if the
							other dispositions of our small military force could be accommodated to
							it— I desired him to consult with the Secretary of War on the subject;
							and to communicate freely with me concerning it; at all times. <persRef

						<p>In my walk this morning round the Square I met and walked with <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef>, the member from
							Rhode-Island— The Lombardy Poplars are assuming their first verdure— In
							my Eastern Seedling bed, I found two fresh shoots of Plum-trees, and
							from one of these I had before discovered the top leaves and Cotyledons
							are broken off, so that it will perish— The ground is hard as if it were
							baked, so that the plants and especially the cotyledons have great
							difficulty, in piercing through the surface and extricating themselves
							from the ground— This is perhaps the reason why so few of the Nuts and
							Stones that I have planted have come up— Walking before dinner in my
							Western garden I find ten peach-trees and five Apricots above the
							surface. <persRef ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Watkins</persRef> called to recommend <persRef ref="thomas-james2"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thomas</persRef> for the
							Suttler’s place that he desires— The D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							afterwards came and introduced <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Purdy</persRef>, a merchant from Smyrna, and about
							embarking to return thither— <persRef ref="beecher-philemon">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Beecher</persRef> a member from Ohio
							came with <persRef ref="king-edward">Edward King</persRef>, of that
							State— <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> was here
							twice—first to enquire if I had done with the papers which he had left
							with me the day before yesterday— I had not entirely; but returned him
							the extract and copy of <persRef ref="crowell-john">Crowell’s</persRef>
							Letter; advising that the copy should be sent to the House rather than
							the extract— Secondly with a Letter from <persRef ref="dinsmoor-silas"
								>Silas Dinsmoor</persRef>, requesting an exact copy of the Letter
							from <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="campbell-george">G. W. Campbell</persRef> concerning him which
							has been communicated to the House of Representatives— Dinsmoor claims
							it of right; and I told Governor Barbour that I thought it could not be
							denied him— Dinsmoor says that he was the victim of that Letter, but was
							never allowed to have a copy of it— The correction of the spelling, in
							the Document printed by order of the House of Representatives has taken
							off much of the effect expected by those who procured the call of the
							House to produce it; and the rage of the Myrmydons is venting itself
							upon Governor Barbour, because the Document comes from the Department of
							War— The claim to search the Records came first from the partizans of
							General Jackson, and was first complied with in their favour— But when
							granted to his adversaries, all the flood-gates of ribaldry are opened
							upon the Secretary, for treating both parties alike— <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> was
							here, and read to me the answer that he has prepared to the call from
							the Retrenchment Committee, requiring a Statement of the duties

							Several Establishments subordinate to that Department; of which there
							are ten—Two Comptrollers, five Auditors—Register, Treasurer, and
							Commissioner of the General Land-Office— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rush has again called a Meeting of the Commissioners of the Sinking
							fund, for Saturday Morning— The <persRef ref="wirt-william">Attorney
								General</persRef> having returned from Baltimore, the Meeting may be

								ref="calhoun-john">Vice President</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="dorsey-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R. B.
								Dorsey</persRef> brought me a Letter from his father in Law <persRef
								ref="dorsey-clement">Clement Dorsey</persRef>, Member of the House
							from Maryland— His object was to solicit the appointment of
							Superintendant of the Patent-Office— I told him that I had already
							recommended to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> one person, and I believed he had appointed another—
								<persRef ref="bateman-ephraim">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bateman</persRef> the Senator and <persRef ref="forward-chauncey"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forward</persRef> the member of

								>Lyford</persRef>, keeper of the news-room at Norfolk, relating a
							conversation in which a judge of the Superior Court in Virginia, named

								<persRef ref="ritchie-thomas">Ritchie</persRef>, Editor of the
							Richmond Enquirer, in which he declared with a vulgar Oath, that if John

						<p>After several days of Summer heat, the temperature of Winter has
							returned, and I walked this morning round the Capitol Square, with Sleet
							and Snow, which continued at intervals through the day— I paid a short
							visit to my Eastern Seedling bed in the garden, but there has been no
							new sign of vegetation since yesterday, nor have any of the fruit trees
							appeared to acquire any additional growth since I discovered them a week
							since— My experiments of planting last Summer, failed, with the
							exception of two apple-trees raised from seeds in flower Pots; and half
							a dozen Orange-trees, raised in glass tumblers—transplanted into boxes
							filled with Earth, which I have kept through the winter in my chamber. I
							propose repeating some of the experiments of Seeds and Stones in the
							Pots and Tumblers, which I have had filled with fresh Earth— In Seedling
							Pot N. 1. I deposited last Monday a Post-oak Acorn, a Chesnut, a Shag
							bark, a Plum Stone, a Tamarind Stone; and seed of Persimmon, grape,
							Orange, Apple and Pear— In Seedling Pot N. 2. Several of the same.
							Yesterday in glass Tumbler N. 1. 12. Post-Oak Acorns round the sides of
							the glass— 1. Plum Stone, and a few raspberry seeds, and this day in
							Tumbler N. 2. 10. Orange seeds, fresh from the fruit round the sides of
							the glass, and several grape and gooseberry seeds— I find that the
							Apple-trees coming up in my Eastern seedling-bed, are from the seeds
							sown there the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April last year— So
							that while a portion of the Shagbarks came up, within two Months after
							they were planted, the apple-seeds appear after laying nearly a year in
							the ground— Yet in May and June last as apple-seeds planted in a Pot
							came up the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> day— <persRef
								ref="tracy-phineas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tracy</persRef> a
							member of the House of Representatives from New-York, came to enquire,
							if a pardon could be obtained for a young man at New-Orleans sentenced
							to ten years imprisonment, for stealing from the Mail— A youth of
							respectable family and connections, of good character until he sank
							under this temptation; and who has already suffered from two or three
							years of the penalty— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Tracy that
							any Representation which might be made to me, in behalf of this person,
							would be cheerfully received and deliberately considered; but that I was
							bound to tell him that I had in no instance pardoned the offence of
							stealing form the Mail. I gave him for this rigour the same reasons that
							I had assigned in a similar case to <persRef ref="bell-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef>, of <pb type="ms"
								n="493"/>Tennessee—the great aggravation of the crime— Its
							pernicious consequences to Society— The multitudes of persons, exposed
							at all times and in every part of the Country to the temptation of
							committing it— The immense amount of property, always exposed to such
							depredation, and the defenceless condition in which it always must be— I
							considered the severity of the Law, as the only protection to the public
							interest, and if I should yield to the relaxation of it, in one
							instance, I should be compelled to extend it to many others, till it
							would operate, as a vital repeal of the punishment; and as a license to
							the Spoiler— I said that the remission of punishments was among the most
							pleasing exercises of power; and that I could never refuse to grant a
							pardon upon petition, without denying myself a gratification—but it was
							required by an overruling sense of duty, and without knowing what the
							particular circumstances of this case are I could give no encouragement
							to expect that I shall deem it consistent with my duty to grant the
							pardon— <persRef ref="jackson-john3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Jackson</persRef> came to apply again for an office, and brought a
							recommendation from <persRef ref="bryan-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bryan</persRef> of the House of Representatives— He said
							there was now a vacancy of a Clerkship in the Treasury Department; for
							which I referred him to the <persRef key="rush-richard"
								>Secretary</persRef>; and gave him the recommendations; which he had
							brought to me before— <persRef ref="crane-ichabod">Major Crane</persRef>
							came with <persRef ref="jones-roger">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Jones</persRef> the Adjutant General— The Major has
							claimed by Memorial, a brevet for ten years service, upon a brevet for
							gallant conduct in the late War— I told him that his was one of a Class
							of Cases, upon which I had delayed to decide, because there was a
							proposal before Congress for altering the Law relating to Brevets. I
							should however come to some determination before the close of the
							present Session of Congress— Jones said that before the end of this year
							there would be at least fifty Officers in the army, claiming Brevets for
							ten years Service— Major Crane rests his claim on the grant of brevet
							upon brevet to others, particularly to the Officers of the Marine Corps.

								ref="dorsey-clement">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clement

							merchant vessel of the Havanna, taken, by a Mexican Privateer, and
							pursued for recapture by a Spanish frigate, had found a refuge at Key
							West—and was said to be refitting there to escape— I thought it deserved
							consideration whether Congress should not enact a Law, prohibiting all
							privateers and their prizes from entering that port. Evening at my
							Office—writing heavily.</p>

							1829. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush found the subject complicated,
							that he felt much embarrassed how to answer it— I thought that the

							Act making the Appropriation for the Quarter— M<hi rend="superscript"

							“Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell,

							They have already received upwards of 4. Millions of Acres: while the

							Charlestown, Massachusetts; upon which I thought it would be necessary
							for M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Binney to go to Congress— An opinion

							the Court Martials in the case of the Master Commandant <persRef
								ref="carter-william">Carter</persRef> and Lieutenants <persRef
								ref="foster-william4">Foster</persRef> and <persRef

								ref="weed-elijah">Weed</persRef>, and <persRef ref="howle-parke"
								>Howle</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard enquired
							of the Instructions to be given to <persRef ref="biddle-james">Commodore
								Biddle</persRef>, respecting the Brazilian decree <pb type="ms"

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tudor</persRef> had been instructed to
							state if necessary to the Brazilian Government that our naval Officers
							would be authorised to resist it—perhaps this notice might supersede the
							necessity of resistance. The instructions now to be given to Commodore
							Biddle would be to disregard the decree in every thing short of hostile
							conflict, and if that should fail, the authority of Congress would be
							asked for the use of force— He spoke of the Letter he had sent me
							proposing the nomination of 4 Captains 6. Masters Commandant and 10.
							Lieutenants in the Navy— I desired him to send me the nominations— He
							mentioned the application of <persRef ref="heermann-lewis">D<hi

							the strength of an old Resolution of Congress, that swords should be
							presented to Officers who should be designated by <persRef

							distinguished themselves at the attack upon Tripoli in 1804. Preble
							never designated the Officers, and has long been dead— But Heermann was

							distinguished himself and claims therefor a Sword— I thought it was too
							late— We finally determined to appoint <persRef ref="armstrong-andrew"
								>Andrew Armstrong</persRef> as Navy Agent at Lima— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard told me that the object of the

								Brown</persRef>, a Clerk in the Department of State, about the
							payment of money from the contingent fund to <persRef ref="cook-daniel"
								>Daniel Pope Cook</persRef>, upon my Certificate; and with a view to

							Rebello, complaining of the arrival at New-York, of a prize, to the
							Privateer recently arrived at Baltimore, and protesting against his
							being allowed to refit in our Ports— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							had written to the <persRef ref="mcculloch-james">Collector</persRef> at

								<persRef ref="chicot-auguste">Auguste Chicot</persRef> at
							New-Orleans, a reference to the <persRef ref="smith-robert2">U.S.

							Referred to the <persRef ref="tillotson-robert">U.S. District

							continuing cold. Hoar frost on the ground, and all the vegetation
							shewing marks of being frost bitten— The leaves of the Horse Chesnut
							particularly which had unfolded, appear scorched as if by fire— The
							plants in the garden were powdered with the frost, and the verdure of
							the fields is faded— After Breakfast <persRef ref="culpepper-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Culpeper</persRef> a member of the
							House from North-Carolina introduced a constituent of his named <persRef
								ref="davis-thomas">Thomas Davis</persRef>, who has been many years a

							State for a Passport, and told him it was all the authority, I could
							give him— He could take as many men with him as he pleased, and might
							take Passports at the Department for them all— Davis told me he was a
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>
							<pb type="ms" n="498"/>man himself; but that his father his father in
							Law, and all his family were warm supporters of the Administration—
								<persRef ref="lee-william">William Lee</persRef> came to recommend

							and brought me two papers containing allowances to a <persRef ref="u"
								>Major Anderson</persRef>, upon the settlement of his accounts, of
							exactly the same kind, as he said, with the claims of Binney— I said if
							there was Law or usage, to warrant the allowances there was nothing for
							me to decide. If there was none, I did not see what I could decide— The
							allowances to be sure had been made by Acts of Congress for Interest,
							Loss of Exchange—Discount upon Treasury Notes, and the like—but the Acts
							of Congress themselves proved that the allowances could not be made
							without them— Lee said also that there were two precedents in the War
							Department, of lumping allowances made upon Indian Treaties by order of
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef>, which would bear out the charges of <persRef

							of Tennessee— I had a visit from <persRef ref="ringgold-cheston">Cheston
								Ringgold</persRef>, a young man, Son of <persRef
								ref="ringgold-samuel">Samuel Ringgold</persRef> of Hagerstown. Also
							from <persRef ref="hoops-adam">Major Hoops</persRef>, the Military
							Store-keeper at Watervliet New-York; who is still labouring with his
							projects of reform; and will call on me with papers again to morrow—
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> came for a
							decision respecting the claims of the Cherokee Indians in Arkansas; but
							the wrong book had been sent from the War Department yesterday, so that
							the correspondence referred to was not found in it— Two other Volumes of

							Petition from <persRef ref="burnett-abraham">Abraham Burnett</persRef>,
							a Pottawattami Indian, concerning two Sections of Land reserved to him
							by Treaty of 2. Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1818. The Petition

								ref="cass-lewis">Governor Cass</persRef>. On the Petition of
								<persRef ref="leclerc-pierre">Pierre Le Clerc</persRef>, another
							Pottawatime Indian for permission to sell one Section of Land, reserved

							should appear on the face of the deeds and be subject to the approbation
							of the President of the United States. The Second that the <unclear>Indian
							Agent</unclear> shall certify his belief that the Consideration was really given

						<p>The Morning was still cold, but in the course of the day, moderated again

							tree, piercing the surface of the earth is in my Eastern seedling bed.
							Still doubtful whether those that had come up are yet alive, or killed
							by the frost— The ground is much caked, and cracked by the frost; and
							yet is covering itself with weeds— I found under one of the old Cherry
							trees in the yard, a number of small trees coming up from Stones, fallen
							from the tree— Also a number of stones on the ground which have
							apparently lain there over the winter— I picked up about 30 of these,

								Tompkins</persRef>—he was very averse to going to Congress; saying
							that he could not expect to obtain it of them, unless after four or five

								Beecher</persRef> strongly recommended by <persRef ref="sloane-john"

							Discovered one more shooting Apple tree in my Eastern seedling bed—
							Picked up on the ground, under the yard red Cherry tree near a hundred
							of the Stones, most of which sunk in water—and I caused about a dozen of
							the self planted trees, which had come up under the tree, to be
							transplanted into the Western Nursery— I also planted there on the South
							side, this Evening after dinner ten rows of Black Walnuts, Shagbarks,
							Peach Stones, Persimmon, Apple and Orange Seeds, dried Prunes and their
							Stones, Apricot and Yard Cherry Stones— These are from an ungrafted

							discovered that the Land is excellent; and they are swarming thither
							like bees— They are covering it with unlicensed Settlements and the
							People of the Territory are loudly claiming that the land should be
							offered for Sale— This collision between the just and reasonable demands
							of our own people, and the pledge seemingly given to the Indians is very
							embarrassing: and it is scarcely imaginable that within so recent a
							period, the President and Secretary of War should have assumed so
							unwarranted an authority; and have given so inconsiderate a pledge— I
							observed however to Governor Barbour that as the pledge in its utmost

							Lovely’s purchase, a right of peaceful way, would be reserved for them—

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>
							came together, and presented a question upon the Act of Congress of
							1819. for the suppression of the Slave trade, which involves the
							legality of all executive proceedings in the case of the Africans lately
							landed at Key West from the stranded Spanish Vessel, fleeing from the
							pursuit of a British armed vessel, and who have since been transferred
							to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Augustine in Florida. The Act of 3.
							March 1819. is a penal Statue; all the provisions of which are directed
							against Citizens or Residents of the United States, participating in
							that traffic, or against the unlawful introduction of Slaves into the
							United States— In this case the Africans were landed from a wreck of a
							foreign vessel to save their lives— No unlawful attempt was made to
							introduce them into the United States—no Citizen or Resident of the
							United States appears to have had any concern in the transaction, so far
							as the Slave trade was intended by it; and the provisions of the Law, do
							in no respect apply to it— M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Southard said
							that <persRef ref="berrien-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Berrien</persRef> the Senator from Georgia, supporting some claim
							for the bounty promised by the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Section
							of the Act of 3. March 1819. in the case of negroes brought in the
							Spanish Ship Ramirez, under circumstances partly similar to those of
							this case, insisted that the claim to the bounty, though in this Act
							confined to the <pb type="ms" n="501"/>Africans found in vessels of the
							United States, Slave trading, was yet extended by the other Acts against
							the Slave trade, to all Negroes however introduced into the Country, but
							it appeared to me that this argument could not be sustained. We
							concluded that it would be necessary to propose a Supplementary Act of
							Congress— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> was

							Legislature, in favour of <persRef ref="preble-william">William Pitt
								Preble</persRef>, one of the judges of the Supreme Court of the
							State, and an inveterate and open-mouthed opponent of the
							Administration— These recommendations are made in language unjust, and
							offensive towards the Administration—accompanied by repeated and solemn
							protestations against the right of the General Government to submit the
							question to any arbitrator at all; and a groundless charge in general
							terms, that the agents of the general Government heretofore have not
							given full effect to the title of the State to the controverted
							territory— I told the Senators that I would give respectful
							consideration to the recommendations; and expressed to them much regret
							at the gross misrepresentations which had been made in the State, to
							produce alienation and distrust among the People of the State of Maine,
							against the Administration of the general Government—and I spoke of the

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="barclay-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							it, in newspaper publications in the State to impute to me a concession
							of the right of the Province of New-Brunswick to exercise jurisdiction
							within the contested territory when it was merely an inference of Bagot
							himself, directly contrary to the tenor of my observations to him— There

							boundary question, and we looked over the copy of <persRef
								ref="mitchell-john">Mitchell’s</persRef> map which belongs to the
							Department of State— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parris appeared to
							think that much of the strength of our claim depended upon the location
							of the North-west angle of Nova Scotia, and that this could not
							reasonably be controverted— <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi

								ref="gaines-edmund">Gaines</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="macomb-alexander">Macomb</persRef> and Harrison were all
							slightly mentioned, each whom has strong pretensions, and upon which
							ever of the four the choice may be fixed there will be great clamour
							from the friends of all the others and from the adversaries of the
							Administration generally— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said that
							if Gaines should be appointed he could not serve with him— He alluded to
							a personal insult offered him, about three years since by <persRef
								ref="butler-unknown3">Lieutenant Butler</persRef>, Gaines’s aid, in
							his presence and in the Antechamber to my Cabinet— They happened to meet
							there; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay coming in as they with
								<persRef ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef>, were going out—
							General Brown introduced Butler to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay,
							who offered Butler his hand, which Butler passed on without receiving—
							General Gaines made some slight equivocal apology for this rudeness of
							Butler, which M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Clay forbore further to
							notice, but which has remained upon his memory. I told him that I should
							under no circumstances whatever nominate General Gaines. But there are
							so many difficulties, besetting the measure that I propose to take the
							opinion of the members of the Administration concerning it, and
							requested a meeting at one O’Clock on Monday to consider it— <persRef

							says Binney told him he should very willingly go to Congress with his
							claim, if he had not been born North of the river Potowmack— He has too
							much reason for the distrust implied by this remark— <persRef

							again by the illness of her children. <persRef ref="gaines-edmund"
								>General Gaines</persRef> came and left with me two Letters, from
							himself, one to me dated 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> containing a sensible and well written
							argument against the practice of duelling, the other dated 8. October
							1826, and addressed to the adjutant General, and requesting the official
							information to be found in his Office, respecting the campaign of the
							force under his Gaines’s command in 1814. These papers I read after the
							general retired; and I had no conversation with him concerning them— But
							he recurred to his double claim; as Senior Officer of the Army, to
							assume the actual command, from the time of the decease of <persRef
								ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef>; and to the vacant
							appointment of Major-General. He expressed some anxiety that this
							appointment should be forthwith made, and added that if it should be
							delayed he would ask a furlough for a short time; and he intimated that
							his continuance in the army would depend upon his receiving the
							appointment of Major-General. I did not think it necessary to notice
							either of those remarks; though I thought them neither reasonable nor
							delicate— He told me he had been informed, that a representation had
							been made to me that he had spoken of me, in disrespectful terms—this he
							said was entirely without foundation— He had a strong personal
							attachment to <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>,
							but had never spoken otherwise than respectfully of me— I told him that
							I had never heard it otherwise imputed to him: and assured him that
							whatever my final determination with regard to this nomination might be,
							I should suffer no consideration personal to myself to have any
							influence whatever upon my decision— The Cabinet Meeting was from one,
							till past four O’Clock. I said that the number of Candidates for this
							appointment, with pretensions so nearly equal, and the high importance
							of the appointment itself had induced me to consult the members of the
							Administration, before coming to my decision— The four Candidates are
							Generals <persRef ref="macomb-alexander">Macomb</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="scott-winfield">Scott</persRef>, Gaines; and <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">W. H. Harrison</persRef>, now a Senator from
							Ohio— All their claims were canvassed; their merits critically scanned;
							their defects freely noticed, and their comparative pretensions weighed.
							They so nearly balanced one another, that every member of the
							Administration had much difficulty in coming to a decided preference—
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Clay</persRef>, <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governour
								Barbour</persRef>, <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>,
							finally, and somewhat indecisively joined their voices in favour of
							Scott— <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> more positively preferring Macomb; with which my own
							opinion concurred— I attributed the preference of Scott to a feeling of
							which those Gentlemen were probably themselves not conscious—The
							Virginia sympathy. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had also Western
							biases, inclining him towards Harrison; but he would not allow that
							Gaines was from Tennessee; or that Tennessee was a Western State— There
							was not one voice for Gaines— He and Scott have both made themselves
							obnoxious by continual acts of insubordination, and contempt of the
							civil authority— Their controversy for rank and precedency has been
							carried on by both not only with rancour, but with indecency— And Scott
							after challenging Gaines to fight him in a duel, avails himself of that
							act, and of Gaines’s declining to receive the challenge as matter to
							sustain him; and glories in the open and undisguised violation of the
							Articles of War, as if that was to be taken as argument in his favour— A
							great objection to Scott in my mind is that the choice of him would
							cancel all his outrages upon the discipline of the army, <pb type="ms"
								n="504"/>while it would bear heavily as punishment upon those of
							Gaines, of the same character and occasion. Gaines’s Letter against
							duelling is well written and well reasoned, but in the midst of his
							argument against the practice he obscurely hints that if Scott should be
							appointed Major-General, he will fight him— There was not time for
							discussing the question concerning the Africans landed at Key-West, and
							thence transported to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Augustine. Another
							meeting was therefore fixed for one O’Clock on Wednesday— <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef> dined at <persRef

								Webster’s</persRef>. <persRef ref="degrand-peter">De Grand</persRef>

							The origin of this outrage was that Jarvis came to the last

							that if Jarvis had the feelings of a gentleman, he would not shew

							named <persRef ref="u">M’lean</persRef>, who he said would receive any explanations— John repeated
							to M’lean, what he had said, declined giving any written answer and said
							he would hold no correspondence with Jarvis— This day, Jarvis followed

							accosted him by name, asked him if he had given him his final answer,
							and upon Johns answering that he had, struck him on the face, and

							the House of Representatives, enquiring what instruments, and what
							appropriation would be required to resume the Survey of the Coast, and
							his opinion of the necessity of the measure— I approved the answer,
							suggesting for consideration two slight alterations, towards its close—
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Everett</persRef> called here in the Evening, and spoke of the
							assassin’s attack upon my Son at the Capitol, while he was in the
							discharge <pb type="ms" n="505"/>of a public duty. I had heard nothing
							of it before— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett related the
							circumstances as he heard them, and enquired whether I should propose to
							make any communication to Congress concerning it— I said I should not
							immediately— The transaction occurred immediately under the notice of
							both Houses of Congress, and within the walls of their own building— It
							seemed to me it was rather their affair than mine to act upon it, and I
							should prefer that they would act upon it, setting aside every
							consideration personal either to me or to my Son— Under this Congress,
							it is doubtful whether any remedy for such brutalities, will be found,
							short of being provided with arms for self-defence.</p>

									>r</hi> Semple</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">Bowles</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="galusha-elon">Galusha</persRef> came to make fresh
							Statements and proposals respecting the debts of the Columbian College—
							The act for their relief, relinquishing the debt for which they were
							bound to the United States has become a Law; and they have a fair
							prospect of raising their 50000 dollars by subscription— But they find
							their debts much heavier than they had expected, and they amount to more
							than 100,000 dollars— They brought me a paper subscribed by several of
							the creditors agreeing to receive a proportional dividend; but to which
							the Bank of the United States having a lien on the College buildings,
							declines acceding. These Gentlemen now hope, to be able from all their
							resources to pay a dividend of 65 per Cent, without interest— They
							descend step by step, according to the approved custom in such cases—
							They will get lower yet— I told them again that I would accede to any
							thing to which a majority of the Creditors in number and value should
							agree upon— <persRef ref="dorsey-clement">M<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Dorsey</persRef>, a member of the House from Maryland,
							introduced <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tidboll</persRef> and <persRef ref="ringgold-cheston">Cheston
								Ringgold</persRef> of that State— <persRef ref="mclean-john2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r </hi>M’lean</persRef> the Postmaster
							General, came and informed me that he was now under the necessity of
							removing <persRef ref="bache-richard">Richard Bache</persRef> from the
							Office of Postmaster at Philadelphia, and that he proposed to appoint
								<persRef ref="sergeant-thomas">Thomas Sergeant</persRef> in his
							place. He said he had seen and conversed with <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Sergeant</persRef> on the subject, and that he thought the
							appointment would be generally acceptable— He said that one of his
							motives for making this appointment was that T. Sergeant having married
								<persRef ref="sargeant-sarah">Bache’s Sister</persRef>, the loss of
							the Office would be somewhat mitigated to Bache himself. His decisive
							reason for removing Bache is, that after having brought up the large
							arrears of his debt to the Government, he has now fallen afresh into
							delinquency— There was a short Cabinet Meeting at one O’Clock, the
							result of which was a determination that a Message should be sent to
							Congress, recommending a Supplementary Act, to that of 3. March 1819.
							authorising the President of the United States to send to Africa,
							persons taken from Vessels of the United States, unlawfully engaged in
							the Slave-trade— The opinion was unanimous that the Law as now existing
							limits the Power of the President to the disposal of persons imported
							into the United States, in violation of the Laws against the
							Slave-trade— I desired <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> to send me copies of
							the papers relating to the Negroes landed at Key West from the stranded
							Spanish Prize ship, and since transferred to Saint Augustine— These
							papers it <pb type="ms" n="506"/>will be necessary to send to Congress
							with the Message— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush and <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> afterwards came and
							observed that the members of the Administration all thought it would be
							proper to send a Message to Congress, concerning the assault upon
								<persRef ref="adams-john2">my Son</persRef> yesterday in the
							Capitol. They proposed to meet to-morrow Morning here, at 11. O’Clock,
							to consider of it to which I agreed— <persRef
								ref="tayloe-edward-thornton">Edward Tayloe</persRef> called; having
							arrived this morning from Mexico, with two Treaties, concluded by
								<persRef ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poinsett</persRef>—one of Commerce, and one of Boundaries— We had
							this Evening the tenth Drawing-Room, which was fully attended— I asked
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dorsey who was present at the assault
							upon my Son yesterday, for a conversation with him at his leisure, to
							have a statement of the facts, from him as he witnessed them— He said he
							would; but proposed to postpone it, until he should have made the
							statement requested of him by <persRef ref="archer-william">M<hi

						<p>I was quite ill with hoarseness and sore throat in the Night; but rose at
							my usual hour this morning, and walked round the Capitol Square. Met
							<persRef ref="elliot-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William Elliott</persRef>, opposite to the
							Garden of the Columbian Institute. Visited the garden on my return, and
							with <persRef ref="ousley-john">Ouseley</persRef> sowed eight rows of
							the grain of the white mustard seed— After Breakfast <persRef
								ref="pollock-allen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Allan Pollock

								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> came at ten O’Clock.
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> and <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> at eleven— I had
							prepared a draft of a short Message to Congress upon the outrage on
								<persRef ref="adams-john2">my Son</persRef>— But from the personal
							feeling which might be supposed to affect me on this occasion. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had also made a draft, which he read,
							and which I adopted, with the alteration of a few words. The two drafts
							were indeed substantially the same— The question was discussed whether a
							Message should be sent, and if so, at what time— My own impression had
							been to wait and see if the Subject would not be taken up by one or the
							other House of Congress, and if it should, to make no communication at
							all— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay however was of opinion that a
							Message should at all Events be sent—and immediately— The act was of the
							most dangerous character as an example— It had a tendency to introduce
							assassination into the Capitol. It might be practiced for the robbery of
							a confidential message between the Executive and the Legislature— It was
							indeed too probable that in the present disposition of both Houses of
							Congress, they might do nothing to remedy the evil; but there was a duty
							for the Executive to discharge: independent of what Congress might do—to
							maintain his own dignity and security in the performance of his
							functions— He understood that the two parties in Congress were
							hesitating what they should do in this case, and distrustful of each
							other— He felt assured that nothing would be done, unless the
							responsibility should be put upon them by a message. The very
							forbearance to send one would be used as an argument for doing nothing—
							A motion would be referred to a Committee, which would make a partial
							report, perverting the facts and giving the wrong to the previous
							offensive remark of my Son— The House of Representatives, had now no
							member in it, with weight of character to lead them, in any prepared
							direction; without some external impulse— Forbearance on the part of the
							Executive was laudable but might be carried to an extreme— The other
							members of the Administration concurred in these views and I acquiesced
							in them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt only thought there would be
							more calmness of dignity in passing the transaction without notice; but
							he too finally yielded his opinion. I mentioned that I had informed
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Everett</persRef> that it was not my intention to send a Message, at
							least immediately; and it was possible that <pb type="ms" n="507"/>the
							Message might come unseasonably, if a Resolution should have been
							already offered in the House— I concluded therefore to send the message
							by <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brent</persRef>, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay went
							previously up to the Capitol, to be there when the Message should
							arrive—to determine according to the Circumstances whether the Message
							should be delivered or not— M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Clay
							afterwards returned and informed me that by his direction, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent had delivered the Message— That M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett was not in the House, and that
							nothing had been moved in the House upon the Subject— That <persRef
								ref="johnston-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Johnston</persRef> of the Senate had informed him that nothing
							had been done in there; but that was a mistake— As <persRef
								ref="foot-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Foot</persRef> had
							offered a Resolution, for a Committee of Inquiry, with power to send for
							persons and papers— We had at the meeting some conversation upon the
							nomination for Major General, which as I have expected has produced
							great dissatisfaction among all the partizans of the three disappointed
							Candidates— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay who was in favour of
								<persRef ref="scott-winfield">Scott</persRef> is much annoyed with
							the censures upon this selection; and a little hurt that the Candidate
							of his preference was not chosen— He thinks the Office will be
							abolished— His own health continues so bad, that he spoke again this day
							of the probability of his own resignation— I believe it inevitable: and
							likely to take place very soon— <persRef ref="bateman-ephraim">M<hi

								<persRef ref="maxwell-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Maxwell</persRef> of the House of Representatives from the joint
							Committee of enrolled Bills, brought me seven Acts of Congress which I
							signed. I also signed 43. Commissions of army Officers, dated 15
							February— John dined at <persRef ref="krudener-paul">Baron

							having collusively facilitated the escape of a man named <persRef

							give all the aid in his power to detect and arrest the suspected

						<p>The weather deprived me again of my morning walk, as by the same cause I
							had lost that of yesterday morning— I walked out with <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef> about a half an hour before
							dinner, and this was all the exercise, I could take in the day. The
							effect upon my Spirits superadded to that of the catarrhal cough which

							appeared by my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John’s</persRef> Record,
							that the Resolution of the Senate conferring the nomination, was sent to
							the Treasury Department the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of

							obtained from the <persRef ref="lowrie-walter">Secretary of the
								Senate</persRef>— <persRef ref="baker-absalom">Absalom

							the Senator from South-Carolina, came to introduce <persRef ref="u"

							was lame from honourable wounds, but he became so loquacious, and so

							him out of my chamber, and furnish him with motives for going away. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hayne and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="mccord-david">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

							Senator from New-Hampshire was here, and conversed with me on various
							political topics— The nomination of <persRef ref="macomb-alexander"
								>General Macomb</persRef> as Major General, and the dissatisfaction
							it has given to <persRef ref="harrison-william">General
								Harrison</persRef>, and to his friends particularly of the Ohio and
							Indiana Delegations— He said he was aware, that no other of the four
							Candidates could have been appointed without producing still greater
							excitement, and dissatisfaction— He thought the choice upon which I had
							fixed was the best; but he believed if the question of abolishing the
							Office of Major General should come again before the Senate it would
							prevail— A Resolution to that effect had been moved in the House of
							Representatives by <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis
								Williams</persRef>, immediately after the death of <persRef
								ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef>— Since the nomination of
							Macomb it had been brought forward again; and may very possibly pass in
							the House— It would now have the appearance of a censure both upon
							Macomb, and his nomination—but the same disposition would have been
							aroused though in other individuals, by the nomination of either of the
							other competitors, and to the measure itself, whether adopted or
							rejected I attach little importance— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell
							spoke also of the appointment of a Minister to Great-Britain, and was
							very anxious that it might be delayed until the next Session of
							Congress— He mentioned also the proceedings in the Senate upon my
							message relating to the assault of <persRef ref="jarvis-russell">Russell
								Jarvis</persRef> upon my Secretary; and thinks that the opposition
							party will for the sake of their own credit, do something to manifest
							their disapprobation of his conduct— I have no belief that they well.
							They brought him here for the purpose of assassination, and they cannot
							punish him for labouring in the vocation to which they called him— My

						<p><date>20. VI.</date> Sunday— Rain. Fog.</p>
						<list><item>Wyer Edward</item></list>
						<p>The rain continued through great part of this day— Rode with <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail2">Abby</persRef> to the Unitarian Church. Heard
								<persRef ref="stetson-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Stetson</persRef> from John 1. 1. “In the beginning was the Word,
							and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”— 14. [“]And the Word
							was made flesh and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, and the
							glory as of the only begotten of the father) full of grace and truth.”—
							And Psalm 33.6— “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all
							the host of them by the breath of his Mouth.”— These texts the Preacher
							said he had brought together, as illustrative of the meaning of each
							other— He said he had been requested to give an exposition of the manner
							in which the unitarian doctrine could be understood conformably to those
							texts in the first chapter of John’s Gospel, and in particular how by
							the unitarian doctrines the character of Jesus Christ, could be
							distinguished from that of Moses, or of the eminent prophets— The Sermon
							was a solution of this question— He said they considered Jesus Christ,
							as the manifestation of the power of the one only God, in human form—
							That in the agency of human power, word and action were successive; but
							in the operations of divine power the word and the action were
							identical— God said let there be light, and there was light; and thus
							the word was with God, and the word was God— Creative power was thus
							conferred upon Christ, the Son of God, with which he wrought Miracles
							upon Earth— It was thus that he became the Saviour and Redeemer <pb
								type="ms" n="510"/>of the world, this character was therefore
							altogether different from that of <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>,
							or of any of the prophets— This exposition was ingenious and forcible,
							but was not that of all Unitarians. It would not have been sanctioned by
							the late <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Little</persRef>—he admitted no difference of nature between Moses
							and Jesus— He believed Christ to have been a mere man—the Son of
								<persRef ref="joseph5">Joseph</persRef> and <persRef ref="mary"
								>Mary</persRef>, and that the powers conferred upon him as a
							Minister from God, differed only in degree from those of Moses, or any
							of the prophets— With George I walked home from the morning service—
								<persRef ref="wyer-edward">Edward Wyer</persRef> came in, fresh from
							Rio de Janeiro, whither he had been sent with despatches to <persRef
								ref="tudor-william2">William Tudor</persRef>, appointed Chargé
							d’Affaires to that Government— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tudor
							whose Commission has been sent to him at Lima in Peru, and who received
							it only in December, had not arrived at Rio de Janeyro when Wyer reached
							there— Wyer proceeded on to Montevideo, where he saw <persRef
								ref="forbes-john">J. M. Forbes</persRef>, our Chargé d’Affaires to
							the Government of Buenos Ayres, who has been many months afflicted, even
							to the disqualification for business by the Gout—and was upon an
							excursion to Montevideo, whence he had been to Rio de Janeyro for the
							recovery of his health— Wyer arrived two days since at New-York, and
							speaks of having had an extremely boisterous passage home— Attended with
							George the afternoon Service at S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> John’s
							Church— Heard <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the Evening prayer for the second
							Sunday after Easter, and preach from Romans 3.21. [“]But now the
							righteousness of God, without the Law is manifested, being witnessed by
							the law and the prophets; 22. Even the righteousness of God, which is by
							faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe; for there
							is no difference.”— After three days of rain and fogs the weather
							finally cleared away this Evening.</p>

						<p>My Catarrhal cold is yet troublesome, but I walked this morning with

							had packed up to send to New-York, but opened, that George might see it.
							He has good likeness of all the Judges of the U.S. Supreme Court, and

								<persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> went before the Committee

								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and delivered to them a written
							statement of facts relating to the assault upon him by <persRef
								ref="jarvis-russell">Russell Jarvis</persRef>, and to the occasion
							whence it arose— <persRef ref="crockett-david">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crockett</persRef>, a member of the House of

								rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							<persRef ref="u">Wommock</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">Elliot</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="u">Smith</persRef>, and another, from North and

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mather</persRef> of that State,
							who was a Commissioner for laying out a Road to the boundary of Mexico—
							I urged them to prevail upon the Legislature of Illinois, at some time
							when they should be laying out a new County, to call it by the name of
							LaSalle— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mather said they had once tried
							to get a County so named without success. <persRef ref="ticknor-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ticknor</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="prescott-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Prescott</persRef> are visitors from Boston— <persRef
								ref="watkins-george">George Watkins</persRef> from the Department of
							State came for a note from the Mexican Minister <persRef
								ref="obregon-pable">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Obregon</persRef>, complaining of the seizure at Key West of a prize to
							a Mexican privateer carried in there— <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> afterwards called, and
							we had some conversation concerning it— The prize had been so much
							damaged, in the capture, that she could not depart from the Port without
							repairs; and those repairs could not be made without selling a part of
							the cargo to pay for them— The question is whether this can be allowed
							consistently with the Laws of Neutrality— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay said he could find no authority to the point; and that having
							accidentally seen <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Webster</persRef>, he had enquired of him if he
							recollected any such case, but he did not— The seizure by the <persRef
								ref="pinckney-william2">Collector</persRef> had been upon the charge
							that the vessel which made the prize had been fitted out <pb type="ms"
								n="511"/>in our own Ports— And M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Obregon’s Note complains especially and repeatedly, that when the
							seizure was made the Mexican flag, was hauled down— I found in <persRef
								ref="wheaton-henry">Wheaton</persRef> upon Captures some remarks on
							a case nearly resembling this, but not identically the same— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay mentioned also his negotiation with
							the Prussian Charge d’Affaires, <persRef ref="niederstetter-ludwig"
								>Niederstetter</persRef>, with whom some question has arisen with
							regard to two Articles of the projected Treaty— One upon the free ships
							free goods principle, and the other upon the definition of blockade—
							With regard to the first M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Niederstetter
							was not authorised to agree to the limitation by which the principle of
							free ships free goods should be recognized only in cases when the enemy
							of the belligerent acknowledges the same—and it is doubtful, whether the
							Senate would advise to the ratification of the Article, without the
							limitation— I said the Article might be postponed for further
							consideration, as Had been done in the Treaty of 1798— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay spoke likewise of his conferences
							with <persRef ref="krudener-paul">Barron Krudener</persRef>, the Russian
							Minister, concerning the proposal on our part, to refer the question of
							our North-Eastern boundary to the arbitration of the <persRef
								ref="nicholas-i">Emperor Nicholas</persRef>— The Baron thinks the
							Emperor would accept, though with reluctance the task of arbitrator, but
							said he might perhaps accept on condition, that the parties should
							previously make a last effort to adjust the dispute by direct
							Negotiation between the parties themselves—an idea with which I was much
							pleased— <persRef ref="lee-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								William Lee</persRef> brought me statements of several claims which
							have been allowed by the accounting officers of the Treasury; being the
							same in principle with those now claimed by <persRef ref="binney-amos"
								>Amos Binney</persRef>; and he asked leave for Binney to come and
							see me again himself to which I readily agreed— <persRef
								ref="dickins-asbury">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Asbury
								Dickins</persRef>, Secretary to the Columbian Institute brought me
							the subscription Book of the Society, containing the names of the
							members subscribed by themselves with the dates of their respective
							admissions— I subscribed my name, as of 6. October 1817. <persRef
								ref="hoops-adam">Major Hoops</persRef> came to enquire if I had
							examined his Dissertation, upon the Military Store keeper’s Office— I
							had not had time to get them through— Major Hoops read me another
							Letter, and will call again in a few days— <persRef ref="barbour-james"
								>Governor Barbour</persRef> called upon the subject of his parleys
							with the Arkansas Cherokees, and a proposition which he thinks of making

							the Delegate from the Territory— <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi

								Wyer</persRef> from <persRef ref="biddle-james">Commodore
								Biddle</persRef>— I sent Message N. 27. to the Senate, with the

						<p>Walk round the Capitol Square alone— Garden visit— No new appearance of

						<p>Walked alone round the Square— Visited the Garden— No appearance of new
							vegetation in my seedling beds— Some of the walnuts of last years growth
							are putting out their leaves; but the clay-soil of the ground bakes
							almost to the hardness of a brick, so that the young trees are so
							clogged that they cannot make their way through to the Service—
							Impatient at their not appearing, I desired <persRef ref="ousley-john"
								>Ouseley</persRef> to spade up one of the rows where I had planted
							cherry stones last Summer— Of a row of 36. I found only one stone
							unchanged, and one vegetating with a radicle and Cotyledons, which would
							have come up perhaps in a month— I cannot yet satisfy myself why so
							small a proportion of the seeds and stones that I plant do come up— The
							Strawberries are in full blossom— A white Iris at the gate open— No
							fresh flowers. <pb type="ms" n="514"/>I sent for <persRef
								ref="elgar-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elgar</persRef>
							and read to him the memorial of <persRef ref="dyer-william">William B.
								Dyer</persRef>, complaining of injustice suffered by him in the sale
							and resale of certain city lots— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elgar
							told me other circumstances relating to those transactions which
							confirmed my conviction that I had no authority to interpose, though
							Dyer has been harshly dealt with, and advantage has apparently been
							taken, both of his imprudence and of his necessities— <persRef
								ref="mather-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mather</persRef>
							of the State of Illinois called— He enquired of me whether the late
								<persRef ref="cook-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Daniel
								Pope Cook</persRef> had two years ago; when the Bill for adding
							three judges to the Bench of the U.S. Supreme Court was before Congress
							and expected to pass, delivered to me a recommendation, signed by most
							of the members of the Legislature of Illinois in behalf of <persRef
								ref="pope-nathaniel">judge Nathaniel Pope</persRef>, for one of
							those appointments— I said I believed he had. I certainly had received
							such a recommendation, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook had been
							anxiously desirous that judge Pope should receive the appointment. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Mather said he was well assured it was
							so—but exertions had been made before M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cook’s death, to produce a coolness between him and judge Pope, and one
							of the means used had been an intimation to judge Pope that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook never had delivered to me that
							recommendation. <persRef ref="well-eleanor">Eleanor Wells</persRef> was
							the woman who came some time since to say she had a petition before
							Congress of a Pension; having lost her husband, and two Sons in the
							public service. <persRef ref="chambers-ezekiel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Chambers</persRef> the Senator from Maryland called to
							have some conversation with me upon public affairs— He expressed much
							solicited respecting the appointment of a Minister to Great Britain; and
							although entertaining a very high opinion of <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>, thought that the appointment of him would be
							inexpedient, both as to the political effect, and because his removal
							would be an irreparable loss in the Senate. <persRef key="clay-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> came with a draft
							of an Article for the Treaty with Prussia, renewing most of the Articles
							of the last Treaty— He also told me that the State of his Health was
							such that he should be compelled to resign his Office— It was becoming
							impossible for him to discharge its duties and he could not consent to
							hold an office without discharging its duties— He mentioned it now that
							I might have time to make provision to supply his place before the close
							of the Session of Congress— His good wishes for the success of the
							administration would be as warm as if he had remained a member of it—
							But his weakness was constantly increasing— A relaxation from public
							duties was indispensable; and he must go home, and die or get better.
							His disorder is a general decay of the vital powers, a paralytic
							torpidity and numbness which began at the lower extremity of his left
							limb; and from the foot has gradually risen up the leg and now
							approaches to the hip— I told him that his communication was of the most
							painful character to me— That I would still hope he might as the Spring
							advanced find himself so much better as to continue in the Office, and
							while preparing for the contingency of his resignation should he persist
							in thinking it unavoidable, I wished him to take some days for
							consideration if a more cheering expedient might not be embraced—
								<persRef ref="tyler-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> B. O.
								Tyler</persRef> introduced a <persRef ref="williams-benjamin">M<hi

								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> were here together— The Governor has concluded
							after consulting with several friendly members of the Senate to make his
							Treaty with the Arkansas Cherokees— Both the Governor and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard spoke of the condition of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s health; and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard said he doubted whether he would live a month
							longer— I do not think his case so desperate, but there can be no doubt
							that a temporary relaxation from public duties can alone save his life,
							and give him a possible prospect of recovery— <persRef
								ref="letcher-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Letcher</persRef> of Kentucky was here in the Evening and made
							remarks to the same effect— This is in every point of view a disastrous
							occurrence; and is among those of deep humiliation which are thickening
							around me— The younger part of our family dined at <persRef

								>r</hi> Niederstetter’s proposal to introduce into it the 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article of our last Treaty with Sweden,
							concerning blockades. M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Clay was desirous
							of introducing a more precise definition of blockades, but Niederstetter
							cannot venture upon it without Instructions. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay that I had reflected upon his tender
							of his resignation <pb type="ms" n="517"/>and hoped he would reconsider
							it— I mentioned to him D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntts opinion of
							his case, and proposed to him to take an excursion of a few weeks or
							even Months, leaving the current duties of the Department of State to be
							performed by the Chief Clerk M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent, and
							with regard to those duties of a more important character which may
							occur, I said I would give my own attention to them and if necessary
							would remain here the whole summer for that purpose— He appeared
							disposed to make this trial, and said he thought of going next week to
							Philadelphia to consult <persRef ref="physick-philip">Doctors
								Physick</persRef> and Chapman upon his case. He said he had little
							hope of surviving, and had so made up his mind as to set but little
							value upon life— With regard to the political effect of his resigning,
							he scarcely knew what it would be— If it should tend in some parts of
							the Country to relax the exertions of our friends, it would perhaps
							abate the virulence of opposition in other quarters— I told him it was
							my wish to set aside all consideration of political effect in this
							matter— His life and his health should be paramount to all other
							considerations. If he had made up his mind philosophically to estimate
							life itself at a low value, I had made up mine to a much lower estimate
							of political life— I was prepared for whatever might ensue; and like him
							could not foresee what might be the effect of his withdrawing from the
							Administration— It would be exceedingly painful to me to part with him,
							as I had fondly hoped we should continue together at least until the
							close of my present term of service: yet if it should be indispensable
							for the restoration of his health I would look exclusively to that— He
							received with much feeling of gratification these remarks, and said that
							the interest manifested by his friends in his present situation, deeply
							affected him— He said he had <unclear>receive</unclear> this morning another testimonial
							of it for which he was profoundly grateful— Some of his friends had
							conjectured that pecuniary embarrassments in his private concerns
							contributed to the present unhappy state of his health—and they had met,
							and made up a sum of money, the use of which they had offered him for
							his relief— Their impression however had been erroneous— He was not free
							from debt, but there was nothing in the state of his affairs which
							required this assistance, and he had accordingly declined their offer—

							had nominated him to the Senate as Consul at Rio Janeiro and the
							nomination had been confirmed by the Senate— That his Commission had
							been made out, signed, and ready to be delivered to him, when it was
							withheld, in consequence of remonstrances from persons of respectable
							character at Salem, charging him with misconduct in trusts committed to
							him by them— He had been informed that until those transactions should
							be satisfactorily explained, no office under the Government of the
							United States could be conferred upon him— This satisfactory explanation
							had not been given and in this state of things, renewed solicitations on
							his part, were but a useless waste of time— He thanked me for the
							candour of this declaration, and said he should proceed to act according
							to my advice— <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef> told
							me, when he dined here last Monday, that Robinson told him that I had
							given him an office worth nothing which he had therefore declined. He
							said Robinson had also assured him that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe had been desirous of the appointment of Major General, and that
							the Ladies of the family had told him they needed it to procure the
							common necessaries of life— This morning I walked round the Square
							alone— <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> brought
							me the draught of the Treaty prepared to be concluded with the Arkansas
							Cherokees now here. He said they were desirous of having an interview
							with me before they went home, and I agreed to receive them this day at
							one O’Clock. But <persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> M’Kenney</persRef> afterwards wrote me that two of them
							were unwell, and they wished the meeting with me to be postponed until
							to-morrow. <persRef ref="breese-sidney">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Breese</persRef> the U.S. District Attorney in Illinois called and
							left with me a Memorial or Statement of <persRef ref="smith-samuel4"
								>Samuel Smith</persRef> of that State; claiming certain Land-grants,
							to which the <persRef ref="graham-george">Commissioner</persRef> of the
							General Land Office and the <persRef key="rush-richard">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> think him not entitled— There were two or three
							other papers relating to the case— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Breese
							said M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Smiths wish was to appeal to my
							decision— <persRef ref="nourse-charles">Major Nourse</persRef> called
							from the War Department to ask for a Certificate for 6747 dollars 50
							Cents Six per Cent Stocks of 1813. issued to <persRef
								ref="madison-james">President Madison</persRef>, for the benefit of
							the Seneca Indians; which being to be paid off next July, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Nourse desired me to transfer the
							Certificate to the Treasurer of the United States, which <pb type="ms"
								n="521"/>I did— I had advised M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush to
							have this stock re-invested in three per Cents— <persRef
								ref="hoops-adam">Major Hoops</persRef> came and entertained me
							surely more than an hour upon the transcendant importance of an entire
							and radical reform in the system of military Store-keeping— I have not
							had time to peruse his little volume upon the subject, and he now read
							to me, and left with me an abstract or Summary of it, which he thought
							might serve to substitute for it— I listened to him with patience, and
							promised to hear him again before his return to Watervliet where he is
							stationed— We had company to dine— <persRef ref="bancroft-aaron">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Aaron Bancroft</persRef>, <persRef

									>l</hi> Taylor</persRef> of Kentucky, and also Major Hoops, but
							they were engaged or made excuse— <persRef
