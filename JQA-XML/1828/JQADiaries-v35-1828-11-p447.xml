						<p>Cabinet Meeting— The question now to be considered was the course to be
							pursued with regard to General Scott— On the claim to be the Senior
							Major-General, by virtue of his brevet to Major General Macomb, he has
							actually disobeyed his orders N. 109. and 110— He has professed
							disobedience ever since the appointment of Macomb, but until now he had
							indirectly caused all the orders to be executed, though professing to
							disobey them— The Attorney General being absent this Meeting was merely
							for first discussion— The measure which I proposed for consideration was
							that of only revoking General Scott’s Brevet— But the opinion was
							unanimous that this measure should not now be adopted. General Porter
							had prepared a draught of a Letter from him to Scott containing the
							reasons upon which his claim to command Macomb cannot be allowed, and
							upon which his disobedience must be exacted— General Porter had shewn me
							this Letter before, and now read to me an additional paragraphs in which
							my views were presented of the 62<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Article of War—
							I desired him to read my observations upon Scott’s claim and take from
							them any argument which he might think proper to add to his Letter— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush expressed
							doubts of the expediency of revoking the brevet only. They appeared to
							think it would be better to dismiss him at once from the army— It was
							also urged by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay that the final measure should
							be postponed on account of the present doubtful prospect of the
							Presidential Election; of the loss of which I have myself no doubt— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard was for acting in Scott’s case without
							much delay— He thought that if any of these orders from Macomb which
							Scott circulates only through his Aide de Camp, should be disobeyed by
							any Officer of his division, they could not be sustained and vindicated
							as lawful orders— The members of the Administration are to read my
							Observations on Scott’s claim and on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt’s
							return from Baltimore we are to have another Meeting.</p>
