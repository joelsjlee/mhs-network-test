						<p>I took this morning a shower bath; the first time for the Season. Visited
							the Garden— The bud upon the Battle ground Oak has opened into five
							small whitish leaves. The tall Plum tree is 33 inches high, and has
							grown more than a foot in the course of the last Month— A second Tangier
							Orange came up in Box N. 5. The Second Orange in Tumbler N. 4. is
							withering— To multiply experiments I planted 3 yard Cherry stones in a
							small tin cup, to ascertain whether they will vegetate— The Sail needle
							shoot in Box N. 4. remains as when it first appeared— The morning was
							cloudy with a fresh breeze, and I rode the round by the race-ground.
								<persRef ref="smith-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S. H.

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> brought a Letter from
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef>, saying that
							the People of Orange County had invited him to a public dinner—which
							would delay for three or four days his arrival at this place. <persRef
								ref="johnston-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Johnston</persRef> the Senator from Louisiana, introduced a <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whittlesey</persRef> from
							Middletown, Connecticut, whom from that circumstance I supposed, and
							afterwards found to be an applicant for the appointment of Collector at
							that Port, just vacated by the decease of <persRef
								ref="wolcott-alexander">Alexander Wolcott</persRef>— <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>
							brought me an Estimate of the State of the Treasury this day; after the
							payment of upwards of five Millions of principal of the Public Debt;
							from which it appears that there will remain in the Treasury a balance
							of four millions nine hundred thousand Dollars; and that the receipts at
							the Treasury for the first half year have been twelve Millions three
							hundred and sixty nine thousand dollars, so far exceeding our Estimates
							of last Winter, as to warrant the expectation that the receipts of the
							whole year will exceed the estimates— We have therefore every
							encouragement to hope that we shall at the expiration of the year have
							paid off seven Millions of the debt— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush
							spoke also of the application of <persRef ref="macomb-david">judge
								Macomb</persRef>, that the payment of the grant of Congress to
								<persRef ref="macomb-alexander2">Alexander Macomb</persRef> might be
							withheld; and of the injunction to that effect, from the Circuit Court
							of the United States might be obeyed. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rush inclined strongly to the opinion that the injunction should be
							disregarded, thinking that the Government could not with propriety
							interpose for merely private claim— I urged him however to suspend the
							payment, in compliance with the injunction, at <pb type="ms" n="18"
							/>least for a few days, and to call upon judge Macomb for a written
							statement of the grounds upon which he claims the suspension of the
							payment: and afterwards to call upon Alexander Macomb for his answer to
							the claim— I thought it highly probable that judge Macomb could not make
							out a case, which would warrant the definitive compliance with the
							injunction, but we should then have a full justification for
							disregarding it— I had a dinner party consisting of <persRef

							the subject, and advised him that it would be necessary for him to

							from <persRef ref="brackenridge-henry">judge Brackenridge</persRef> of
							Florida, upon the cultivation of the live Oak near Pensacola— It

								Wilde</persRef> a member of the House of Representatives from

							certain claims of Citizens of Georgia for indemnity from Creek Indian
							depredations, according to the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article
							of the Treaty with the Creeks of 8. January 1821— I told him that the
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">Attorney-General</persRef> having been
							with the exception of two or three days absent ever since I received the
							memorial from the Delegation, I had not yet referred the papers to him,
							as would be necessary, before coming to a decision; much of the argument
							for the revisal, resting upon a difference alledged between two opinions
							of the Attorney General heretofore given, one upon those claims of the
							Citizens of Georgia, and the other upon claims of citizens of the United
							States, of indemnity for Slaves carried away, contrary to the first
							Article of the Treaty of Ghent— The first opinion being against the
							allowance of interest, and the second in favour of it— The <persRef
								ref="eagleton-w">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Eagleton</persRef> came to solicit
							contributions, for the Southwestern Theological Seminary at Maryville,
							Tennessee. He had sent me a pamphlet and Letter upon the subject
							yesterday— The peculiarity of this among numerous mendicant
							establishments of this kind in every part of this Country is that the
							Directors of the Maryville Seminary name the sum for which they call
							from each contributor—twenty dollars— <persRef ref="mullany-james"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Mullany</persRef> belongs to
							New-York. He was a Quarter Master in the Army during the late war, but
							left it, at the <pb type="ms" n="19"/>first reduction after the Peace—
							He has accounts yet unsettled at the Treasury, and wrote me a few days
							since a Letter soliciting the appointment of Chief Clerk to the
							Treasurer. He came now to repeat the application; but I informed him
							that all the appointments of Clerks were made by the Heads of the
							respective Departments— <persRef ref="lee-william">William Lee</persRef>
								2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Auditor of the Treasury told me that
							he thought there was need of some new regulation in the public offices
							requiring a more punctual attendance of the Clerks; many of whom were
							inexcusably remiss, in the performance of their duties— Probably the
							Season, and intense heat of the weather produces some negligence—
								<persRef ref="brearly-david">Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>
								Brearley</persRef> was here— He has accompanied one party of Creek
							Indians from Georgia, to the Arkansas Territory, and is soon going to
							muster another detachment of them for that purpose: but he says they
							will not go till they are starved into another sale of their Lands,
							which must soon happen; as they will exercise no industry; and now live
							only upon what they receive from the United States— I visited my Nursery
							this afternoon— The new vegetation has ceased, and I find occasion for
							no observation, except of the decay and perishing of a great number of
							my Trees— We had this day the first Apples of the Season, and I planted
							five seeds in a small round wafer box filled with earth, to ascertain if
							they would vegetate this Summer— My Sail needle shoot in Box N. 4. is a
							Tangier Date— A second appeared this day in the same box.</p>

						<p>There was a great change in the Temperature of the atmosphere last

								<persRef ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S. Adams</persRef> returned my

								Rush</persRef> called for a few minutes but was going to attend the

							Company. The Arrangements for the ceremony of breaking ground to-morrow
							are published in the newspaper of this morning, and also a notice that
							in consequence of my attendance at that ceremony there will be no
							reception of visitors at the President’s House— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rush brought Recommendations of several persons for the
							appointments of Surveyor at New-Orleans, and of Collector at Middletown,
							Connecticut— <persRef ref="bulfinch-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bulfinch</persRef> called, and spoke of the difference

								Elgar</persRef>, the Commissioner of the Public Buildings, and
								<persRef ref="foy-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Foy</persRef>, respecting the width of the border and walk, within the
							railing, on the West side of the Capitol— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bulfinch thought with me, that they would be too narrow as proposed by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elgar; and I told him I thought they
							should be of the same width as on the Eastern side— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bulfinch said he had proposed to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Elgar, that Foy should be allowed to make
							first a small piece of the way according to his own idea; and it might
							then be determined whether it should be continued and completed in the
							same manner— <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brent</persRef> was here; and I spoke with him of the applications
							of the two Priests <persRef ref="harold-william">Harold</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="ryan-john">Ryan</persRef>, for the interposition of
							this Government, with that of the <persRef ref="leo-xii">Pope</persRef>
							to obtain the revocation of an order from his Holiness to them, to
							repair forth with from Philadelphia to Cincinnati in the State of Ohio.
							I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent to make a draft of such a
							Letter to the Cardinal Secretary of State, as would answer the views of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harold and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Ryan, and at the same time not be offensive to the papal
							Government—and I charged him with <pb type="ms" n="20"/>this duty the
							more readily, because being himself a Roman Catholic, a Letter known to
							be written by him would probably more acceptable, and more likely to be
							useful to those in whose behalf it was requested, than if written by a
							protestant— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent brought me also a
							Letter from <persRef ref="rodney-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rodney</persRef>, the Consul at the Havana, but now at Wilmington,
							Delaware, denying totally the truth of the charges against him of the
							anonymous Letter, a copy of which had been sent to him— <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> called shortly before dinner— I had some
							conversation with him upon <persRef ref="brackenridge-henry">judge
								Brackenridge’s</persRef> letter respecting the cultivation of the
							Live Oak. I also read to him the Address which I propose to deliver
							to-morrow, on breaking the ground of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal—
								<persRef ref="mercer-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mercer</persRef> called this Evening, and mentioned to me the
							definitive arrangements for the ceremony— The company to assemble
							between 7 and 8 to-morrow Morning at <persRef ref="u">Tilley’s</persRef>
							Union Hotel, in Georgetown. To walk in procession to the
							Steam-boats—then ascend the river to the first bridge and thence in
							Canal Boats to the spot where the work is to commence— Where he will
							present to me a spade; addressing me with a few sentences, occupying not
							more than five minutes— I told him that as at this time, I must expect
							that whatever I might say would be severely criticised, and
							misrepresented, I had thought proper to write what I should say, so that
							at least I might be responsible for nothing else— That deeming the work
							to be commenced of great importance to the Country and to future ages I
							thought it suitable to the occasion to give to the ceremony somewhat of
							a religious character; and I read to him the address as I proposed to
							deliver it— He approved of it altogether, though he thought the last
							paragraph, expressing good wishes for the success of the Baltimore
							Rail-road which is also to be commenced to-morrow, would not meet with
							sympathy from my hearers, as they believed that to be a rival project:
							but it was nevertheless entirely proper for me to speak thus and the
							religious cast of my address was conformable to his own Sentiments. He
							would adapt the few words that he should say on presenting me the Spade
							to the purport of my own discourse.</p>

						<p><date>4. IV:15.</date> Friday. Independence day. Chesapeake and Ohio
							Canal commenced— John 25. </p>
						<p>Between seven and eight this morning I went with my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> to the Union Hotel at Georgetown
							where were assembling the <persRef ref="mercer-charles"
								>President</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="kent-joseph;stewart-andrew;may-frederick;lenox-peter;smith-walter;janney-phineas"
								>Directors</persRef> of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company; the
								<persRef ref="gales-joseph;cox-john;mason-thomson">Mayors</persRef>
							and Committees of the Corporations of Washington, Georgetown and
							Alexandria— The Heads of Departments, foreign Ministers and a few other
							invited persons. About eight O’Clock a procession was formed preceded by
							a band of Music to the wharf where we embarked in the Steam-boat
							Surprize; followed by two others: we proceeded to the entrance of the
							Potowmack Canal, and up that in Canal boats to its head: near which,
							just within the bounds of the State of Maryland, was the spot selected
							for breaking the ground— The President of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal
							Company with a very short Address delivered to me the Spade, with which
							I broke the ground: addressing the surrounding auditory, consisting
							perhaps of two thousand persons— It happened that at the first stroke of
							the Spade, it met immediately under the surface a large stump of a tree;
							after repeating the stroke three or four times without making any
							impression, I threw off my coat, and resuming the Spade, raised a shovel
							full of the Earth, at which a general shout burst forth from the
							surrounding multitude, and I completed my Address, which occupied about
							fifteen minutes. The President and Directors of the Canal, the Mayors
							and Committees of the three Corporations; the Heads of Departments,
							members of Congress, and others followed, and shovelled up a wheelbarrow
							full of the Earth— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales the Mayor of
							Washington read also a short Address and was answered extemporaneously
							by Andrew Stewart the Director of the Company from Pennsylvania. <pb
								type="ms" n="21"/>After a short repose under a tent on the banks of
							the Canal, we returned by the Canal boats to the landing and thence in
							the Steamboat, where as we redescended the Potowmack, the company
							partook of a light Collation upon the deck— I was asked for a Toast and
							gave the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal—Perseverance.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Mercer and <persRef key="rush-richard"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> also gave toasts—
							About half past two I was landed at Davidsons wharf where my Carriage
							was waiting; and after taking M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush home I
							returned to mine.— The Marshals of the day escorted me home on
							horseback; came in and took a glass of wine, and took leave with my
							thanks for their attentions— A young man named <persRef ref="u"
								>Dorset</persRef>, from Maryland, was the only other visitor—
								<persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Huntt</persRef> and <persRef ref="hellen-thomas">Thomas J.
								Hellen</persRef> dined with us— The day was uncommonly cool for the
							Season, with a fresh breeze, and towards Evening there was a gentle
							Shower— The exertion of speaking in the open air made me hoarse, and
							with the anxiety more oppressive than it should have been to get well
							through the day, exhausted, and fatigued me so that I was disqualified
							for thought or action the remainder of the day— As has happened to me
							whenever I have had a part to perform in the presence of multitudes, I
							got through awkwardly, but without gross and palpable failure.— The
							incident that chiefly relieved me was the obstacle of the stump, which
							met and resisted the Spade, and my casting off my coat to over come the
							resistance— It struck the eye and fancy of the Spectators, more than all
							the flowers of Rhetoric in my Speech, and diverted their attention from
							the stammering and hesitation of a deficient memory— <persRef
								ref="vaughan-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Vaughan</persRef>, <persRef ref="huygens-bangeman">Chevalier
								Bangeman Huygens</persRef>, <persRef ref="krudener-paul">Barons
								Krudener</persRef> and <persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt"
								>Stackelberg</persRef>, and several other members of the Corps
							Diplomatique were present, and thought it perhaps a strange part for a
							President of the United States to perform. Governor Kent of Maryland was
							there as one of the Directors of the Company; and compared the ceremony
							to that said to be annually observed in China— I wrote a short Letter
							this Evening to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>.</p>

						<p>I am compelled to intermit my rides, and for variety of exercise took
							this morning a walk to the slashes. Found very few of the blackberries
							ripe as I was going out of the yard I met a young man who told me his
							name was <persRef ref="u">Towner</persRef>— That he belonged to
							Shepardstown, 70 miles distant from this place, in Virginia: that he had
							come all that distance to witness the ceremony of yesterday and had seen
							it; and being now about to return home he had felt a curiosity to see
							me; and having succeeded was entirely satisfied. <persRef

								Southard</persRef> called after breakfast, in some perplexity
							respecting the construction of an Act, passed at the recent Session of
							the Congress for increasing the pay of the Surgeons in the Navy. The
							phraseology of the Act, does not express the intention of Congress in
							passing it, and unless liberally construed, the intention in passing it
							cannot be fulfilled. But he had not a copy of the Act with him, and I
							had it not at hand. We spoke further of <persRef
								ref="brackenridge-henry">judge Brackenridge’s</persRef> Letter
							respecting the cultivation of the live Oak— I consented that the judge
							should be engaged to superintend the exploration of a forest of these
							trees near Pensacola; and to employ from ten to twenty men upon the
							necessary labour of clearing and dressing and taking care of the trees,
							to which I desired that planting acorns should be added. This part of

							That of the Evening was Unitarian and controversial— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks explained the meaning of the terms
							letteth and let as used in this text; that is to hinder: and the
							division of his discourse was the enumeration of the principal lets or
							hindrances to the complete success of the gospel, and of the means of
							taking them out of the way— He considered the doctrine of the Trinity,
							as the principal let, or hindrance to the universal prevalence of
							Christianity, and the text 1. John 5.7. as the principal authority for
							the doctrine of the Trinity— But he said this text was not in <persRef
								ref="griesbach-johann">Griesbach’s</persRef> Edition of the new
							Testament, and thought that was the only authentic edition extant. He
							also said that a new Translation of the Bible would be the most

							Translation would shortly be published by an eminent Scholar in
							New-England. <pb type="ms" n="23"/>He said the English Translation of
							the Scriptures now in use, was wonderfully accurate for the time when it

							compared with the very different meaning of the original. He spoke also
							with great severity of the abuses, tyranny and oppression which have
							been practised in the name of the Christian Religion: commented with
							much indignation upon the dominion of the Pope’s: and did not forget to
							notice the fate of Servetus— He administered the communion after the

							back to the United States, where he arrived some time sooner than the

						<p>The omission of my morning ride on horseback the last four days is

							around ten miles. After breakfast <persRef ref="u">M<hi

							Collector <persRef ref="wolcott-alexander">Alexander Wolcott</persRef>.
							I had received a Letter from <persRef ref="brown-jeremiah">M<hi

							application, for the appointment yesterday, warning me against the
							appointment of Henry Wolcott, as no friend to the Administration, and

							Wolcott was really for purposes directly hostile to the Administration.
							There are however numerous highly respectable recommendations <pb

							earnest one from his kinsmen the late <persRef ref="wolcott-oliver"
								>Governor Oliver Wolcott</persRef>— <persRef ref="rumney-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Rumney</persRef> was from
							Alexandria, and applied for an appointment as keeper of a light-House.
							His qualifications were his wants— He lost his house by the fire in
							Alexandria, of January 1827. <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> was here and spoke of a

									>l.</hi> Gratiot</persRef> and <persRef ref="babcock-samuel"
								>Major Babcock</persRef> of the Engineer Corps, upon the repairs
							necessary to the Brandywine Light-House in Delaware river—there is an
							appropriation for it by Congress of 10000 dollars; and these engineers
							estimate the cost of them, at more than 90.000. We thought it best to
							suspend the expenditure, of any part of the appropriation, till Congress
							shall have the opportunity of revising it. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rush mentioned also a complaint of a person at Wilmington,
							Delaware to <persRef ref="mclane-allen">Allan M’Lane</persRef> the
							Collector, transmitted by him to the Treasury Department, that the Piers
							at Newcastle which belong to the United States, are exclusively
							occupied, by the Newcastle and Frenchtown Steamboats, whereby the
							merchant vessels, for the accommodation of which the Piers were
							originally intended, are deprived of the use of them. The exclusive use
							of the Piers by the Steam-boats is not allowable; but to exclude them
							from such use would be a great inconvenience to all the travellers by
							that conveyance; and consequently to the Public— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush that I suspected there were politics
							in this movement, and that <persRef ref="mclane-louis">Louis

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pleasonton</persRef> in the
							first instance to write to the proprietors of the Steam-boats, and
							ascertain by what authority they have occupied the Piers; which it
							seemed to me they should not do gratuitously; and we may proceed
							according to the answer which may be received to this enquiry. We had
							also some conversation respecting the appointment of a Collector at
							Middletown— There was this afternoon a menacing thunder shower, which
							passed principally to the Northward of the City— The plants in my
							Tumblers have all failed, from overwatering, and the want of a drain at

						<p>The morning was so cool that I omitted the river bath and rode round by
							the Rock Creek Church; returning by a road over which I had never before
							been— <persRef ref="matthews-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Matthews</persRef> the Roman Catholic Priest came with the <persRef ref="feiner-william">Rev<hi
								rend="superscript">d</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wheeler</persRef> now
							President of the College at Georgetown, with which is connected the
							female School of the Visitation Nuns. There is to be an exhibition there
							the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month at 3. P.M. and they
							came to invite me to attend and to crown the two young Ladies who are to
							receive this distinction for their merits— They invited also the
							attendance of <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Watkins</persRef> introduced <persRef ref="shields-william2"
								>Lieutenant Shields</persRef> of the Navy, just from Boston, where
							he arrived on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>in the frigate
							Constitution, from the Squadron in the Mediterranean— <persRef
								ref="owen-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Owen</persRef> the
							member of the House <pb type="ms" n="27"/>of Representatives from
							Alabama, came to intercede, in behalf of <persRef ref="drake-john2"
								>Cadet John N. Drake</persRef> of that State, one of twenty found
							deficient at the general examination last Month, and recommended for
							dismission— The report is favourable with regard to his Habits of Study,
							General conduct, and military propensity, but declares him deficient in
							the Mathematics, and of indifferent aptitude— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Owen wishes that he may be allowed to remain at the Academy
							in the Class next below that to which he belonged, and he said that the
							State of Alabama, had not her full proportion of Cadets at the
							Institution. I told him I could not allow much weight to that as a
							reason for retaining an incompetent pupil: but that I would readily
							assent to his remaining, if there were precedents for the indulgence. A
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gilroy</persRef>
							came to say that he was going upon business of his own to Quebec: but as
							the expenses of the journey would be burdensome to him, he offered
							himself as a Messenger to carry despatches: for which I informed him
							there was no present, or probably proximate occasion. He said <persRef
								ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt</persRef>
							would recommend him. <persRef ref="porter-peter">General
								Porter</persRef> brought the Treaty of January 1826. with the Creek
							Indians—the subsequent Act of Congress of May 1826 making an
							appropriation for the removal of those Indians West of the Mississippi,
							within two years, and the Act of 9. May last, making a further
							appropriation of 50000 dollars, for the object; but without extending
							the time; the two years having expired, the question is whether by the
							last Act of appropriation the agency can be continued, and the monies
							applied to defray the expenses of removal of other parties of the
							Creeks— I had no doubt that the new Appropriation was an implied
							extension of the Time, and shall understand the Law, accordingly—
							General Porter told me that upon the question of form, of the order
							announcing the appointment of Cadets to Lieutenancies in the Army, He
							thought <persRef ref="jones-roger">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.
								</hi>Jones’s</persRef> views were correct, and that the Orders
							should issue directly from the Department of War— I was of the same
							opinion, and desired General Porter to see <persRef
								ref="macomb-alexander">General Macomb</persRef>, and make known to
							him our impressions on the subject. A person by the name of <persRef
								ref="u">Leland</persRef> came to repeat an application which he had
							made some days since for a loan of money— I declined. <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>
							called for a few minutes; going to attend a Meeting of the Stockholders
							of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal— They are now getting into difficulties
							between the conflicting local interests of Washington and Georgetown,
							and the question whether a new Canal in the City, shall be undertaken as
							a part of the main Canal, or must be a separate and distinct undertaking
							of the City itself. <persRef ref="vaughan-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan</persRef> the British Minister
							called this day, to introduce the Bishop of Nova Scotia, <persRef

							with his family, and <persRef ref="halliburton-brenton">Judge
								Halliburton</persRef>; but I could not receive them— They are to
							leave the City to-morrow. A second Tangier Orange appeared in Pot N. 1.
							an 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> in Pot N. 4. and 2. Oranges in
							Tumbler N. 3.— Visited the Garden this Morning and the Nursery after
							dinner. There are ten Pine-Apples coming up in Pot N. 11. and I found
							the largest of my box Orange-trees, blistered all over the stem, and
							covered with small and almost imperceptible Ants. The Coffee kernels
							have now but just opened their leaves. The Tangier fig cuttings have all
							failed and 15 of the 17 vine cuttings have succeeded. In the Nursery I
							counted the Hickory Walnuts round the borders. North 58. West 0. South
							54 East 13 = 125. One fresh Cork Oak appears, and three are dead.
								<persRef ref="foy-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>I enter this day upon the sixty-second year of my age; a life already
							longer than is enjoyed by three fourths of the human-race— The first
							sentiment suitable to the day, is of gratitude for this mercy—the next a
							deep conviction of the duty of applying the short remnant of days that I
							can expect to purposes such as the task master may approve. The third a
							supplication for favour and fortitude from above— My ride this morning
							was abridged by finding the tide so high at the passage of the Rock
							Creek Bridge near Kalorama, that we turned back without attempting to
							pass it. <persRef ref="porter-peter">General Porter</persRef> came and
							took the papers relating to the Land Treaty with the Seneca Indians now
							in controversy. No report having yet been received from the Commissioner
							appointed last May, <persRef ref="livingston-r">R. M.

							to Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							<persRef ref="ogden-thomas">Ogden</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="troup-robert">Troup</persRef> is to be postponed. General
							Porter thought that according to the desire of <persRef
								ref="owen-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Owen</persRef> of
							Alabama, the <persRef ref="drake-john2">Cadet Drake</persRef> might be
							retained at West Point in the Class below that in which he was
							admitted—to this I assented— General Porter afterwards came and
							introduced <persRef ref="cramer-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Cramer</persRef>, a member of the
							Senate of New-York, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rogers</persRef> a member
							of their House of Assembly— <persRef ref="bulfinch-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bulfinch</persRef> came, with two
							written inscriptions for the Base of the Pediment of the Capitol. The
							object was to give simply the date of the commencement of the building,
							and that of its being finished— But recent as the Event is, there is no
							record of the day when it was commenced—the books of the Commissioners
							only shewing that it was between July and October 1793. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bulfinch said that <persRef ref="foy-john"
								>Foy</persRef> had begun the work of the border and walk round the
							western side of the Capitol, and that it was quite satisfactory—
								<persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gales</persRef>, Mayor of the City, came with <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph2">his father</persRef>, a visitor here from
							Raleigh, North Carolina, on account of the very dangerous illness of his
							daughter <persRef ref="seaton-sarah2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Seaton</persRef>. The Mayor spoke to me of an application two years
							since from the City authorities, for a new Survey of the City, by
							Engineers of the United States and under the authority of the General
							Government— The recollection of the former application had escaped me—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales said he would send me a written
							statement of the reasons which rendered a new survey in the opinion of
							the City Government necessary. He also spoke of the recent movements in
							South Carolina, tending to civil war and a dissolution of the Union—and
							to a call in Kentucky upon <persRef ref="rowan-john">John
								Rowan</persRef> one of the Senators from that State, to account for
							opinions openly avowed by him since his return from this City, that in
							the event of the re-election of the present President of the United
							States the next Congress would be the last that would ever assemble.
							These blusterings of the South-Carolina politicians about the
							dissolution of the Union, are used for the purpose of carrying the
							election by intimidation; or if they fail in that, of laying the
							foundation for forcible resistance to the Laws, to break down or overawe
							the administration after the event— It is the counterpart to the
							New-England dissolution project which began with the purchase of
							Louisiana, and ended by the Hartford Convention— <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> called to take leave;
							going for home to-morrow intending to be here again the 23<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> and 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							this Month, and to embark from New-York the first of the next— He
							mentioned that among the papers furnished him there was no full power;
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> having supposed that there would be no immediate
							occasion for the Negotiation of any Treaty; but he thought that possibly
							a Negotiation might be proposed by the British Government, in which case
								<pb type="ms" n="29"/>he said he should be awkwardly situated; and I
							told him that I would direct <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> to have one made out
							for him— <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> who has been several days unwell, confined to his
							house brought me the proceedings extremely voluminous of a Court of
							Enquiry, upon the conduct of <persRef ref="percival-john">Lieutenant
								Percival</persRef> of the Navy at the Sandwich Islands— I had
							received two days since a long Report of <persRef ref="parker-samuel"
								>Samuel D. Parker</persRef>, who was employed as Counsel, by the
							Board of Foreign Missions, against Percival. It is made to <persRef
								ref="hubbard-samuel2">Samuel Hubbard</persRef> the President of the
							Board, and contains much insinuation, and some complaint against the
							proceedings of the Court of Enquiry— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Southard took this paper with him— <persRef ref="thumblert-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thumlert</persRef> came to enquire if
							I had any answer for his Letter, transmitted through <persRef

						<p>We took a ride this morning of about 14 Miles, with which I was more than

								ref="addicks-barbara">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								O’Sullivan</persRef> came again with her tale of misery and
							distress, her children, her man’s attire and her book for which she is
							soliciting subscriptions— It is a difficult thing to persevere in
							kindness with a half-insane man—with a half-insane woman, impossible.
							She wrote me a long Letter some days since offering if I would supply
							her wants of money to resume her female raiment. I now told her that I
							knew not why she renewed her applications to me as I had several months
							since given her a definitive answer, more than once repeated— She said
							she was sensible of the extreme prejudices in this Country against her
							male cloathing, and I told her that I partook of those prejudices. I
							gave her a five dollar bill, and intreated her not to come to me again—
								<persRef ref="cutts-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cutts</persRef> came to recommend earnestly <persRef ref="nye-seth"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nye</persRef>, who is here, and

							He spoke also of the account produced by <persRef ref="tharp-william"
								>William Tharp</persRef>, and authenticated before a Magistrate,
							with the date of 1814. while the Water-mark on the paper is of 1818—
							Tharp had offered and insisted upon taking his Oath before a magistrate
							that the date on the paper was true, before Cutts told him of the
							water-mark—of which he has not pretended to give any explanation. Cutts
							said he proposed to put the paper into the hands of the U.S. District

								<persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Kenney’s</persRef> Account which is not yet settled, and shewed me
							a fresh Letter from M’Kenney, who prefers leaving the account unsettled
							to authenticating his charges by his own Oath, and talks of appealing to
							Congress. <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brent</persRef> of the Department of State came for despatches

							Valparaiso 13. April, and from <persRef ref="forbes-john">J. M.
								Forbes</persRef> at Buenos-Ayres of 9. May— He brought also the

							consenting to its ratification, which he observed took no notice of the
							Supplementary Articles; but as they are declared explicitly to form a
							part of the Treaty, there was no necessity for special notice of them in

								Porter</persRef> was here again, upon the form of the Order,
							announcing the appointment of the graduated <pb type="ms" n="30"/>Cadets
							to brevet second Lieutenancies in the army. He thought the order should

						<p><date>13. V.</date> Sunday.</p>
						<p>Heard <persRef ref="brooks-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brooks</persRef> from Romans 8.5.6. [“]For they that are after the
							flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the
							Spirit, the things of the Spirit— For to be carnally minded is Death:
							but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.” a more impressive
							discourse than any other I had ever heard from M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Brooks— It consisted principally of a characteristic
							delineation, of human characters—dividing men into three classes. The
							sensual man, the intellectual man, and the pure Christian— His picture
							of the sensualist was frightful; tracing him through all the vices and
							crimes incident to his propensities and indulgences— By the intellectual
							man, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks intended the philosophical
							infidel, who reasons himself out of the belief of religion and a future
							State. He treated this person with a more tender hand, but still
							represented him as the destroyer of his own happiness, and the victim of
							his own perversity. The portrait of the sincere and upright Christian
							was contrasted with both the others, and was drawn with a skilful hand
							and a warm heart. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks like most of the
							preachers of his denomination addresses himself almost exclusively to
							the benevolent affections of his hearers— There is a lack of acids and
							of stimulants in their composition— This objection did not apply to the
							late <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Little</persRef>— His doctrine was full of kindness and benevolence;
							but he was often tart and pungent in his manner of supporting it— There
							was a collection taken up in aid of the funds of the Colonization
							Society, preceded by a few words of exhortation from the preacher. In
							the Evening M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks’s text was from
							Philippians 3.20 “For our conversation is in Heaven”—in which I heard
							not much to retain— There were in the course of this day two or three
							light thunder showers— I wrote to <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> and found the Letters and papers from <persRef
								ref="offley-david">David Offley</persRef>, upon which it is
							necessary that I should occupy myself seriously— My observations on my
							growing plants are now almost confined to the shooting up of oranges and
							lemons an 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Lemon appears this day in Pot
							N. 9. A 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> in Pot N. 8. and a 9<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> Tangier Orange in Pot N. 4. The
							difference in the first appearance of the lemon from that of the orange
							is noticeable. The seed leaves of the lemon are more formed on coming
							out of the ground, and I see as yet no twin stems from one seed; as
							almost always happens to the Orange. I have made one more experiment,

							spoke of the exploring expedition recommended by a Resolution of the
							House of Representatives at their last Session, and of the resurvey to
							be made for fixing the place of the Delaware-Bay Breakwater. Rodgers
							suggested many difficulties to the fitting out of the expedition during
							the present year; and particularly that there was no vessel in the Navy
							suited to the service: all the Sloops of War being too large, and the
							Schooners too small—none of the Sloops of War can be fitted out in less
							than 70 days, and with great difficulty in less than 90— The Hornet, the
							Erie, the Lexington, and the new Sloop now building here, called the
							Vandalia were successively considered, and all found liable to great
							objection. But I earnestly urged that the expedition should at all
							Events be despatched. I have a deep anxiety that this expedition should
							be undertaken, and as far as possible executed under the present
							Administration, and I observe that the next year we might not, as it is
							in my own mind certain that we shall not have the opportunity— The

							was the <pb type="ms" n="32"/>origin of his name of Jackson— That in

						<p>I substitute the Shower and Tub bath, for swimming in the river, and the

							health as I had hoped it would be; but perhaps sustains me from sinking
							at this Season altogether. <persRef ref="graham-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Graham</persRef> came to ask if
							I had decided upon a claim of his for compensation for certain
							extra-services which has been several months before me— The principal
							objection to its allowance is that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham
							himself at the time when he was performing the service, gave <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							That he was when he gave the assurance to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford, receiving a Salary of 2000 dollars a year, and waved a claim
							for extra pay. His demand now is for an allowance for the same services
							after the Salary had ceased— I promised to reconsider the papers, and
							then to come to a decision— He spoke again about employing <persRef
								ref="white-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White</persRef>
							the Delegate from Florida to assist the Attorney General, upon the
							appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, on the contested Land Claims from

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury</persRef> brought me to sign a

							was then absent on service abroad. <persRef ref="ogden-aaron">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l</hi> Ogden</persRef> the Secretary to the
							Slave indemnity Commissioners was here— This is the day to which their
							meeting was adjourned, but he said neither of them had yet arrived—
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> consulted me with regard to the construction of
							an Act of Congress passed at their last Session 24 May 1828. the object
							of which was to increase the pay of Surgeons in the Navy. Its title is
							an Act for the better organization of the Medical Department of the Navy
							of the United States. It first provides that no person shall be
							appointed an assistant Surgeon, till after examination and approval by a
							Board of Naval Surgeons—and that no person shall be appointed a Surgeon,
							till after two years Service at Sea, as an assistant Surgeon, and having
							passed an examination— It afterwards provides a graduated <pb type="ms"
								n="33"/>increase of pay and rations, after 5, 10. and 20 years
							Service, for Surgeons appointed as prescribed by the Act— The question
							was whether this could be construed to extend to the old Surgeons,
							appointed before the passage of the Act. I thought upon full examination
							that it could not, though M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard was
							sure that the intention of Congress was that it should. This intention
							however was not discoverable either in the Letter, or in the apparent
							Spirit of the Law— I advised M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard to
							wait for an explanatory or amendatory Law at the next Session of
							Congress— In the Garden this morning I found a new Plant up in the
							mimosa box; and 16 Pines in Pot N. 11. Trimm’d an Althea, and two wild
							Cherries. Found the tall Plum tree 3 feet 1. inch high— In the Nursery
							this afternoon I found 104 young Peach trees and 13 Button woods— The
							last though late up, promise quick and luxuriant vegetation— The Oaks,
							Walnuts and Chesnuts have apparently ceased raising their Stems; the
							tallest being from 10 to 14 inches long— There are besides the Cork
							Oaks, only three apparent varieties of Oak, from the shape of their
							leaves and stem— The Chesnut Oak—the laurel Oak—which I at first mistook
							for the willow Oak, and seemingly the bear oak, which rises only two or
							three inches from the ground, and puts forth very small leaves—
							Showery.</p>

								M’Kenney</persRef> came with a long Story about his account. The
							lying newspaper of this place, it seems has yesterday an attack upon me
							on the pretence that I had given my sanction to that account—while in
							fact it is not settled yet— M’Kenney has been a very useful and
							efficient Officer in the Indian Department, and rendered very important
							service on that Mission— But he is loose and irregular in all money
							concerns, and was particularly so on that occasion— The amount claimed
							by him including his travelling expenses and presents to the Indians was
							but about 5000 dollars; but in his first account, his charges were not
							specific; and whom positively required to specify them, he made an
							account claiming more than he had at first— The Comptroller <persRef
								ref="cutts-richard">Cutts</persRef>, of course refused to pass it,
							and M’Kenney commences an abusive and threatening correspondence with
							him, and appeals time after time to me— Cutts finally determined to
							allow the account as first charged, M’Kenney making his own Affidavit to
							the expenditures for which he produced no voucher.— This I approved; but
							M’Kenney has vehement objections against it, and now complained of it as
							a great hardship upon him; because it had not been customary. He gave me
							a history of his misfortunes and distresses, representing his pecuniary
							embarrassments as having arisen solely from his engagements for
							others—the important services of his Indian Negotiations— The allowance
							of his Accounts by <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor
								Barbour</persRef> and <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef>, and his great
							necessity for money, all which was persuasive and fascinating; but I
							told him that I had as President, no power to controul the accounting
							Officers of the Treasury— That so far as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cutts had consulted me for advice, I had recommended that he should
							require specific items to the account, and that where there were no
							vouchers he should give his affidavit for the amount at least of his
							expenditures and I could by no means comprehend the policy or justice of
							a second account of larger amount than the first. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard and <persRef ref="porter-peter"
								>General Porter</persRef> were here together. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard was desirous of obtaining some
							evidence of my opinions concerning the encouragement of <pb type="ms"
								n="34"/>domestic manufacturers and the Tariff. I read to him my
							Letter to <persRef ref="walsh-robert">R. Walsh</persRef> of 16 March
							1824— General Porter mentioned that he had been examining the various
							branches of the Service in the War Department, and particularly that of
							intercourse with the Indians which he thought would require a system of
							regulations— He had thought of inviting <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Gov<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Cass</persRef> of Michigan, and
								<persRef ref="clark-william">General Clark</persRef> of Missouri to
							come to this City, to assist in forming such a system— I advised that he
							should first write to them, and ask their general views on the subject
							in writing; after which if it should be found expedient they may be
							invited here— He said he would take this course— He has a Report from
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Livingston</persRef>; the occasional agent to the New-York Seneca
							Indians. <persRef ref="redjacket">Red Jacket</persRef> has been
							reinstated as a Chief, and the removal of the remnant of the Tribe to
							Green Bay becomes more questionable— <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> brought a Letter from
								<persRef ref="cheves-langdon">Langdon Cheves</persRef>, resigning
							his Seat as a Slave Indemnity Commissioner, because he is detained by a

							brought me a Letter of recommendation from <persRef ref="mercer-charles"
								>C. F. Mercer</persRef>, and applied for the appointment of Chief

						<p>In the Garden I trimmed several Peach and wild cherry trees; and weeded

							In the Nursery there are 64 Pear stocks from the seed, in four Rows— The
							vegetation of the Tulip Trees is very remarkable. They have yet scarcely
							any stem; but put forth their Lyrate leaves on long peduncles. The
							leaves are smooth and delicate, and of the most beautiful Pea-green. But
							the nightly insect fastens upon and devours most of them even before
							they are full formed. As yet the five in the Nursery have survived their
							attacks— The Chesnut leaves suffer also severely from these Insects. The
							Button woods are shooting into luxuriance— I had this morning a visit
							from <persRef ref="pleasants-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pleasants</persRef> and <persRef ref="sewell-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Seawell</persRef> the Slave indemnity
							Commissioners; <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Brent</persRef> of the Department came with them. They
							are desirous rather of waiting for the recovery of <persRef
								ref="cheves-langdon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cheves</persRef>, than that a new Commissioner should be appointed in
							his stead— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seawell thought that if M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cheves should arrive here in four weeks
							from this day there would be no delay in the business of the Board— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pleasants thought there might be some
							delay; but less than would inevitably follow from the appointment of a
							new Commissioner— The term of existence of the Commission itself is
							limited to the first of September— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cheves
							writes that he was on his way to his residence at Lancaster
							Pennsylvania, intending to proceed thence to this place to the adjourned
							meeting of the Commissioners at this place when he was taken ill with a
							bilious fever in New-Jersey; and that his physician informed him that he
							could not safely move from that place in less than eight or ten days
							from the date of his Letter, 14 July. He assigns no other reason for
							resigning; but there have been conflicts <pb type="ms" n="35"/>of
							opinion between him and the two other Commissioners, and he may have
							other motives for resigning than his illness— I therefore desired M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent to write to him, and request him if
							he can reach here within three or even four weeks to continue in the
							Commission, considering the inconvenience that must attend the
							appointment of a new Commissioner at this late Stage of the Commission.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seawell was under much excitement at

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean</persRef> the Postmaster
							General was here concerning the appointment of a Postmaster at Maysville
							Kentucky— Many recommendations in favour of the brother of the late
							Postmaster’s widow, who gives out verbally that he will if appointed
							apply the profits of the Office to her and her children’s support— A
							precarious reliance— I advised the appointment of <persRef
								ref="langhorne-maurice">Maurice Langhorne</persRef>. I spoke of the
							proceedings relating to the delinquency of the late Postmaster at
							Philadelphia, <persRef ref="bache-richard">Richard Bache</persRef>; and
							expressed my strong disapprobation of the proceedings of the
							confidential Agent <persRef ref="simpson-presley">Simpson</persRef> up
							on his own statement— Two of Baches Bonds are now sued, but the Bondsmen
							are worth nothing— The Bond upon which <persRef ref="ingham-samuel">S.
								D. Ingham</persRef> is one of the sureties has not been sued because
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham is not yet wholly recovered
							from a long and dangerous illness a nervous fever. A Sentiment of
							tenderness for this man’s condition, worthless, malicious and profligate
							as he is restrains me from rigorous treatment of him at this time— The
							Postmaster General barely mentioned the Office at Portland, where an
							appointment is yet to be made; and he said he expected to be obliged in
							a few days to remove the Postmaster at Raleigh North-Carolina, upon whom
							strong suspicions rested for much money lost at the Office— <persRef
								ref="kingston-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stephen
								Kingston</persRef> of Philadelphia called to see me, and to

						<p>There are in the Eastern Seedling bed twelve Peach trees which had come

								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April I had transplanted as a
							Northern border to this bed— They have grown exceedingly well, and are

							them all a bend towards the South. I asked <persRef ref="ousley-john"
								>Ouseley</persRef> this morning to bank up the ground at their feet;
							to restore them to the true perpendicular: which he said he would. The
							troublesome weed at this time is the purslain; I pluck it up with the
							hand. Next Summer I propose to work with the Spade; an exercise I
							suppose as good as riding on horseback or swimming. It is too late to
							begin, here, where this Season is the last that I shall have for making
							my observations, and where my first experiments have succeeded beyond
							all possible expectation— All the observations upon the first shooting
							and growth of upwards of twenty fruit and forest trees are made— There
							is now from day to day no perceptible difference in them. About the last
							of October will be the Time for marking the height, attained by the most
							<unclear>thrifty</unclear> of each kind— I found this afternoon in the Nursery one new
							Tree heaving up the Earth to come out, and I suppose there will be such
							Stragglers the whole Summer, but only occasionally here and there one. I
							found 64 Pear trees in four rows, 84. Apples in 12. Rows, 120 Persimons,
								<pb type="ms" n="36"/>113 wild Cherries, and I think 3 white
							mulberries, of which <persRef ref="foy-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Foy</persRef> had sown a quantity of seeds, and had
							despaired of their coming up— The Oaks attract most of my attention—many
							of them have made two shoots already this Season—Many only one— Some of
							them have large, others very small leaves— Almost all now look sickly—
								<persRef ref="duhamel-henri">Duhamel</persRef> says that all trees
							at the putting forth of their second leaves, have a severe disease— My
							boxes and Pots produce now nothing new but Tangier Orange and Lemon
							seeds— The dates and the apricot are teazing; and neither the seeds of
							gooseberries, Strawberries, Raspberries or Currents will vegetate— A man
							named <persRef ref="lengss-magnes">Magnes Lengss</persRef>, styling
							himself a Soldier and Sailor of the late War came to give an account of
							himself and to plead for Charity. <persRef ref="bouligny-charles">M<hi

							He said both <persRef ref="u">Brainard</persRef> and <persRef

								<persRef ref="johnson-henry">Henry Johnso</persRef>n the present

								>Derbigny</persRef> probably the next Governor was for Brainard—both

								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							and paying into the Treasury, monies proceeding from the Indian
							factories, after the abolition in 1822. of the Indian trading

						<p><date>20. IV:30.</date> Sunday. Baths.</p>
						<p>Heard <persRef ref="lothrop-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lothrop</persRef>, a young man from the Theological School at
							Cambridge. His morning text was from John 11.25. “Jesus said unto her, I
							am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he
							were dead, yet shall he live.” The subject was the immortality of the
							Soul— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lothrop is a young man, who now
							commences preaching; and he begins with high matter. The miracle of the
							Resurrection of <persRef ref="lazarus">Lazarus</persRef> from the dead
							was performed, as Jesus declared, that the People who stood by might
							believe that he was sent by God— It was to give credence to his mission—
							But the resurrection of Lazarus, has no analogy to the immortality of
							the Spirit, or to the resurrection of the last day— Lazarus was a
							mortal, restored to mortal life—and the language of Jesus when he said I
							am the Resurrection and the Life was eminently figurative— The
							distinction between the occasional revival of a dead man, and the
							endless life of immortality was forcibly drawn by Jesus; who said first
							he that believeth in me, though he were dead yet shall he live: this was
							the case of Lazarus—but he added whosoever liveth and believeth in me
							shall never die— This has reference to the immortality of the Soul— The
							Christian doctrine of the final resurrection applies it to the body; but
							a purified, glorified, spiritualized incorruptible body—not subject to
							the Laws of matter: not abiding upon the earth or in the earth; dwelling
							not in any of the Planets, nor in any of the fixed Stars—but in Heaven,
							that is indefinitely somewhere in the firmament— It is a fearful and a
							wonderful contemplation— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lothrop’s
							discourse was well written, but delivered in too low a voice, and
							without sufficient animation— He considered the doctrine of the
							immortality of the Soul, as supported by probabilities by the light of
							Nature; but as unequivocally proved and rendered certain by the gospel.
							With the authority of the Scripture he represented the condition of the
							Soul in the future State as permanent—unchangeable—happy—social and
							active—but whether attended with a consciousness of its previous
							existence in the flesh, he did not expound— The <pb type="ms" n="38"
							/>Evening Sermon was from Matthew 13–31. [“]Another parable put he forth
							unto them, saying, The kingdom of Heaven is like to a grain of mustard
							seed, which a man took and sowed in his field: 32– Which indeed is the
							least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among
							herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge
							in the branches thereof.” I occupied part of this day in finishing the
							preparation of the papers for <persRef ref="crane-william">Captain
								Crane</persRef> and <persRef ref="offley-david">David
								Offley</persRef>— And I wrote four lines in the Album of a boy at
							New-York who desires me to address him in returning the Book by the name
							of <persRef ref="rapsley-hargrave">Hargrave Rapsley</persRef>— There was
							on one page of the book a paragraph of moral reflections on the approach
							of Death; dated November 1827. and pencil marked in the margin with the
							name of <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt C</persRef>— I wrote four
							lines on the back of this page</p>

							leave exposed to the radiance of the Sun, nothing has come up, but
							Oranges, and two Cucumber vines self planted, one of which I plucked up
							and suffered the other to grow. The Sun turns the corner of the house
							before 11—in the morning and then barely comes in till about 2 PM. at
							the South windows— But it has killed all the Oranges but two that had
							come up in that box— The box N. 5. has also been exposed to the Sun. The
							growth of white mustard seed in it has not been killed, but almost daily
							prostrated and finally stunted by it. But the mustard seed plants have
							sheltered four orange seeds which have come up in it; though their
							growth is much checked. Box N. 4. has been carefully and constantly
							sheltered from the Sun, but when the Sun is off, exposed as much as
							possible to the air— It contains ten oranges—four Dates an Althea, and
							an Apricot, and no plant that came up in it has died. <persRef

							full of disappointments and among the most mortifying of them to me, has
							been the misconduct of persons whom I have peculiarly befriended. This
							case of English is one of the most mortifying that have occurred— I have
							repeatedly procured employment for him in the public service, and
							notwithstanding his excentricities approaching to insanity have
							continued to favour him till now. I can now no longer sustain him— In

						<p><persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit’s</persRef> Thermometer at 90—one of the effects of which is to

							that they were informed, that <persRef ref="cheves-langdon">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cheves</persRef> had resigned his Seat
							at <pb type="ms" n="43"/>that board, and urging very earnestly the

								ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef>
							brought me the reply this morning received from M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cheves to the Letter which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brent at my request had written to him, urging him still to retain his
							Seat; if he could come on in two or three weeks— He persists in
							tendering his resignation— Says his Physicians now forbid him to leave
							Lambertsville, the place where he is detained, in less than three weeks,
							and that even then he will be utterly unable to attend to business of
							any kind. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Coxe’s memorial did not
							recommend any individual, but he told me the claimants would unanimously
							be satisfied with the appointment of <persRef ref="ogden-aaron">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Aaron Ogden</persRef>, now Clerk to
							the Commissioners. <persRef ref="pleasants-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pleasants</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="sewell-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seawell</persRef>
							were also here, and were both very averse to the appointment of a new
							Commissioner— The memorial argues that it is doubtful whether the
							decisions of two Commissioners would be legal; but contends more
							fervently for the right of a third commissioner, in the event of a
							disagreement between the two. <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>, the Attorney General
							was afterwards here; and he has been concerned as Counsel for several of
							the Virginia Claimants— He was also much opposed to the appointment of a
							third Commissioner, which he thought altogether unnecessary— There have
							been one or two questions decided by the Commissioners now acting,
							against the opinion of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cheves, favouring
							the claims of persons residing in Maryland, Virginia, and
							North-Carolina, and thereby reducing the amount allowed to the more
							Southern claimants— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cheves a native of
							South-Carolina, domiciliated in Pennsylvania, favoured the Southern-most
							portion of the claimants; and if they lose their supporter in him I
							should feel myself bound to supply his place by a Commissioner from the
							same quarter of the Union with him or at least entertaining the same
							opinions on the points controverted between the Commissioners— The two
							acting Commissioners, however do not anticipate any difference of
							opinion between them as likely to arise during the remainder of the
							continuance of the Commission, which is limited to the first of
							September next— I therefore determined to postpone accepting the
							resignation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cheves, so long as there
							shall be no division of opinion between the two Commissioners now in
							Session— But if they should disagree; so as to require a third
							Commissioner to make a majority then I will accept the resignation of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cheves and appoint a third
							Commissioner at the same time— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt spoke
							with me also concerning the proposal of the <persRef ref="graham-george"
								>Commissioner of the General Land Office</persRef>, to employ
								<persRef ref="white-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								White</persRef> the Delegate from Florida as assistant Counsel in
							the Land cases; and concerning M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White’s
							own proposals, which he thought were not acceptable— I desired him to
							give me his opinion upon the subject in writing, which he promised.
								<persRef ref="lovell-joseph">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lovell</persRef> came to speak of <persRef ref="english-george">G.
								B. English</persRef>, who is now sober, and in deep consternation at
							the loss of his place. Lovell said that English’s drunken fit might
							perhaps have been a casualty and not a habit— He promised to observe his
							conduct closely for some time to come, and interceded in his behalf, if
							there should be no repetition of his offence. English himself was here,
							and I told him of the reasons which had induced me to revoke his
							appointment— He could not deny the facts, but solemnly pledged himself
							that no such Event should ever happen again— I told him that confidence
							so shaken could not be restored but by Time— That if after several
							months of experience, it should be in my power to serve him I should be
							gratified to do it.— But that Time was essentially <pb type="ms" n="44"
							/>necessary to redeem the character which could alone justify me in
							giving him employment in the public service. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Brent and <persRef ref="porter-peter">General
								Porter</persRef> were here upon business of their respective
							Departments— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent making the necessary

								ref="shelby-thomas">T. H. Shelby</persRef>, republished from
							Kentucky papers in the National Journal of yesterday. This demand was
							made in minatory language, and with a lying charge of partiality in the
							late Secretary of War, in cases of similar demands made upon him—
							General Porter expressed a doubt whether he should answer this Letter at
							all—but shewed me a draft of an answer, which he had written— It
							declared a readiness to furnish inspection or copies of any documents to
							persons having any right to claim them; but declined granting them in
							this instance on account of the reflections in Green’s Letter upon
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef>, with some
							argument to justify this course. I thought it would be better after the
							first sentence to say that the tenour of Green’s Letter was such as
							forbade the compliance with his request, and the holding any further
							communication with him— <persRef ref="passet-p">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>With my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>, <persRef

								ref="giusta-antoine">Antoine</persRef>, I crossed the river in our

							so deceptive that after diving from the boat, as I supposed within a ten
							minutes swim of the shore, before reaching half the distance I found
							myself so fatigued that I called the boat to me, and clung to her, till
							she was rowed to the shore. We had crossed nearly opposite to the Tiber
							point and were annoyed with leaches and ticks at the landing— The
							decline of my health is in nothing so closely brought to my conviction,
							as in my inability to swim more than 15 or 20 minutes without tiring—
							This was the day of most overpowering heat that we have had this Season.
							My thermometer at 90. and the afternoon and evening calm— I attended the
							morning service at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, and
							heard <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read prayers for the 8<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity, and preach from Proverbs 14.8 “The
							wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of fools
							is deceit.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley made this text a theme
							for descanting upon the terrors of a future State and the dangers of the
							judgment to come— But like a very large proportion of the Proverbs it is
							a maxim merely prudential— The translation of this text is probably
							imperfect— The antithesis is not in striking contrast between its parts—
							Throughout the whole book of Proverbs, the wise and the righteous man
							are considered as identical and the fool is generally synonymous with
							the wicked— The first part of this sentence presents an idea
							sufficiently clear and instructive— But if the wisdom of the prudent is
							to understand his way, it would seem that the counterpart to the thought
							should be that the folly of fools is self deception: and this I suppose
							to be the meaning of the text in the original language. The man who
							deceives himself does not understand his way, and the deceit which is
							the folly of fools, is that which they practice upon themselves, and
							which disables them from understanding their way. In the Proverbs of
								<persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef> there is a great fund of
							worldly wisdom, the foundation of which is laid in the wisdom which is
							from above—in piety to God— There is no other genuine wisdom—all else is
							self-deception the folly of fools— <persRef ref="tucker-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Tucker</persRef> formerly a
							member of the House of Representatives from Virginia, and now a
							professor at the University of Virginia, called and paid me a visit.
							They have a vacation at the University, and he is making a northern
							excursion in the interval— After dinner I rode with the Ladies round by
							the Navy-yard. The excessive heat prevented my attendance at Church.</p>

						<p>There was a shower in the Night with Thunder, and a change in the

								Collins</persRef> came, I recollect not upon what errand— <persRef
								ref="carter-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carter</persRef>,
							to make a transient visit: he is a member of the House of
							Representatives from South-Carolina, travelling northward for a Summer
							excursion— <persRef ref="wilson-john4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wilson</persRef> is a dismissed deputy land-Surveyor who came for
							two purposes; first to appeal from a decision of the Secretary of the
							Treasury <pb type="ms" n="46"/>upon some claim in the settlement of his
							Accounts, and the second was to apply for an appointment as Commissioner
							or Surveyor for running the boundary line, between the State of
							Louisiana and the Territory of Arkansas, under an Act passed at the last
							Session of Congress— He left with me the papers relating to his claim—
							These appeals from the decisions of the Heads of Departments, are very
							troublesome, and almost always unreasonable— I deem it however an
							indispensable part of my duty to admit them, and fully to examine the
							claim and the principle of the decision against which the appeal is
							taken. <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> consulted me respecting the Construction of an
							Act of the last Session of Congress for the better organization of the
							medical Department of the Navy of the United States; the object of which
							is to improve the qualifications of the Surgeons in the Navy, by
							requiring examinations and a probationary term of Service for Surgeons
							to be hereafter appointed, and to give them the benefit of a gradual
							increase of pay and rations— This last provision was intended to apply
							also to the Surgeons already in the Service; but the act is so worded
							that it does not include them. All the provisions in favour of the
							Surgeons are limited to those appointed according to the regulations of
							the Act. As the intention of Congress unquestionably was that the
							Surgeons in service should have the benefit of the increase of pay, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard inclined to the opinion that the
							Act might be so construed that they should receive the allowance, but as
							the interval to the next Session of Congress is very short and as the
							language of the Act is so explicit, as to give no cover of ambiguity for
							such a construction, I thought we should wait for an explanatory or
							supplementary Act at the next Session of Congress; particularly as from
							the whole purview of the Act there is room for plausible argument, that
							its operation was intentionally confined to the Surgeons and Assistants
							hereafter to be appointed—</p>

						<p>The morning being cool and pleasant we rode on the Rockville turnpike

									>r</hi> Daniel Brent’s</persRef> place in    about 9 Miles, and
							the longest morning ride we have yet taken. M<hi rend="superscript"

								>Baron Krudener</persRef> the Russian Minister to <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, with
							copy of a Circular from the Russian Vice Chancellor <persRef
								ref="nesselrode-karl">Count Nesselrode</persRef> to all the Russian
							Ministers abroad, and a copy of the Instructions from the Russian
							Government to the Commander of their fleet in the Mediterranean,
							prescribing the conduct they are to observe towards the Navigation of
							neutral Nations, in the present War between Russia, and the Ottoman
							Empire— The principles prescribed to the Russian Admiral are those of
							the Treaty between Russia and Great-Britain of June 1801. with the
							explanatory Convention of October the same year— This Treaty was the
							first abandonment on the part of Russia of the Empress Catherine’s armed
							neutrality. It was a compromise with Great-Britain, in which she acceded
							to the Russian doctrine of Blockade and list of Contraband, and Russia
							conceded the belligerent right of capturing the property of Enemies in
							neutral vessels— The first question that occurred to me was whether
							these Treaties of 1801. between Russia and Great-Britain were still in
							force between the parties to them as Treaties, and I found on referring
							to <persRef ref="hertslett-lewis">Hertslett’s</persRef> Collection of
							all the existing Commercial Treaties of Great-Britain with other Powers
							made in 1821. that they are not included in it— In the War of 1809. the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef>
							<pb type="ms" n="47"/>returned to the principles of the armed
							neutrality, and never afterwards renewed the Treaties of 1801. with
							Great-Britain— I mentioned to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent, the
							substance of the answer to be returned in the absence of the Secretary
							of State, to Baron Krudener’s Note, in which I desired him to introduce
							the enquiry, whether the Treaties of 1801. were considered by the
							parties, as still in force, and also the expression of a wish, that the
							principles of the armed neutrality had been adopted by Russia, on the
							present occasion— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent mentioned that
							Baron Krudener had intimated a desire of a private Audience from me, to
							which I agreed and fixed for one O’Clock to-morrow— <persRef

								ref="porter-peter">General Porter</persRef> and <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>
							were successively here. General Porter said his attention had been
							particularly turned to the expenditures and the accountability in the
							Indian Branch of the War Department, and he thought they required the
							establishment of a system of regulations, which he contemplated
							preparing— But he thought he should derive great assistance in the work,
							from <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Governor Cass</persRef> of the Michigan
							Territory—and <persRef ref="clark-william">Gen<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> W. Clark</persRef> formerly governor of the Missouri

							Washington next October, and by consultation with them to prepare the
							system of regulations. To this I assented, but advised him to write to
							them previously, and to request a written communication from each of
							them of his ideas relating to the subject generally. M<hi

						<p>Resumed the usual morning ride round by the College, across the Rockville
							Turnpike, by <persRef ref="smith-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								S. H. Smith’s</persRef> and through the Capitol Yard, about ten
							Miles— I sent for <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Southard</persRef>, and requested him to prepare
							Instructions to <persRef ref="crane-william">Captain Crane</persRef>,
							Commander of our Squadron in the Mediterranean, having reference to the
							Circular from <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl">Count Nesselrode</persRef>,
							and the Instructions to the Admiral of the Russian fleet in that Sea,
							communicated by <persRef ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="clark-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clark</persRef> the Treasurer, and <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> were here together.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark was in some perplexity relating
							to the Office of Chief Clerk under him— It is ostensibly held by a man
							named <persRef ref="brook-samuel">Samuel Brook</persRef>, who in process
							of Time has become perfectly superannuated and for more than a year past
							has never even attended at the Office— He is poor, and has no other
							means of subsistence than his Salary. The late Treasurer <persRef
								ref="tucker-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tucker</persRef>,
							who had been for at last ten years before his death past the age of
							active service, unwilling to adopt the harsh measure of turning Brook
							adrift upon the world in the last Stage of life; authorised one of the
							inferior Clerks to perform the duties of Chief Clerk; deducting from
							Brooks Salary, the difference between that of Chief Clerk, which
							is    dollars and that of a copying Clerk, of 800 dollars, the last of
							which only was paid to Brook, and the remainder to <persRef
								ref="dashiell-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dashiel</persRef>
							<pb type="ms" n="48"/>who performed the duties of Chief Clerk— This was
							the State of things at the Death of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Tucker— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark entered upon the duties of
							Treasurer the first of this Month; and now at its close being called to
							sign the usual monthly requisition for paying the Salaries of the
							Officers in that division of the Department is very reluctant at giving
							this Sanction to the arrangement which D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Tucker had allowed— He said he wanted a real and efficient Chief Clerk,
							in whom he could place unbounded personal confidence, and to whom he
							could in case of necessity entrust even his signature— He did not relish
							the responsibility of allowing part of the Salary, legally due to one
							man to be paid to another, nor that of paying a copying clerk’s Salary
							to one, who did no duty at-all. At the same time he was sensible of the
							harshness with which he would be chargeable, by dismissing Dashiel from
							the Chief Clerkship de facto, and Brook from the same office de jure,
							and from his substituted pensionary pittance— We had much conversation
							upon the subject— The appointment of the Clerks is by Law vested in the
							head of the Department, but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush told
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark that in this case it should be
							entirely at his discretion— As the appropriations are all made for the
							residue of the year, I advised that the arrangement should be continued
							till its close— That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dashiel and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brook should be notified, that it must
							then cease— That the estimates of Appropriations for the next year
							should be made conformably to the new order, and that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark should then designate a Chief Clerk
							in whom he could place entire confidence— In all which he appeared to
							acquiesce. Baron Krudener came at one— He said it had unfortunately so
							happened that the despatch from his Government containing the Official
							Notification of the Russian Declaration of War against Turkey had not
							yet been received by him— That he greatly regretted this, inasmuch as he
							knew his Instructions had directed him, in communicating the
							Declaration, to give with it an exposition of the motives which had
							rendered it indispensably necessary— That these reasons had been
							communicated frankly to the principal Powers of Europe, and had been
							altogether satisfactory to France, Austria, Prussia and Great-Britain,
							the final answers of whom though variably modified were all indicative
							of approbation at the course pursued by the <persRef ref="nicholas-i"
								>Emperor Nicholas</persRef>— That he was exceedingly desirous of
							conciliating the good opinion of the Government of the United States,
							and he hoped that in answering the notification of the Declaration of
							War, they would freely express their Sentiments with regard to the
							course of the Emperor on this emergency. I answered that whenever he
							should be enabled to make the communication which he had referred to, it
							would be received with the most friendly interest, and answered with the
							utmost candour— That from the general and high confidence which we
							placed in the benevolence and justice of the Emperor, I was well assured
							we should find no departure from those attributes in the measures to
							which he had found himself under the necessity of resorting in his
							relations with the Porte; and that we should take pleasure in giving
							full expression to this Sentiment so far as it might be compatible with
							the neutral position to the war in which we should stand— I added that
							with regard to the circular of Count Nesselrode, and the instructions to
							the Russian Admiral in the Mediterranean, which had been communicated
							with his note to the <persRef key="clay-henry">Secretary of
								State</persRef>, an immediate answer would be given to him from the
							Department in the absence of that Officer— I should also direct
							immediate Instructions to be given to the Commander of the Squadron of
							the United States in the Mediterranean, with the intention, and I hoped
							with the effect of preserving and of promoting the harmony and the best
							understanding between the two Countries— The Instructions to the Russian
							Admiral, in adopting the regulations of their Conventions of 1801 with
							Great-Britain, had in one respect deviated from the <pb type="ms" n="49"
							/>principles which had been more usually favoured in Russia, by
							authorising the capture of enemy’s property in neutral vessels, and I
							enquired if these Treaties of 1801. were still considered by Russia and
							Great-Britain, as binding between them— He said he could not tell— His
							Government had adopted the principles which had been agreed upon in
							those Treaties, for the basis of the Instructions to the Commander of
							their fleet; but it was not their intention to molest the trade of
							neutral Nations, and the measures of the Admiral would probably relax
							even from the tenour of those Instructions— He added that he was
							authorised to say that if the Government of the United States should be
							disposed to regulate by a Convention founded upon principles of
							reciprocity the subject of neutral <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>principles</hi> navigation he would receive and transmit to his
							Government any proposal they might offer, and it would be considered
							with the most friendly disposition to accede to it— I said I hoped that
							the best understanding would be preserved by the Officers of the two
							Nations, and that on the return of the Secretary of State we should
							perhaps act upon the suggestion he had given and propose a convention,
							conformable to our views, and which might meet those of the Emperor. He
							asked if there had been as was intimated in the newspapers, any
							movements of the American Government towards the attainment of access to
							the navigation of the Black Sea— I said there had been heretofore some
							advances to that object made which had not succeeded— He said that after
							the close of the present War, that Navigation would be free to all
							Nations— He observed that he was desirous of making an excursion of some
							weeks during this vehemence of the Summer, and enquired if I could see
							any objection to his using this indulgence— I said, none—that I hoped
							his visits to various parts of our Country, would be gratifying to
							himself, and make him favourably acquainted with them— He took leave,
							saying that he should report to his Government that my reception of him
							had been exceedingly kind and friendly, and that he hoped he should soon
							be enabled to make the official communication relating to the
							Declaration of War— At two O’Clock I went with my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>, <persRef ref="hellen-mary">his
								wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S.
								Adams</persRef> to the female Academy of the Nuns of the Visitation
							at Georgetown, and distributed the prizes that had been awarded to the
							young Ladies after an exhibition of a former day. There are upwards of a
							hundred girls at this School, and prizes were given to perhaps half of
							them— They consisted of books, work baskets, ornamented screens, gilt
							cards, with inscriptions, bearing the name of the girl to whom they were
							presented—and I crowned two of the young Ladies, the receivers of this
							first prize in the first and second Classes— The crowns were garlands of
							flowers; there are at the school <persRef
								ref="iturbide-juana;iturbide-sabina;iturbide-maria">three
								daughters</persRef> of the some time Emperor of Mexico <persRef
								ref="iturbide-augustin">Yturbide</persRef>, and they all received
							prizes—the eldest of them had the first crown, and in adjusting it to
							her head, the Sentiment of the vanity of human greatness impressed
							itself deeply upon my mind— In the intervals between the distribution of
							the prizes to the several classes there was music on the Piano, and
							singing by several of the Scholars— Four or five of the Nuns were
							present, presiding at the distribution of the prizes, and at the side of
							the Piano, in the sable weeds of the order was the young and beautiful
								<persRef ref="u">daughter</persRef> of <persRef ref="jones-jacob"
								>Commodore Jones</persRef>, who not long since took the veil— At the
							close of the ceremony I addressed a few words to the young Ladies,
							assuring them that I felt myself as much honoured, in distributing to
							them the rewards, as they had been in receiving them— There was however
							this difference between us, that on me the honour had been gratuitously
							conferred, but theirs was the reward of merit. <pb type="ms" n="50"
							/>These rewards they would long retain: some of them all their lives;
							they would afford them a source of pure and virtuous pleasure, as
							testimonials of the correctness with which they had performed their
							duties at this early stage of their lives. And now in taking leave of
							them, I had two things to say, and which I wished peculiarly to impress
							upon their minds The first was to ask a favour of them as a friend— The
							second, to give them a word of advice as a father. In future life they
							would often look with satisfaction at these prizes which they had now
							received, and my request was that whenever they enjoyed that pleasure
							they would give at the same time a thought of kindness to the hand from
							which they had received them. But the advice I had to give them was far
							more important, as it looked to their own future welfare— Their prizes
							were the reward of merit. And I wished every one of them to consider her
							own as a pledge and a promise of further and higher merit— This thought
							would stimulate them to constant virtuous exertions, and they had my
							fervent wishes that their lives might be but a long alternate succession
							of merits and rewards, until at the last, they should receive the reward
							of merit in Heaven— We then immediately retired and returned home. It
							was past six O’Clock— In the Evening <persRef ref="watkins-george"
								>George Watkins</persRef> brought the book in which he has commenced
							the Record of the projected Negotiation with the Sultan—</p>

						<p>We rode again this morning to the Bladensburg Spring, where I drank three
							cups of the water. It is a very weak Chalybeate, scarcely perceptible to
							my taste, but we met a man there who told us much of its effects. Said
							it turned meat or vegetables boiled in it black, and when left to stand
							gathered a thick skum of its surface— Returning home we were overtaken
							by <persRef ref="calvert-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calvert</persRef> in his phaeton—who kept company with us as far as
							the Capitol— <persRef ref="wilson-john4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wilson</persRef> came again concerning his claim against which the
							Secretary of the Treasury has decided, and concerning his application to
							be appointed a Commissioner to run the line between the State of
							Louisiana, and the Territory of Arkansas. I had come to no determination
							upon either point. <persRef ref="thornton-w">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thornton</persRef> of Alexandria came to solicit in
							behalf of a petitioner named <persRef ref="hellriggle-philip">Philip
								Hellrigg<unclear>le</unclear></persRef> for discharge from prison, for an assault—for
							which I gave an order— <persRef ref="graham-john3">John E.
								Graham</persRef> was a stranger. <persRef ref="cutts-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutts</persRef> came again upon the
							subject of <persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Kenney’s</persRef> Indian Mission Account— M’Kenney has published
							a pamphlet upon it; defending himself chiefly by a quotation from the
							Report of the Minority of the Retrenchment Committee; and complaining
							bitterly of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutts, whom he charges with
							having misrepresented him as claiming double mileage— Cutts still
							insists that he did— M’Kenney is one of those men, who never can keep
							accounts otherwise than loosely; and in this affair he made out two
							different accounts; both objectionable— The discussion upon them has
							been very unpleasant; but I recommended to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cutts to adhere to the proposal he had made to settle the
							first Account as allowed by <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor
								Barbour</persRef>, with a specification of the charges, and
							M’Kenney’s own affidavit to the items of presents to the Indians for
							which he has no vouchers— M’Kenney objects to making the affidavit as
							unusual; but Cutts says it has been some times required—and I advised
							him to refer to the particular precedents— <persRef ref="ringgold-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ringgold</persRef>, the newly
							appointed District Attorney for middle Florida, and afterwards <persRef
								ref="graham-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham</persRef>
							of the General Land-Office came upon the subject of the Land-claims now
							in litigation before the judicial tribunals and which are to be finally
							decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. An Act of Congress of
								<pb type="ms" n="51"/>the last Session, authorizes the President to
							appoint a Law Agent, to superintend the Interests of the United States
							in relation to these Land claims in Florida; and also to appoint
							assistant Counsel to the District Attorney. The Law Agent was appointed
							immediately after the close of the Session of Congress, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham is very desirous that <persRef
								ref="white-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph M.
								White</persRef> the Delegate from Florida, should be employed as
							assistant Counsel— There has been some correspondence between them on
							the subject, and some difficulty on account of the terms proposed by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White, leaving him at liberty to
							select the cases in which he should be engaged for the United States,
							and to be employed against them in others. I desired the opinion of the
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">Attorney General</persRef> upon this,
							which was that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White should be retained
							generally as assistant Counsel, but without being at Liberty to select
							his cases, and to appear against the United States in all others. Among
							the motives for employing him is that of forming a compilation of all
							the Ordinances, decrees and other vouchers concerning Land titles in the
							American Colonies under the Spanish Government; a work as important for
							the settlement of disputed titles in Louisiana and Missouri as in
							Florida. I requested M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham to write to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White, now in the State of New York,
							proposing to employ him upon the terms recommended by the Attorney
							General, and in the event of the declining, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Graham suggested the employment of <persRef
								ref="hamilton-alexander3">Alexander Hamilton</persRef>, whom I
							proposed to see on my passage through New-York. <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef>
							from the Department of State, brought a Note from <persRef
								ref="lederer-lewis">Baron Lederer</persRef>, the Consul General from
							Austria, to the Secretary of State announcing that he has received a
							Full Power from his Government to negotiate a Treaty of Commerce with
							the United States. Baron Lederer requests an interview with me for which
							I fixed to-morrow at one O’Clock. <persRef ref="mercer-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mercer</persRef> was here, having come
							to attend a meeting of the Proprietors of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.
								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> also attended their Meeting— There are collisions of
							interests between the different proprietors, which it will be found
							difficult to conciliate. The inhabitants of Washington City are bent
							upon having the canal pass through the City to join the Eastern Branch
							of the Potowmack: those of Georgetown insist, that this should be a
							distinct and separate undertaking by the City of Washington itself, and
							as no instalment of the Subscriptions to the Stock has yet been paid,
							there is danger that the Corporation and the City Subscribers, will
							withdraw from the whole undertaking by ostensible conveyances of their
							Stock to irresponsible persons. <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> had prepared
							Instructions to <persRef ref="crane-william">Commodore Crane</persRef>,
							consequent upon the communications recently received from <persRef
								ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef>, of which in
							consequence of my interview with the Baron Yesterday, I proposed a
							modification— I signed Orders for the remission, upon payment of all
							charges, of the penalties, for excess of 12 Passengers, on the Petition
							of <persRef ref="recourse-francois">Francois Recoursé</persRef>, Master
							of the French Ship La Floré from Havre to New-York, and for excess of 5
							passengers on Petition of <persRef ref="brown-henry">Henry
								Brown</persRef>, Master of American Ship Pallas, from Havre to
							New-York. Signed also Lead mine licenses and bonds from N. 23. to 48
							inclusive and N. 22. and Leases and bonds from 110 to 119.— Land grants
							819. also signed.</p>
