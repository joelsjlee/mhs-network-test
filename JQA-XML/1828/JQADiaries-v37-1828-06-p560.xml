						<list><item>Ringgold Tench</item></list>
						<p>I heard this morning <persRef ref="bigelow-andrew">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow</persRef> from Ephesians 2.8.
							[“]By grace are ye saved through faith”—he left out the remainder of the
							verse—“and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.” which indeed
							would not so well have suited his argument. It was an anti-calvinistic
							discourse upon a strong calvinistic text. He dwelt upon the doctrine of
							arbitrary election as revolting to reason, and incompatible with the
							goodness of the divine nature; but he did not meet directly even that
							portion of the verse which he took for his text—and did not notice at
							all the remainder of the verse— In the Evening I heard him again from
							Psalm 19.1 “The Heavens declare the glory of God,” omitting also the
							remainder of the verse— This Sermon was not sectarian— He selected also
							for the singers <persRef ref="addison-joseph">Addison’s</persRef>
							paraphrase of the first six verses of this Psalm, one of the best of
							that writer’s Poems. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow’s <pb
								type="ms" n="561"/>devotion is fervent, and he is evidently sincere
							in his opinions— After the morning service <persRef ref="ringgold-tench"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ringgold</persRef>, the Marshal
							called upon me, and mentioned that he had received a note from <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>,
							to say that he and <persRef ref="monroe-elizabeth">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Monroe</persRef>, with their
							Granddaughter <persRef ref="hay-hortensia">Hortensia Hay</persRef> would
							be here to-morrow, to dine and pass the Night at his house, being on
							their way to New-York— I afterwards wrote a Note to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ringgold, enclosing one to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, inviting him and his family to
							dine and pass the Night here— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ringgold’s
							answer leads me to expect that this invitation will be declined, M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Monroe’s health being infirm— There was a
							Sunday School Meeting this afternoon at <persRef ref="laurie-james">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Laurie’s</persRef> Church; which I did
							not attend— No Service at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s— I
							visited the Nursery after dinner, but found no new vegetation— There is
							much curiosity in observing the infinite diversity of manner in which
							different plants come out of the ground, and it is a study to know what
							plant is at its first appearance— One of those which I found yesterday
							at the Northwest corner; and two on the South side, are yet unknown. The
							Dutch Elms given me by <persRef ref="taliaferro-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taliaferro</persRef> have
							almost all taken, and are flourishing— But my attention devotes itself
							exclusively to the seedlings.</p>

						<p>By way of variety we rode this morning through Georgetown to the little
							Falls Bridge; but the road is bad, and though along the margin of the
							river less pleasant than that by the race ground— <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef>
							from the Department of State came for the Letter of <persRef ref="u"
								>Captain Fournier</persRef>, of the Buenos Ayrean Cruizer Juncal
							seized at Baltimore for slave trading and piratical acts; the Captain’s
							Secretary being in attendance for an answer— There is also a Letter from

							Captain Fournier’s Counsel, upon this subject— <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> and <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> were here together—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard brought and left with me the
							draft of his answer to the Letter of <persRef ref="scott-winfield"
								>General Scott</persRef>; declining to arrest and bring to trial by
							Court Martial <persRef ref="macomb-alexander">General Macomb</persRef>,
							or General Scott himself, and directing him at the expiration of his
							furlough to repair to his post— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							spoke of the Report upon the expenditures of secret Service money which
							he had left with me, and which he wishes to have published in the
							Newspapers— I had some doubts of the expediency of that measure, as
							being altogether unusual and novel, and as likely to attract public
							notice to that part of the Report of the Retrenchment Committee giving
							it an importance which it would not otherwise possess— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Southard thought it was an exposition necessary to counteract the use
							which would be made of the misrepresentations in the Report at the
							Western popular Elections— I kept the paper for further consideration—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay mentioned the wish of <persRef
								ref="rumpff-vincent">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rumpff</persRef>, the Minister from the Hanseatic Cities, to add an
							Article to the Convention, the Ratifications of which were to be this
							day exchanged; to which I agreed— And I fixed Wednesday next One
							O’Clock, to receive M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rumpff in Audience to
							take leave— <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bailey</persRef> of Massachusetts introduced to me a <persRef
								ref="otis-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis</persRef> of
							Barnstable, who has been here several months, and with whom there was
							another person whose name was not mentioned— <persRef
								ref="tingey-thomas">Commodore Tingey</persRef> called to pay me a
							visit: he mentioned that the Congress frigate was here at the Navy yard,
							and might be got ready for Sea in six weeks time. <persRef
								ref="williams-eleazar">Eleazar Williams</persRef> the half breed
							Seneca Indian preacher came and was in great concern to find that the
							Senate had not finally acted upon the Treaty under which those in
							New-York were to remove to Michigan— He said the greater part of them
							were now disposed to go and he did not know when the opportunity would
							again occur— He was in great perplexity, and asked my advice what should
							be done— I said that with regard to the Treaty, nothing could be done
							but to wait till the next Session of Congress, and the Senate would
							probably then decide upon it; and with regard to the exchange of the
							Indian Agents at Green Bay, and Michillimackinac, which he <pb type="ms"
								n="562"/>again earnestly urged— I told him I must consult with the
							new Secretary of War <persRef ref="porter-peter">General
								Porter</persRef> when he should arrive— <persRef
								ref="hamilton-thomas">Major Hamilton</persRef> came to renew his
							application for an appointment, and to ask the return of his papers of
							recommendation which I told him I would have looked up and give to him
							to morrow— <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef> called here about one O’Clock with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard, and about an hour afterwards I
							went with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> and visited him and <persRef
								ref="monroe-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Monroe</persRef>, at <persRef ref="ringgold-tench">Marshal
								Ringgold’s</persRef>; we found there <persRef ref="mclean-john2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean</persRef> the Postmaster
							General, and <persRef ref="graham-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								G. Graham</persRef> the Commissioner of the Land Office, who had
							been out with the Marshal to meet M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe,
							but missed him— <persRef ref="roberdeau-isaac">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l</hi> Roberdeau</persRef> was also there— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe declined the invitation to dine and
							lodge with us. He looks very little altered since I last saw him in
							August 1825. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Monroe is much out of
							health and reduced— <persRef ref="nourse-charles">Major
							Nourse</persRef>, chief Clerk of the War Department brought a Letter
							from <persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">T. L. M’Kenney</persRef> to the
							Secretary of War, mentioning that <persRef ref="owen-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Owen</persRef> the member of the House
							of Representatives from Alabama, had offered himself as Commissioner to
							treat with the Choctaw Indians for some small reservations of land
							wanted for the State of Alabama, and would ask no compensation; but only
							the payment of his expenses— I declined appointing M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Owen as Commissioner, because he was a
							member of Congress— <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef> left with me a paper
							written by <persRef ref="chase-samuel2">Samuel Chase</persRef> the judge

								<persRef ref="hellen-thomas">Thomas J. Hellen</persRef>: which he

								>r</hi> Frye’s Accounts as his guardian— <persRef
								ref="taylor-william">William Taylor</persRef>, Consul at Vera-Cruz
							came and took leave, going to-morrow Northward as far as Boston— He
							expressed himself grateful for the favours he had received from the
							Government, and requested if a favourable opportunity should present
							itself that he might be transferred to any Consulate in Europe, more
							profitable than that of Vera-Cruz. I visited the garden after dinner,
							and found no new vegetation, but was soon driven by the rain back to the
							House—</p>

						<p>The loss of the morning ride even for a day, impairs its efficacy for the
							restoration of my health, and the heavy thunder gust of the Night was
							followed by a day so sultry that my excursion from the house was
							confined to an after dinner visit to the nursery— I there counted
							ninety-seven Spanish Cork Oaks; but found nothing further. I observe
							only that a few of every kind of tree that had come up, are
							perishing—the causes of which are various—the heat of the Sun withers
							some—others suffer prostration from rain— Insects above ground devour
							the leaves—vermin beneath nip the stalks— The infancy of plants seems to
							be as delicate as that of animals— I have however now so many varieties
							and so many of each kind that I can bear the loss of a portion of them;
							and have now little more to expect for the remainder of the Season— I
							make two remarks—one that the self-planted seeds, thrive the most
							vigorously— The other that the plants which I most cherish are the most
							apt to disappoint me and die— I took up this day the Yard Cherry Stone,
							and Plum Stone, planted in Pot N. 3. 10. April— No vegetation, but the
							stones all sunk in water— I planted now in it 2. Tangier Orange seeds
							and 2 Quincy grape seeds— In pot N. 5 I took up the stones planted 25
							April and planted 12 Tangier Orange seeds and 10 Quincy grape seeds— In
							Box N. 4. I planted 12 Yard cherry kernels, which had been 24 hours
							soaking in water— In the same box a self-planted Althaea came up. In box
							N. 5. I planted 6. Tangier orange seeds— In pot N. 2. a red staple first
							appears <pb type="ms" n="563"/><persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> came to speak of
							putting into operation the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal— He subscribed last

							has been urging the <persRef ref="gales-joseph">mayors of
								Washington</persRef> and <persRef ref="cox-john"
								>Georgetown</persRef>, to make preparations immediately for
							commencing the work—we had much conversation with regard to the choice
							of the President and Directors, and agreed that the most suitable person
							to be President would be <persRef ref="mercer-charles">C. F.
								Mercer</persRef>, by whose persevering exertions the undertaking has
							been so far accomplished— There are to be six Directors; one of whom it
							was thought advisable to take from each of the District Cities,
							Washington, Georgetown and Alexandria—one from Maryland; one from
							Virginia, and one on the line of the Canal— Many names were mentioned,
							but nothing definitive in that respect was settled— <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> was twice here—first upon the Instructions to be
							given to <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Governor Cass</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="menard-pierre">P. Menard</persRef> for negotiating with the
							Winebago and other Indians; and the second time with a Letter from
								<persRef ref="eaton-john">J. H. Eaton</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="owen-george">G. W. Owen</persRef>, concerning a purchase of
							Lands from the Cherokee Indians ineffectually attempted last year, and
							the proposal for which they wish to have renewed— <persRef
								ref="strickland-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								Strickland</persRef> Architect and Engineer from Philadelphia was
							here, with a Letter of recommendation from <persRef ref="sergeant-john"
								>J. Sergeant</persRef>— He has also a recommendation from the
							chamber of Commerce at Philadelphia— I told him that it was my intention
							to employ him, but that I had not yet determined on the mode of
							proceeding with regard to the Construction of the Work; and asked him to
							call again to-morrow. The Act of Congress places the whole work at the
							discretion, and on the responsibility of the President— But its
							execution must be referred to one of the Executive Departments; and upon
							consultation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard I concluded to refer it to the
							Navy Department— The <persRef ref="u">mother</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="u">wife</persRef> of <persRef ref="anderson-willis">Willis
								Anderson</persRef>, under Sentence for Manslaughter at Alexandria
							brought a petition numerously and respectably signed for his pardon—
							Their distress was very affecting, but I told them they must obtain a
							recommendation from the <persRef ref="swann-thomas">District
								Attorney</persRef> or from one of the judges— <persRef
								ref="hamilton-thomas">Major Hamilton</persRef> called again for his
							papers but they had not been found, and I told him I would have them
							looked up by to-morrow. <persRef ref="tyler-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyler</persRef> came soon after, and
							advised me not to admit Hamilton into my chamber when I was alone— Said
							that he was a desperate man, and had used to him threatening language
							against me and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush— Had also threatened
							to kill himself; and Tyler said that a <persRef ref="u"
								>brother</persRef> of Hamilton’s had killed a man in the street at
							New-York and then killed himself— I told Tyler that I paid no regard to
							such threats— And it was my belief that Hamilton had used them for the
							purpose of having them reported to me— <persRef ref="bradley-abraham"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bradley</persRef> the Assistant
							Postmaster General was here and gave me further information respecting
							the delinquency of the late <persRef ref="bache-richard"
								>Postmaster</persRef> at Philadelphia— He thinks the defalcation
							will be of more than 25000 dollars— He also says that he believes
								<persRef ref="ingham-samuel">S. D. Ingham</persRef> has a Deed of
							Defeazance releasing him from responsibility upon his bond as surety to
							Bache— The mass of Evidence shews extraordinary indulgence to Bache; a
							high probability that it will result in a heavy loss of money to the
							public, and the cause of which is clearly traceable to <persRef
								ref="mclean-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean’s</persRef>
							political connections with Ingham, and with <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
								>Vice President Calhoun</persRef>, of whom Ingham is the servile
							tool— The conduct of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean has been that
							of deep and treacherous duplicity— With solemn protestations of personal
							friendship for me, and of devotion to the Cause of the Administration he
							has been three years using the extensive patronage of his Office in
							undermining it among the people— With the names of <persRef
								ref="lee-henry3">Harry Lee</persRef>, of <persRef
								ref="gardner-charles">Charles K. Gardner</persRef>, of <persRef
								ref="mower-j">Mower</persRef>, of <persRef ref="magee-john"
								>Magee</persRef>, of <persRef ref="u">Resides</persRef>, and others
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bradley related to me transactions,
							which can leave no doubt upon my mind— M’lean is a double-dealer— His
							words are smoother than butter but war is in his heart. <persRef
								ref="hendricks-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hendricks</persRef>, the Senator from Indiana, called and took
							leave. <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="smith-john">J. A. Smith</persRef> to that mission, and to
							appoint a new Secretary to the mission to Spain— I requested M<hi

								Clark</persRef> of Pennsylvania—having received this morning a
							Letter from <persRef ref="savage-john">Chief Justice Savage</persRef>

							the General Land-Office came and spoke of an Application from <persRef

								Strickland</persRef> was here and said he must return to

							as an Engineer in the construction of the Breakwater near the mouth of

								>Secretary of the Navy</persRef>— He said he thought the first thing
							to be done would be to make a Survey to fix on the spot where the work

							appoint <persRef ref="rodgers-john">Commodore Rodgers</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="bernard-simon">General Bernard</persRef>, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Strickland to make the Survey to fix upon

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard mentioned the offer of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Owen of Alabama, to treat with the
							Cherokees for a purchase of lands, which I had declined on account of

								ref="armstrong-francis">F. W. Armstrong</persRef> the Marshal of
							both Districts in Alabama, who is now here, should be charged with this

							the last Summer. <persRef ref="matthews-william">M<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="rumpff-vincent">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rumpff</persRef> the Minister Plenipotentiary from the Hanseatic
							Cities, to an Audience for taking leave— He addressed me in a short
							Speech, as usual upon such occasions expressive of the friendship and
							good will of the Governments of the three Cities of Lubeck, Bremen, and
							Hamburg, towards the United States, and of his own grateful sense of the
							kind reception, and friendly treatment that he had experienced in this
							Country. He spoke in French, and I answered him in the same language— I
							desired him upon his return to his Constituents to assure them of the
							friendly feelings of the Government of the United States towards them,
							and of the great satisfaction with which we had concluded the Treaty of
							Amity and Commerce, which it had been the object of his mission to
							negotiate. It had been the more gratifying to me, as I had from a period
							of very early youth been personally acquainted with two of the three
							confederated Cities, and recollected with warm gratitude the kind and
							hospitable treatment I had received in them; and its repetition more
							than once afterwards at <pb type="ms" n="565"/>Hamburg— As to himself I
							was happy to learn that he had been pleased with his reception here, and
							could express no other sentiment than that of regret at his departure;
							with cordial good wishes that his voyage might be prosperous and his
							future life prosperous and happy—after this interchange of official
							compliments, I invited him to be seated—we conversed a few minutes upon
							indifferent topics, and he withdrew— <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> was here and spoke
							again of the appointment of President and Directors of this Chesapeake
							and Ohio Canal— The name of <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> for President had
							been mentioned to him since yesterday; with the use of some influence
							upon his mind against the choice of <persRef ref="mercer-charles">C. F.

									>r</hi> Elgar</persRef> the Commissioner of the public buildings
							brought me a Letter to him from <persRef ref="trumbull-john">Col<hi

							him a copy of the Resolution, and his Letter was to ask an explanation
							of its meaning—whether he was to devise the measures, or merely to
							superintend the execution of them; and what was understood by a
							reasonable compensation— I told Elgar I thought the Resolution intended
							that Trumbull should indicate the measures for the preservation of the
							Pictures—but what it meant by reasonable compensation I could not
							determine. The <persRef ref="u">wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
								>mother</persRef> of <persRef ref="anderson-willis">Willis

							had told them there were so many names signed to the recommendation that

							for his Report and opinion— They brought me after dinner a Letter from

							murder— That the verdict of the Jury reducing it to manslaughter, and
							that he could not recommend a pardon; and <persRef ref="cranch-william"

						<p>After the thunder showers of last night, the power of the Sun this day,
							was intense, and our ride on horseback more wearisome than pleasant— The
							Thermometer ranged about 85— My grape vine in Tumbler N. 2. died of a
							dropsy— The tamarind and another vine had already perished with the same
							disease a day or two before— To replace them a Persimmon planted 31.
							March came up in Pot N. 1. and a self-planted Althaea in Box N. 4— In

							I sent for <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brent</persRef> of the Department of State, and requested that in
							the pamphlet publication of the Laws of the late Session of Congress;
							the Acts of the Legislatures of Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania
							relating to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, may be subjoined to the Act

								>d.</hi> May 1828—one to authorize the improving of certain Harbors,
							the building of Piers and for other purposes—the other making an

							Delaware Bay— Both making very heavy expenditures of Public Money and
							committing the <pb type="ms" n="566"/>execution of both the Acts without
							restriction or qualification to the discretion of the President of the
							United States— General Macomb read from the National Journal of this
							morning both the Acts— He had a list of all the Engineers in the Service
							of the United States; of the Surveys upon which the greater part of them
							are now engaged; and of those upon which the rest of them should be
							immediately employed, according to their relative urgency— General
							Macomb marked the particular Surveys to be forthwith commenced, and the

							recommended that some of the young Officers recently withdrawn from the
							Engineer Service, and stationed at the Artillery School of practice at
							Fortress Monroe, Old Point Comfort, should be again called upon for

							that he would view it as an injury rather than a favour— I declared

						<p>There were a multitude of Bathers in the river this morning. I swam about
							ten minutes— The weather was intensely warm, but afterwards cooled. I
							heard morning and afternoon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>    at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church. He read prayers for the
							first Sunday after Trinity— His morning text was from Jonah 1.6.— “What
							meanest thou, O Sleeper! arise, call upon thy God, of so be that God
							will think upon us that we perish not.” The preliminaries to the
							discourse were narratives of <persRef ref="jonah">Jonahs</persRef>
							adventures, of his mission to Nineveh, of his flight to Tarshish—his
							embarkation at Joppa; the tempest at Sea—his transshipment to the
							whale’s belly and his final landing upon the shore; but the application
							of the text to the auditory had no connection with all this— The rebuke
							was upon indifference to religion— The summons <pb type="ms" n="569"
							/>was to sleeping Sinners, heedless of the tempest which threatens them
							with destruction. The preacher gave out also for singing the 107<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm 23–30—which contains a vivid
							picture of a storm at Sea— The afternoon text was from Matthew 25–42.
							[“]For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty and ye
							gave me no drink: 43. I was a stranger; and ye took me not in: naked and
							ye clothed me not: sick and in prison, and ye visited me not.” There was
							in the discourse much complaint of the treatment experienced by the
							Church; but in general terms, without specification; and with an
							exception as to the treatment of the Ministers of the Church, concerning
							which he observed that he would say nothing— I met at Church <persRef
								ref="jackson-william">Major Jackson</persRef> of Philadelphia, who
							came home with us to call upon <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef>— He has come to
							receive the portion of his pay granted by the recent act of Congress for
							the relief of the Officers and Soldiers of the Revolutionary War. In the
							Evening I heard <persRef ref="bigelow-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bigelow</persRef>, from Luke 16.31.— “If they hear not
							Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose
							from the dead.” The doctrine raised from the text was that the Evidences
							of Religion, are sufficient to satisfy reasonable minds, and that
							stronger proofs would not satisfy those who discredit them— After
							evening Church I signed Land grants.</p>

						<p>The morning was cool— I bathed in the River from the Boat; but in 15

							failed. <persRef ref="ousley-john">Ouseley</persRef> put them down,

							in a box— There are two Tamarinds up in seedling Pot N. 2. Two in Box
							N.    and one in Pot N. 6— The large plant in Pot N. 2. is apparently a
							Spanish Chesnut— Ouseley has a box with five Coffee seeds just up— The
							kernel itself is pushed up by its root, as with the apple and the
							Tamarind— My first pot raised apple-tree of last year is now 18 inches
							high—fifteen of which have grown this Season. My Tumbler plantations in
							the house all fail— The Oranges in Tumbler 2 are all dying. Nine of them
							had taken root, and come up vigorously— The death of all these Plants
							was caused by over watering which rotted the roots— The Peach tree in
							Pot N. 3. appears to be perishing—killed by the heat of the Sun— I
							counted in the Nursery 105 Cork Oaks in 27. Rows, and asked <persRef
								ref="foy-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Foy</persRef> to
							prepare ground for my last plantation of last year’s seeds and Stones—
								<persRef ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							to obtain the discharge of <persRef ref="u">her Son</persRef> who is at

							subject to Epileptic fits, and unfit for duty. She brought a certificate

							unfitness for duty: but they did not agree even in the name of the man—
								<persRef ref="row-elizabeth">Elizabeth Row</persRef> who came with

							from the physician of the garrison at Fort M’Henry, and from the

							There was a Statement from the Engineer Department of the balance of

							employed upon the various Surveys now in progress. The balance of

						<p>Thinking it expedient to alternate my exercise of riding on horseback,
							and bathing in the Potowmack, I took this morning a ride— Planted at the
							South Corner of the Nursery in 2. Rows 24. fresh Cherry Stones, that
							sink—with dried Cherries—gooseberries, and gooseberry, apple, and raisin
							seeds— From Breakfast I was called by <persRef ref="thruston-buckner"
								>Judge Thruston</persRef>, who in his peculiar way came to scold
							because <persRef ref="thruston-alfred">his Son</persRef> had not been
							appointed a Lieutenant in the Marine Corps, and to supplicate some
							appointment for him, to save him from desperation— The judge met
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> in the Antichamber and was scarcely civil to him.
							I have now been so long acquainted with judge Thruston, and have
							witnessed so many of his sensitive paroxysms that they produce little
							impression upon me.— I told the judge that I could do no more for his
							son than was compatible with my duties to others, and if the occasion
							should occur I should readily do that— The judge is partially insane,
							and knows and avows it; but retains intelligence enough to make his
							insanity a plea to his title to compassion— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard came to speak concerning the papers that he had
							left with me yesterday, all of which he now took back— With regard to
							the appropriation for the expedition of the Chickasaw and Choctaw
							National delegations to go to see the Country West of the Mississippi, I
							could not definitively decide upon it, not having at hand the Act of
							Congress itself. But there were a number of persons earnestly
							recommended <pb type="ms" n="571"/>by various members of Congress, to be
							employed to accompany the Indians, and <persRef ref="mckenney-thomas"
								>M’Kenney</persRef> proposes that a physician should be sent with
							them, for which I mentioned <persRef ref="todson-george">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Todsen</persRef>— Respecting the
							deficiency of the survey fund, I agreed that the extra allowance to the
							Engineers should be reduced from 1 1/2 dollar to 1 dollar per day— That
							their ordinary pay and rations should be charged not to this fund, as it
							has been, but to that of the army appropriations as they should be; and
							that those of the chiefs of brigades who now have with them four
							assistants must in future have only two. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Southard read a Letter from <persRef ref="biddle-james">Captain
								Biddle</persRef> dated in April, stating that <persRef
								ref="tudor-william2">W. Tudor</persRef> had been landed in Chile on
							his passage from Lima; so sick that he was unable to pursue his voyage—
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Southard— His daughter <persRef ref="erwin-anne">M<hi rend="superscript"

								>r</hi> Clay has prepared an instruction to <persRef

							Instruction is to be sent to <persRef ref="lawrence-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence</persRef> to be executed by
							him, in the event of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour’s arrival

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calvert</persRef>, of
							Bladensburg. <persRef ref="hamilton-thomas">Major Hamilton</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="fry-henry">Henry Fry</persRef> came and took their
							respective papers. <persRef ref="clarke-satterlee">Satterlee
								Clark</persRef>, to repeat an application for an appointment as
							Suttler to the troops at the North-west: I told him I had recommended
							him to the late Secretary of War and would again recommend him to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard— <persRef ref="jones-roger"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jones</persRef> brought me
							some papers upon which two years since his claim for double rations was
							allowed, which he requested me to read with reference to a difference of
							opinion between <persRef ref="macomb-alexander">General Macomb</persRef>
							and him, in regard to his duties— General Macomb thinking that the
							Adjutant General has no right to communicate directly with the Secretary
							of War in any case; but only through the Major General— I asked him for
							the order by which the Head Quarters of the Major General were fixed at
							the Seat of Government, which he afterwards brought me— It is in the
							General Orders of 17. May 1821. issued in pursuance of the Act of
							Congress 2. March of that year for the reduction of the Army— <persRef
								ref="yates-william">William Yates</persRef> is a Quaker wine
							merchant of Philadelphia who paid me a visit of curiosity— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Todsen came on his old errand of
							solicitation for employment— I referred him to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard, and told him I had thoughts of him to go as
							Physician to an Indian travelling delegation. <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>
							brought me three more decisions of <persRef ref="smith-joseph2">Judge
								Smith</persRef> of Florida, upon claims of indemnity for losses
							sustained by individuals, by the operations of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson’s</persRef> army in the
							invasion of 1818— They are all cases of remotely consequential damages
							leaning upon the meagerest and most interested testimony, and the
							decisions in their favour are so preposterous that I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush I thought they ought not only to be
							rejected, but with some note of censure upon them— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush spoke also of this Chesapeake and
							Ohio Canal Corporation: and to the persons already mentioned as suitable
							for Directors, now added the name of <persRef ref="stewart-andrew"
								>Andrew Stewart</persRef>, the member of the House of
							Representatives from Pennsylvania, to which I readily assented— There is
							it seems a scramble for the Land through which the Canal must pass, in
							which the Baltimore and Ohio Rail-road company are endeavouring to
							forestall the Canal— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush inclined at the
							stimulus of the Canal interest here to instruct the U.S. Engineers, whom
							we have assigned to the Rail-road, not to assist in this project of
							preoccupying the Lands but I thought we could not authoritatively
							interfere, in which opinion M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard
							concurred— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush said that the subordinate
							Officers of the Treasury, represented that there would be great
							confusion in the Treasurer’s Accounts, unless the new Treasurer should
							delay entering upon the duties of his Office, until the commencement of
							the Quarter, which I supposed might without much difficulty be arranged.
							I spoke to him also of the necessity of organizing a system of
							accountability for the internal improvement funds.</p>

						<p>I planted in seedling box N. 5. Six fresh Cherry kernels. I find the
							Cherry and Apricot Stones are hard to raise from the Stone and I am
							trying the experiment of breaking the Stones, and planting the kernel— I
							have found the kernels of all those that float in water, withered and
							lifeless— Those that sink are alive and full— The Tamarind in Seedling
							Pot N. 1. up sixteen days has put forth in succession a stem with five
							Stalks each bearing nine pair of leaflets, like the sensitive plant,
							which open to the Sun, and close together at Night— The Persimon in the
							Pot vegetates more rapidly than in the open air— In eight days it is
							disclosing its third pair of leaves— After dinner I visited the garden—
							In the Eastern Seminary I have 5. Apple 1. Apricot 3. Red Cherry 2. Wild
							Cherry    Self-sown Lilacs 5. Battle ground Oaks 12 Peach 1. Pear 13
							Plum, and 20 Shagbark walnuts of last years growth— This is all the
							result of at least six hundred nuts stones and seeds sown and planted
							last year— The Apple, Pear and Plum, push up the stem, unfolding leaf
							after leaf till the top leaf without indication of the cause turns dry,
							and then the plant ceases to rise higher— My last years apple tree, has
							within the last week thus stopped— <persRef ref="ousley-john"

						<p>Galling ride with <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> to the
							Navy-Yard, and Eastern Branch Bridge. Found in the Nursery 110 Cork Oaks
							in 29 Rows— Persimon shoots appear in abundance; but that in the Pot
							outstrips those in the garden and forms larger and longer leaves— In
							this tree the seed does not come up as Cotyledon, nor form the seed
							leaves—The plumelet is a dark red stalk shewing itself first above
							ground in staple form; pressing out its extremity in a yellowish stem
							which becomes erect, then opens to a fork the two prongs of which in two
							or three days change and expand into green seed leaves—from these, two
							leaves proper in two or three days more open, at right angles with them,
							and then the leaves form in <pb type="ms" n="573"/>pairs, a law of
							vegetation common to many plants— The Oaks which I had taken for Willow
							Oaks, appear to be rather the Laurel Oak— I am unable from their present
							foliage to distinguish between the different kinds of Walnuts, and of
							White and Chesnut Oaks which have come up. Some of the Oaks have shot up
							a second Stem, on the top of the first, and are putting forth a
							secondary foliage— The English walnuts that have come up, are much

							vigour in lateral twigs, and broad foliage— The main stem not rising at

						<p>After swimming 25 minutes in the river, I visited the garden where the
							vegetation with the heat and moisture of the last week has been
							marvelous. The weeds and herbaceous plants have grown as by enchantment,
							but I found no new vegetation upon my trees— I observed only the
							expansion of one kernel of coffee into seed leaves; resembling those of
							the Althaea, but larger— The Althaea in box N. 4. which came up the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> has been from that time forming and
							opening its seed leaves— The stem is about half an inch above ground—the
							Seed leaves nearly round, presenting their surfaces in right angles with
							the stem, and directly upwards to receive the rays of the Sun, and the
							moisture of the atmosphere— The first leaf proper is now appearing
							between them— In Pot N. 1. The stem of the Tamarind up 24 May is also
							about half an inch above ground. The nut has not changed into seed
							leaves, but retains its perpendicular position, and its size its two
							lobes being opened just enough to hold between them the stem below and
							the plumelet above them. It has now put forth six successive stalks each
							bearing several pair of leaflets, which close together at Night and open
							to the Sun in the morning— The Persimon in the same Pot up the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> has a stem nearly two Inches from the
							ground. I have already remarked how its Seed leaves were formed, and at
							right angles with them its first pair of leaves proper. The second pair
							is now forming parallel with the Seed leaves. These two plants in this
							Pot, thrive more rapidly, and shew more promising, than others of the
							same kind, up in the garden and nursery. I have strewed a little fresh
							Earth over the surface of the ground in the Pot— But the Peach that I
							have in Pot N. 3 is much less prosperous than those growing in the open
							air— The Earth in my Tumblers N. 1 and 2. is becoming mouldy and
							breeding worms. All vegetation in them seems dead. <pb type="ms" n="575"

						<p><date>15. IV.</date> Sunday— Sun rose 4.35.</p>
						<p>Heard <persRef ref="bigelow-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bigelow</persRef> this morning from 1. John 4.16. “God is Love”— The
							turn of this Gentleman’s mind is logical. He delights in argument. He
							began his discourse by observing that the first impression upon the
							human mind of the deity as observable in the works of creation is the
							idea of power, with out necessary association of beneficence of power
							operating not less in destruction than in production— After illustrating
							this position not much in detail, he enumerated the reasons by which
							upon more extensive observation the mind was led to the conclusion that
							the true nature of the Supreme being was goodness, inseparable from
							power— There was nothing apparently controversial in the course of his
							argument; and yet if its conclusions are correct they constitute a
							complete refutation of the Calvinistic doctrines of Election and
							Reprobation. But goodness or beneficence is relative to a created,
							animated and sentient being— There is no more goodness in the production
							than in the destruction of a tree or a stone— There is nothing but
							Power— But all living material beings are susceptible of pleasure and
							pain, to which human language has affixed the appellation of good and
							evil— Now the formation and organization of animated matter, is
							certainly evidence of Power, and it is evidence of creative
							intelligence— It is also true that life is pleasure, and that the gift
							of life is evidence of a property in the Creator distinct not only from
							Power, but from intellect— In the mosaic account of the Creation; at
							every stage of the work it is said that God saw that it was <hi
								rend="italic">good</hi>. Every thing was good—not as a mere exercise
							of Power or of intelligence, but as contributing to the enjoyment of the
							created man— Yet man was created not for enjoyment alone— He is
							susceptible of pain no less than of pleasure— He is himself but a
							creature of Time. He cometh forth like a flower and is cut down— The
							operation of divine Power <pb type="ms" n="576"/>in the condition of
							man’s existence, is evil as well as good. According to the Holy
							Scriptures man was created perfect and immortal; but made himself mortal
							by his own disobedience, and by the rebellion of a superior Spirit— The
							predominating idea therefore of God is and must remain the simple
							attribute of Power in the exercise of which good and evil are alternate—
							The time of afternoon service at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							Church, being now fixed to commence at five O’Clock, our dinner hour, I
							could not attend— In the Evening, I heard at <persRef ref="laurie-james"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laurie’s</persRef> Church, a
							German Preacher in his own language from Matthew 10.32 “Whosoever
							therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my
							Father which is in heaven.” The manner of the preacher was much more
							emphatic than his matter. The auditory was not numerous—</p>

								ref="persico-luigi">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Persico</persRef>
							was rather slack in the execution of his work, on the Pediment of the

							the <persRef ref="chapin-stephen">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Chapin</persRef> the new President of
							the Columbian College— They have recommenced their course of

								ref="patterson-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Patterson</persRef>, and <persRef ref="morris-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Morris</persRef> of Baltimore were
							here deputed from the Baltimore Rail-road Company— <persRef
								ref="macomb-alexander">General Macomb</persRef> had directed the
							withdrawal, of several of the Engineer Officers, who had last year been
							assigned at the request of the Company to assist in making their
							Surveys, and among the rest, <persRef ref="u">Lieutenant
								Trimble</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Morris represent that of three brigades of
							United States Engineers now employed upon their Surveys, the continuance
							of two is so indispensable that the withdrawal of them, would delay the
							operations of the company for a whole year: and that Lieutenant Trimble
							is one of those, without whom they could not proceed— But that they
							could spare one of the three brigades— I referred them to the acting
							Secretary of War, with the assurance, that all possible accommodation
							should be yielded to their wishes— <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> was here, and had a new
							question upon the construction of the act for the relief of the
							Revolutionary Officers. The amount of pay to each Officer is limited so
							as not in any event to exceed the full pay of a captain in the line of
							the Army— The question was whether this should be a captain of Infantry,
							of Cavalry or of Artillery. I thought it should be the one <pb type="ms"
								n="578"/>or the other according to the Corps in which each Officer
							served— The result of this indeed is that a General of Infantry receives
							not so much as a Captain of Cavalry, or of Artillery; but this is the
							Spirit of the Law which provides that a General shall receive no more
							than a Captain of the same arm—and the expression of the Law is that
							each Officer shall receive <hi rend="italic">his </hi>pay— Now the pay
							of an Officer of Artillery could not be <hi rend="italic">his </hi>pay
							to an Officer of Infantry. The reduced pay to Officers above the rank of
							Captain is the established principle of the Acts, for which Congress are
							responsible; and as the whole is a gratuity, the superior Officers have
							no right to demand that it should be proportioned to their rank. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush spoke again of the choice of
							Directors for the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, about which he is much
							troubled— There is a question between <persRef ref="smith-walter">Walter
								Smith</persRef> and <persRef ref="mason-john">General
								Mason</persRef>, for Georgetown— Between <persRef
								ref="washington-bushrod">Judge Washington</persRef>, and a <persRef
								ref="janney-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Janney</persRef>
							for Alexandria, and there was one suggestion which he inclined to
							favour, to set aside the three Corporations and make a full board not
							belonging to either of them— This I thought quite inadmissible— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Marvin came to speak again for the
							discharge of <persRef ref="sheldon-josiah">Josiah Sheldon</persRef> from
							prison— The original papers were not to be found; but Marvin left with
							me a copy of Sheldon’s petition to the Secretary of the Treasury—
								<persRef ref="holbrook-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Holbrook</persRef> called and I informed him that the Land wanted by
							him was not of the reservations at my disposal— <persRef
								ref="macomb-alexander">General Macomb</persRef> came with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard, and we conversed upon the
							application from the Baltimore Rail-road company; and upon that for the
							Surveys of roads through Painted Post, to the North-western boundary of
							New-York— We agreed that no Engineers should be withdrawn from the
							Baltimore Company except those whom they say that they can spare. I am
							to read the papers and answer the application for surveys to Lake
							Ontario, to-morrow— A man named <persRef ref="pratt-carey">Carey
								Pratt</persRef>, came into my chamber about four this afternoon and
							said—The Battle of Bunker’s Hill was this day fifty-three years ago, and
							I was there— He left with me a Petition to be put on the Pension list;
							but he was not in the Continental Service— Visited the Garden after

						<p>An intense Summer day, closed with a long thunder shower— I swam half an
							hour in the river— Visited the Garden before breakfast, and the Nursery
							after dinner— Fifteen of the Tangier vine-cuttings have sprouted— At my
							request <persRef ref="ousley-john">Ouseley</persRef> spaded up the weeds
							which were over growing the Eastern seedling bed— But the men who have
							been weeding in the nursery have cut up six of my Spanish Cork Oaks— I
							found in the Nursery a second Tulip tree—Western Border. <persRef
								ref="graham-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Graham</persRef> brought me six Proclamations for Sales of Lands at
							Cahaba and Tuskaloosa, in Alabama, Lexington and Jackson, Missouri;
							Little Rock, Arkansas and Monroe in Michigan—in October and December
							next. The Legislature of Alabama, at whose request the Sales there have
							been postponed, wish the postponement to be continued—but the Registers
							and Receivers earnestly remonstrate against further delay— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham spoke of the location of two
							reserves for Potawatomi Indians in Indiana, which I directed to be done,
							by the Indian agent <persRef ref="tipton-john">Tipton</persRef>— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham proposed to engage, <persRef

							the Delegate from Florida, to assist the <persRef ref="wirt-william"
								>Attorney General</persRef> in managing before the U.S. Supreme
							Court, appeals pending there <pb type="ms" n="579"/>to a very large
							amount, from decisions against Land claims of individuals in the
							territory of Arkansas, by virtue of pretended Spanish grants. I desired
							him to make a statement to that effect in writing— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham said he had received a Letter from
								<persRef ref="davis-george">G. Davis</persRef>, late Surveyor
							General of Lands, South of Tennessee, dismissed from Office, giving
							notice that he had thought proper to take away with him, all the papers,
							belonging to the Office— He observed that there was no Statute remedy
							for this breach of Trust— I thought a remedy could be applied by
							Chancery process in the Courts of the United States— He said there was a
							Statute against this Offence in the State of Pennsylvania, which might
							serve as a model for an Act of Congress— I desired him to send me a copy
							of it— He said the Sales of Lands this year would fall short of the
							Estimates— <persRef ref="goldsborough-r">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								R. Y. Goldsborough</persRef> brought me a letter from <persRef

								>r</hi> Scott</persRef> of Georgetown, brought a Letter of Recommendation from

							of 1. Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> last, which <persRef
								ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef> had left at the

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Marvin</persRef> came with the papers
							relating to the Petition of <persRef ref="sheldon-josiah">Josiah
								Sheldon</persRef>, which had on further search been found at the
							Treasury Department— I had declined granting two years ago the prayer of
							the petition, because there were strong presumptions of fraudulent
							conveyances of property, to defeat the Judgment of the United States
							against him, which is for nearly 20000 dollars— Since that time the
							Evidence of fraud remains, without being confirmed or disproved; and I
							told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marvin, that nothing having
							occurred, except the lapse of time to change the views upon which I had
							declined acting, I saw not how I could now consistently grant that which
							I had refused before— After much conversation, I concluded to cause
								<persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pleasonton</persRef>, the Auditor having charge of the Treasury

								>Beardsley</persRef>, enquiring, whether any confirmatory evidence
							of fraud on the part of Sheldon, had come to his knowledge since he
							wrote before—and if not, I said I would further consider the propriety
							of granting the discharge of Sheldon, from imprisonment— <persRef
								ref="jones-roger">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Jones</persRef>, the Adjutant General came again for the copy of the

								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> took back the papers he had left with me
							yesterday— I approved the proposed printed regulations for the issues of

							was necessary to <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott’s</persRef>
							argumentative Letter, except a simple acknowledgment of its receipt,
							with notice that it had not in any respect changed the views, upon which
							my decision had been formed— <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi

							a Resolution of the Corporation of the City of Washington, for raising a

							nothing new to alledge— I now desired her not to come to me again— She
							hinted, that her husband did not wish to be discharged from prison

								>General Peter B. Porter</persRef>, the newly appointed Secretary of
							War, who arrived this morning— The General had written to me that he
							would defer his final answer, with regard to his acceptance of the
							appointment till his arrival here— He now mentioned that there was only
							one scruple which had occasioned hesitation in his mind. There is a
							question pending with respect to the amount of his compensation, as
							Commissioner under the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Articles of the Treaty of Ghent— The
							Treaty itself; an agreement made at the Exchange of the Ratifications
							and two Acts of Congress, passed at different times have bearings upon
							the question; and his accounts as Commissioner are yet unsettled. I said
							that as he would have no agency in the settlement of his account, the
							questions upon it could not be affected by his acceptance of the Office
							of Secretary of War, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay was of the
							same opinion, observing that the question upon the Settlement of my

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> came to speak of
							the Execution of the Resolution of the House of Representatives,

								ref="wadsworth-alexander">Captain Alexander S. Wadsworth</persRef>,
							and we had a general conversation upon the objects chiefly to be
							attended to upon the expedition, which he expects will take from two to
							three years for their accomplishment— As its objects are partly
							scientific, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard wished that some men

								ref="reynolds-jeremiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							observed that in order to bring to a point the whole subject, he should

						<p>Read <persRef ref="evelyn-john">Evelyn</persRef>, and visited the Garden
							before my ride. The Persimon which had come up in the Southern Seedling
							bed, was killed— The fork seed-leaves having been broken off, I suppose
							by the heavy rain, Night before last— Perhaps one half the last years
							Shagbarks are also perishing— Their leaves scorching up and
							disappearing— The vegetation of the others shoots in lateral Stalks, and
							over-sized leaves— No growth of the stem this year— A bud formed however
							on the top of some of them promising a growth next year— In the Eastern
							Seedling bed, I find two more of the Battle-ground Oak-Acorns which I
							planted the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of October, now just up— I
							planted 6.—the four others came up 29. April and within a week after—
							The whole six are now up; but why these two should come seven weeks
							later than the others I cannot explain.— One of the Plumtrees in the
							same bed is 27 inches high: there is one, not more than three inches
							high; the rest of various sizes between the two— One or two of the peach
							trees are 25 inches high— The wild Cherries 14 inches—one apple about
							the same; but the shooting leaf has been attacked by an insect, and
							further growth for this year is arrested— There is one Pear tree about a
							foot high— I planted in Seedling pot N. 9. dry Tangier lemon seeds and
							6. fresh cherry Stones— I sent for <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Brent</persRef>, and spoke with
							him concerning the application of <persRef ref="mitchel-thomas3">T. S.
								Mitchel</persRef> for the appointment of a new Justice of the Peace—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent knew scarcely one of the

								Appleton</persRef> came to renew an application for an appointment

							the second Auditor of the Treasury left me a paper containing questions
							in relation to the pay of Brevet Officers— There was a new regulation
							made in June 1827. authorizing the allowance of Brevet pay to every
							officer exercising a command double that of his rank in the line— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee seemed to think that this was not
							legal; if the command was in the Officer’s own Regiment— But the
							restriction upon brevet rank, within the Regiment, applies to the
							command with reference to other Officers and not to the pay. If a
							Captain commands two companies it is only by virtue of Brevet rank as a
							Major—he could not as a mere Captain, command them— He performs the
							duties of a Major, and has therefore a claim to the pay of that rank;
							equally whether the companies belong both to one regiment, or to
							different corps— I gave this opinion to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lee— <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							some diffidence of his competency for discharging them, but I told him I
							had no doubt they would soon become familiar and easy to him— I
							recommended to him to give his early attention to the accountability of
							all the various branches of service in the Department— I observed there
							had been some irregularities which had crept into practice from the
							illegal controul over the expenditures first assumed by <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>,
							and which <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef>
							finding established, had not entirely rectified. I mentioned

							with regard to the Settlement of <persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kenney’s</persRef> account, which I
							believed was not yet removed— I also mentioned the appropriations for
							Surveys, and works of Internal Improvement, under the Act of    April
							1824. and subsequent acts in furtherance of it— I said it was necessary
							to specify the head of Department under whose direction each Survey or
							purposed work should be placed which I proposed to do by giving written
							authorities— That distinct accounts should be opened at the Treasury for
							each separate work, and that nothing should be charged to those
							accounts, paid to the Officers of the Army employed upon the surveys,
							except the extra allowance to them, for being employed on that service—
							Their pay and other allowances as Officers being of course charged to
							the Army Accounts. <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"

							two large bundles of papers, which he said were the Letters received
							yesterday, and this day relating to the Execution of the Law for the
							Relief of the Revolutionary Officers and Soldiers— He spoke of the

								>President</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="kent-joseph;stewart-andrew;may-frederick;lenox-peter;smith-walter;janney-phineas"
								>Directors</persRef> of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal; which was
							satisfactorily accomplished— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush said
							that his Engagements of duty here, would not permit him to be absent
							from the City this Summer. He recurred again to the Construction of the
							Act for the Relief of the Revolutionary Warriors, and urged the
							allowance of the highest Captain’s pay, to Officers of Infantry above
							that rank; to which I finally assented. We rode this morning by the
							Race-ground to Rock Creek; before which I read <persRef
								ref="evelyn-john">Evelyn</persRef>, and visited the Garden— After
							dinner I walked round the Nursery— In the Garden I cut down a stem of
							Althea, and set it in the Corner of my Seedling box N. 4. but this is
							not the right Season. There are in my Southern Seedling bed three
							flourishing Catalpas of last years spontaneous growth. Of the 8. Pots of
							Brazilian flower seeds planted 8. May one shoot only, the Jasminum
							Muscoza, just appears. I put in to seedling Pot N. 4. a deposit of
							decaying raspberries; and took from it one Tangier Orange-seed planted
							in it 3 June, which had a tap-root half an inch long. I now placed it in
							N.E. Corner of Box N. 3— I planted in Pot N. 7. 12. Black-heart Cherry
							Stones. The Althea in Box N. 4. is putting out its second leaf proper—
							The Persimon in Pot N. 1. puts forth its 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							leaf— In the Nursery— No appearance of new Cork Oaks since the 16<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi>—one black walnut in the South border,
							planted 11. April. The English Walnuts and Shag barks suffer severely
							from the depredations of nightly bugs. The Chesnuts not quite so much— I
							found four young trees of spontaneous growth, but know not what they
							are—Mulberry? Sycamore? Willow Oak?</p>

						<p><date>22. IV:15.</date> Sunday— Sun rose 4:42.</p>
						<p>Heard at the Unitarian Church this morning, <persRef ref="burnap-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burnap</persRef>, from Romans
							14.7. “For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.” A
							Dissertation, upon the importance to the character and conduct of every
							individual, of his influence upon the destinies of others— The most
							remarkable part of the Sermon was a contrasted parallel between the
							Characters and the historical fortunes of <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Buonaparte</persRef>, and of <persRef
								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>; of the former of whom
							he spoke in terms of unqualified severity, and of th latter with
							equal panegyric— Buonaparte should have said when dying [“]Oh! what a
							wounded name I leave behind”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burnap said
							his influence over the fortunes of others was greater than that of any
							man that ever lived—and that he turned it all to bad purpose— Neither of
							these assertions was correct— When Buonaparte was at the pinnacle of his
							power in the Summer of 1810 I told poor <persRef ref="six-willem">Six
								d’Oterbeck</persRef> then Minister of <persRef ref="bonaparte-louis"
								>Louis Buonaparte</persRef> at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Petersburg, that Napoleon knew nothing but how to win Battles; and that
							after all standing by itself was but a precarious kind of knowledge— Six
							then all but worshipped him—but he told me that Napoleon, had conceived
							the opinion that he was possessed of supernatural power— That he was
							more than a human being; and that this phantasy had taken possession of
							all his family. Six believed that he would finish by establishing a
							Western Empire, embracing the whole Continent of Europe, and that he
							would claim to be the prophet of God, and enact over again the Tragedy
							of <persRef ref="mahomet">Mahomet</persRef>— He also believed that he
							wo<unclear>uld</unclear> succeed in carrying that plan into effect— Bonaparte was a man
							of great genius for military combinations and operations—whose head was
							turned by success—who had magnificent imaginations, and some generous
							purposes; but was under no controul of moral principle. Very shortly
							after my conversation with Six, here referred to Napoleon drove his
							brother Louis from the throne of Holland which he annexed to the French
							Empire— Six d’Oterbeck was recalled, and not long afterwards drowned in
							one of the Canals of Amsterdam— Napoleon and his preternatural power
							have crumbled into dust; and now he becomes the Moral of a Sermon

						<p>For the benefit of my health I began this day to combine the river bath
							and the ride— Rode to the Rock near the Bridge— Swam about ten minutes;
							and then rode again, round the Capitol Square home— Labour in the garden
							is a third expedient of exercise to which I shall perhaps hereafter
							resort— I have not yet ventured to undertake it— My complaints result
							from Sedentary habits, for which laborious and hardy exercise is the
							best remedy— I visited this morning the garden. It is said in the Letter
							about the Lucombe Oak in Evelyn. Vol. 1. p. 75 that other Oaks shoot
							twice in the year—in May and August— My Oaks in the Garden have put out
							yet only one shoot, from two to three inches long, and then spread out
							their leaves like the Petals of a flower— Most of the leaves are of the
							rock chesnut kind; and in the Nursery many of them have already put out
							a second shoot, some of them being at least a foot tall. The first
							appearance of the second shoot in some of them is in the form of
							miniature leaves of the light Strawberry colour. The first growth of
							Rock chesnut leaves, have in many of these plants spread out to their
							full size as on the tree, and the second shoot putting out smaller
							leaves, gives the whole plant the appearance of Stages one above another
							like a Chinese Pagoda. I planted two whole Cherries in box N. 5.

									>r</hi> Thomas S. Mitchel</persRef> came for an answer to the
							application for the appointment of <persRef ref="butt-richard">Richard
								Butt</persRef>, as a Justice of the Peace in the neighbourhood of
							the Poor house— I had not obtained the information necessary to judge of
							the expediency of the appointment, and asked M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Mitchel to call in a few days upon <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> at
							the Department of State— He was afterwards here, and said he could not
							find upon enquiry who any of the applicants were— <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>
							called, and soon went to attend the adjourned meeting of the Stock
							holders of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal— He spoke of the necessity of
							employing further clerical aid, for the execution of the Act for the
							relief of the revolutionary Officers and Soldiers— He proposed to refer
							it all to Asbury Dickins, and to allow him extra-compensation for that
							extra-service— I told him that to this there was an express prohibition
							of Law, in the Act of 20. April 1818. which I read to him— I advised him
							to engage all necessary Clerk-hire; but to observe the limitations of
							the Law. He still inclined to leave it to Dickins, and rely upon an
							appropriation by Congress to grant him the extra-compensation— <persRef
								ref="fullerton-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Fullerton</persRef> called with <persRef ref="clark-william2">Judge
								Clark</persRef> the newly appointed Treasurer of the United States—
							I mentioned to him the public convenience which would be served by his
							entering on the execution of his Office on the first of next Month— So
							that his Accounts as Treasurer might commence with the quarter. <persRef
								ref="fendall-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fendall</persRef> was here, and I asked him for a printed copy of
							the Laws of the last Session which he afterwards sent me so far as they
							have been printed in the pamphlet— <persRef ref="levy-n">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Levy</persRef> the Consul at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Thomas called, and renewed his old
							complaint that the Government of the Island would not allow him to
							receive and keep the Registers of Vessels of the United States arriving
							there. I desired him to renew the representation in writing— <persRef
								ref="porter-peter">General Porter</persRef>, brought me a fresh
							Letter from <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef>— He
							says he is distressed and embarrassed by my reiterated decisions against
							him. That he cannot obey the commands of his junior and inferior
							officer— That he intends to apply for redress in some form to Congress;
							and he asks a furlough of six or nine Months for that purpose. As this
							is an affair in which I deem it necessary to take every step with
							deliberation, I desired General Porter to give notice to the other
							members of the Administration of a meeting on the subject at one O’Clock
							to-morrow; and in the mean time to communicate General Scott’s Letter to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, and <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef>— General Porter brought also the Reports of the
							two Commissioners under the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article of
							the Treaty of Ghent; and shewed me on a small map the Island concerning
							the possession of which they differed— He charges unfairness upon the
							British Commissioner <persRef ref="barclay-thomas">Barclay</persRef>,
							and proposed that <persRef ref="delafield-joseph">Major
								Delafield</persRef> should make a supplementary written statement in
							reply to the misrepresentations of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Barclay to which I agreed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent sent me
							several despatches received since <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s</persRef> departure yesterday
							Morning—among them Letters from <persRef ref="rochester-william">William
								B. Rochester</persRef>, Charge d’Affaires to Guatemala; who has
							returned and landed at Savannah— The Republic of Central America is in a
							state of civil War, and the Government is virtually dissolved— There was
							a recommendation respectably signed recommending <persRef
								ref="hebb-william">William Hebb</persRef> for the appointment of a
							Justice of the Peace, and I directed a Commission for him to be made
							out— <persRef ref="pleasonton-matilda">Miss Matilda Pleasonton</persRef>

								>Charles</persRef>, and now much involved in giving him an analysis
							of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> Oration for Roscius

							Board, he requested my particular attention, to the proceedings of a
							Court of Enquiry recently held at Boston, upon the conduct of <persRef
								ref="percival-john">Lieutenant Percival</persRef> of the Navy at the
							Sandwich Islands.— The proceedings are very voluminous, and have but

								ref="preston-william">Preston</persRef> is a young man from
							Philadelphia who applies for a Midshipman’s Warrant. His name has been
							long on the Register of applications at the Navy Department— He now
							wrote me a Letter of direct solicitation, which he brought here himself,
							and desired to see me— I received him and referred him to the Secretary
							of the Navy to whom I promised to speak, and did speak in his behalf.
							Cabinet Meeting at one— <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>
							<persRef ref="porter-peter">General Porter</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> present— I stated to them that in every step of
							these proceedings with <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General
								Scott</persRef>, I wished to act with the benefit of their advice—
							That the conduct of General Scott was insubordinate and disrespectful to
							a degree that were it not for the gallant services which he has rendered
							to the Country, I should some time since have dismissed him from the
							army— That on the rigorous principle of military subordination it was
							perhaps my duty so to have done— But it was entirely in the Nature of
							our principles and Institutions, to temper with kindness and indulgence
							even the rigidity of military discipline— And I thought it peculiarly
							proper so to do in the case of an Officer who stood so high in the
							estimation of his Country, and towards whom I had personally no other
							than friendly feelings. He had now three times successively manifested a
							disposition of disobedience to lawful commands; and now asked for a
							furlough till next April, avowedly to make an application in some form
							to Congress against the orders and decisions of the President— This
							allegation was itself an insult: for in what manner could Congress
							controul these orders and decisions. Certainly by no other mode than by
							Impeachment of the President, or by an ex post facto Law to annul a
							purely Executive Act. I should therefore on no consideration grant him a
							furlough— It had occurred to me, that in giving him this answer it would
							be proper to order him peremptorily to his Post, and to fix a day when
							his present leave of absence from it should cease— General Porter
							thought an intimation ought to be given in the answer, not only that the
							furlough could not be granted; but that the request was not admissable
							even as a subject of consideration: which was approved— General Porter
							also said that the course might be taken of ordering him here—of giving
							him informally and verbally warning of the consequences which he was
							bringing upon himself, by his conduct, and inducing him to ask <pb
								type="ms" n="586"/>to withdraw all the correspondence upon the
							subject, and repair to his Post: but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush
							said that with Scott’s character, and after his controversy with
								<persRef ref="gaines-edmund">Gaines</persRef> upon this same
							question he would certainly take every such indulgence for concession,
							and abuse it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard concurred in this
							view— I desired General Porter to make a draft of a Letter, limiting the
							furlough, and we adjourned the meeting till to-morrow at one— I visited
							the Garden and Nursery: perceived no new vegetation since the 16<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> but the Sun is scorching every thing— I
							planted one Apricot Stone in the Centre and one Persimon seed at the
							side of each of the Pots N. 7. 8. and 9. One Tangier Orange seed planted
							3. June in Pot N. 4. this day came up.</p>
