						<p>The number of visitors was smaller than usual, but they absorbed as

							Maryland introduced <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Polk</persRef>, originally from that State, but now of Indiana— He
							left with me a Letter soliciting an appointment as Commissioner to treat
							with Indians, jointly with <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Governor
								Cass</persRef> of the Michigan Territory to purchase lead mine
							lands, and also for the purpose of exploring scientifically the Country.
								<persRef ref="tucker-ebenezer">Judge Tucker</persRef>, a member of

							West Point, and <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bailey</persRef> member of the House from Massachusetts.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey spoke of <persRef

								Appleton’s</persRef> accounts; and of the application of <persRef
								ref="bates-john">J. A. Bates</persRef> for a purser’s appointment.
							He thought there had been some partiality in the <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>, and that the
							State of Massachusetts had not a full proportion of the naval
							appointments: in which I assured him he was mistaken— <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> was
							here, and informed me that <persRef ref="tucker-thomas">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tucker</persRef> the Treasurer was
							dangerously ill, and had been for several days— He said it would be
							indispensably necessary, unless he should very shortly recover to
							appoint a person to perform temporarily the duties of the Office— We
							concluded however to wait until Monday before making the appointment,
							and in the meantime to cast about for the person to be selected— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush spoke also of the Silk Manual,
							preparing by <persRef ref="mease-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mease</persRef>, and of which he is writing a few concluding pages.
								<persRef ref="ingersoll-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Edward Ingersoll</persRef> called, and spoke of the Memoir of
								<persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> written by him, and
							published in the biography of the Signers of the Declaration of
							Independence— I told him of my design to write Memoires of the Life of
							my father; and perhaps a History of the United States from the formation
							of the present Constitution of the United States— But I said if I did I
							should probably leave the work to be published after my decease. We had

								>Samuel H. Smith</persRef>— Major Stark is a manufacturer residing
							at Pembroke, New-Hampshire; and was summoned here to give testimony by
							the Committee of Manufactures; he had told me when last here that he had
							nothing to ask; but he now left with me a Letter from his Son <persRef
								ref="stark-david">D. M’k. Stark</persRef>, requesting him to procure
							for him, while at Washington, a Clerkship in one of the public Offices,
							or a situation in the Custom House at New-York— There was a Cabinet
							Meeting at one O’Clock attended by the Heads of the Departments of
							State, Treasury, War and Navy. The <persRef ref="wirt-william">Attorney
								General</persRef> was absent— The Seizure of the prize Slaves by the
								<persRef ref="pinckney-william2">Collector</persRef> at Key-West and
							the Note of the British Minister, <persRef ref="vaughan-charles"
								>Vaughan</persRef>, were discussed, and the case has become yet more
							complicated, by claims for salvage this day received by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, from Citizens of the United States,
							for having saved the British Schooner herself where she had struck upon
							the reef, and the cargo, of her prize which was wrecked— In the
							correspondence forwarded with the claim, <persRef ref="holland-edward"
								>Captain Holland</persRef> admits that salvage was due, but he went
							away without allowing any thing— The whole transaction presents five or
							six different questions involving 1. the fact of capture. 2. The right
							of capture, not by the Law of Nations but by virtue of a Treaty between
							Spain and Great-Britain 3. The Laws against the Slave-trade, of Spain,
							Great-Britain, and the United States— 4. The territorial jurisdiction of
							the United States— 5. The revenue Laws of the United States. 6. The Act
							of Congress of 3. March 1825. concerning wrecks on the Coast of Florida.
							7. The right of Salvage according to the Laws of Nations 8. The
							privileges and exemptions, of the public ships of one Nation within the
							territorial jurisdiction of another— And very probably 9. A claim of
							protection, and indemnity of the Spanish owners of the Prize-Ship,
							stranded within the jurisdiction of the United States— Some of these
							questions are exclusively of judicial cognizance; others altogether
							executive; but even of those triable at Law some appear to be beyond the
							jurisdiction of our tribunals and others of their cognizance alone. We
							had much conversation upon all these points, without coming to any
							definitive result. Finally M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard took
							the papers, with promise to put them into the hands of the Attorney
							General to-morrow; and we are to have another Meeting on Monday.</p>

						<p><date>3. V:30.</date> Sunday.</p>
						<p>Remiss in the performance of my daily tasks which threw me into arrears:
							first by an hour absorbed this morning in reading the lives of <persRef
								ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef> and of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> in Plutarch; and then by
							dallying with time in the Evening.—I heard however <persRef
								ref="wiswall-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wiswall</persRef> from Romans 8.9. “Now if any man have not the
							Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.” a Dissertation upon the Spirit of
							Christ— Written in a plain Style; and read without attempt at eloquence—
							There was nothing in it to blame; and nothing left upon the memory of
							the hearer: between the Services <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett</persRef> called and read to
							me a part of his Speech delivered in the House of Representatives the
							day before yesterday; and which he had written off for the printer it
							was that relating to my accounts, and to some of the Slanders in
							circulation against me. It is to be published to-morrow morning, and a
							great part of it in which he had reviewed the Laws concerning the
							contingent expenses of foreign intercourse—had already been given to the
							Printer— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett said <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sergeant</persRef> had yesterday made an admirable Speech on the
							same Resolutions— In the afternoon I heard <persRef ref="baker-daniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>, from Jeremiah
							6.16. “Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for
							the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall
							find rest for your Souls.” He omitted the remainder of the verse— But
							they said we will not walk therein. This omission made it a Sermon <pb
								type="ms" n="421"/>merely of exhortation, and not of rebuke— The
							division of the discourse: was natural, and judicious— 1. That in the
							pursuit of happiness there is a good way, and that it is in the old
							paths. 2. That it is the duty of man to search, and enquire after this
							good way. 3. That having found it, they must walk in it—as well in faith
							as in practice. 4. That the reward of this shall be happiness— Rest unto
							the Soul— The text is a fruitful one for the support of the antient
							doctrines and primitive manners— The chapter from which the verses is
							taken contains one of the most awful prophesies of the capture of
							Jerusalem, by the Chaldean conquest. The charges against the people, are
							of covetousness—false dealing—Slander—and abomination; meaning I suppose
							idolatry— It is by the reform of these abuses, that the warning of the
							Lord offered rest to their Souls—that is, Peace—redemption from the
							horrors of the invasion and conquest that awaited them— This view of the
							text however was not taken by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker— His
							application of the lesson of the prophet was only to sustain the
							doctrines of Calvinism— But the good way of the old paths, might be
							urged more plausibly as to doctrines, by the Romist, or Greek Church
							than by Protestant Calvinist— Nor is a text from the Old Testament much
							adapted to recommend the Christian System by which all old things are
							done away, and all things are become new— The most forcible application
							of this beautiful imagery would be to practical morality—to those
							virtues which are of all ages, and to which men must return, to escape
							the desolation which their vices must ultimately bring upon them— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett dined with us—and <persRef
								key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> W. S.
								Smith</persRef> spent the afternoon and evening with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">her Sister</persRef>— I passed it with
							them, and wrote nothing.</p>

							appointment of <persRef ref="woodbridge-william">M<hi rend="superscript"

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wing</persRef>, the Delegate
							from the Territory, who had told me that he had a person in his eye,

							That is when the acceptance by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbridge
							of his judicial appointment shall be known— <persRef ref="barbour-james"
								>Governor Barbour</persRef> left with me a list of Officers to be
							nominated for promotion by Brevet—involving a question, whether Officers

							can be made out by patching together the fragments of time before and

								Taylor</persRef> from New-York, successively called and engaged

							Dorsey made various enquiries, with a view to answer some of the

							two Resolutions of that body; one advising and consenting to the

								<persRef ref="todson-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Todsen</persRef> came with some new recommendatory certificates, and
							soliciting a fresh appointment to an agency at the African Colony— The
							Cabinet Meeting was held from one to four O’Clock— Present all the
							members— I first referred to their Consideration a Letter, received this
							Morning from <persRef ref="forsyth-john">John Forsyth</persRef>,
							Governor of Georgia, enclosing a printed pamphlet, containing a
							Constitution of the Cherokee Nation of Indians, regularly formed by an
							Assembly of Chiefs last July, in all essential points resembling the
							Constitution of our States; establishing a Legislative power in two
							branches; an elective Chief Magistrate, and a judiciary of a Supreme,
							and subordinate Courts. The Governor of Georgia considers this as
							violating the Article of the Constitution of the United States, that no
							new State shall be formed within any of the separate States or by
							uniting parts of different States; and he calls upon me to be informed,
							what the General Administration intended to do in this case— I observed
							that I did not consider the Article of the <pb type="ms" n="424"
							/>Constitution cited by the Governor of Georgia, as applicable to the
							case: supposing its operation must necessarily be limited to the parties
							to the compact. But I thought that the Indians could not by any
							formation of a Constitution, change the character of their Relations
							towards the United States, or establish an Independent civilized
							Government within the Territories of the Union— There was some
							discussion upon this point, and <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> inclined to the
							opinion, that the principle which I assumed did bring the subject within
							the Article of the Constitution to which the Governor of Georgia
							appeals. He also thought that the right of the Cherokees to form a
							Constitution might depend upon the nature of the Constitution itself— He
							did not view it as a necessary consequence that their Constitution must
							be incompatible with our territorial rights— I therefore requested the
							members of the Administration to take and examine the papers with a view
							to an early meeting to determine what shall be done— The other and
							proper object of the present meeting was, the answer to be given to
								<persRef ref="vaughan-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Vaughan’s</persRef> Note, upon the complaint of <persRef
								ref="holland-edward">Lieutenant Holland</persRef>, for the Seizure
							of 121. Africans by the <persRef ref="pinckney-william2"
								>Collector</persRef> at Key-West— The instructions to be given to
							the Collector—the course to be pursued with regard to the claims for the
							Salvage; and the probable contingency that a Spanish claimant may
							hereafter appear, of the wrecked Slave trader— I never knew a
							transaction entangled with so many controvertible questions— After long
							discussion, which terminated more in passing from one difficulty to
							another than in settling any one of them, I concluded. 1. That the
							answer to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan, should explicitly deny
							all right of complaint by Lieutenant Holland, for the seizure of the
							Negros, and rather waive the claim of the Collector to payment of duties
							on the goods— But the claim to Salvage to be explicitly stated to him—
							An offer of time to be made, within which Lieutenant Holland may bring
							the question of his right to the negroes before the competent judicial
							tribunal within the United States, but with information that the men
							being emancipated by our Laws, must within a reasonable time be sent to
							the Colony of Liberia in Africa— Corresponding Instructions are to be
							given to the Collector at Key-West, and <persRef ref="southard-samuel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> is to be
							making all necessary preparations to provide without unnecessary delay
							for the transportation of these people from Key West to the Colony— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had a Note verbale, from the Russian
							Minister, <persRef ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef>,
							complaining of the Slander upon the memory of the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef>, in the pamphlet
							noticed by <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Everett</persRef>, and enquiring if there were no means of obtaining
							reparation for it— I advised M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay to see
							the Baron, and say to him that there was no remedy against such libels
							in this country but contempt. But to observe that in this particular
							instance, the calumny upon the Emperor Alexander, was slight, and
							evidently used only as inducements to the infamous imputations upon me
							and <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>— This
							Evening we had the fifth Drawing-Room; very thinly attended. The House
							of Representatives, sat till ten O’Clock, and came to an unanimous vote
							on the Retrenchment Resolutions.</p>

						<p>I omitted to mention that yesterday I sent Message to Congress. N. 6.
							with the Treaty with Sweden the Ratifications of which were exchanged by
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> and <persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron
								Stackelberg</persRef> the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last
							Month. <persRef ref="tracy-phineas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tracy</persRef> member of the House of Representatives from New-York
							was here this morning, and made some enquiries respecting the principle
							of reappointment to Offices the tenure of which is limited to four
							years. I told him that the Act of Congress of 15. May 1820. by which all
							the offices employed in the collection of the Revenue, were thus
							limited, had not answered the purpose for which it was intended— That
							the ostensible object under colour of which it had been carried through
							Congress had been <pb type="ms" n="425"/>to secure the accountability of
							those Officers; for which other enactments would have been much better
							suited. That its real and immediate object was to promote the election
							of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">W. H. Crawford</persRef> as
							President of the United States in 1825— It placed the whole body of
							executive Officers of the general Government throughout the Union, at
							the mercy for their continuance in Office of the Secretary of the
							Treasury, and of a Majority of the Senate— It was drawn up by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford, as he himself told me— It was
							introduced into the Senate by <persRef ref="dickerson-mahlon">Mahlon
								Dickerson</persRef> of New-Jersey, then one of his devoted
							partizans, and its design was to secure for M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crawford the influence of all the incumbents in Office at
							the peril of displacement, and of five or ten times an equal number of
							ravenous Office-seekers, eager to supplant them. This object succeeded
							so far as to enlist a multitude of most active electioneering partizans
							in Crawford’s cause— The Custom House Officers throughout the Union, the
							District Attorneys, Marshals, Register of the Land-Offices, Receivers of
							Public Monies, Paymasters in the Army, and all their family connections
							were ardent Crawfordites— The Senate was conciliated by the permanent
							increase of their power, which was the principle ultimate effect of the
							act, and every Senator was flattered by the power conferred upon himself
							of multiplying chances to provide for his friends and dependants— But
							the gravity of the mess was disproportioned to the length of the lever—
								<persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Monroe</persRef>, unwarily signed the Bill, without adverting
							to its real character— He told me that <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef> considered it as in
							principle unconstitutional. He thought the tenure of all subordinate
							executive Offices, was necessarily the pleasure of the chief by whom
							they were commissioned— If they could be limited by Congress to four
							years, they might to one—to a month—to a day, and the executive Power
							might thus be annihilated— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe himself
							inclined to the same opinion; but the question had not occurred to him
							when he signed the Bill— In carrying the act into execution he adopted
							the principle of renominating every Officer at the expiration of his
							Commission, unless some charge of misdemeanor should be adduced and
							proved against him; and during the last eighteen Months of that
							administration, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford was disabled
							both physically and politically from making the use of this act which he
							had intended— I have proceeded upon the principle established by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe; and have renominated every
							Officer, friend or foe, against whom no specific charge of misconduct
							had been brought. The result of the Act has been to increase the power
							of patronage exercised by the President, and still more that of the
							Senate, and of every individual Senator— <persRef ref="phelps-elisha"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Phelps</persRef>, a member of
							the House from Connecticut brought and left with me the papers relating
							to the Petition of <persRef ref="smith-john11">John Smith</persRef> to
							be discharged from prison— He said he would write to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith to ask for explanations and also to
							the District Attorney <persRef ref="huntington-hezekiah"
								>Huntington</persRef>, concerning his own case— I had visits from
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wever</persRef> of
							Ohio, and <persRef ref="schnebley-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Schnebley</persRef> of Washington County, Maryland; and from
								<persRef ref="chase-philander">Bishop Chase</persRef> of Ohio— The
							Bishop left with me a printed copy of his Address to the Legislature of
							the State of Ohio, in behalf of Kenyon College of which he is President—
							He is now here soliciting Congress for a grant of two Townships of Land
							to the same Institution— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pegram</persRef> a visitor from Virginia was also here, and <persRef

							rebuilding a Methodist Church at Frederick, for which he was soliciting

									>r</hi> Southard</persRef> came for the papers, relating to the

									rend="superscript">l</hi> Henderson</persRef> commandant of the
							Marine Corps, to remove <persRef ref="kuhn-joseph">Captain
								Kuhn</persRef> as its Paymaster, and appoint another in his place—
							His wish to do this proceeds from personal misunderstandings between
							them— Kuhn is an active intelligent and punctual paymaster, and I am
							unwilling to see him removed to gratify merely the private pique of his
							commanding officer. The Laws and the practice under them have left it
							doubtful as to the right of the Commandant to appoint the paymaster, but
							there is no power given him to remove him. Henderson infers this from
							the power of appointing, but I am not disposed to allow the inference— I
							desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard to put the papers in the
							hands of the Attorney, and ask his opinion, first whether the power of
							appointing and secondly whether that of removal is in the Commander of
							the Corps— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard informed me of the
							decease this morning of <persRef ref="tucker-thomas">Thomas T.
								Tucker</persRef>, the Treasurer of the United States, and named to
							me two persons, either of whom would willingly accept the Office—
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> had some
							conversation with me, on the attempt of the Cherokee tribe of Indians to
							establish a Constitution of Government for themselves, and on the
							remonstrances of the Government of Georgia against it. He referred to a

									>l</hi> M’Kenney</persRef> of 29. November last to him,
							recommending that notice should be given them as early as possible that
							this cannot be permitted— The Governor mentioned also a Candidate for
							the appointment of Treasurer, and he left with me a written Report of T.
							L. M’Kenney upon certain changes exhibited last year by some of the
							Chiefs of the Great Nation against the Agent <persRef ref="crowell-john"
								>John Crowell</persRef>— M’Kenney was authorized to investigate and
							Report upon those charges. His report is entirely favourable to Crowell
							and imputes all the charges to <persRef ref="ridge-john">John
								Ridge</persRef> the Cherokee— <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> brought me some papers
							from Alabama—a message from the Governor (<persRef ref="murphy-john"
								>Murphy</persRef>,) to the Legislature of the State, and a
							Remonstrance from the Legislature, addressed to Congress against an
							Instruction from the Treasury Department to the Receivers of Public
							Monies, at the Land-Offices, dated last August, directing them to
							receive in payment for lands, only Specie, Bills of the Bank of the
							United States or its branches or Bills of Specie paying Banks of the
							State— The remonstrance of the Legislature is in language little short
							of frantic— A blustering, bullying style which many of the State
							Governors and Governments adopt towards the General Administration, as
							if <pb type="ms" n="427"/>they considered insolence as their only means
							of demonstrating their Sovereignty. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush

							objecting to his reappointment— Writing under excitement, the judge had

							dollars value for a debt of 30,000, but this Committee require a
							relinquishment from the Creditors, as a condition precedent for them to

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="chase-philander">Bishop Chase</persRef> this Morning
							at the Capitol. He read prayers for the fifth Sunday after the Epiphany,
							and preached from Matthew 11.30. “For my yoke is easy, and my burden is
							light.” The Bishop is not eloquent, but there is an earnestness in his
							manner which carries conviction with it—with the exception of a peculiar
							inflection of his voice, which occurs frequently at the close of a
							Sentence, and is not agreeable—his reading would be very good. In
							commenting upon his text, he imputed to the corrupt propensities of
							human <pb type="ms" n="429"/>nature the fact that the hard yoke and the
							heavy burden of the world, were so generally preferred to the easy yoke
							and the light burden of Christ— He told us his hearers that we rejected
							the commands of Christ from the same motives, and the same hardness of
							heart which induced the Jews to reject his person— He drew a striking
							parallel between the precepts of Christ, and the practices of the world,
							and reprobated in terms of great severity the custom of duelling, and
							the sanction of it by the usages of the world— Seduction, and other
							vices of licentiousness he also rebuked with pious indignation as vices
							countenanced by the world; which he contrasted with the unsullied purity
							of the gospel— He was listened to with great attention— The House was
							scarcely full; but not thinly attended— In the afternoon I heard
								<persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker</persRef>, from Titus 2.14. “Who gave himself for us, that he
							might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar
							people, zealous of good works.” A Direct discourse upon the atonement— A
							laborious effort at the pathetic— Malheur a qui fait des efforts says
								<persRef ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire</persRef>. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker never touches upon the atonement but
							he talks nonsense— He gave us a dialogue between Justice and Mercy, at
							the gate of the walled enclosure within which the whole human race are
							impounded, which was ludicrous; and in the verse before his text
							“Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great
							God <hi rend="italic">and </hi>our Saviour Jesus Christ, he said very
							good Commentators had thought it should read <hi rend="italic">even
							</hi>our Saviour Jesus Christ; because God the father never appeared
							visibly— But in espatiating upon the atonement, he lashed himself up
							into such a fever of excitement—that he said he must stop short. He
							could proceed no further. I had an evening visit from <persRef
								ref="peters-richard">R. Peters jun<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi></persRef> with <persRef ref="weld-lewis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Weld</persRef> the principal of the

								<persRef ref="u">Darlington</persRef>, <persRef ref="u"
								>Conrad</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u">Saeger</persRef>; the last a
							German boy about fourteen years of age— I visited that Institution at
							Philadelphia, in October 1824. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Weld has
							now come here, to solicit of Congress a grant of Lands for the benefit
							of the Institution. He has applied also to the <persRef
								ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker</persRef> of the House of
							Representatives for the use of the Hall, to hold in it an exhibition of
							the capabilities of his pupils— I held with them a conversation of half
							an hour, by writing alternately upon Slates, and partly by gesticulation
							between them and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Weld, to whom I
							addressed questions which he expounded to them; and received and
							interpreted to me their answers— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Weld
							left with me a pamphlet, being his fifth annual Report of the Directors
							of the Institution to the Legislature of Pennsylvania, and invited my
							attendance at his exhibition, which I promised if my time should permit.

								</hi>O’Sullivan</persRef> is a woman about forty years of age, who
							presented herself in Male attire, with a subscription book for the
							publication of a French Grammar, to which she wished to obtain my name;
							with a certificate from a Gentleman at Cincinnati Ohio, endorsed by
								<persRef ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice Marshall</persRef> here,
							apologetic for her unsexual dress; which she professed to have assumed
							for the convenience of travelling alone; and with an application for the
							admission of <persRef ref="u">her eldest Son</persRef>, a lad in his
							sixteenth year, as a Cadet at West Point— There was much mystery and
							some incongruity in the Story which she told of herself; and there was
							much which she was not disposed to tell. She began by announcing herself
							as the Sister of a man named <persRef ref="osullivan-john"
								>O’Sullivan</persRef>, once appointed to the Consul of the United
							States at Mogadore; afterward at Teneriffe—subsequently speculating as a
							Merchant and Navigator on the Coasts of Peru and Chili, and finally
							there lost, some two <pb type="ms" n="430"/>or three years since by
							Shipwreck— She said they were the Son and daughter of an <persRef
								ref="osullivan-thomas">Irishman</persRef>, an Officer in the British
							Army in the War of our Revolution— That she was born in Ireland; was
							brought at two years of age to this Country then placed at a Convent in
							Canada; kept there until she was eighteen years old, and taught only the
							French language. That her father’s marriage was unfortunate—against the
							will of his family, by whom it was never acknowledged an under whose
							influence he finally separated from her mother. That she herself had
							been equally ill-fated in marriage, and had three children, two Sons and
							a daughter; the eldest of whom was born in Philadelphia in 1812. She
							then produced three certificates of baptism from the bishop of
							Marseilles in France; attesting to the baptism of these three children,
							by the name of <hi rend="italic">Addicks</hi>,<hi rend="italic"/>and
							that they had been born in lawful wedlock. She said that being somewhat
							philosophical in her opinions, she had not been aware of the necessity
							of having her children christened at the time of their birth, and so
							they had all been baptised at the same time, at Marseilles in 1824. That
							while her brother lived, he and supplied her with about 1500 dollars a
							year: but now she was obliged to provide for herself and family, and
							proposed to keep a boarding school for girls at Baltimore— I asked her
							if she had any other evidence, besides the certificate of the Bishop of
							Marseilles, that her Son was born at Philadelphia— She said <persRef
								ref="tilghman-william">Chief Justice Tilghman</persRef> if living
							could have testified to it; and she thought <persRef
								ref="hopkinson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hopkinson</persRef> would now do so— I observed that her children
							were baptised by the name of Addicks; and that was the name by which her
							Son, if admitted to West-Point must enter She said he would be
							excessively mortified, if compelled to drop the name of O’Sullivan; and
							she expected an Act of the Legislature of Louisiana, would authorise her
							and her children to retain it— There is something strange and romantic,

							a Senator from Connecticut called to recommend the appointment of a
							Consul at the Swedish Island of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Bartholomew’s: He said that by the operation of our new Treaty with
							Sweden together with that of a late Treaty between Great-Britain and
							Sweden, our trade would be placed on a more advantageous footing with
							the British Colonies than it had ever been before— He said he was
							perfectly well acquainted with that trade, having been engaged in it
							himself; and having carried more than one Cargo to the Islands. As an
							example of the oppressive effect of the British Laws upon their own
							Islands, he said he had once taken a Cargo to one of them, part of which
							consisted of candles, then a prohibited Article— He declared them in <pb
								type="ms" n="431"/>his manifest, not expecting they would be
							admitted, but the Collector on looking over the paper said these are not
							Candles—they are herrings—and then with his own hand struck out the word
							Candles—inserted Herrings, and admitted them with the rest of the Cargo—
							I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Foot there was a <persRef
								ref="harrison-robert">Consul</persRef> appointed to the Island of
								S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. Bartholomews, at the last Session of
							Congress. He had however been since employed on a special Agency, to
							visit the principal British Islands, and report what the operation upon
							them of the present interdictions of trade had been— I knew not whether
							he was still detained upon this Service; but if he was, and could not go
							to S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. Bartholomews I would readily nominate
							the person recommended by him— I advised him to see <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, and
							ascertain the fact— Foot spoke also of a debate which arose yesterday in
							the Senate upon a proposition for amending their Rules; in which he had
							taken a part; and he observed that there was much complaint
								<unclear>at</unclear> the State of Connecticut that for many years
							there had not been made a single appointment from that State— <persRef

							of Representatives, of the Committee of enrolled-Bills, brought the
							general Appropriation Bill, and two others for my signature, and I
							signed them— <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef>
							brought me the papers relating to the dispute between the second
							Comptroller <persRef ref="cutts-richard">R. Cutts</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">T. L. M’Kenney</persRef>, on the
							Settlement of M’Kenney’s account for his compensation, and expenses, on
							his Mission and Agency last year with the Indians. M’Kenney has not
							specified the amount of the items, as I had directed that he should.
							Cutts therefore has taken the stud, and refuses to pass the account;
							upon which M’Kenney writes Letters personally abusive upon Cutts; but
							totally destitute of argument upon the matter. Governor Barbour
							requested my decision upon the question, and I wrote one, declaring my
							opinion that the objections of the Comptroller to the passage of the
							Account exhibited were valid— This is a very unpleasant occurrence to
							me, because Governor Barbour, in the unsuspecting frankness of his
							disposition signed a requisition upon the Treasury for the balance of
							M’Kenney’s account, and apparently under the impression that it could
							not be questioned by the accounting Officers— M’Kenney adroitly availed
							himself of this to call upon me for a positive order to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutts to pass the account— On the first
							examination of the papers I was satisfied that Cutts was right, and I
							hoped to avoid the necessity of a formal decision, by advising that
							M’Kenney should present a new account, barely specifying the amount of
							the several items of which it was composed. This he at first refused and
							afterwards evaded, substituting instead of arguments or facts, a stream
							of petulant invective upon Cutts.— Governor Barbour was also very
							indignant at a charge of trickery against him, on account of the order
							in which the documents sent from the War Department, on the call for the
							Mobile Militia Court-Martial proceedings to the House of
							Representatives, were arranged— The proceedings of the House upon the
							subject have been marked with all violence and desperation of party

						<p><persRef ref="vanrensselaer-stephen">General Van Rensselaer</persRef>
							called early this morning, and introduced <persRef
								ref="sinclair-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sinclair</persRef>, a Presbyterian Clergyman a native of Ireland who
							has resided several years in this Country, and has been the principal of
							a School or Academy, from which he has now retired— He was formerly
							minister of a Presbyterian Meeting House at Antrim, of which the
								<persRef ref="stewart-robert">Marquis of
								Londonderry</persRef><persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh’s</persRef> father was an Elder— But he observed
							somewhat archly, that the Presbyterians of Antrim were all Unitarians—
							He gave me a Charity Sermon, preached by him, at the Maryland Institute
							about a year since. <persRef ref="foy-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Foy</persRef> the Gardener of the Capitol came to speak
							of the public grounds, and to disclaim having had any part in the laying
							out of those round this house— Yet he seemed to expect some compensation
							for his attendance here— He asked if I had received any of the foreign
							seeds for which I had sent, and I mentioned the Cork Oak Acorns and
							Spanish Chesnuts from Malaga: He thought the ground was now too wet for
							planting them; but that some time in the Month of March would probably
							serve best, for that purpose— <persRef ref="addicks-barbara">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> O’Sullivan</persRef> came and took
							back her subscription book; and gave me some further particulars of her
							History. <persRef ref="osullivan-john">Her brother</persRef> claimed
							the title of Count of Bearhaven; an Irish title, but by a grant from the
							king of Spain— <persRef ref="mcgran-john">M’Gran</persRef> was another
							Irishman applying for a contribution— <persRef ref="southard-samuel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> brought me a
							large budget of Letters to him, written last May, and recommending
								<persRef ref="stockton-lucius">Lucius Horatio Stockton</persRef> of
							New-Jersey for an Office— I suppose he had reference to the Office of
							Treasurer likely to be soon vacant but he did not mention it— <persRef
								ref="leffler-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leffler</persRef>
							a member of the House from Virginia, introduced two of his Constituents,
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. <persRef ref="u"
								>Sprigg</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Jacob</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="kerr-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kerr</persRef>, a

							orders for the discharge from prison of    <persRef ref="u"
								>Brown</persRef>, and of <persRef ref="kern-michael">Michael
								Kern</persRef>, whose Petitions have been some time before me— He
							spoke of the Cherokee Constitution, and said he now after having read it
							inclined to concur in opinion with me, that we could not permit them to
							form an independent civilized State within our own Confederation.
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> brought and left with me a pamphlet being a Report of
							a joint Select Committee of the Legislature of Maine, upon their
							North-eastern boundary. He spoke further of the Arbitrator to be agreed
							upon with the British Government, at the Exchange of the Ratifications
							of the Convention— The <persRef ref="nicholas-i">Emperor of
								Russia</persRef>, appears to be still, the least exceptionable— I
							thought there would be an objection against the <persRef ref="artois-charles"
								>King of France</persRef>, from the Circumstance that while Canada
							and Acadia belonged to that Nation, they were in controversy with
							Great-Britain, upon this identical boundary— France then took the ground
							of argument now maintained by Great-Britain—and Great-Britain that now
							supported by us— I should fear that a French umpire, would be apt to pay
							extraordinary deference to antient French authorities— The <persRef
								ref="william-i">king of the Netherlands</persRef> was mentioned—the
								<persRef ref="frederick-william-iii">King of Prussia</persRef>—the
								<persRef ref="frederick-vi">King of Denmark</persRef> and some
							others; but without coming to any final decision— <persRef
								ref="allen-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Allen</persRef>, a
							member from Massachusetts came to speak of the removal of the Land
							Office from Delaware to Tiffin— I told him it had been definitively
							settled that it should go to Tiffin. <persRef ref="knight-simeon">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Knight</persRef> came for a decision
							upon the question relating to the settlement of his Accounts, but I had
							not yet made it— <persRef ref="mease-james">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Mease</persRef> called, and was much gratified, that the
							House of Representatives had ordered the printing of 6000 copies of his
							Silkworm report. <pb type="ms" n="433"/><persRef ref="biscoe-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Biscoe</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="scott-gustavus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Scott</persRef>,
							were both applicants for the same Office, of Superintendant of the
							Public Buildings— The Bill for authorizing this appointment has not yet
							the sanction of Congress: but both these persons, and many others are
							already eager competitors for the place— I received this day a Letter
							from my Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, enclosing a
							Bond, as Executor to <persRef ref="boylston-ward">W. N.
								Boylston</persRef>, which I sent back unsigned. Evening party at
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clays attend by <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail2;hellen-mary" type="multi">our young

							a plan, gradually—say an hour every day to set my house in order— To
							make inventories of all the property that I possess, and Lists of my
							Title Deeds and Securities— That they may be ready for my Executors or

							belied—with a view to refer to them in notes to be appended to his
							Speech— I read to him my own Speech in Senate, made on the    of
							November 1803. and reported in the National Intelligencer of the    of
							the same Month; and mentioned to him the principles upon which I had
							voted on the Bills relating to Louisiana, during that Session of

							interrupted by the visit of <persRef ref="preston-james">Governor
								Preston</persRef> and <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis

							said he was to have at that hour a wedding at his house—<persRef

							the fifth requiring the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury,

								>r</hi> Rush said that of the Statements of expenditures no small

							1823. and .1824. with respect to the Officers of the Departments, he
							should refer the Resolution to the several Auditors and Comptrollers,
							and he should answer concerning the Clerks that instead of less than he
							had, more were indispensable—for to manage a Revenue of 25 Millions a
							year, he had eight Clerks, which <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> for a revenue from
							ten to fourteen Millions, had always had nine— It was therefore

						<p>Two persons, one named <persRef ref="u">Furrow</persRef>, from Shenandoah

							from Frederick County, Maryland, called together Strangers, indulging
							their curiosity— <persRef ref="mallary-rollin">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Mallary</persRef>, member of the House of
							Representatives from Vermont, introduced two brothers, named <persRef
								ref="u">Stanley</persRef>, one of whom he said was <persRef
								ref="stanley-henry">his brother in Law</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="cole-abraham">Abraham Cole</persRef>, brought me an
							introductory Letter, from <persRef ref="little-peter">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l</hi> Peter Little</persRef>— He is a
							farmer, living in the County of Baltimore, and his object was to obtain
							a contribution for building a Baptist Meeting House at Black Rock about
							sixteen Miles from the City. I sent to the Department of State, for a
							List of appointments made during the recess of Congress, sent to the
							Senate on the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April 1814. with a
							Report from the Secretary of State, in answer to a Call from that body
							of the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of the same Month— <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef>
							came over from the Department, with a list of recess appointments made
							in 1813. for which he supposed I had sent— He afterwards sent word that
							there was no copy of the Report and list alluded to at the Department;
							but my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> found one among the
							printed Documents of that Session, at the Office of the Secretary of the
							Senate— He furnished it to <persRef ref="wright-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wright</persRef>, with the draft of
							unfinished remarks on this subject of recess appointments which I had
							written in 1826. <persRef ref="chambers-ezekiel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Chambers</persRef> the Senator from Maryland called with
							a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Scott</persRef> of
							Baltimore— Chambers spoke of the debate of the last three or four days
							in the Senate; which has terminated in the failure of an attempt by
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Vice President Calhoun</persRef>, to
							obtain the sanction of the Senate, to a principle which he assumed for
							his justification in permitting <persRef ref="randolph-john">John
								Randolph</persRef> in the winter of 1826, two years since, day after
							day, in speeches of ten hours long, to drink himself drunk with bottled
							Porter, and in raving balderdash of the meridian of Wapping, to revile
							the absent, and the present, the living and the dead— This was tolerated
							by Calhoun, because Randolph’s ribaldry was all pointed against the
							Administration—especially against <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> and me—and because he
							was afraid of Randolph— It continued until the public indignation,
							sparing Randolph, on the score of insanity, ascribed the degradation of
							the Senate which ensued to the dereliction of his duties by the
							presiding Officer of the Senate— Calhoun then bethought himself of the
							pretence that the President of the Senate had no power to call a member
							to order, because no such power was given him by the rules of that body—
							A presiding Officer without power to call a member to order was so
							preposterous an absurdity that after some time, Calhoun narrowed down
							his denegation of his own authority to the call to order for words
							spoken in debate, resting it upon the plausible pretence of preserving
							inviolate the freedom of debate— The discrimination itself surrendered
							the principle; for there was no rule of the Senate giving the President
							the power to keep order <pb type="ms" n="435"/>in any particular, and it
							is palpable that if a grant of power was necessary to enable him to keep
							order, for one purpose it was equally necessary for all— Randolph’s
							course was so outrageous, that the Legislature of Virginia at the
							expiration of his time, elected <persRef ref="tyler-john">John
								Tyler</persRef> in his place—and he was elected for the present
							Congress to the House of Representatives— At this time the opposition
							party, having a majority in the Senate, and wishing to hold up Calhoun
							again for the Vice-Presidency, have been trying various means to get a
							vote of the Senate, sanctioning his ex-abdication of his duty— The
							course pursued for that object has been winding and insidious—and was
							ultimately disconcerted, by an amendment to one of the Rules, proposed
							by <persRef ref="foot-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Foot</persRef>, recognizing the right of the President, in
							common with every Senator to call to order, but giving in the case of a
							decision by the President, an appeal to the Senate. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun receives this as a grant of power
							from the Senate, and expresses his Satisfaction at its limitation by the
							appeal to the Senate— Chambers himself made an excellent Speech in this
							debate— <persRef ref="greenough-horatio">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Greenough</persRef> brought me a Letter of introduction from
								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">Josiah Quincy</persRef> the Mayor of

							given, and notified to the individual dismissed by Letter, from the Head
							of the Department under which he served. Sometimes as in the case of
								<persRef ref="clarke-satterlee">Satterlee Clark</persRef>, only from
							a Subaltern; and if Lee’s belief is correct in this case of Simeon
							Knight not at all— The only evidence of his dismission will be the
							appointment of another paymaster without even saying in his place— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee brought with him, and shewed me a
							statement made at his office, to be exhibited to the retrenchment
							Committee, shewing the multiplicity of business with which it has been
							and is charged. All the offices are equally occupied. <pb type="ms"
								n="436"/>This day at One O’Clock had been appointed for the Cabinet
							Meeting upon the Letter from the <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Governor of
								Georgia</persRef>, with the Cherokee Constitution— But the House of
							Representatives adjourned over from yesterday till next Monday to allow
							the use of the Hall this day for the exhibition of the deaf and dumb
							Teachers and pupils— I learnt the fact this morning from <persRef
								ref="taliaferro-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Taliaferro</persRef>, whom I fell in with on my walk, accompanying
								<persRef ref="taliaferro-james">his brother</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="brown-jesse">Brown’s</persRef> Hotel, whence he was going to
							take passage in the Steam-boat for Virginia— I met also in this walk,
								<persRef ref="barney-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barney</persRef> and <persRef ref="dorsey-clement">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dorsey</persRef>, Members of the House
							from Maryland— I shortened this walk, and at Noon walked to the Capitol,
							leaving directions at home, that if the members of the Administration
							should come at one, to ask them to wait a short time for my return from
							the Capitol; and ordered my Carriage to be there for me at one. I found
							at the Capitol <persRef ref="weld-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Weld</persRef>, delivering in the House of Representatives, an
							Address recommendatory of the Institutions for the Instruction of the
							deaf and dumb, which he soon closed, and then began the performances of
							his three pupils. Their language of gesticulation is two-fold, one
							consists of spelling words; each Letter of the alphabet being marked by
							the sign of a distinct collocation of the fingers: the other is by
							motion of the arms and hands, and of the whole body, and by significant
							expressions of the countenance; it is altogether pantomimic— By spelling
							the Letters they read and write—and thus they identify words— But it is
							through the pantomime only that they understand the meaning of their
							discourse; and two of them in writing a sentence occasionally used
							different words— Their writing is in this respect a translation of the
							discourse delivered by gesticulation; and different translators use
							different words to convey the same thought— Besides the examination
							which they underwent from their teacher M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Weld, and from <persRef ref="gallaudet-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gallaudet</persRef> principal of the original
							Institution at Hartford, Connecticut, several of the Spectators at the
							request of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Weld, joined in the
							examination, and put questions to the pupils which they answered with as
							much acuteness and propriety, as could be expected from youths of their
							age possessed of all their Senses— But as the questions put by the
							Spectators, were upon objects, not within the ordinary routine of their
							Studies, there was not quite the same promptitude or accuracy in their
							answers to them, as when responding to their own Instructors. <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Vice President Calhoun</persRef> asked them what
							was the difference between Power and Right— They gave definitions, but
							without point— They did not suspect what was running in M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s head when he put the question—
							They had not read the debate on the Rules of the Senate, and did not
							know, that Right was a President of a deliberative assembly without
							Power to call to order, for, words spoken in debate. <persRef
								ref="stevenson-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Speaker
								Stevenson</persRef> asked them, who had given the world the greatest
							example of true glory—only one of them attempted to answer this
							question; and he was sadly perplexed—he first answered God, by giving
							the gospel— He was told the question referred to human beings, he then
							wrote <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>— Finding this did not yet
							answer he successively wrote Perhaps <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
								>Bonaparte</persRef>— Perhaps <persRef ref="washington-george"
								>Washington</persRef>— This name, without the perhaps was that which
							I suppose the Speaker had intended to elicit— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Weld to illustrate the method of teaching them abstract
							words and ideas wrote the word irrefragable, the use of which he said
							was unknown to them, and which upon his enquiring of them they signified
							that they did not understand— He taught them the meaning of it so that
							they wrote sentences in which the word was properly introduced— I asked
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallaudet if he could make them
							understand the difference, between irrefragable and incontrovertible— He
							said he could not immediately discern the distinction between them
							himself— I said irrefragable was that which could not be
							refuted—incontrovertible was that which could not even be contested. He
							then taught them the difference between the words of which they wrote
							distinct definitions— <pb type="ms" n="437"/>I desired the question to
							be put to them, if they knew the figure over the Clock in the Hall: but
							they did not— Afterwards I enquired if they could tell the name of the
							Muse of History— One of them said he had forgotten it— But the question
							still did not suggest to him that it was the figure over the Clock. I
							asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Weld if he could make them write
							the line</p>
						<lg>
							<l>“Hark! a glad voice the lonely desert cheers”</l>
						</lg>
						<p>He told me the only word in the line that he should spell to them by
							Letters on the fingers was lonely— The eldest pupil, wrote the line
							Hark! a glad voice the lonely desolation cheers— The youngest boy wrote
							it Hark, a glad voice <hi rend="italic">a </hi>lonely desert cheers— One
							of them was asked to write the names of several distinguished men, of
							antient and modern times, and the four quarters of the globe, which he
							did— The Spectators were requested to name any one of them for a brief
							biography— I named <persRef ref="plato">Plato</persRef>, and the pupil
							immediately wrote down a short account of his life, death and writings—
							One of them wrote down an abstract, of a Conversation he had yesterday
							had with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallaudet on the subject of
								<persRef ref="rousseau-jean">Rousseau</persRef> of Geneva— The
							boy at the request of a Lady, told a Story of a Clergyman, marked and
							mimicked while preaching, by his monkey perched on the canopy over his
							head—to the inextinguishable laughter of his Auditory— There was a boy
							from Alexandria, about fifteen, entirely untaught, with whom, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Weld held some conversation, mutually
							intelligible between him and the boy. He says there is a great
							resemblance between the gestures of all the uninstructed deaf and dumb—
							He says also that throughout this country the proportion of deaf and
							dumb to the whole population is about one to two thousand persons— About
							6000 in the United States— This exercise lasted about three hours, and
							when I came home, I found <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> had been here, and were gone— Governor Barbour
							after waiting some time— <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> came afterwards and I
							had a very long conversation with him about the Cherokee Constitution,
							and the Indian Titles to Lands. He seems not to have considered
							thoroughly the nature of the Indian titles, and to suppose that it is a
							permanent possession of the Soil—like that of the white People— He has
							not yet prepared his Report upon the Claim of Satterlee Clark—My visit
							at the Capitol this day very much interrupted the regular course of my
							business.</p>

							15.21. “But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall

							Chapter in which <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Paul</persRef> declares himself peculiarly the Apostle of the
							Gentiles—and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallaudet in the application
							of his Discourse considered the deaf and dumb as Gentiles of our own age
							and Country— The Sermon written in an ambitious Style was fervent in
							manner and cogent in reasoning— The forlorn and pitiable condition of
							the deaf and dumb, without instruction, and the world of thought of
							knowledge, and of enjoyment created for them by teaching were contrasted
							without elaborate study for effect but by reference to his own
							experience in the progress of educating them— He dwelt especially and
							with power, upon the blessing imparted to them, in the ideas of a
							Supreme Creator, of their own immortality and of the hopes and promises
							of the Gospel. The Hall was well filled, but not crowded; and the Sermon
							was listened to with deep attention— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallaudet is the first founder of the Schools for deaf and dumb in this
							Country, and may without imputation of arrogance, compare his own
							condition and services to his fellow mortals with those of the Apostle
							of the Gentiles— Returning home from the Capitol I met <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards</persRef> of the
							Treasury Department, who stopped and asked me, if I had heard the news—
							I said “none”— He informed me that the Northern Mail had brought the
							account of the sudden Death of <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt
								Clinton</persRef>; Governor of New-York— <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sergeant</persRef> soon afterwards called upon me, and sat with me
							in Conversation, about an hour— This was one of the distinguished and
							ambitious Statesmen of this Union— He was one of the first
							Post-revolutionary great men of the age, but his mind was of secondary
							size, deluded <pb type="ms" n="438"/>by success and flattery into the
							self-conceit that he was of the first magnitude—He came forward at a
							very early age with a brilliant reputation sustained by all the weight
							and influence of his Uncle <persRef ref="clinton-george">George
								Clinton</persRef>, then transcendent in New-York—was of the Council
							of Appointment that broke down, and drove into retirement <persRef
								ref="jay-john">John Jay</persRef> and in 1802 was elected to the
							Senate of the United States— He there sat only one Session, and in
							October 1803 resigned his Office for that of Mayor of the City of
							New-York, then extremely lucrative, but as far beneath that of a Senator
							of the United States in dignity, as surpassing it in profit— This step
							of political bathos marked in characters indelible the measure of DeWitt
							Clinton’s mind— From the Senator of a Sovereign State in the most select
							Council of the Union he shrunk into the police officer of a single City,
							and busied his mind with the regulation of go-carts and the punishment
							of Shop-lifters— He never afterwards got beyond the bounds of the State
							of New-York, as a public man, though in 1812 he made a desperate plunge
							at the Presidency of the United States; purchasing the support of the
							federal party, by a sudden, and even indecent desertion of his own—more
							literally purchasing influence in various parts of the Union—by hired
							Agents, venal presses, and even stipended itinerant preachers—to the
							utter ruin it is said, of his private fortune—alieni appetens, sui
							profusus He thus became a formidable competitor, and received 89
							electoral votes, <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Madison</persRef> receiving 128. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r </hi>Clinton has since gone through at least four vicissitudes of
							political fortune in his own State and was now reduced to the last State
							of declaring himself a partizan of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef>, to rivalize with <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> for the
							Vice-Presidency— The New-York Legislative Caucus therefore in nominating
							Jackson forbore to make any nomination of Vice-President and Clinton was
							feeding his hopes of the China-Jordan, when arrested by the tamer of all
							Ambition, and consigned to the Sepulchre <unclear>and</unclear> the
							worm— I hear in his fate the voice of the same teacher— Be ye also
							ready— Lord, teach us so to number our days that we may apply our hearts
							unto wisdom— At S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Johns Church this
							afternoon, I heard <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read Evening prayers for Quinquagesima
							Sunday and preach from Isaiah 4.5. “And the Lord will create upon every
							dwelling place of Mount Zion, and upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke
							by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by Night: for upon all the
							glory shall be a defence.” There is allusion in this text to the
							Tabernacle and Ark in the Wilderness; but the application is obscured,
							and the smoke was not cleared away by the Discourse— After Church
								<persRef ref="roberdeau-isaac">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

								Clay</persRef> was here; complaining of the state of his health,
							which he says is so bad, that nothing except the existing state of
							things could induce him to continue longer in the public service— He
							thinks his health is gradually sinking: and his Spirits are obviously
							giving way under the load of obloquy, Slander, and persecution which has
							been heaped upon him, as well as upon me— He took the draft of a
							despatch which he had prepared to send to <persRef
								ref="lawrence-william2">William Beach Lawrence</persRef>, Chargé
							d’Affaires at London; with the three Conventions concluded by <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>, which have been advised for ratification by the
							Senate here, and are still to be ratified in England— I suggested one
							alteration in the despatch, and we spoke of the Sovereigns to be
							proposed or agreed to for the arbitration of the question upon our
							North-Eastern Boundary. The <persRef ref="nicholas-i">Emperor of

							rejection I incline to the <persRef ref="william-i">king of the

							of the Administration, to meet here at one tomorrow; upon the Letter
							from the <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Governor of Georgia</persRef>, with
							the Cherokee Constitution— He mentioned also the proceedings in the
							Legislature of the State of Maine, upon the questions relating to the
							North-eastern boundary— The Report of the Agent from the State, <persRef
								ref="daveis-charles">Daveis</persRef>: the Report of the Committee
							of the Legislature of Maine—and the Resolutions of the Legislature—all
							of an inflammatory character— From the Report and Documents of <persRef

							reluctance at giving opinions; all thought the Letter and Resolutions
							should be communicated; but without any expression of opinion upon the
							effect of the Resolution to authorise Congress to erect Toll-gates upon
							that part of the road which lies in Pennsylvania— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay thought there should be in the
							message a Recommendation of a provision by Law, for the permanent repair
							and preservation of the Road— The second object for deliberation was the
							Letter from the <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Governor of
								Georgia</persRef>, with the Cherokee Constitution— And there was so
							much reluctance to the expression of any definite opinion, that after a
							discussion of two hours, I was unable to form any distinct conclusion,
							and adjourned the meeting till one O’Clock next Friday— The
							predominating sentiment was to refer the whole subject to Congress
							without expressing any opinion upon the Constitutional question: and
							that the answer to the Governor of Georgia should merely inform him of
							this reference— But this will not relieve us from the decision of the
							question. We must fairly meet it, nor will there be any advantage gained
							by delay. No one member of the Administration thought the Article of the
							Constitution appealed to by the Governor of Georgia, applicable to the
							case; but no one seemed willing to avow the opinion that it was not so.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush remained, and read me the drafts
							of his answers to the retrenchment Committee. I signed an order for the
							discharge of <persRef ref="nixon-silas">Silas Nixon</persRef>—in prison
							at Boston for Larceny— <persRef ref="hellen-thomas">Thomas J.
								Hellen</persRef> dined with us— <persRef ref="hellen-johnson"

							still keep their chambers.</p>

						<p>Returning on my morning walk round the Capitol Square, I stopped at

								ref="lowrie-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowrie</persRef>
							the Secretary of the Senate brought me three Resolutions of that body,
							confirming Nominations, one of them containing the Naval Appointments—
							Five persons, entire Strangers came together, to see the President’s
							House and the President—one of them said they came from Virginia— They
							sat and conversed with me perhaps a quarter of an hour, and as they were
							going away I asked their names— Each of them named himself—<persRef

							Boston; who told me he had disposed of my Portrait which he painted last
							Summer, to the Athenaeum, and had made a copy of it for himself, to

							will take it to morrow, at the same time with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Greenough, at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King’s—
								<persRef ref="sergeant-john">J. Sergeant</persRef>, member of the

								<persRef ref="u">M’Culloh</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"

								ref="geddes-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
								Geddes</persRef> is a civil engineer, who has long been employed
							upon the New-York Canal, and is now engaged in the Surveys made by order
							of the Government of the U. States. He brought me a profile view of the
							Erie Canal, which was wanting to the work in two large Volumes on the
							New-York Canals; and pasted in before the title page of the first
							Volume— <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> was here to take the final directions concerning the
							friendly Sovereign to be proposed as the arbitrator between us and
							Great-Britain, upon our North-eastern boundary question— I mentioned the
								<persRef ref="nicholas-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef>, the <persRef
								ref="william-i">King of the Netherlands</persRef>, and the <persRef
								ref="frederick-vi">King of Denmark</persRef>— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay told me he had a Letter from <persRef
								ref="kent-joseph">Governor Kent</persRef> of Maryland, upon the
							subject of the appointment of Treasurer of the United States— He did not
							wish his name mentioned unless there was a prospect of Success. But he
							would accept the office if it should be offered. I mentioned several of
							the persons who have the strongest claims, and between whom I shall find
							it most painful to make a selection. He appeared strongly to incline in
							favour of <persRef ref="clark-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clark</persRef> the late Treasurer of Pennsylvania— This Evening was
							the sixth Drawing-Room— Very much crowded— Sixteen Senators; perhaps
							sixty Members of the House of Representatives, and multitudes of
							Strangers—among whom were the Institutors of Deaf and Dumb from
							Philadelphia, New-York and Hartford— The heat was oppressive; and these
							parties are becoming more and more insupportable to me—I wrote this day
							a short Message to both Houses of Congress, and one to the Senate; but
							they were not sent— I wrote about an hour after dinner, before the
							Drawing Room commenced; and nearly another hour after it was over— These
							are among the most difficult returns to labour that I am ever enabled to
							accomplish; but they are indispensable substitutes for the morning hours
							I am losing. Within the last week, I have risen almost every day after
							the dawn, and two or three times in broad day-light.</p>

								<persRef ref="lane-samuel">Lane</persRef>, refused to acknowledge

								<persRef ref="maury-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							November 1827. which I signed— They are to be sent to England by a young
								<persRef ref="blunt-n">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Blunt</persRef> as a special messenger— <persRef
								ref="dickins-asbury">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dickins</persRef>, Secretary to the Columbian Institute, brought me
							to examine Designs for a Seal and Diploma, for that Society, well drawn,
							and which suggesting some alterations I approved. They have not adopted
							the device I had proposed for a Seal, but propose in its stead a hissing
							rattlesnake coiled round a book; to which I object as odious imagery;
							and instead of the classical motto from <persRef ref="horace"
								>Horace</persRef> Lucent Sidera Nautis, with the Ship; they have
							discarded the Ship, and substituted for the motto Favent Astra; which I
							disapproved, as an idea borrowed from the false Science of judicial
							Astrology, and therefore inappropriate to an Institution for the
							promotion of true Science— On this as on the former occasion of the
							Pediment to the Capitol, I observe the extreme diversities in the
							Sentiments of learned and ingenious men, upon matters of taste and
							invention— My device for the Seal, and motto were in my own self-conceit
							ingenious, classical elegant and appropriate—but no one thought them so,
							except myself; and they have taken in its stead a Serpent Sibilant,
							which would be an excellent emblem for the House of Representatives at
							this time, but is in my judgment a very absurd one for a learned and
							literary Institute; and instead of the Stars of Horace, illuminating the
							Mariner’s Night, they have the Stars of judicial astrology, favouring
							the deadly venom of the Rattlesnake— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Dickins also gave me some seeds of two or three plants which he has

						<p>Morning walk round the Capitol Square. <persRef ref="little-peter">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Little</persRef> introduced two of
							his friends, father and Son— One or both of them of his Constituents.
								<persRef ref="knight-nehemiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Knight</persRef>, a Senator from Rhode-Island, made enquiries in
							behalf of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							at Port au Prince— The same person for whom <persRef ref="u">D<hi

							applied: and I gave M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Knight the same
							answer and information, which on the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> I
							had given to him. <persRef ref="karthaus-peter">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Karthaus</persRef> was a visitor from Baltimore, who
							finding me busy, stopped for a short time— Cabinet Meeting at one— All
							present excepting <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Rush</persRef>, who sent by <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> an apology; being confined to his house by
							indisposition— The question was again upon the Letter from the <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Governor of Georgia</persRef>, denouncing the
							Constitution lately adopted by the Cherokee Indians, as a violation of
							the Article of the Constitution of the United States, which interdicts
							the formation of new States within the old ones— It was the opinion of
							every one present that this Article of the Constitution, applied only to
							those who were parties to the compact. That it did not bear upon the
							Indians at all— But <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef>, urged that it was not necessary to take
							this ground either in answering the Governor of Georgia, or in the
							Message to Congress— Even if it would be proper for this Government to
							prevent by force the establishment of the Cherokee Constitution, it
							would require the express authority of Congress to enable the Executive
							to Act— After further discussion, I came to the conclusion to proceed as
							follows—I requested the Secretary of War, <persRef ref="barbour-james"
								>Governor Barbour</persRef> to instruct the Agent of the United
							States with the Cherokee Indians, to give them notice, that we had been
							informed of the Constitution, which they had made for their own
							Government. That they must understand that this cannot in any manner
							alter the state of their Relations with the United States; and that if
							their intention was that it should, we protested against the whole
							proceeding— This will be a sufficient foundation for answering the
							Governor of Georgia, and also for a communication to Congress of his
							Letters, and of the Resolution of the Legislature of the State— <persRef
								ref="wilde-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilde</persRef>,
							one of the members of the House of Representatives from Georgia, has
							offered a Resolution to the House calling for information from the
							President; <unclear>. . . .</unclear> any thing, and if any thing what
							has been done to preserve from violation the same Article of the
							Constitution of the United States, to which Governor Forsyth appeals—
							The resolution was this day considered and debate upon it having arisen
							it was laid upon the table— About four this afternoon, the Officers of
							one of the Militia companies which turned out and paraded this day, sent
							to enquire if I would receive their Salute—to which I assented; and
							accordingly stood at the steps in front of the house, while they fired
							the round, and marched through the yard— Five persons then entire
							Strangers to me, followed me into the House—two of them said they came
							from Virginia, and had a curiosity to see me— We had company to dine.

							Midshipman dismissed from the service, by sentence of a Court-Martial,
							to be restored to the Navy— He left with me several Letters
							recommendatory of Green from respectable persons, among whom are
								<persRef ref="burton-hutchins">H. G. Burton</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gaston-william">W. Gaston</persRef>. He enquired when the young
							man should come for my decision— I advised that he should apply next
							week to the <persRef ref="southard-samuel">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef>— <persRef ref="preston-james">General
								Preston</persRef>, called to take leave: returning to Richmond. This
							Gentleman has been Governor of Virginia, and a General in the Army— He
							is now Post-master at Richmond, an office obtained for him, by the most
							earnest solicitation, to <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>, and which he says is
							in point of profit so far from answering his expectations, that it
							compels him to live separated from his family; the emoluments of his
							place not being sufficient to enable him to maintain them at that place—
								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> was here, with Letters from <persRef
								ref="astor-william">W. Astor</persRef>, President of the American
							Fur Company, urging the re-establishment of a Revenue Cutter on Lake
							Superior— There has been one there heretofore; but of late none— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Astor complains of smuggling carried on
							with Canada, which after having been suppressed by the former Cutter is
							again reviving by the disuse of such a guard— A Letter from <persRef
								ref="stewart-adams">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stuart</persRef>
							the Collector at Michillimackinac but now here, countenances the
							application of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Astor. I thought the
							request should be complied with. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush
							also shewed me a confidential private Letter to him from <persRef
								ref="mitchell-robert">Robert Mitchell</persRef>, Collector at
							Pensacola, mentioning that a friend of his, there had spent some weeks
							last summer in South-Carolina, and had frequently seen <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>,
							with whom he had formerly been intimate as a Schoolmate— That he was in
							the habit of speaking in the most disrespectful and unbecoming manner of
							the whole Administration— Said that all the Departments were in a State
							of the greatest disorder; and that if <hi rend="italic">he </hi>was at
							the head of the Treasury Department, he would effect the same reform in
							its organization, as he had done in the Department of War— The truth is
							that of the reforms in the War Department made while <pb type="ms"
								n="445"/>he was at its head, the most important was the reduction of
							the army from ten thousand to six thousand men, utterly against his
							will, against all the influence that he could exercise, and to his
							entire disapprobation— And all the other changes of organization, were
							upon plans furnished by <persRef ref="brown-jacob">Generals
								Brown</persRef> and <persRef ref="scott-winfield">Scott</persRef>,
							and carried through Congress chiefly by the Agency of <persRef
								ref="williams-john">John Williams</persRef> of Tennessee. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun had no more share of mind in them,
							than I have in the Acts of Congress to which I affix my signature of
							approbation— Calhoun is a man of considerable talent, and burning
							ambition, stimulated to frenzy by success, flattery, and premature
							advancement. Governed by no steady principle; but sagacious to seize
							upon every prevailing popular breeze to swell his own sails— Showering
							favours with lavish hand to make partizans; without discernment in the
							choice of instruments, and the dupe and tool of every knave cunning
							enough to drop the oil of fools in his ear— My Son John dined at
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour’s</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="holzey">Holzey</persRef>, the black boy, belonging to <persRef
								ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef>, and who has been
							several years with us, died about five O’Clock this afternoon. He has
							been sinking several months in a consumption.</p>

						<p>There was a storm of Rain which continued all the morning, and until near
							Sunset, when the weather cleared up— I rode with <persRef
								ref="roberdeau-mary">Mary Roberdeau</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S. Adams</persRef> to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t</hi> John’s Church, where in addition to the
							usual Services of the day, the first Sunday in Lent, <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johns</persRef> was ordained as
							a Priest, and the Communion was administered by <persRef
								ref="chase-philander">Bishop Chase</persRef>— The whole ceremony
							took near four hours of time, and it was close upon 3. O’Clock, when we,
							came out of the Church— The Morning Prayers were read by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Johns— The Sermon by <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							was from 2. Corinthians 5:20— “We are Ambassadors for Christ.” and was
							an exposition of the duties of a Minister of the Christian Gospel— He
							defined, and enlarged upon the character and functions of Ambassadors,
							the highest order of Public Ministers, sent he said from one Sovereign
							to another, or to the Subjects of a revolted Province— It was in this
							light that he considered the parallel between the Service of an
							Ambassador, and that of a Christian Minister— The conclusion of the
							Discourse was a long personal Address to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Johns, who was to be ordained, reminding him of the duties that he was
							about to assume, and finishing with the Vision of <persRef ref="theodorusverax">Theodorus</persRef>, extracted he said from a late publication, and
							the purport of which was to impress upon his mind, the danger and Sin of
							indulgence and tenderness to the sinners in the Ministration of a
							Christian Pastor— Theodorus with a virtuous life and unsullied purity,
							spared the vices of his flock, from the gentleness of his nature and the
							sweetness of his temper— But the Vision was sent to warn him, that this
							mildness and forbearance were themselves sinful, and that he was no
							better than a rotten pillar in the temple of the Lord— Bishop Chase then
							performed the Service of conferring Priest’s Orders upon M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Johns, in which was included the
							administration of the Communion, not only to him, but to all the members
							of the Church present, who chose to partake of it— <persRef
								ref="mccormick-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Cormick</persRef>, and <persRef ref="allen-ethan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Allen</persRef>, episcopal clergymen
							were present, and took some part in the ceremonies, but the ordination
							was performed almost entirely by the Bishop— Immediately after my return
							from Church, <persRef ref="vinton-john">Lieutenant Vinton</persRef>, one
							of the Aids of <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef>,
							called and informed me that the General died this day about Noon— The
							immediate cause of his death, was a lung fever taken this day week, but
							its primary cause was the severe wound that he had received during the
							late War with Great-Britain, and Paralytic shocks which some years
							afterwards disclosed the extent of its malignity— His health has been
							declining for several years, and although long sustained by a firm and
							buoyant Spirit has been sinking irredeemably the last three Months— On
							the fourteenth of last Month he came, and disclosed to me, in a manner
							which deeply affected me, his own state of mind and body, of which he
							was fully conscious— I think I have not since seen him— Lieutenant
							Vinton said that his last thoughts were of the public— Recollections of
							his own services and sufferings and anticipations of the future
							greatness and glory of his Country. He added that among the latest words
							that he spoke, were expressions of regard for me, and of sensibility to
							the kindness I had always shewn him. <pb type="ms" n="446"/>General
							Brown was one of the eminent men of this age and Nation— Though bred a
							Quaker, he was a man of lofty and martial Spirit, and in the late war
							contributed perhaps more than any other man to redeem, and establish the
							military character of the Country. He had a high sense of honour, a
							courteous and unassuming deportment, and conduct irreproachable in
							private life— He has been Commander in Chief of the army from the time
							of its reduction in 1821— The Splendour of the defence of New-Orleans,
							has cast in the shade Brown’s Military fame, and his campaign on the
							Canadian frontier in 1814. far more severely contested than were the
							Atchievements of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>— Less
							aided by good fortune, and less favoured by egregious errors of the
							enemy— There was no service at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s

						<p>Immediately after the scarcely clear rising of the Sun, I took my daily
							walk round the Capitol Square, and on returning gave my fourth sitting
							to <persRef ref="greenough-horatio">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Greenough</persRef> at <persRef ref="king-charles2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> King’s</persRef>— He said he should
							want but one sitting more. I spoke to him to make a marble bust of
								<persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> next Summer; which he
							promised to do— <persRef ref="elgar-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Elgar</persRef> called upon me after breakfast, upon
								<persRef ref="king-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert
								King’s</persRef> claim to certain lots in the City, in payment of
							Services as a Surveyor. There was a Letter from <persRef
								ref="munroe-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Munroe</persRef>, to <persRef ref="lane-samuel">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Lane</persRef>, setting forth M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> King’s claim; which Lane however declined
							to recognize— I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elgar to send me
							the record of King’s purchase of the lots which he afterwards did.
								<persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> were here together— The Governor spoke of the
							honours to be paid <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General Brown</persRef> at
							his funeral— The first process was to search for precedents; and the
							only precedent found was that of the decease of <persRef
								ref="washington-george">General Washington</persRef>; who like
							General Brown was at the time of his decease Commander in Chief of the
							Army; but his circumstances and situation were so peculiar that few of
							the measures then adopted could now be followed with propriety. The
							event was then announced by a special message from the President to
							Congress. I thought that would now be neither necessary nor proper— The
							event was also then announced by a General Order in the name of the
							President to the Army— I supposed it should now emanate from the
							Secretary of War— Governor Barbour said that <persRef
								ref="jones-roger">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Jones</persRef> the Adjutant General had made a draft of an Order;
							but the Governor thought it would be susceptible of improvement, and he
							asked me to make a sketch of such a paper; which I promised to do, but
							desired that Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jones’s draft might be
							sent to me; observing that I presumed much of it might be preserved— The
							Governor afterwards brought a new Letter of complaint from the <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Governor of Georgia</persRef> about another
							murder by Creek Indians— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard spoke
							of a Court of inquiry to be convened at Boston, upon the Charges against
								<persRef ref="percival-john">Lieutenant Percival</persRef>— He
							afterwards sent me the opinion of the <persRef ref="wirt-william"
								>Attorney General</persRef>, and the papers relating to the claim of
								<persRef ref="henderson-archibald">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Henderson</persRef>, to appoint the Staff-Officers of the Marine
							Corps— <persRef ref="osullivan-edward">Edward O’Sullivan</persRef>, a
							boy of about 14 came with a Letter from his mother, whom he called his
							father— I referred him for his solicitation to the Secretary of War—
								<persRef ref="hassler-ferdinand">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hassler</persRef> called and gave me a new book lately published by
							him entitled a popular exposition of the System of the Universe— He is
							now going to Richmond. <persRef ref="mercer-charles">Major

									>r</hi> Walch</persRef> from Annapolis, whose object is to

						<p>Walk round the Capitol Square immediately after Sunrise, closed a short

							had not time to finish. <persRef ref="lawrence-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence</persRef>, a member of the

							friends Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi><persRef ref="u"
								>Harper</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Palmer</persRef>, from that
							State— <persRef ref="silsbee-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Silsbee</persRef> came yesterday from Baltimore where he saw
								<persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> P. C.
								Brooks</persRef>, who with <persRef ref="brooks-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brooks</persRef> and their daughter
								<persRef ref="frothingham-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Frothingham</persRef>, have been called there by the illness of his
							Son <persRef ref="brooks-ward">Ward Brooks</persRef> who resides at
							Baltimore, and is perishing by a rapid pulmonary consumption. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Silsbee told me they did not expect that
							Ward would survive this week— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Silsbee
							likewise read to me a Letter from <persRef ref="mills-elijah">Elijah H.
								Mills</persRef> the late Senator from Massachusetts, who is
							lingering under an incurable hectic, and with a large family to support,
							is thus deprived of his means by the practice of the Law, which was his
							profession and in which he was eminent. He represents his condition to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Silsbee, and intreats him to
							ascertain, whether the Office of Treasurer of the United States,
							expected to be vacated by the decease of <persRef ref="tucker-thomas"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tucker</persRef>, could be
							obtained for him— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Silsbee that
							with the warmest regard for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mills, the
							deepest sympathy with his distressed state, and an earnest desire to
							serve him, I could give him no encouragement to expect the appointment
							of Treasurer, an Office of the highest responsibility, and requiring the
							effective personal agency of its holder— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Mills’s situation, unfortunately disqualifies him from such constant
							attendance, and unremitted labour as the discharge of the duties of this
							place required, and although it would be desirable if possible to avoid
							assigning this reason to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mills himself,
							it must be decisive in precluding even the consideration of his name in
							making the selection— <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor
								Barbour</persRef> left with me, the draft of a General Order
							announcing to the Army the death of <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General
								Brown</persRef>, made by the Adjutant General, <persRef
								ref="jones-roger">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Jones</persRef>— I made another draft embracing almost the whole of
							that of the Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> and adding about as much
							more— <persRef ref="barney-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barney</persRef>, the member of the House of Representatives from
							Baltimore, called with <persRef ref="williams-nathaniel3">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> N. F. Williams</persRef> the U.S.
							District Attorney at that place; and <persRef ref="wickliffe-charles"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wickliffe</persRef>, a member
							from Kentucky, introduced a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> M’Alister</persRef> of that State. Wickliffe is one of
							those worthy personages, who as a member of Congress avails himself of
							the freedom of debate to revile and slander me before the Nation, and
							then of his privilege as a member to introduce his friends to my
							personal acquaintance— This Class of adversaries is not the most
							numerous, nor quite the most despicable— <persRef ref="plantou-anthony"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Plantou</persRef>, is a
							frenchman, a dentist; and a Poet. He gave me a french Ode on the Battle
							of Navarino, composed and published by him, and dedicated to the <pb
								type="ms" n="448"/>allied victors; and he shewed me a set of false
							teeth cramped together by an invention of his own, for which he proposes
							taking out a patent— <persRef ref="mason-thomson">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mason</persRef> the Mayor of
							Alexandria, brought me an Act of the Corporation of that City to
							authorize the drawing of Lotteries for the purpose of making a Turnpike
							Road from near <persRef ref="wiley-william">Wiley’s</persRef> Tavern, in
							Fairfax County to Alexandria—passed 5. December last—but requiring my
							approbation to give it effect, which I accordingly signed— I had also
							visits from <persRef ref="wool-john">General Wool</persRef>, and from
								<persRef ref="white-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								White</persRef> the Delegate from Florida, who introduced a <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webb</persRef> of that
							Territory— Also from <persRef ref="gaines-edmund">General
								Gaines</persRef>, who came to urge his claims to the appointment of
							Major General vacated by the Death of General Brown. I had a long
							conversation with him, in which he set forth his claims with all the
							energy in his power. He appeared to consider the only question to be
							between him and <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef>;
							and he alleged that he was older as a man, and had been several years
							longer in the army— That he had always commanded Scott, except that he
							had once, at the close of the late War, been tried by a Court Martial,
							of which Scott was President; and upon charges which he had reason to
							believe had been instigated by Scott. He complained also that Scott had
							availed himself of his power as Compiler of the Army Regulations, to
							introduce an Article in support of his own pretensions. I told General
							Gaines that I had heretofore examined the controversy respecting the
							question of Rank, between him and General Scott— It was a painful
							subject and I had hoped to be spared the necessity of deciding it. I had
							deeply lamented the personal character given to the contrast by them
							both, and the publication of their pamphlets; for he must permit me to
							say, that I had the highest respect for both—considered both as having
							rendered essential Service to their Country, and equally deserving of
							honour from her— There had been two questions of rank between them—first
							as Brigadier Generals— Secondly as Major Generals by Brevet— In the last
							days of <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe’s</persRef> Administration a respectable Board of Officers
							had been convened by him for the express purpose of deciding them— They
							had decided the first in his Gaines’s favour. They had declined giving
							an opinion upon the second; the only reason for which was that they
							could not agree upon it; and the division among them was so equal that a
							decision by them such as they could give would have been of no use as
							advice to the President. General Brown was the President of that Board—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe was a Military man— When they
							declined pronouncing upon the question it was obviously one, which I
							must be very reluctant in approaching. He said that almost every member
							of that Board, was a brevetted Officer—therefore interested in the
							question: and that it was a maxim of universal Law that no man should
							sit in judgment in his own cause. So that British Lawyers had held that
							the Parliament itself could not grant such an authority. But the degree
							of interest which disqualifies, is always itself a matter of question, a
							brevetted and non-brevetted Officer, are equally, though adversely
							interested in the issue, and therefore all, alike incompetent to decide
							upon it— I said that in reconsidering the whole subject I would receive
							any thing that he might think proper to say further upon the subject of
							his pretension in writing— I should think it due to give some
							opportunity to General Scott who was absent, and should finally settle
							the point upon full advisement with those associated with me in the
							Government— He said he did not wish to take any advantage of General
							Scott’s absence; and promised to furnish me a written statement of his
							claims. <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> called, intending to have brought with him his draft
							of an answer to the Chairman of the Retrenchment Committee, but he had
							by mistake brought another paper— He mentioned <unclear>the</unclear>
							substance of it, but I told him I should wish to see it, and might
							perhaps have some suggestions to make in relation to it. <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="ringgold-tench">Ringgold</persRef> came and informed me that
							the procession was ready— He and my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> went with me in the Carriage— The procession went
							from <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General Brown’s</persRef> House— The
							Militia of the District turned out in considerable numbers— Of the Army
							there was only a company of Artillery from Fort Washington, and the few
							Marines of the Corps stationed at the Navy-Yard— The Military escort
							preceded the corpse. The family of the deceased immediately followed,
							and the members of the Senate and House of Representatives in Carriages
							after mine— The roads were muddy and deep— Departing from the House just
							afternoon, it was near three O’Clock when we reached the Navy Yard and
							Cemetery. The funeral service much abridged was performed by <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							preceding; and that of <persRef ref="u">Captain Stuart</persRef> from
							Georgetown following after my Carriage— It was close upon four O’Clock
							when I got home— <persRef ref="silsbee-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Silsbee</persRef> called here in the
							Evening: said he had a ship loading at Baltimore, which he was about
							sending to Buenos-Ayres; but it was reported there had been a blockade
							declared by the Government of Buenos-Ayres, of the whole Coast of
							Brazil: that under this secret blockade, an American Vessel called the
							Ruth had been captured and condemned which had alarmed him and many
							other merchants— He said <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> had mentioned to him
							that despatches had been received from <persRef ref="forbes-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Forbes</persRef> the Charge d’Affaires
							at Buenos Ayres with information that this blockade had been revoked,
							and that he had sent those despatches to me.— I found them immediately
							in one of the boxes sent from the Department of State— It appeared that
							the blockade was declared in the sixth Article of reserved or secret
							Instructions furnished to their privateers— The brig Ruth was captured
							under them, and when brought into Port and upon trial the Instructions
							became public— Forbes had already addressed a Note to the Minister of
							Foreign Affairs, remonstrating against the capture, and demanding the
							restoration of the Ruth— On the publication of the Instructions, he sent
							another note, demanding whether they were authentic and remonstrating
							especially against the sixth and also the first Article— He received
							from the <persRef ref="balcarce-juan">Minister of Foreign
								Affairs</persRef> an Answer, that such Instructions had been issued
							on the occurrence of the War with Brazil, adopted from similar
							Instructions, issued at a former period of their War, with Spain— But
							that on the same day that M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Forbes’s Note
							had been received, the sixth Article of the Instructions had been
							revoked, and the first Article had been modified— The case of the Ruth
							was still before the judicial Court, undecided. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Silsbee intimated a wish that this despatch from Forbes, and
							the Notes between him and the Buenos-Ayrean Minister of Foreign Affairs
							might be published— I gave this Morning to the Secretary of War,
								<persRef ref="jones-roger">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Jones’s</persRef> draft of an order announcing to the army the
							decease of General Brown; with that which I had sketched, somewhat
							enlarging upon it— I desired Governor Barbour to make what use of my
							draft he pleased, and to treat it by alteration or omission as freely as
							I had dealt with Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jones— The Governor
							had expressed a wish that in alluding to the character of Brown, some
							notice might be taken of his humanity— I had accordingly introduced a
							few words conveying that idea— He thought these sharp-pointed, and I
							left it to his judgment to retain or omit them.</p>

							here a day or two longer to advise with the <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">Secretary of the Navy</persRef> upon a project
							revived in Congress for the Survey of the Coast— A project which at this

								>Lieutenant Governor of New-Brunswick</persRef> of 8 December 1818,

							found an account of the same conversation, which will enable me to
							rectify the misapprehension of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had just received and read to me

								>r</hi> Clay to reply to that answer, and at his desire promised to
							draw up a paragraph, referring to that Letter of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bagot— I had also much conversation with M<hi

							from <persRef ref="hamilton-james3">M<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Hamilton</persRef>, the Chairman of the Retrenchment Committee,
							upon the expenditures of the contingent fund of foreign Intercourse—
							There was much matter which I suggested to him additional to that <pb
								type="ms" n="451"/>in his draft—and of which he said he would avail
							himself— I observed that to the comparative view of the Appropriations
							for the years 1823. 4 and 5. with those of the years 1826. 7. and 8.
							there should be added similar views of the expenditures of the years
							1822. 3. and 4. with those of 1825. 6. and 7. I remarked to him the

							from Ministers Plenipotentiary to the Chargés d’Affaires, and referred
							him to the Report of the Committee on the Expenditures of the Department
							of State in 1822. observing that as to this Department any comparative

							since at New-York, and was removed for interment at Boston. After the
							performance of the obsequies there, he came back, and is now constantly
							engaged, either in the Senate, or in arguing causes before the Supreme
							Court— We had much Conversation upon subjects of political interest at
							this time— Upon a Bill before the Senate relating to the forms of
							process in the Courts of the U. States—under cover of which there was a
							project in operation for annihilating the most essential parts of their
							jurisdiction— It was creeping along, almost sub Silentio, and had
							arrived at its last debateable Stage; on the day when he resumed his
							Seat— He had then barely time to arrest it, by obtaining a postponement
							of the question upon it till the next day—when in a Speech of two hours
							he effectually stopped its progress for the time; and it has since be
							committed to be divested of its most objectionable features— There is
							reason to apprehend that there will be left yet enough to produce great
							injustice. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster himself thinks the
							opposition Majority in the Senate <pb type="ms" n="452"/>not so firmly
							cemented together as to be able to effect any important mischief. I said
							that hitherto nothing violent had been attempted during this Session in
							the Senate— All the Treaties with European Nations have been ratified—
							Most of the Nominations have been confirmed; and as yet not one has been
							rejected. I had done every thing in my power to avoid a collision; and
							none has occurred— But they have passed a Bill, to make <persRef
								ref="bissell-daniel">Bissell</persRef> a Colonel, for seven years
							back, the principles of which appear to me very questionable and if it
							should pass the House of Representatives it may revive instead of
							definitively settling the old controversy upon the reduction of the
							army. There might also be a question upon the appointment of a
							Major-General; but I thought it more probable that the Office would be
							abolished—to which I should make no objection— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Webster appeared to be averse to the abolition of the

								ref="macomb-alexander">Macomb</persRef>, which would be favoured by

								<persRef ref="scott-winfield">Scott</persRef> and <persRef
