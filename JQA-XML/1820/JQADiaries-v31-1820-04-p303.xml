						<p><date>1. VI:</date> Saturday. <persRef ref="tyler-benjamin">B. O.
								Tyler</persRef> was again here this Morning, and having examined the
							Records at the Capitol finds that the Square Number 592. stands in the
							name of <persRef ref="pratt-francis">Pratt Francis</persRef> and others,
							in whose name it was assessed for the taxes upon which it was sold. I
							had sent to enquire of <persRef ref="brent-robert">R. Brent jun<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> by what right he and
								<persRef ref="pearson-unknown2">Pearson</persRef> had rented the
							ground, and found that they only pretended to a lien upon it, but had
							not chosen to pay the taxes, and could therefore not hold against the
							sale. I therefore took Tyler’s deed, and paid him for it. <persRef
								ref="brackenridge-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brackenridge</persRef> of Baltimore called upon me, and gave me a
							history of his misunderstanding with <persRef ref="bland-theoderick"
								>judge Bland</persRef>, on their South American Mission— There were
							it seems mingled up in that affair two ingredients, of no very patriotic
							character. Bland, his son in Law <persRef ref="skinner-john"
								>Skinner</persRef>, and their connections here, had connected
							themselves with the <persRef ref="carrera-j">Carrera’s</persRef>, exiles
							from Buenos Ayres and Chili, and conspirators against the existing
							revolutionary Governments there. They had lent them large sums of money,
							and had obtained from them stipulations for exclusive privileges of
							Commerce for ten years. This private speculation was the source of all
							the artificial excitement stirred up in the Newspapers, during the
							Autumn and Winter of 1817. The papers in the Richmond Enquirer of that
							time, signed <persRef ref="lautaro-unknown">Lautaro</persRef>, addressed
							to <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>, and calling upon him to
							take the lead in Congress to produce a formal acknowledgment of the
							Independence of Buenos Ayres, were written by Skinner with some
							assistance from others— The same cabal obtained the appointment of Bland
							as one of the Commissioners, and Bland, was at the same time the private
							agent of Skinner, and his associates, to recover from the Governments at
							Buenos Ayres, and in Chili the monies lent to the Carrera’s, whom those
							very Governments were prosecuting as Traitors, and several of whom they
							have since put to death. These connections of Bland, not without links
							of attachment to the Baltimore privateering piracies, influencing and
							pervading his conduct as a Commissioner, Brackenridge says were the only
							causes of his quarrel with him— Brackenridge had not hesitated to give
							him his opinion that they were improper. <persRef ref="rodney-caesar"
								>Rodney</persRef> he says had done the same. Rodney being a brother
							Commissioner of equal rank with himself, Bland had let it pass off
							smoothly with him; but the disapprobation of a subaltern, more galling,
							and less dangerous, he had set at defiance, and had indulged his
							resentment, by every effort in his power to disgrace him—one of which
							efforts was an attempt to palm on the Mission another interpreter, on
							the pretence that Brackenridge was incompetent. After their return home
							Brackenridge was repeatedly and severely attacked in the Aurora, by
							anonymous publications which he says he has traced to Bland; and last
							Summer Brackenridge published in two Volumes an Account of his Voyage
							and of that Mission, in which were many passages reflecting upon Bland,
							though not in a direct manner, by name— Two pamphlets have been recently
							published purporting to be a review of Brackenridge’s work; but very
							dull and pedantic, with laboured efforts, and conceited pretensions to
							Wit— Brackenridge told me, and notified in a newspaper, that this
							pamphlet was the joint production of Judge Bland, J. S. Skinner,
								<persRef ref="moreno-unknown">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Moreno</persRef>, one of the South-American <unclear>Exiles,
								and</unclear><persRef ref="irvine-baptis">Baptis Irvine</persRef>.
							This latter personage, has since come out, with an avowal that he was
							the sole author of the pamphlets, <pb type="ms" n="304"/>Brackenridge
							says he is sure the others had a hand in it— He gave me a character and
							History of Baptis Irvine not at all advantageous to him— He is a
							Scotsman, driven as a needy political adventurer to this Country, and
							from a natural turbulence of temper, never long quiet in one spot. He
							has been successively a journey man to <persRef ref="duane-william2">W.
								Duane</persRef> at Philadelphia, and Editor of Newspapers at
							New-York and Baltimore— By recommendations from <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt Clinton</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="smith-samuel2">General S. Smith</persRef> and many other
							habitual recommenders, he obtained the appointment as Agent to
							Venezuela, from whence he returned, assuredly without having done any
							good— He has been ever since his return a hanger on for a further
							appointment; and is now an author to be let for any sort of abuse or
							scandal that any one wishes to have circulated— Brackenridge is also
							himself a suitor for Office— <persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M. Johnson</persRef> called at the
							Department to enquire if the Letter promised by the President to
								<persRef ref="forsyth-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Forsyth</persRef> had been forwarded to him— It had been sent to
								<persRef ref="torres-manuel">M. Torres</persRef>. The <persRef

						<p><date>2. VI:</date> Easter Sunday, and Snowed the whole day; so that the
							ground was entirely covered— I recollected a similar Easter day at
							Ealing in the year 1816. but that was the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.
							</hi>of April—twelve days later in the season than this. <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D. Brent</persRef>
							called upon me to say that <persRef ref="kenny-unknown">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Kenny</persRef> would preach at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Patrick’s Church, and I went to hear him—
							He took no text, but the Gospel of the day—which is the same as that of
							the protestant episcopal Church, and his discourse was an argument upon
							the credibility of the testimony to the fact of the Resurrection of
							Jesus Christ. This is a Common-Place topic for a Christian Preacher, and
							Doctor Kenny handled it with ingenuity— The story of the crucifixion,
							resurrection and ascension of Jesus, is one thing— His system of
							doctrines is another. All the facts related of the life and death of
							Jesus may be disbelieved, and his precepts as a teacher of morals and
							religion be adopted— The quality of the lesson has no necessary relation
							to the person of the instructor— The narrative part of the Bible, Old
							Testament and new, according to all the rules of <hi rend="italic"
								>human</hi> evidence, is more fabulous than the metamorphoses of
								<persRef ref="ovid">Ovid</persRef>— It is a perpetual succession of
							miracles from the first Chapter of Genesis to the last of the
							Revelations— The resurrection and ascension of Christ, is among the most
							incredible of those miracles, because it is among the widest departure,
							from the ordinary phenomena of the material world— It was a resurrection
							of the body, with the mortal wound which it had received, open— This
							body eats, drinks and talks; yet suddenly appears in the midst of the
							disciples, the doors being shut, and finally vanishes from their sight
							and ascends to Heaven— If in a court of Law, a hundred witnesses of the
							most unquestioned veracity upon all other occasions should testify upon
							oath to such a tale of a human being, no intelligent jury would believe
							them— It is not the common impossibility of an apparition—an unembodied
							Spirit, but flesh and bones reorganized in death, performing the
							functions of animal nature, and yet absolved from all the properties and
							incapacities of matter. Human testimony is not more competent to make
							all this credible, as matter of fact, than human power is competent to
							affect it. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kenny’s argument was good to
							confirm believers in their faith; but an over-earnestness to answer
							objections sometimes discloses to the adversary weak points which his
							own discernment might not have discovered. The first of <persRef
								ref="bacon-francis">Lord Bacon’s</persRef> Characters of a believing
							Christian, defines a Christian as “one that believes things his reason
							cannot comprehend; hopes for things which neither he nor any man alive
							ever saw: labours for that which he knoweth he shall never obtain, yet
							in the issue, his belief appears not to be false; his hope makes him not
							ashamed: his labour is not in vain.” Paradoxes and seeming
							Contradictions are the essence of the Christian faith—“I believe,
							Lord—Help thou my unbelief.”— <persRef ref="cardelli-pietro"
								>Cardelli</persRef> was here this morning, and told me there was no
							prospect of his obtaining further employment at the Capitol. He said a
							couple of Italians who are travelling about the Country and selling
							Casts of Busts and Statues, had proposed to him to join in partnership
							with them; and asked my advice. I told him I thought it was the best
							thing he could do, if Congress should pass the Law, proposed, upon his
							petition. He will wait for that; and is now taking the bust of <persRef

							was at my house this Morning, to solicit an appointment as Watchman to
							the public building of the Department of State— This man is a native of
							Ireland; was a servant of my <persRef ref="adams-john">fathers</persRef>
							during his Presidency, and afterwards of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson</persRef>; after the
							expiration of whose term Dougherty kept a shop and wine and Porter
							cellar, with which he has been unsuccessful. When about two years since
							a Superintendent was appointed for the building in which the Offices of
							the State, War and Navy Departments were kept, Dougherty was selected,
							at the very strong recommendation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jefferson, and chiefly by my solicitation and influence. He had not been
							six Months in the Office, before he had words with <persRef
								ref="lane-samuel">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Lane</persRef>,
							the Commissioner of the Public buildings, a man with only one arm; and
							actually beat him with a cane. Lane complained to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> who very properly insisted
							that Dougherty should be dismissed from his superintendency. Dougherty,
							who seems to have thought that he had patrons who would support him, and
							that a family dependent upon him would excite sympathy in his favour,
							struggled hard, but in vain against his removal; and has been time after
							time importunate to obtain his restoration. He has always been told that
							his only chance of success would be to pacify Lane and obtain his
							consent— He has repeatedly applied to Lane, but without success: whether
							from the implacability of Lane’s temper, or the stubbornness of his own,
							which never could bend to any profession of repentance or sorrow for
							what he had done— Lane prosecuted him also for the assault and battery,
							for which he was sentenced to a fine of 50 dollars and 60 days
							imprisonment. He has wearied my Patience by his importunities, and this
							day I told him he must be sure he could never again be employed by the
							public, unless he could propitiate Lane himself. This is one and not the
							only example of a person to whom I have done acts of kindness, and who
							have thrown away the benefit of them by the foolish indulgence of their
							own passions— At one O’Clock I met at the President’s the <persRef
								ref="goupydequabeck-alexander">Viscount de Quabeck</persRef>, Charge
							d’Affaires from the Netherlands, and presented him to take leave, for an
							absence until the next Winter. He maintains uniformly the idea of
							returning here before the commencement of the next Session of Congress,
							though he probably will not. There is no person appointed to act during
							his absence in his stead. The correspondence between Commodores <persRef
								ref="decatur-stephen">Decatur</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="barron-james">Barron</persRef> which led to the late fatal
							duel, has now been published by Decatur’s friends in a pamphlet. The
							President asked me what I thought of it. I told him my impression was
							different from what I believed would be that of the great majority of
							readers. I thought the wrong on the side of Barron; that from his first
							Letter, it was scarcely possible the affair could end otherwise than by
							a duel— That he called upon Decatur, to acknowledge or disavow
							particular words imputed to him, and either could not give his
							authority, or declined to give it. He must have been aware that Decatur
							though he might disavow the express words, could not avoid qualifying
							the disavowal by admitting that he had spoken of him in terms otherwise
							unfavourable— This Decatur did in the correspondence, more harshly than
							was necessary— He was galled by the very thought of being called to
							account for any thing by Barron, and could not suppress the feelings of
							disdain, which he really felt for him and his conduct— Decatur had been
							a member of a Court Martial, which had passed a sentence upon Barron, of
							five years suspension from the service— It was impossible he should
							entertain a favourable opinion of him; or that he should avoid
							occasionally expressing the contrary. Barron’s challenge therefore was
							therefore in substance for Decatur’s decision against him on a Court
							martial; and being ostensibly for words which Decatur expressly
							disavows, and for which Barron can give no authority, places him
							essentially in the wrong from the first— <pb type="ms" n="306"/>But
							Decatur’s tone throughout the correspondence is so peremptory and
							indignant, that it has the appearance of pressing too hard upon a fallen
							man. This is so striking, and obvious on the face of the papers, that
							the sympathy of the readers will generally be in Barron’s favour— The
							President said that Barron’s application to be restored to his command,
							had been considered with an earnest wish to give him that opportunity to
							redeem his character, but he had not satisfactorily accounted for not
							returning to the United States during the late War, and there was on the
							files of the Navy Department information from a <persRef
								ref="goodwin-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Goodwin</persRef> of Baltimore, now dead, of Barrons having used
							language to a <persRef ref="lyon-unknown2">M<hi rend="superscript"

							impracticable—that no such precaution was thought necessary here— That
							such a regulation would prove extremely oppressive upon commerce, and
							useless as a guard against infection— That we had reason on the contrary
							to complain that the regulations in Sweden were rigorous beyond all

							in Congress from Baltimore, as Chairman of the Caucus in 1816. which
							nominated Candidates for the Offices of President &amp; Vice-President
							of the United States, at the election then ensuing. He states that he
							has been required by numbers of members from various parts of the Union,

								>other</hi> members of Congress who may think proper to attend at
							the Representative Hall at the Capitol, next Saturday Evening, at half
							past seven O’Clock in the Evening to determine whether it be expedient
							that a nomination should now be made of Candidates for the Offices of
							President and Vice-President— This is the result of caballing— There is
							at present no ostensible intention to oppose the re-election of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe as President, in any part of the
							Union— Every attempt to form a new fixed opposition party has hitherto
							failed. But the Vice-Presidency <pb type="ms" n="307"/>is, to call
							things by their proper names, in the Market. <persRef
								ref="tompkins-daniel">Tompkins</persRef> stands as a Candidate for
							the Office of Governor of New-York, against <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt Clinton</persRef>. But the election is
							strongly contested, and the issue doubtful. The choice is to take place
							the last week of the present Month. Tompkins has however no thought of
							relinquishing the Vice Presidency if he should fail in the election as
							Governor of New-York. But a majority of the New-York delegation in
							Congress are partizans of Clinton, and disposed even to throw out
							Tompkins from the Vice-Presidency. At the same time it appears Clay has
							fixed his eye upon that Office, and as Clinton’s ultimate aim is at the
							Presidency, the aspect of the present moment is of an approaching
							Coalition between <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> and Clinton.
							Samuel Smith in the midst of a stupendous ruin of reputation and fortune
							as a merchant, maintains yet his consideration and influence as a
							politician; or at least struggles hard to maintain it; and is now baited
							to this hook by the view of a vacant Speaker’s Chair which he is told he
							has a clear pretension to occupy. So that the object of this Caucus is
							to announce Clay as the Candidate for the Vice-Presidency, and to make
							way for Smith as the future Speaker— To prepare the minds of members for
							this, Clay has given out that he has met with a heavy loss by the
							failure of a person whose notes he had endorsed, and which he was last
							summer obliged to pay, to the amount of 25000 dollars. That his private
							affairs have thus become embarrassed; so that having a family of
							children to support, he can no longer afford to come to Congress, and
							intends to resign his Office as Speaker, before the close of the present
							Session— That his affairs are embarrassed there is no doubt. According
							to the general rumour he has more than once won and lost an affluent
							Fortune at the gaming table. The last Winter was an unlucky one, for
							him, and before he left this City he was said to have met with
							embarrassing losses. In his Florida Treaty Speech, the other day he made
							an ingenuous confession that in his youth he had sometimes indulged in a

						<p><date>7. V:15.</date> A young man by the name of <persRef

								<persRef ref="edwards-james">J. L. Edwards’s</persRef> Note— A
							difficulty has arisen to impede its settlement, by the refusal of

							with a general warranty, though he is under Bond to give a good and
							sufficient deed in fee simple. He offers a deed with a warranty only
							against himself and those claiming under him; and without a warranty of
							freedom from all incumbrances— I told Hickey finally that if Edwards
							would take an Opinion of respectable Counsel, and he should say that
							such a deed as Van Ness Offers is a fulfilment of his Bond, I would take
							it and settle the matter. <persRef ref="forbes-john">Forbes</persRef>

							from <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">A. Gallatin</persRef> of 15.
							February and from <persRef ref="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef> of 25
							February, shewing that Vivés had passed through Paris and London, on his
							way. <unclear>Gallatin</unclear> had seen him; and says he has not with
							him the Spanish Ratification, but is empowered if the explanations
							should be satisfactory, to agree that the United States should take
							possession without waiting for the Ratification from Madrid. Rush had
							not seen him—but by comparing the two statements it appears that Vivés
							told <persRef ref="pasquier-etienne">Pasquier</persRef>, the French
							Minister of Foreign Affairs, that the subject of the grants would be
							accommodated; but the principal difficulties would be in relation to the
							piracies and to South-America; and a very few days afterwards told
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, that
							he should be able to convince the American Government that <persRef
								ref="onis-luis">Onis</persRef> had exceeded his instructions. I took
							these despatches to the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>;
							and observed to him that as Vives did not bring the ratification, and as
							he appeared to have told one Story at Paris and another at London, it
							gave strong grounds for suspicion that the real object of his Mission
							was to procrastinate and come <pb type="ms" n="308"/>to no conclusion;
							it would therefore be necessary to anticipate that result, and determine
							upon the course to be pursued, both with him; and afterwards on the
							supposition that we are to bring to a speedy close the negotiation with
							him. The President said he really did not think we ought to go to War
							for Florida; or that the Nation would be willing to proceed to that
							extremity— This also was my opinion— But after what had passed, I
							believed Florida might be occupied without risking a War, and it would
							deserve Consideration whether any other course could be taken,
							consistently with the honour of the Nation— The President desired me to
							send the despatches to the other members of the Administration and said
							he would afterwards have a consultation upon the subject. Evening at
							home, writing.</p>

							who had travelled in those Countries had found it necessary to recur to
							the protection of other Governments; but he would prefer relying upon

							There has been for some weeks a rumour afloat that he is going out as an

								>Rogers</persRef> of Pennsylvania, severely censuring the call of a

							President, by those who are in the President’s most intimate confidence,
							and those who have just received Offices, by his nomination.</p>

							the etiquette of foreign Ministers residing here, between themselves, I
							could know less than he did; but that in every part of Europe, between

							made it a question with <persRef ref="turreau-louis">General

							Turreau adhered to the general European custom of diplomatic visiting,
							Pahlen and he while they resided here did not visit each other at-all.
							De Neuville said his own experience here had not absolutely settled the

								ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>Indian agent Mitchell</persRef>, and a List of witnesses whom he

							said he would furnish me with copies of these papers to send to Governor
							Clark; and added that it would be made a party affair of such violence
							as to convulse the whole state— The President came to the Office, and
							afterwards <persRef ref="monroe-joseph">his brother Joseph
								Jones</persRef>, with a Letter from <persRef ref="forsyth-samuel"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef> to the

							whether I thought the Letter should be answered by me or by the
							President— I told him rather by himself, than by either— Not by me
							because D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth had chosen to address the
							President directly— Not by the President, because it was not suitable
							that he should enter into a direct Correspondence with a man, who is
							substantially a foreign Agent. But he, as the President’s Secretary
							should answer it, and I told him what I thought he should say. He
							accordingly afterwards sent me an answer, open to be forwarded by me, if
							I should approve it—which I did— The President is in general, upon his
							guard against direct addresses to himself, especially from foreigners.
							He keeps all the foreign Ministers, at a cold and cautious <pb type="ms"
								n="310"/>distance; but he permitted this D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Forsyth to have immediate access to him because he was a
							Citizen of the United States, and Forsyth has abused his indulgence by

							There is a Resolution now proposed to the House of Representatives by

								Cobb</persRef> of Georgia, for an Amendment to the Constitution, to

								Hall</persRef>, a member of the House, from the same State— Macon
							spoke about a copy of a Treaty with the Cherokee Indians for which he
							applied some days since at the Office— It had been prepared and sent to
							him this morning, but he had not yet received— I appointed one O’Clock
							this day to receive <persRef ref="vives-don">General Vivés</persRef>, at

								ref="ferdinand-vii">King of Spain</persRef> to <persRef

							Letter from Onis to me, enclosing it. He at the same time said he had to

							to deliver a credential Letter from his Sovereign. I told him I would
							immediately take the President’s directions; and give him notice of the
							time which the President should fix— I received a summons from the
							President to attend a Cabinet Meeting at his house at two O’Clock. All
							the members of the Administration were there. A warrant had issued last
							week for the Execution of <persRef ref="ferguson-john">John D.
								Ferguson</persRef> and <persRef ref="denny-israel">Israel
								Denny</persRef>, two of the men convicted of Piracy at Baltimore—and
							the day fixed was the day after to-morrow. This morning a petition,
							signed by four thousand inhabitants of that City, for their pardon, was
							brought to the President, by the two Members from the City, and two
							persons of respectable character had come on purpose to bring the
							petition— There was a representation also, setting forth many
							extenuating circumstances in their behalf, but that was not signed; and
							there were Letters from <persRef ref="bland-theoderick">judge
								Bland</persRef>, and others, among which one from <persRef
								ref="hoffman-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hoffman</persRef>, pleading for them— The unsigned paper stated
							particularly that Ferguson at the commencement of our late War with
							England had been an impressed Seaman in the British Navy; that he had
							given himself up as a prisoner, and refused to serve against his
							Country— That he had then discovered a key to the signals used in the
							British Navy; and had transmitted it to the Navy Department here of
							which <persRef ref="jones-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								William Jones</persRef> was then the Secretary— The question upon
							the pardon was then discussed in a desultory manner, and there appeared
							to much wavering in the mind of every one. The President finally asked
							my opinion first, and I gave it in favour of a reprieve for two Months
							now; and for the substitution of a long imprisonment of several years,
							instead of death, for these and all the other cases of simple piracy,
							and executing only those which had been complicated with murder. In this
							case the worst act had been that of taking 2300 dollars from a Spanish
							vessel, without injury or even insult to any person. It was with great
							reluctance, and only from a deep conviction of the peculiar necessity of
							making an example at Baltimore that I had before assented to the
							Execution of these two men— But here was now a petition it might be said
							from the whole City— The case of these men was hard— Their Captain,
								<persRef ref="danel-john">Daniels</persRef>, the man who had seduced
							them to their crime, had been tried for a case in which the life of the
							Master of an English Merchant vessel had been lost by his act; who had a
							hundred piracies and as many murders upon his soul; this man had been
							discharged by Judge Bland, and was walking the Streets of Baltimore; and
							holding his head as high as any man; all the principals and ringleaders
							in these privateering piracies had escaped— They were triumphant against
								<pb type="ms" n="311"/>every prosecution, while these poor ignorant
							creatures, the mere mortal instruments of their guilt, were to suffer
							death. Besides, in the general opinion their case was not that of mere
							unqualified Piracy. They had a sort of colour of Commission; a spurious
							but yet plausible connection with the cause of the South American
							Patriots— The compassion of the public would be turned in their favour,
							and indeed there might be reason to apprehend a popular movement at
							Baltimore, to prevent their execution. At least a great odium would be
							excited against the Administration for it— <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> concurred in
							this opinion, though more doubtfully; and inclining to the execution—
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> was decidedly for the execution. He
							had no doubt of the right of the Legislature to affix the punishment of
							Death to any atrocious crime— They had now affixed it to Piracy; and the
							question now was, should the Law be executed or not— If not executed in
							this case, it ought not to be executed in any of the others; and the Law
							would then be a dead Letter— That this was a case of mere Piracy,
							without murder, made it so much the better, as a test for the execution
							of the Law— And if they had met with resistance it is to be presumed
							they would have committed murder— As to their connection with the
							South-American cause, it was pretended, and not real— Plunder was their
							object, and they were equally ready to take it from all Nations—
								<persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> was very unwilling to give any opinion, and
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef> said he was divided between two opinions— All the
							reasoning however was in favour of the Execution— After sitting till
							near five O’Clock, the President was yet undecided and adjourned the
							Meeting till ten O’Clock to-morrow Morning. He desired me as I should be
							returning home to call at <persRef ref="duval-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Duval’s</persRef>, where M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones, the former Secretary of the Navy,
							now in the City, lodges, and enquire of him if he had any recollection
							of the alledged fact of Ferguson’s having transmitted during the late
							War a key to the British signals to the Navy Department. I had a
							reprieve made out, ready to be signed if the President should so
							determine, and on my way home called at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Duval’s, where I saw M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones. He had no
							recollection of the transmission of the key to the British signals, by
							Ferguson, but said he would make enquiries of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Duval, who was at the time referred to a Clerk in the Navy
							Department, and would write me the result. He also referred me to
								<persRef ref="homans-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Homans</persRef> the Chief Clerk of the Department, to ascertain if
							there was any evidence on the files to elucidate the fact— At the door
							of my house I found the two persons who had brought the petition from
							Baltimore, waiting for the answer. I told them the President had not yet

						<p><date>12. V:30.</date> My Son <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef> is this day nineteen years of age. I recur to the
							period of his birth with mingled emotions of gratitude, anxiety and
							hope. The mercies and blessings which I have received since that day,
							have been signal, and many—the afflictions, such as are inseparable from
							the lot of mortality, and tempered with consolations— I received this
							morning a note from <persRef ref="jones-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Jones</persRef>, who states that <persRef
								ref="duval-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Duval</persRef>
							has no recollection of the transmission of the key to the British
							signals by <persRef ref="ferguson-john">Ferguson</persRef>; but that he
							has seen and conversed with him in prison at Baltimore—and that he is a
							native of Scotland, and speaks the broad dialect of that Country. The
							Story therefore of his having given himself up as a Prisoner, at the
							commencement of the late War is without foundation— The members of the
							Administration met again this Morning at the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef>, but the <persRef ref="thompson-smith"
								>Secretary of the Navy</persRef> not attending. I went over to his
							Office, and made enquiries of the <persRef ref="homans-benjamin">Chief
								Clerk Homans</persRef>, who examined the files, but could find no
							evidence upon them to confirm the allegation in favour of Ferguson.
								<persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								King</persRef> of New-York came in while I was at the Navy-Office—
							He spoke of <persRef ref="vives-don">General Vives</persRef>, and said
							the disposition of the Senate towards the Florida Treaty was no longer
							the same now that it was last year. He seemed to think the ratification
							might now be accepted without resubmitting it to the Senate, but this
							under present Circumstances I should deem inexpedient— I returned to the
							President’s, where M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson was also now
							present. The question <pb type="ms" n="312"/>upon the pardon was
							resumed; but the President had now made up his mind to refuse the
							reprieve, and to persist in the order for execution— He said he had come
							reluctantly to the conclusion; but that an example was indispensable— He
							asked however the opinion of all the members, and now, all except myself
							were decidedly in favour of the execution— I remained of the opinion
							which I had expressed yesterday. I was charged however to communicate
							the President’s decision, to the person who brought the petition from
							Baltimore, which I did; assuring him that every possible attention had
							been shewn to the petition— That in declining to comply with it the
							President had performed a painful duty; but that his decision had been
							the result of the fullest deliberation— He said that although he
							regretted the determination; he could not say it was unexpected to him;
							and he expressed himself perfectly satisfied with regard to the
							attention which had been shewn to the petition. At one O’Clock I
							returned to the President’s, where I found General Vivés already
							arrived. I presented him immediately to the President, to whom he
							delivered a Credential Letter—as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
							Plenipotentiary from the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">king of
								Spain</persRef>. He had sent me yesterday a copy of it as I had
							requested— In delivering the Letter he made a short address to the
							President in French, expressing the king’s friendly dispositions towards
							the United States and his own personal desire to contribute all in his
							power to the friendship and harmony of the two Nations— The President
							answered him also in French, with professions of a similar disposition
							on the part of the United States, and a hope that the friendship between
							the two Nations will be preserved unimpaired. The audience was not of
							ten minutes duration— When the General withdrew I requested him to send
							to the Department of State, a list of the persons belonging to his
							Legation, which he promised to do. I said I hoped also to receive
							shortly a further communication from him— He said he should address me
							without delay. At half past one O’Clock I presented <persRef

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ruggles</persRef> a Senator from the
							State of Ohio called upon me this morning, with a written recommendation
							signed by five of the six members of the House of Representatives from
							that State, of a person for the appointment of a judge in the territory
							of Arkansaw— I had some conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Ruggles, with regard to the opinions of the people in the Western
							Country concerning the Florida Treaty, and <persRef key="clay-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s</persRef> project of
							setting it aside and taking possession of the Province of Texas— Ruggles
							said that this project was adverse to the interests of the State of
							Ohio, who would be well satisfied with the ratification of the Treaty—
								<persRef ref="trimble-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> David
								Trimble</persRef> a member of the House from Kentucky called at the
							Office, to enquire what would probably be the result of the Negotiation
							with <persRef ref="vives-don">General Vivés</persRef>— His ostensible
							motive was to make-up his opinion upon the Report to be made by the
							Committee of Ways and Means, of which he is a member— But he came with a
							long argument to convince me, that the only way for me to make myself
							popular in the Western Country was to set the Treaty aside, and urge the
							recognition of the South American Revolutionists, and insist upon the
							Rio del Norte as the Western Boundary— I told him, that I understood the
							map of the Country rather too well to suppose it would ever be possible
							for me to do any thing that could make me popular in the Western
							Country— That as to the Treaty, I had never set the value upon it, that
							was supposed; and of all the members of the Administration I was the
							last who had consented to take the Sabine for our Western Boundary— I
							had no doubt that if the Treaty should be set aside, we should
							ultimately obtain more Territory than it would secure to us, but we
							should get the same territory with the treaty, sooner <pb type="ms"
								n="313"/>than we should want it; and even now I thought the greatest
							danger of this Union, was in the overgrown extent of its territory,
							combining with the Slavery question— I added as my belief that there
							would be a majority of the House of Representatives now, who would not
							accept of the Province of Texas as a gift, unless Slavery should be
							excluded from it. Since the Missouri debate, I considered the
							continuance of the Union for any length of time as very precarious, and
							entertained serious doubts whether Louisiana and Slavery would not
							ultimately break us up. He said he himself considered the Slavery
							question as the greatest that can agitate this Union; but that Kentucky
							would get rid of her Slaves, and would finally not be in the
							Slave-holding interest. They did not want Slaves for the Articles of
							their cultivation; but if the Union should break up there would be three
							Confederacies—Eastern, Southern and Western— I said, so I had heard Clay
							say—that within five years we should have three confederacies: but why
							there should be precisely three, I could not see. The Slave question
							might split us in two— Because this question besides involving the
							strongest oppositions of interest, involved also the principle of all
							others the most deeply planted in the hearts of this People— There was
							no existing opposition of mere interest between any two parts of this
							Country, which could possibly produce a dissolution of the Union. He
							said he agreed with me in that. But if the Union should break, the
							Country between the Sabine, and the Rio del Norte, would become
							indispensibly necessary for the Western Confederacy— It would be an
							excellent Country for the cultivation of Coffee, and there was an
							admirable Seaport there which would be necessary to the command of the
							Gulph of Mexico— I told him that I did not believe that we should ever
							find either a good Seaport or grounds for cultivating Coffee in Texas,
							nor did I believe there was any article of cultivation that needed
							Slaves— The want of Slaves was not in the Lands but in their
							inhabitants— Slavery had become in the South and Southwestern Country a
							condition of existence— They could not live without them. As to the
							Treaty, we could now very easily disengage ourselves from that— The
							difficulty would not be in setting it aside, but in obtaining it. He and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay were excellent negotiators in
							theory— They were for obtaining all, and granting nothing— They played a
							game between their own right and left hands, and could allot with
							admirable management the whole stake to one hand, and total discomfiture
							to the other— In the Negotiation with Spain, we had a just claim to the
							Mississippi and its waters; and our Citizens had a fair though very
							precarious claim to indemnitites. We had a mere colour of claim to the
							Rio del Norte— No claim to a line beyond the Rocky Mountains and none to
							Florida, which we very much wanted— The Treaty gives us the Mississippi
							and all its waters—gives us Florida—gives us an acknowledged line to the
							South Sea and seventeen degrees of Latitude upon its shores—gives our
							Citizens five Millions of Dollars of indemnity; and barely gives up to
							Spain the colourable claim, from the Sabine to the Rio del Norte— Now
							Negotiation implies some concession upon both sides— If after obtaining
							every object of your pursuit but one, and that one weak in principle,
							and of no present value, what would you have offered to Spain to yield
							that also? Trimble had no answer to this question; but he said he
							believed Onis had deceived me about the grants— He had no doubt Onis
							knew the grants were dated before the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							of January, and assumed that date with the intention that it should
							confirm them. This was no disparagement to me. Any honorable man, might
							be thus deceived; but that he believed was the fact. I told him that
							Onis might very possibly have had such an intention; but the fact was we
							had never relied upon the date— That the grants were annulled by the
							terms of the Article, independent of the date; and that we have not only
							the demonstration that such was the professed intention of the parties
							on both sides, but that the Article could, without a violent perversion
							of language bear no other construction. To this Trimble agreed— Trimble
							is a bustling, talkative, pushing man, professing to be independent of
							all parties, but in reality a Satellite of Clay’s— He made a Speech in
							the House the other day, upon Clay’s Resolutions against the Treaty, in
							which he said all that he this morning repeated to me, and much more— He
							is one of the members, who make it a point to keep upon good and
							friendly terms with me personally, and always to side against me upon
							public questions involving my opinions reputation or character.—
								<persRef ref="sullivan-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Sullivan</persRef> also came to the Office, and spoke of the
							appointment of <persRef ref="russell-benjamin">B. Russell</persRef>,
							Editor of the Centinel at Boston, as a Printer of the Laws. Sullivan
							obtained a promise of this appointment last November directly from the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, at his house in
							Loudoun County— It has given great <pb type="ms" n="314"/>offence to the
							republicans in Massachusetts, and to their members in the House of
							Representatives a majority of whom have addressed to me a remonstrance
							against it. Sullivan insisted that it was of great importance to
							conciliate the federalists; but I told him I had little faith in the
							possibility of conciliating federalists— They abandoned their opposition
							just so far as they despaired of success, but upon every question that
							arose, on which the administration needed support they had been and
							would still be found seizing upon it to bring themselves up again. So
							they had done with the Seminole War— So they had done with the Slave
							question, which they had ruined with their assistance and so they would
							do whenever the shoe should pinch— To all this Sullivan replied with
							many words, and insisted much upon Russell’s zeal and activity in
							promoting <persRef ref="mason-jonathan">Jonathan Mason’s</persRef>
							election as member from Boston in the House of Representatives— Sullivan
							also told me that he should call upon me again before leaving the
							City—perhaps to-morrow— I returned this Morning the visit of General

							finally be ratified— There are to be three of those Commissioners, for
							which at least thirty applications have been made to the President—
							Sullivan is a man of polished manners, but not of much delicacy of
							sentiment; for he <pb type="ms" n="315"/>urged his appointment on the
							ground of a promise to use all his influence and that of his friends to
							support the administration, and promote the re-election of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe. This appointment he said would
							much strengthen his influence— The fact is that his influence is very

							or to secure M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s re-election. That
							is so secure that Sullivan and his friends will take special care to be
							in favour of it. But there is a coarseness in these unveiled proposals
							of political barter, very disgusting to me— Sullivan was very urgent for
							a promise of my influence in his favour for this appointment; but I told
							him the applications were very numerous, and if the appointments should
							ever be made the President would have all the candidates before him, and
							would make his own selection, as was always his custom— Sullivan was not
							half satisfied with this answer— It would have cost me nothing but
							principle to have promised him my influence, and to have made him my

							sacrifice of principle for any man’s political friendship— We spent the

								ref="bradish-luther">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bradish</persRef> came to the Office for the special Protection,
							which he has been soliciting, to serve him in his projected travels. I
							gave him a special Passport, but he came back and wanted something more.
							That is he wanted to be constituted a public agent. <persRef

								Garnett</persRef> a member of the House of Representatives from
							Virginia, came to enquire concerning the appointment of a man named
								<persRef ref="boughan-r">Boughan</persRef> as commercial agent at
							Valparaiso in Chili— This person had been very earnestly recommended by
							Garnett, and several other members of Congress and other respectable
							persons, and a Certificate of appointment had already been made out for
							him, when <persRef ref="percival-john">Lieutenant Percival</persRef>
							arrived from the South-Sea, and gave such unfavourable accounts of his
							conduct to the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, that he
							desired Percival to inform me of them, and directed me to suspend the
							sending of the certificate— Percival came, and told me that Boughan, as
							Supercargo of a vessel from Baltimore to Valparaiso had betrayed the
							trust of his employers, and was notorious among the Americans in Chili,
							as a worthless character— He told me several particulars as being known
							to himself; for others he referred to persons of respectable standing in
							Baltimore. <pb type="ms" n="316"/>I told Percival, that in suspending an
							appointment already determined upon, for such causes, it would be
							necessary to have written evidence of the charges, and asked him to
							write me a Letter which might remain upon the files of the Department. I
							received accordingly a few days since a Letter from him at Baltimore,
							enclosing one from a person named <persRef ref="ward-j">Ward</persRef>,
							both unfavourable to Boughan, and shewed them to Garnett, who was
							satisfied that the facts stated in them would require explanation.
								<persRef ref="wyer-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward

							the draft of a Letter prepared to be sent to <persRef ref="vives-don"
								>General Vives</persRef>— The President desired a Meeting of the
							members of the Administration, which was held at eight O’Clock this
							Evening— In the mean time I dined at the Russian Minister, <persRef
								ref="poletica-pierre">Poletica’s</persRef>, with Vivés, and all the
							members of the Diplomatic Corps now here. At the Cabinet meeting the
							alternatives were discussed of the answer to the Note of Vives which I
							had prepared, and of asking as a preliminary for a copy of his
							full-powers— The latter mode of proceeding was concluded to be the most
							advisable; and to enquire at the same time whether he is the bearer of
							the ratification by the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">King of
								Spain</persRef> of the Treaty, to be exchanged, if the explanations
							required by his Note should prove satisfactory— All the members of the
							Administration were present— The President also consulted them on the
							propriety of furnishing Bradish with a Certificate, of Appointment as an
							Agent of the United States, for collecting and transmitting information;
							and the general opinion was that it might be given, though I remarked
							the possibility that it might expose him, unless he should use it with
							discretion to be taken for a Spy— It was about ten P.M. when the Meeting
							broke up and I came home.</p>

						<p><date>19. VI:</date> The theatre in this City was burnt down, about seven
							O’Clock this Morning. I went to the spot, the roof had already fallen
							in, and the interior of the building was nearly consumed. As it stood by
							itself the fire did not spread. It had been used last Evening by a

							Gas. The experiments first made by <persRef ref="davy-humphrey">Sir

							and most of the members of the Legislature— But <persRef
								ref="cook-daniel">D. P. Cook</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="edwards-ninian">Edwards</persRef> earnestly remonstrated
							against his appointment on the charge that he was a man of notorious
							intemperance— <persRef ref="lemmon-robert">R. Lemen</persRef> was
							appointed, and has now resigned— Cook came last Monday and recommended
							the appointment of <persRef ref="conner-henry">H. Conner</persRef>,
							urging an immediate nomination, as the District Court is to be held
							early in May— The next morning M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards,
							brought me a Letter from Lemen to the President, resigning the Office,
							and one from the <persRef ref="pope-nathaniel">District judge
								Pope</persRef>, recommending Conner— Edwards also urged the
							necessity of an immediate appointment. I took the Letters to the
							President, who immediately nominated Conner to the Senate— Thomas
							however opposed the nomination in Senate, obtained a postponement of
							their decision upon it, and the consent of his colleague Edwards that
							the nomination should be withdrawn.— He then applied at the Office for a
							copy of Lemen’s resignation, and of all the papers relative to the
							application of Fowke for appointment as Marshal, last year. Among those
							Papers were Letters from Edwards, not only charging Fowke with
							intemperate habits, but containing remarks concerning Thomas himself,
							which if seen by him, would have excited his resentments against
							Edwards— With the President’s approbation, I sent Lemen’s resignation,
							and all other papers, excepting those containing the charges, against
							Fowke, to Thomas and informed him that it was not usual to communicate
							papers of that description, which were necessarily confidential. He came
							this morning, and declared himself entirely satisfied, and fully
							sensible that papers such as those which I had declined to send him,
							ought not to be communicated. But he said the appointment of another
							person as Marshal last year had caused great excitement in the State,
							and he had now hopes that Edwards and Pope would consent that Fowke
							should be nominated— I told him that the recommendations of the Governor
							and members of the Legislature would no doubt have been decisive; but
							the charge against Fowke was of gross and notorious intemperance; a vice
							which not only precluded an appointment, but was of itself a sufficient
							cause for removal of a person already appointed. Thomas said he was well
							aware of that— But in this case he should take the other side— It was
							not so. He had no doubt that Fowke drank more than was necessary for
							him; but he was not a drunkard— And so this affair now rests. <persRef

								ref="thompson-arietta">wife</persRef>, a daughter of the <persRef

							Office, to recommend a person by the name of <persRef
								ref="espada-joseph">Espada</persRef>, for the appointment of
							Commercial Agent at Campeachy. There was a Cabinet Meeting at the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>, to consider of
							the Note received last Evening from <persRef ref="vives-don">General
								Vivés</persRef>. It is apparent that nothing can be done with them,
							and scarcely possible to doubt that it was the intention of his
							Government to shape his instructions in such a manner, that he should be
							prevented from doing any thing definitive— It was agreed that the reply
							to his note should correspond in general with that which I had prepared
							to his first Letter; the President expressed some uneasiness that Vives
							had pursued the course of transacting all the business in writing,
							without asking for a personal conference, and manifested a desire that
							application should be made to <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> de Neuville</persRef>, for his
							interposition— I told him de Neuville had offered it; but that I had
							declined it as a proposition upon our part: thinking it ought to come if
							at all from Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Vives himself; which the
							President on reflection approved. It appears by a despatch from <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">A. Gallatin</persRef> that Vivés told him at
							Paris that he was authorised to give us possession of Florida, without
							waiting for the ratification of the Treaty— He now declares that he has
							no such authority. <persRef ref="crawford-unknown">Crawford</persRef>
							said he had no doubt Vives had held communications both with de Neuville
							and <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">Poletica</persRef> here, and that
							they had advised him to deny his having this authority, and told him
							that Congress would do nothing, at all events this Session. In the
							public transactions between Nations, there is often such a total
							disregard to truth, that the suspicion expressed by Crawford is perhaps
							not uncharitable; but suspicion itself is as apt to be deceived, as
							credulity. Suspicion is frequently nothing more than self-deception.
							Whenever a man resorts to suspicion to account for the conduct of
							others, his belief is governed more by his wishes than by his judgment.
							He suspects what he wishes. Of various possible causes of the same
							effect, he selects that which in other respects best suits his interests
							or his passions. Suspicion too is apt to delude by wearing the mask of
							sagacity— I think Crawford’s suspicion in this case unfounded. But I
							observed it was probable <persRef ref="laserna-mateo">La
							Serna</persRef>, might have impressed Vives, with the opinion that
							Congress will do nothing. And it is still more probable that no person
							has given him any such expectation— We had this Evening our usual weekly
							tea-party, which was attended by upwards of seventy persons— General
							Vives and his Legation was here.</p>

						<p><date>26. V:30.</date> I made a draft of a Note to <persRef
								ref="vives-don">General Vives</persRef>, and took it to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, who immediately sent for the
							members of the Administration to consider of it. They all came excepting
							the <persRef ref="wirt-william">Attorney General, Wirt</persRef>, who is
							gone to Richmond. The manner of conducting this negotiation has been
							thus— On receiving a Note from Vives it is immediately translated by
								<persRef ref="purviance-john">J. H. Purviance</persRef>, the only
							translator for the Department— I then take the translation to the
							President, and after a Conversation with him, prepare the draft of an
							answer, according to my own ideas, which I take to the President— He
							assembles the members of the Administration by whom the draft is
							discussed. Alterations, Additions, or omissions are proposed, after
							which the Note is finally prepared and sent— My draft this day, repeats
							the assertion of the absolute obligation of the <persRef
								ref="ferdinand-vii">king of Spain</persRef> to ratify the Treaty;
							reviews the unjustifiable delays which have put off the ratification
							from time to time, and shews the frivolous and constantly changing
							pretexts alledged for them. Then coming down to the time of his own
							arrival here, it shews that he neither brought the ratification of the
							Treaty, nor a power to give possession of Florida, as a pledge for the
							ratification; but refers us back to promises already given and violated—
							It then proceeds to give the explanations upon all his points— Asserts
							and shews that in the civil War, between Spain and her American
							Colonies, the United States have maintained a faithful and impartial
							neutrality; that the pretended expedition last Summer against Texas was
							an insignificant marauding party, which never assembled within our
							Jurisdiction; for the suppression of which prompt and effectual measures
							were taken, and that it was probably as well as the exaggerated
							representations of it sent to Spain, a device of the fraudulent
							speculators in <pb type="ms" n="320"/>the annulled grants— That we had
							constantly refused to contract any engagement not to recognize the
							independence of the South-Americans— That it was well known to the
							Spanish Government, and to <persRef ref="onis-luis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis</persRef> when he signed the
							Treaty, that we never should agree to any such stipulation— That Spain
							had no right to ask it of us; and that it would be incompatible with our
							neutrality to accede to it— That the Declaration which <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef> was instructed to deliver on
							exchanging the ratifications of the Treaty was not intended to annul,
							after, or impair the eighth Article of the Treaty, but to fulfil it, as
							it stands— And proves that such was the meaning of the Article. After
							going through all the Articles of explanation, it concludes by stating
							that the Correspondence between us would immediately be laid before
							Congress, and that after they shall have taken such measures concerning
							it as they <unclear>should</unclear> think proper, I shall make him a
							further Communication. Some question was made as to the expediency of
							this conclusion, and whether it would not be better simply to announce
							that the Correspondence would go to Congress without any promise of
							further communication. I mentioned my reason for adding the last clause
							which was lest Vives might suppose by the reference to Congress, it was
							intended to have no further communication with him— This was not my
							purpose; and after Congress shall have acted upon the Correspondence it
							seemed proper, and indeed necessary that notice should be given him of
							what they shall have done. <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> thought it would be
							well to enlarge upon the absolute obligation of the King of Spain to
							ratify the Treaty. I had been impressed with the same idea, but had
							omitted that argument, to avoid making the note too long. I concurred
							however with Calhoun’s opinion, and took the draft with me to make the
							addition— The Editors of the National Intelligencer, <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and <persRef ref="seaton-william"
								>Seaton</persRef> called this evening at my house, to ask whether
							they might contradict in their paper certain paragraphs which have
							appeared the last two or three days in the Washington City Gazette—
							Asserting that the President had refused to receive the Treaty, which
							General Vives had brought with him ratified— That he had refused to
							receive him as Minister of Spain; and that last evening, the General was
							at a party at a private house, where were also several of the Heads of
							Departments, and it was observed that no interchange of civilities took
							place between them— Every one of these paragraphs is a falsehood or a
							misrepresentation. But they are shadows of a real substance— They are
							not facts— But the state of things, of which they are indicated as the
							Evidence, really exists— To deny the particular symptom, would be taken
							by the public for a denial of the malady, and that would mislead them
							more than the misstatements themselves have done. The mission of Vivés,
							is a part of the paltering system of Spain— He can conclude nothing, and
							we are going to Congress with its total failure— The curiosity of
							members of Congress is so eager, and inquisitive, and there are so many
							participators in all our secrets that a Negotiation might as well be
							carried on in a public Square, by the sound of the trumpet as here— I
							told Gales and Seaton that the paragraphs in the City Gazette were not
							true, and I had no knowledge whence they came— Some of them carried
							their contradiction with them in their absurdity— An authorised
							contradiction of them did not appear to be necessary, and might lead to
							other misconceptions— It might be stated that the Reports were not
							authentic. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="pueyrredon-juan">Pueyrredon</persRef>, to such a

								<persRef ref="deforest-david">De Forest</persRef> came out he
							brought a formal demand that Halsey should be dismissed— There had also
							been a complaint against him for extortion in his Consular charges— He
							now told me that he came to justify his conduct, which he attempted to
							do, without <pb type="ms" n="321"/>success. He said he had known that
							various exports of arms and equipments of armed vessels from this
							Country had taken place, in behalf of the South-Americans, without
							opposition, and he had therefore concluded with the approbation of this
							Government. He feebly denied having made sale of Artigas’s Commissions,
							though he acknowledged he was informed it had been so attested at some
							of the trials for Piracy at Baltimore— He also denied having ever had
							any actual interest in Buenos Ayres privateers, and as to his illegal
							charges, he pleaded the example of other American Consuls, at Gibraltar
							and at Lisbon— I told him his explanations were not satisfactory—that I
							wished to have no further discussion with him on the subject, but that

							told me that he had seen and conversed with General Vivés who was much

							most earnest desire that the negotiation should succeed, and had every
							appearance of being a fair and candid man. I told him that from what I
							had seen of Vivés personally, I had entertained a favourable opinion of
							his character, but the difficulty was that he had no Powers. His
							Government had sent him here upon a shuffling mission, with instructions
							which they knew would prevent him from concluding any thing, and would
							compel him to resort back to them— This after what had passed was a
							mockery. He asked me whether I would before sending the reply to Vives’s
							last Note, have a personal conference with him— He thought we might thus
							more easily come to a mutual understanding, and he hoped Vives had some
							proposal to make, which might be accepted by us. I said I would take the
							President’s directions, and had no doubt he would consent that I should
							have a personal conference with Vivés, though I saw no reason to expect
							from it any satisfactory result. The Correspondence had already gone too
							far. I had expected, General Vives would in the first instance have
							proposed a verbal discussion to precede writing: but he had chosen to
							begin with writing, and had left little or nothing to do, by way of
							conference. This was the more extraordinary, as he had told <persRef
								ref="pasquier-etienne">Baron Pasquier</persRef>, the French Minister
							of foreign Relations at Paris, that he was authorised if he should
							receive satisfactory explanations, to authorise the immediate delivery
							of Florida into our possession as a pledge for the immediate
							ratification of the Treaty—a power which he now positively declares that
							he has not. De Neuville said he inclined to think that Vivés possessed
							some such power, and he earnestly wished we might have an opportunity of
							discussing the points of the Mission more freely than was practicable in
							writing— I believe this course to be the most advisable.</p>

						<p><pb type="ms" n="322"/><date>29. V:</date> Received this Morning a Note
							from the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, requesting to
							see me before my Conference with the Spanish Minister. I called upon him
							accordingly. It was merely to desire me to communicate fully to <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de
								Neuville</persRef> the course intended to be pursued, by us— De
							Neuville came according to appointment to my Office at Noon. I shewed
							him the Notes which had passed between <persRef ref="vives-don"
								>Vives</persRef> and me since his arrival; and the last Note
							prepared by me and ready to be sent— The main argument of this Note is
							to prove the absolute obligation of the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii"
								>king of Spain</persRef> to have ratified the Treaty, and to expose
							the prevarication of the <persRef ref="melgarejo-joaquin">Duke of San
								Fernando</persRef>, in his correspondence with <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>, on this subject— This
							exposition, I think complete. De Neuville could object to it nothing but
							that Sovereigns being independent, were accountable for their actions
							only to God. I observed to him that Sovereigns having relations of
							interest together were accountable also to each other—were bound to do
							Justice, and perform their promises, and if refusing were compellable to
							perform them by just War— But this is not the question with the Duke of
							San Fernando. With him, it is merely a question of authority from
								<persRef ref="vattel-emer">Vattel</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="vonmartens-georg">Martens</persRef>, on the right of a
							Sovereign to refuse the ratification of a Treaty signed by his <persRef
								ref="onis-luis">Minister</persRef> with unqualified full-powers— The
							Duke admits the appeal to the authority of those writers, and distorts
							their meaning by perverting their words— To this, de Neuville had
							nothing to reply— As he left me, General Vivés came, and I had a
							conference with him of about two hours. I gave him explanations upon all
							the points mentioned in his Notes, but I abridge the account of them
							here; because the substance of them will be contained in the
							correspondence between us, which will be published— He said he came with
							a most anxious desire to settle amicably all the differences. That this
							was also the determination, and the earnest wish of his king. That his
							Government had no intention to temporise, or deal disingenuously with
							us— That if such had been their object he never would have accepted of
							this Mission. He was a soldier, and had never been employed before in
							diplomatic Negotiations. He wished to go directly to his purpose. When
							he arrived in the U.S. he had been informed that the expedition of last
							Summer against Texas had been broken up and dissolved—that the Laws
							against Piracy had been strengthened, and effectually carried into
							execution— That the hostility against Spain, which had been represented
							in such strong colours to the king seemed to have been greatly
							exaggerated, and that he had formed sanguine hopes of the success of his
							Mission— That the king had withheld the ratification of the Treaty, only
							from a sense of duty to his own subjects— That he could not see their
							property plundered upon the Ocean, and his territories invaded, at the
							very moment of the conclusion of the Treaty without pausing to act upon
							it. And when informed of the proposal made by this Government to
							Great-Britain, to recognize the Independence of Buenos Ayres, he could
							not avoid the belief that our recognition of it, would immediately
							follow upon the ratification of the Treaty— I told him that the
							proposition was made to France, as well as to Great-Britain; and was
							intended to have been made also to Russia— That it was made at a time
							when we had no expectation of the conclusion of a Treaty. On an opinion
							then and yet entertained that Spain herself must and would ultimately
							acknowledge the Independence of Buenos-Ayres, and that this concerted
							recognition, by several of the principal Powers in relation with Spain,
							would be favourable to the interests of all parties, Spain herself
							included— He said he was himself of that opinion— I told him that our
							system between Spain and South-America was neutrality— That a
							stipulation not to recognize the South-Americans would be a breach of
							neutrality, and as such we could not accede to it. With regard to the
							grants, I told him that we wanted nothing but the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>Article of the Treaty as it stands— And
							the Declaration which Forsyth had been instructed to deliver was merely
							to warn against the possibility of an erroneous construction of it, from
							an accidental mistake of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis, which
							could justly have no bearing upon it. He said the grants had never made
							a serious question by the Spanish Government— The Grants were null and
							void. All such grants when registered by the Council of the Indies,
							always had conditions of Settlements and improvements annexed to them,
							which these Grantees could not have performed— And if they should ever
							produce their Charters, the Conditions unperformed would appear upon the
							face of them— It was only after the other Objections had been raised
							that his Government had thought of taking up this— As it was desirable
							that something should be done for the Grantees he had been instructed
							first to propose, that a sufficient portion of the Lands, should <pb
								type="ms" n="323"/>be reserved to the United States, to pay the five
							Millions of Dollars stipulated for the Claims, and that the grants
							should be good for the remainder to the grantees; but he was not
							required to insist upon it, and did not wish it to appear in the
							Correspondence at-all. I told him that although the Sum assumed by the
							United States to be paid for Claims of their Citizens upon Spain
							amounted only to five Millions of Dollars, yet the claims themselves
							were much more— That it would be impossible to discriminate so as to
							annul the grants to the extent of five Millions of Dollars, and to
							recognize them for the remainder. But if the King of Spain wished to
							have the grants confirmed, we might consent to it upon condition of
							having an equivalent ceded to us West of the Sabine, and taking for
							example the Colorado, as the boundary. He said he would give up the
							Affair of the grants altogether, and therefore wished me in the Note
							which I should write him, to speak with the utmost decision upon that
							point. On the whole he said he was personally satisfied upon all the
							points of explanation which he had been instructed to notice. He could
							also undertake to say that his Government would be satisfied upon all
							excepting that of our refusal to promise not to recognize the
							Independence of the South Americans. What I had said to him on that
							subject, fell short of the expectations of his Government, and therefore
							he could not promise the immediate ratification of the Treaty upon the
							arrival of his Messenger. But he would promise that the answer should be
							immediate and without delay. As he was entirely satisfied himself, he
							should earnestly urge his Government to the Ratification; he would shew
							me the despatch that he should write, and fully believed that the
							Ratification would be immediately given— After this interview, de
							Neuville came again to the Office. I told him that General Vives had
							been explicit and apparently candid. But in removing almost all the
							difficulties that had existed, he had raised others— I should however
							write him now a different note, from that which I had prepared; and I
							should make every possible effort towards conciliation— I then called at
							the President’s, and gave him an exact account of what had passed
							between Vivés and me— The President formed sanguine hopes of final
							success from it. I did not share them. The prospect seems indeed to
							brighten, when every obstacle but one has vanished, and that seeming to
							hang by a hair— But to my mind that one has alone been insuperable from
							the beginning and will yet prove so, unless superseded by another not
							less unsurmountable— To this Vives himself in our Conversation alluded—
							The mutiny of the troops at the Isle de Leon, which broke out on the
								1<hi rend="superscript">st. </hi>of January last, by their refusal
							to embark for the long prepared expedition against South-America, has
							ripened into a complete revolution of Government in Spain. We have
							within a few days accounts that Ferdinand 7. has convoked the Cortes,
							and sworn to their Constitution of 1812. Vives told me that he had no
							authentic intelligence of this Event; but that he believed it— The
							Constiution of 1812. declared the two Florida’s to be a part of the
							Spanish territory, and under it, the alienation of any portion of that
							territory, by the King is expressly prohibited— Vives said if the King
							had sworn to that Constitution the power of ratifying the Treaty would
							no longer be in him alone, though he supposed whoever might be his
							Council, they would consider this as a transaction completed, and not
							subject to be affected by a change of internal Government in Spain— This
							will undoubtedly make a new difficulty, if all the others are abandoned—
							I promised the President to prepare as soon as possible the draft of a
							new Note— <persRef ref="smith-william-steuben;smith-catherine-johnson"

						<p><date>30. V:</date> Heard at the Capitol a <persRef ref="gurley-unknown"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gurley</persRef> from
							Connecticut, a preacher of considerable talent, whose discourse was
							animated, eloquent, full of imagination, and original thought, expressed
							in choice and generally elevated language but delivered with the tone
							and modes of voice, and twang peculiar to New-England; and chiefly so to
							Connecticut. The remainder of the day, I was occupied in preparing the
							draft of a Note to <persRef ref="vives-don">General Vives</persRef>, as
							a substitute to that which was prepared before the conference of
							yesterday. When finished I sent it to the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef>. After dinner I took a solitary walk, and then
							visited the <persRef ref="anderson-joseph">Comptroller
								Anderson</persRef>, but he was not at home. I left cards for him and
							his son <persRef ref="anderson-alexander">Alexander</persRef> who is
							here on a visit from Tennessee. Remainder of the Evening at <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun’s</persRef>, the Secretary of War; where I met <persRef
								ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Richard M.
								Johnson</persRef>.</p>
