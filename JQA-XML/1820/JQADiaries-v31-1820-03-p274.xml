							the appointment of Agent for the U.S. to the Commission under the 6<hi

							are merely to read the Philadelphia Newspapers. O’Brien comes to talk
							about his accounts and the Missouri question.— Ware, was one of the
							Seamen of the Ship Baltimore, which was abandoned by its Captain, and
							carried into Falmouth, while I was in England— Ware and others of the
							crew, left at my recommendation his claim for wages, with <persRef

							suspicious that his money was not safe and disposed to sue Aspinwall for
							it here: from which I dissuaded him, though I told him there was no

							Senate have carried their whole point, barely consenting to the
							formality of separting the Bill for the admission of the State of Maine
							into the Union, from that for authorising the People of the Territory of
							Missouri to form a State Government— The condition that Slavery should
							be prohibited by their Constitution, which the House of Representatives
							had inserted, they have abandoned.— Missouri and Arkansaw will be Slave
							States; but to the Missouri Bill, a section is annexed, prohibiting
							Slavery in the remaining part of the Louisiana cession, North of
							Latitude 36: 30— This compromise as it is called was finally carried
							this Evening by a vote of 90 to 87 in the House of Representatives;
							after several successive days and almost nights of stormy debate.</p>

						<p><date>3. VI:30.</date> Went with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Adams</persRef>, our <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Son Charles</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary Hellen</persRef> to the Capitol Hill, and
							viewed <persRef ref="sully-thomas">Sully’s</persRef> Picture of the
							passage of the river Delaware by <persRef ref="washington-george"
								>General Washington</persRef>, 25 December 1776, now exhibited in
							the building lately occupied by the two houses of Congress. As a picture
							of men and especially of horses, as large as life it has merit; but
							there is nothing in it that marks the scene, or the crisis— The
							principal figure, is the worst upon the Canvas— Badly drawn, badly
							coloured; without likenes’s, and without character— While we were there
								<persRef ref="nelson-jeremiah">Jeremiah Nelson</persRef>, a member
							of the House from Massachusetts came in, and told us of <persRef
								ref="randolph-john">John Randolph’s</persRef> motion this morning to
							reconsider one of the votes of yesterday upon the Missouri Bill, and of
							the trickery by which his motion was defeated; by <persRef
								key="clay-henry">the Speakers</persRef> declaring it not in order
							when first made; the Journal of yesterday’s proceedings not having been
							then read—and while they were reading the <persRef
								ref="dougherty-thomas">Clerk of the House</persRef> carried the
							Bills as passed by the House, to the Senate; so that when Randolph,
							after the reading of the Journals renewed his motion, it was too late;
							the papers being no longer in possession of the house. And so it is that
							a Law Perpetuating Slavery in Missouri and perhaps in North-America has
							been smuggled through both houses of Congress. I have been convinced
							from the first starting of this question that it could not end
							otherwise— The fault is in the Constitution of the United States, which
							has sanctioned a dishonourable compromise with Slavery. There is
							henceforth no remedy for it but a new organization of the Union, to
							effect which a concert of all the white States is indispensable. Whether
							that can ever be accomplished is doubtful— It is a contemplation not
							very creditable to human nature, that the cement of common interest
							produced by Slavery is stronger and more solid than that of unmingled
							freedom. In this instance the Slave-States have clung together in one
							unbroken phalanx, and have been victorious by the means of accomplices
							and deserters, from the ranks of Freedom. Time only can show, whether
							the contest may ever be with equal advantage renewed. But so polluted
								<pb type="ms" n="276"/>are all the streams of Legislation in regions
							of Slavery, that this Bill has been obtained only by two as unprincipled
							artifices as dishonesty ever devised; one by coupling it as an appendage
							to the Bill for admitting Maine; and the other by this outrage,
							perpetrated by the Speaker upon the Rules of the house— When I came this
							day to my Office, I found there a Note requesting me to call at one
							O’Clock at the President’s house— It was then one, and I immediately
							went over— He expected that the two Bills; for the admission of Maine,
							and to enable Missouri to make a Constitution, would have been brought
							to him for his signature; and he had summoned all the members of the
							Administration, to ask their opinions in writing to be deposited in the
							Department of State; upon two Questions. 1. Whether Congress had a
							Constitutional right to prohibit Slavery in a Territory? and 2. Whether
							the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section of the Missouri Bill,
							(which interdicts Slavery <hi rend="italic">forever</hi> in the
							Territory North of 36 1/2 Latitude, was applicable only to the
							territorial State, or would extend to it, after it should become a
							State— As to the first question, it was unanimously agreed that Congress
							have the power to prohibit Slavery in the Territories; and yet neither
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, nor <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef> could find any express power to
							that effect given in the Constitution; and Wirt declared himself very
							decidedly against the admission of any implied powers— The progress of
							this discussion, has so totally merged in passion all the reasoning
							faculties of these Slave holders, that these Gentlemen in the simplicity
							of their hearts had come to a conclusion in direct opposition to their
							premises; without being aware or conscious of inconsistency— They
							insisted upon it that the clause in the Constitution, which gives
							Congress power to dispose of, and make all <hi rend="italic"
								>needful</hi> rules and regulations respecting the territory and
							other property of the United States, had reference to it, only as land,
							and conferred no authority to make rules, binding upon its inhabitants;
							and Wirt added the notable Virginian objection, that Congress could make
							only <hi rend="italic">needful</hi> rules and regulations —and that a
							prohibition of Slavery was not <hi rend="italic">needful</hi>— Their
							argument, as Randolph said of it in the House covered the whole ground,
							and their compromise, measured by their own principles is a sacrifice of
							what they hold to be the Constitution— I had no doubt of the right of
							Congress to interdict Slavery in the Territories and urged that the
							power contained in the term dispose of, included the authority to do
							every thing that could be done with it as mere property, and that the
							additional words authorising needful rules and regulations respecting
							it, must have reference to persons connected with it, or could have no
							meaning at all— As to the force of the term needful, I observed it was
							relative, and must always be supposed to have reference to some end—
							Needful to what end— Needful in the Constitution of the United States to
							any of the ends for which that compact was formed, those ends are
							declared in its preamble—to establish justice for example. What can be
							more needful to the establishment of Justice, than the interdiction of
							Slavery where it does not exist. As to the second question my opinion
							was that the interdiction of Slavery in the 8<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Section of the Bill, <hi rend="italic">forever</hi>, would
							apply and be binding upon the State, as well as upon the Territory;
							because by its interdiction in the Territory, the People when they come
							to form a Constitution, would have no right to sanction Slavery—
							Crawford said that in the new States, which have been admitted into the
							Union upon the express condition that their Constitutions should consist
							with the perpetual interdiction of Slavery, it might be sanctioned by an
							ordinary act of their Legislatures— I said, that whatever a State
							Legislature might do in point of fact, they could not by any rightful
							exercise of power establish Slavery— The Declaration of Independence,
							not only asserts the natural equality of all men, and their unalienable
							right to Liberty; but that the only <hi rend="italic">just</hi> powers
							of government are derived from the consent of the governed. A power for
							one part of the people to make slaves of the other can never be derived
							from the consent, and is therefore not a just power. Crawford said this
							was the opinion that had been <hi rend="italic">attributed</hi> to
								<persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								King</persRef>. I said it was undoubtedly the opinion of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> King; and it was mine. I did not want to
							make a public display of it, where it might excite irritation, but if
							called upon officially for it, I should not withhold it— But the opinion
							was not peculiar to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King and me— It was
							an opinion universal in the States where there are no Slaves— It was the
							opinion of all those members of Congress who voted for the restriction
							upon Missouri, and of many of those who voted against it— As to the
							right of imposing the restriction upon a State, the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> had signed a Bill with
							precisely such a restriction upon the State of Illinois— Why should the
							question be made now, which was not made then— Crawford said that was
							done in conformity to the compact of the Ordinance of 1787: and besides
							the restriction was a nullity, not binding upon the Legislatures of
							those <pb type="ms" n="277"/>States. I did not reply to the assertion
							that a solemn compact, announced before heaven and earth in the
							ordinance of 1787. a compact laying the foundation of security to the
							most sacred rights of human nature, against the most odious of
							oppressions, a compact solemnly renewed by the acts of Congress enabling
							the States of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, to form State Governments, and
							again by the Acts for admitting those States into the Union, was a <hi
								rend="italic">nullity</hi>, which the Legislatures of either of
							those states may at any time disregard and trample under foot. It was
							sickening to my Soul to hear the assertion; but to have discussed it
							there would have been useless, and only have kindled in the bosom of the
							Executive the same flame which has been raging in Congress; and in the
							Country— Its discussion was unnecessary, to the decision of the
							questions proposed by the President— I therefore only said that the
							Ordinance of 1787. had been passed by the old Congress of the
							Confederation, without authority from the States, but had been tacitly
							confirmed by the adoption of the present Constitution, and the authority
							given to Congress in it to make needful rules and regulations for the
							territory— I added that in one of the numbers of the federalist, there
							was an admission that the old Congress had passed the Ordinance without
							authority, under an impulse of necessity—and that it was used as an
							argument in favour of the enlarged powers granted to Congress in the
							Constitution. Crawford said it could therefore have little or no weight
							as authority— I replied that it was not wanted as authority— That when
							the old Confederation was adopted the United States had no territory.
							Nor was there in the Act of Confederation, in which the powers of
							Congress under it were enumerated a word about territory. But there was
							a clause interdicting to Congress the exercise of any powers not
							expressly given them. I alluded to the origin of the Confederation with
							our Revolution— To the revolutionary powers exercised by Congress,
							before the Confederation was adopted— To the question whether the
							Northwestern territory belonged to the United States or the separate
							States— To the delays occasioned by that question in the acceptance of
							the Confederation; and to the subsequent cessions of Territory by
							several States, to the Union, which gave occasion for the ordinance of
							1787. To all which Crawford said nothing. Wirt said that he perfectly
							agreed with me that there could be no rightful power to establish
							Slavery where it was res nova— But he thought it would not be the force
							of the Act of Congress that would lead to this result— The principle
							itself being correct, though Congress might have no power to prescribe
							it to a sovereign State. To this my reply was, that the power of
							establishing Slavery, not being a Sovereign power, but a wrongful and
							despotic power, Congress had a right to say that no State undertaking to
							establish it de novo should be admitted into the Union; and that a State
							which should undertake to establish it would put herself out of the pale
							of the Union, and forfeit all the rights and privileges of the
							connection. The President said that it was impossible to exclude the
							principle of implied powers, being granted to Congress by the
							Constitution. The Powers of Sovereignty were distributed between the
							general and the State Governments— Extensive powers were given in
							general terms; all detailed and incidental powers were implied in the
							general grant. Some years ago, Congress had appropriated a sum of money
							to the relief of the inhabitants of Caraccas, who had suffered by an
							earthquake— There was no express grant of authority to apply the public
							money to such a purpose— It was by an implied power— The material
							question was only when the power supposed to be implied came in conflict
							with rights reserved to the State Governments— He inclined also to think
							with me, that the Rules and Regulations, which Congress were authorised
							to make for the territories, must be understood as extending to their
							inhabitants— And he resumed to the history of the North-western
							Territory. The Cessions by the several States to the Union, and the
							controversies concerning this subject during our revolutionary War— He
							said he wished the written opinion of the members of the Cabinet,
							without discussion, in terms as short as it could be expressed, and
							merely that it might be deposited in the Department of State— I told him
							that I should prefer a dispensation from answering the second question;
							especially as I should be alone here in the opinion which I entertained;
							for <persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef>, the Secretary of the Navy cautiously avoided
							giving any opinion, upon the question of natural right, but assented to
							the Slave sided doctrine that the eighth Section of the Bill, word <hi
								rend="italic">forever</hi>, and all, applied only to the time and
							condition of the territorial Government— I said therefore that if
							required to give my opinion upon the second question, standing alone, it
							would be necessary for me to assign the reasons upon which I entertained
							it— Crawford saw no necessity for any reasoning about it, but had no
							objection to my assigning my reasons— Calhoun thought it <pb type="ms"
								n="278"/>exceedingly desirable that no such argument should be drawn
							up and deposited— He therefore suggested to the President, the idea of
							changing the terms of the second question, so that it should be, whether
							the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section of the Bill was consistent
							with the Constitution? which the other members of the administration
							might answer affirmatively, assigning their reason, because they
							considered it applicable only to the territorial state; while I could
							answer it, also affirmatively: without annexing any qualification— To
							this the President readily assented, and I as readily agreed— The
							questions are to be framed accordingly— This occasion has remarkably
							manifested Crawford’s feelings, and the continually kindling intenseness
							of his ambition. I have had information from the <persRef
								ref="jennings-jonathan">Governor of the State of Indiana</persRef>,
							that there is in that State a party countenanced and supported by
							Crawford whose purpose it is to introduce Slavery into that State, and
							there is reason to believe that the same project exists in Ohio and
							Illinois— This avowed opinion that in defiance of the Ordinance of 1787.
							and of the Laws admitting those States into the Union, Slavery may be
							established in either of those States by an ordinary act of its
							Legislature strongly confirms the impressions of him communicated to me
							by the Governor of Indiana. It is apparent that Crawford is already
							aware, how his canvass for the Presidency may be crossed by this Slavery
							contest— The violence of its operation upon his temper is such that he
							could not suppress it— After this meeting, I walked home with Calhoun,
							who said that the principles, which I had avowed were just and noble;
							but that in the Southern Country, whenever they were mentioned, they
							were always understood as applying only to white men— Domestic labour
							was confined to the blacks; and such was the prejudice, that if he, who
							was the most popular man in his district, were to keep a white servant
							in his house, his character and reputation would be irretrievably
							ruined. I said that this confounding of the ideas of servitude and
							labour, was one of the bad effects of Slavery—but he thought it attended
							with many excellent consequences— It did not apply to all kinds of
							labour—not for example to farming— He himself had often held the plough—
							So had his father— Manufacturing and mechanical labour, was not
							degrading— It was only menial labour—the proper work of Slaves— No white
							person could descend to that— And it was the best guarantee to equality
							among the whites— It produced an unvarying level among them. It not only
							did not excite, but did not even admit of inequalities, by which one
							white man could domineer over another.— I told Calhoun I could not see
							things in the same light— It is in truth all perverted
							sentiment—mistaking labour for Slavery, and dominion for Freedom— The
							discussion of this Missouri question has betrayed the secret of their
							Souls— In the abstract they admit that Slavery is an evil; they disclaim
							all participation in the introduction of it; and cast it all upon the
							shoulders of our old Grandam Britain— But when probed to the quick upon
							it they show at the bottom of their Souls, pride and vain-glory in their
							very condition of masterdom— They fancy themselves more generous and
							noble-hearted than the plain freemen who labour for subsistence— They
							look down upon the simplicity of a yankey’s manners because he has no
							habits of overbearing like theirs, and cannot treat negroes like dogs—
							It is among the evils of Slavery that it taints the very sources of
							moral principle— It establishes false estimates of virtue and vice; for
							what can be more false and heartless than this doctrine which makes the
							first and holiest rights of humanity to depend upon the colour of the
							skin— It perverts human reason, and reduces men endowed with logical
							powers to maintain that Slavery is sanctioned by the Christian religion—
							That Slaves are happy and contented in their condition— That between
							Master and Slave there are ties of mutual attachment and affection. That
							the virtues of the Master, are refined, and exalted by the degradation
							of the Slave, while at the same time they vent execrations upon the
							Slave-trade; curse Britain for having given them Slaves, burn at the
							Stake, negroes convicted of crimes: for the terror of the example, and
							writhe in agonies of fear, at the very mention of human rights as
							applicable to men of colour. The impression produced upon my mind by the
							progress of this discussion is that the bargain between Freedom and
							Slavery contained in the Constitution of the United States, is morally
							and politically vicious— Inconsistent with the principles upon which
							alone our revolution can be justified; cruel and oppressive by rivetting
							the chains of Slavery—by pledging the faith of Freedom to maintain and
							perpetuate the tyranny of the master, and grossly unequal and impolitic,
							by admitting that Slaves are at once enemies to be kept in subjection,
							property to be secured or restored to their owners, and persons, not to
							be represented themselves, but for whom their masters are priviledged
							with nearly a double share of representation— The consequence has been
							that this Slave-representation has governed the Union— Benjamin,
							portioned above his brethren has ravined as a wolf—in the morning he has
							devoured the prey, and at night he has divided the spoil— It would be no
							difficult matter to prove by reviewing the history of the Union under
							this Constitution, that almost every thing which has <pb type="ms"
								n="279"/>contributed to the honour and welfare of the nation, has
							been accomplished in despite of them, or forced upon them; and that
							every thing unpropitious and dishonourable, including the blunders and
							follies of their adversaries, may be traced to them— I have favoured
							this Missouri compromise, believing it to be all that could be effected
							under the present Constitution, and from extreme unwillingness to put
							the Union at hazard. But perhaps it would have been a wiser as well as a
							bolder course to have persisted in the restriction upon Missouri, till
							it should have terminated in a Convention of the States to revise and
							amend the Constitution— This would have produced a new Union of thirteen
							or fourteen States, unpolluted with Slavery, with a great and glorious
							object to effect; namely that of rallying to their Standard the other
							States, by the universal emancipation of their Slaves. If the Union must
							be dissolved, Slavery is precisely the question upon which it ought to
							break. For the present however this contest is now laid asleep— <persRef

								<persRef ref="king-rufus">R. King</persRef>, <persRef

								<persRef ref="thorndike-israel">I. Thorndike</persRef> upon the
							Russian Government. Dana, was recommending some person for the Office of
							Consul at Pernambuco, and King apparently came to talk with me of the
							compromise, and the Maine and Missouri Bills— There were however so many
							persons present that he said but little. He is deeply mortified at the
							issue, and very naturally feels resentful at the imputations of the
							Slave-holders that his motives on this occasion have been merely, of
							personal aggrandizement— “Close ambition, varnished over with zeal”—
							This imputation of bad motives, is one of the most envenomed weapons of
							political, and indeed of every sort of controversy— It came originally
							from the Devil “Doth Job fear God for nought”— The selfish and the
							social Passions are intermingled in the conduct of every man acting in a
							public capacity— It is right that they should be so, and it is no just
							cause of reproach to any man, that in promoting to the utmost of his
							power the public good, he is desirous at the same time of promoting his
							own— There are no doubt hypocrites of humanity as well as of religion—
							Men with cold hearts and warm professions, trading upon benevolence, and
							using Justice and Virtue as the Stakes upon the turn of a Card, or the
							cast of a die— But this sort of profligacy belongs to a state of Society
							more deeply corrupted than ours. Such characters are rare among us. Many
							of our public men have principles too pliable to popular impulse, but
							few are deliberately dishonest, and there is not a man in the Union of
							purer integrity than Rufus King— I dined and spent the Evening, with

						<p><date>5. VI:30.</date> The <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> sent me yesterday the two Questions in writing
							upon which he desired to have answers in writing, to be deposited in the
							Department of State— He wrote me that it would be in time if he should
							have the answers To-morrow. The first question is in general terms, as
							it was stated at the Meeting on Friday— The second was modified, to an
							enquiry whether the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section of the
							Missouri Bill is consistent with the Constitution— To this I can without
							hesitation, answer by a simple affirmative, and so after some
							reflection, I concluded to answer both. Heard <persRef ref="post-reuben"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Post</persRef> the Chaplain of
							the Senate, at the Capitol, and after Church I returned several visits.
							Among the rest to <persRef ref="daggett-david">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Daggett</persRef> of Connecticut, late a Senator, and

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parrott</persRef> of
							New-Hampshire— It was said that in the hottest paroxysm of the Missouri
							Question in the Senate, <persRef ref="barbour-james">James
								Barbour</persRef> one of the Virginia Senators, was going round to
							all the Free State Members, and proposing to them to call a Convention
							of the States, to dissolve the Union, and agree upon the terms of
							Separation, and the mode of disposing of the public debt, and of the
							Lands, and make other necessary arrangements of disunion— Dana said he
							told him, that he was not for calling a Convention to separate; but he
							had no objection to a Convention to form a more perfect Union— I
							observed that I thought a Convention might in the course of a few years
							be found necessary to remedy the great imperfections of the present
							system; and that it might be called <pb type="ms" n="280"/>whenever a
							majority of the People should become convinced of its necessity. I added
							there were three subjects each of which might produce a state of things
							issuing in such a necessity— One was the regulation of the
							currency—Banks and Paper Money— Another the impotence of the National
							Government to make internal improvements by Roads and Canals, and the
							third was Slavery— The idea that a Majority of the People might hold a
							Convention appeared to startle some of the Gentlemen, and particularly
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson— It is nevertheless sound
							Constitutional doctrine— I called also on <persRef ref="edwards-henry"

								<persRef ref="botta-carlo">Botta’s</persRef> History of the American
							Revolution— I had lent him my French Translation of Botta, and he now
							asked me for advice with regard to his own. He intimated the intention,
							of writing an Introduction, to his translation; a plan which I thought
							might be executed in an interesting manner—by a critical review of the
							other historians of the same period. There were historians of the
							American Revolution, British, American and French— Each of whom told the
							Story in his own way— Botta, was an Italian— Of a Nation entirely

							lost the vote by disunion— The Slave holders, clung together, without
							losing one vote. Many of them, and almost all the Virginians, held out
							to the last even against the compromise— The cause of this closer union
							on the Slavish side is that the question affected the individual
							interest of every Slave-holding member and of almost every one of his
							Constituents— On the other side individual interests were not implicated
							in the decision at-all. The impulses were pure republican principle and
							the rights of human nature— The struggle for political power, and

							repeal or change the Law for printing the Acts of Congress in the

							Sessions of Congress with an estimate of the expense— That being sent
							and referred to his Committee, he now writes to enquire what has been

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowndes</persRef>, Chairman of the
							Committee of foreign Relations of the House of Representatives was
							there— This Committee made <pb type="ms" n="282"/>yesterday their Report
							upon the part of the President’s Message at the Commencement of the
							Session, concerning our Affairs with Spain— It proposes an Act
							authorising and requiring the President to take possession of Florida—
							This instead of a discretionary power, which the President’s Message had
							proposed, is a positive injunction; Lowndes says it will not pass in
							Congress. It was earned by a bare majority of the Committee; and I
							believe its real object was to help through the military appropriation
							Bill, which labours in its passage through the house, and to give the
							go-by to motions for reducing the army. The Report itself has some very
							exceptionable features— It neither makes nor proposes any provision of
							indemnity for the claims upon Spain, and it countenances the idea, that
							by taking possession, the contested grants of Land must be recognized by
							the United States as valid— Intimating that for the indemnity to our
							Citizens, Spain must expect us to look westward— Lowndes is a man of
							fine talents, of good principles, of mild temper, and placid
							manners—grave but cheerful, and always inoffensive— He is or has been
							independent in his fortune, and two years ago declined a choice of two
							Missions either to Constantinople or to Russia, which were offered to
							him by the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>— He has more
							personal influence in the house of Representatives than any other
							member, and is generally friendly to the present administration— But as
							much of his influence rests upon the general impression of his
							independence, he is rather over solicitous to maintain that reputation—
							To be very sure of standing erect, he leans a little backward—
							Supporting the administration in the main, he is apt to seek for
							differences of detail. He joins in no factious opposition, but he loves
							to devise ways and means of his own— So in this case, he proposes not
							what the President recommended, but a substitute— Not a power which the
							Executive might have held up in terrorem, in Negotiation with Spain, and
							the very possession of which would probably have rendered its exercise
							unnecessary, but a positive direction to the President to take
							possession at all events— Lowndes finding it doubtful, whether either of
							the proposals would pass, produced one differing from that of the
							President to manifest at all Events his independence— We came home
							before nine O’Clock.</p>

							chaplain rather as a sort of pension for having been a chaplain in the

						<p><date>13. VII:</date> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>was here this
							morning: the person some weeks since introduced to me by <persRef
								ref="story-joseph">judge Story</persRef>; and one of the claimants
							upon the Government of Spain— He told me that the principal, if not the
							sole reliance of those claimants for obtaining eventual indemnity for
							any part of their losses was upon me. That the Committee of Foreign
							Relations had reported a Bill for taking possession of Florida, without
							providing at all for the claims, and that many of the Northern Members
							were very unwilling to vote for it in that shape. But the Northern
							Members will not vote for taking possession of Florida at-all. The
							Missouri question has sickened them of Slave States, and although at the
							commencement of the Session they were ready to vote for the measures
							recommended by the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, they
							would now scarcely accept Florida as a gift— At one O’Clock I attended
							the Cabinet Meeting at the President’s— The first subject considered was
							the case of a number of Pirates now under sentence of Death at
							Baltimore, Richmond, Charleston, Savannah and New-Orleans— All cases of
							Privateers under the South-American colours— The whole number is
							forty-five— The opinion was unanimous that some of them must be
							executed, but that a large proportion of them should be reprieved— The
							papers relating to them were read with a view to ascertain, the
							individuals, who by any extenuating circumstances, might have any claim
							to be considered fit subjects for Mercy. A Letter from <persRef
								ref="johnson-william">judge Johnson</persRef>, who presided at the
							trials in Charleston and Savannah, sufficiently marked the
							discrimination to be made in those cases. There was a record of part of
							the Evidence in the cases at New-Orleans, from which one case of
							peculiar atrocity, and one of strong mitigation were selected. There was
							an earnest petition, in behalf of one of the men convicted at Richmond,
							and a recommendation in his favour by the <persRef ref="stanard-robert"
								>District Attorney at Richmond—</persRef> But the petition was from
							a brother of the culprit, living at Portland, Maine, and <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> maintained there
							was nothing that recommended that case to favour more than any other—
							Stanard the District Attorney said in his Letter that he had considered
							this man’s case so much more favourably than the rest, that if the
							evidence had been otherwise deficient he should have discharged him and
							used him as a witness against the others— The most obvious feature in
							Crawford’s character is decision; but with strong sense, his opinions
							are sometimes so unaccountable that they surprize by their absurdity. He
							does not appear to be himself aware of the feelings which inspire them—
							He occasionally throws out opinions for the sake of making an argument;
							but in such cases I usually avoid taking it up. It was agreed that
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef> the Attorney General, should see Chief <persRef
								ref="marshall-john">Justice Marshall</persRef>, and enquire of him,
							where the severity of the Law, and where the beneficence of humanity may
							best be dispensed— There was a petition from Baltimore, signed by the
								<persRef ref="bland-theoderick">District judge Bland,</persRef> and
							several others, praying a pardon for all the seven convicted there; but
							there were no solid reasons assigned for the prayer; and the opinion in
							the Cabinet was unanimous that Baltimore was of all others the place
							where the necessity of making an example was the most urgent. Bland was
							not upon the Bench when these men were tried, but he passed sentence of
							Death upon them, and I know not how he looked in pronouncing it. In
								<persRef ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Franklin’s</persRef> fable of <persRef ref="taylor-polly">Polly
								Taylor,</persRef> the Judge on <pb type="ms" n="284"/>the Bench who
							convicts her of having had a bastard child, is the man by whom she was
							first seduced. If the Pirates at Baltimore, on receiving their Sentence
							could have addressed the Court, and told the whole truth they could have
							disclosed a scene of darker shades than the Story of Polly Taylor— There
							were two Petitions from these men sentenced at Baltimore, evidently
							written by one of their lawyers, and in a very disgusting style of
							levity and insolence. It was concluded that the public Justice and
							example required the execution of two at each place—and that the rest
							might be reprieved, and ultimately pardoned. Some question was made by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford whether the power of the
							President extended to a commutation of punishment; but it was not
							determined, and should I think be taken up, and deliberately decided
							hereafter— Wirt said the power of the king to commute punishment was
							exercised only by special Statutes— The second subject discussed, was
							the application from the <persRef ref="clarke-john2">Governor of
								Georgia</persRef> for Treaties to be held with the Creek and
							Cherokee Indians— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> had
							expressed himself to me, very much averse to the measure; he said and
							now repeated, that those Nations had lately made very extensive
							cessions, and with great reluctance— That the attempt now to obtain
							further cessions would certainly not succeed unless we should bully
							them, and at great expense— A Treaty would cost fifty thousand Dollars;
							and we should be obliged to pay very nearly the full value for the Lands
							if we obtained them— To all this Crawford assented, but said there would
							be great dissatisfaction in the State, if the application should be
							rejected— There was an expedient proposed, of holding one of the
							Treaties—with the Creeks— The Cherokees being still more reluctant at
							marking any further cession. The President finally asked me what was my
							opinion. I said the United States were bound by compact with the State
							of Georgia, to obtain the cessions as soon as possible, and my opinion
							was that we ought to do precisely what the State of Georgia asked us to
							do. It was accordingly so determined; and that a Message should
							immediately be sent to Congress recommending that provision be made by
							Law for holding the Treaty— There is in this affair, among other things,
							much of Georgia party Politicks. Clark, the present Governor is an
							inveterate enemy of Crawford, and was chosen in opposition to <persRef
								ref="troup-george">Troup</persRef>, who was Crawford’s friend, and
							the candidate of his partizans— Clark now urges the holding of these
							Treaties, and in his Letter to me, recommends, if the President should
							think that the Citizens of Georgia, are so much interested in the event,
							that persons from other States should be selected as Commissioners, that
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> should be
							one of them; adding that two thirds of the people of Georgia would have
							more confidence in him than in any other man. This is a home thrust at
							Crawford, whose deadly enmity with Jackson, is now perfectly notorious,
							and to whom is attributed the whole persecution of Jackson, on account
							of the Seminole War— Crawford would take no satisfaction in the success
							of Clark or of Jackson in rendering important and acceptable service to
							the People of Georgia. This disposition to thwart a personal enemy or
							rival, even at the sacrifice of the public interest, is a vice so deeply
							rooted in human nature, that it shews itself in every form of
							Government, and in none more than in ours— It is I firmly believe the
							greatest obstacle to the performance of useful service— The meeting
							broke up about four O’Clock— This and to-morrow Evening were assigned
							for receiving the visits of congratulation at the President’s on the
							Marriage of <persRef ref="monroe-maria">his daughter</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="monroe-james2">Lieutenant Monroe</persRef> called at my house
							to say, as from the <hi rend="strikethrough">foreign Ministers</hi>
							President, that he wished me to notify the foreign Ministers, that they
							might pay with their Ladies the wedding visit to <persRef
								ref="gouverneur-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef>and
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Gouverneur, and that it would be
							returned— But that it must stop there— I was not at home but it seems
							that Lieutenant Monroe, had mistaken his message. I went with M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams this Evening to the wedding party.
							The message was from the Ladies and to <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams—</persRef> But as she in consequence of the conversation with
								<persRef ref="hay-eliza">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Hay</persRef> last week had already given notice to the diplomatic
							corps that they were not to know the President had a daughter married,
							it was finally concluded by <persRef ref="monroe-eliza">M<hi

								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hay to leave things as they are. <persRef

							when he was Secretary of State; and that this increase was prevented, by
							the fixing the Salary at its present rate two years ago at my
							recommendation— I told him I would avail myself of the first opportunity
							when I should see those two Senators to speak to them of the subject.
							Before I reached my Office I met <persRef ref="ervin-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ervin,</persRef> a member of the House
							of Representatives from South-Carolina, who had been to the Office to
							enquire for certain papers, relating to the trade between the United

							to-morrow. <persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G.
								Hay</persRef> was at the Office to ask for English Newspapers this
							day received <pb type="ms" n="285"/>with a budget of despatches— An
							account preceding the Mail from New-York, announced the arrival there of
							a vessel from Liverpool, bringing the intelligence of the death of the
							British King, <persRef ref="george-iii">George the third</persRef>, and
							of the <persRef ref="edward">Duke of Kent.</persRef> It had first been
							known here yesterday. The papers this day received confirmed it— The
							Duke of Kent died on the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of January,
							and the King the 29<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of the same month—
							George the third had reigned sixteen years, the Sovereign of this
							Country— I suppose there are about a half a million of souls in this
							union who were once his Subjects— Four fifths of that number; born his
							Subjects—of whom I was one. The forty-fourth year is revolving, since
							the People of North America cast off their allegiance to him and
							declared their Independence. Of the 56 signers of that instrument only
							four are at this day numbered among the living. <persRef

							Carrollton, Maryland— The last ten years of the Life of George the third
							he has been kept in confinement at Windsor, in a state of mental
							alienation; blind and perhaps deaf. Imagination can scarcely conceive a
							state of existence more calamitous or a contrast more awful of the
							extremes of human grandeur and debasement in one person. George the
							third was a man of good but ordinary capacity, possessed of many private
							virtues and no vices, but those incident to a royal education. His reign
							has been a most tempestuous period in the history of the civilized
							world. His influence over it has been negative and inauspicious. As the
							great head and champion of the cause of existing institutions, against
							all innovation, he has contributed to perpetuate abuses of the most
							pernicious character, to recement with human blood the ruinous and
							perishing edifice of feudality, and to prolong the deadly struggle
							between the absurd and artificial distinctions of hereditary rank, and
							the tendencies of the age to the common level of democracy— The papers
							this day received give accounts also of a mutiny of troops in Spain,
							which were destined to South-America, and the consequences of which must
							be momentous. <persRef ref="dana-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							that he Otis would wish to supplant any man, but because Maury is an old
							man, and that the business of his Office is, and for some time has been
							transacted by his Clerk, who is an Englishman— There is something so
							gross, and so repugnant to my feelings, in this cormorant appetite for
							office, this barefaced and repeated effort to get an old and meritorious
							public servant turned out of place, by a bankrupt to get into it, that
							it needed all my sense of the allowances to be made for sharp want and
							of the tenderness due to misfortune to suppress my indignation. He asked
							me, if I would advise him to press these Considerations personally upon
							the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, to which I barely
							answered no. He said he had asked <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jonathan Russell,</persRef> his
							opinion whether it would be indelicate to suggest them, and Russell had
							told him they were facts, which there could be no impropriety in
							stating. This is not the first sample I have had of Russell’s morals,
							connected with the pursuit of office. Otis is an Office-hunter equally
							ravenous: and like some other ravenous animals has the gifts of fawning
							and of tears— But even with such persons no passionate manifestation of
							Sentiment should be indulged; and this is the only way that I can
							understand as consistent, the scriptural injunction “be ye angry and sin
							not.” <persRef ref="percival-john">Lieutenant Percival</persRef> came
							also to the Office. A man, by the name of <persRef ref="boughan-r"
								>Boughan</persRef>, has been urgently recommended by several very
							respectable persons, including members of Congress, for the appointment
							of Consul or Commercial agent at Valparaiso in Chili; and a Commission
							for him was already prepared. Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Percival gave this Morning to the President such information concerning
							him, and his conduct at Valparaiso, that the President desired him to
							come and state the facts to me, which he did. The substance of it was
							that Boughan went to Valparaiso as Supercargo, of a vessel belonging to
							Baltimore, and that he defrauded his owner. There were other things less
							obnoxious but not creditable, and altogether Percival said that Boughan
							had lost all reputation with all his Countrymen there— He added that he
							was not desirous of being known as having given this information, but if
							it was necessary that his name should be given he should not wish to
							withhold it. I asked him to put the substance of what he had told me in
							writing, as it might be necessary to have it upon file, and that his
							name should not be given unless there should be a necessity for it— He
							promised to write as requested— I this day <pb type="ms" n="287"
							/>received from <persRef ref="forsyth-john">J. Forsyth,</persRef> a
							despatch of 3. January, with a Postscript of the 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> The Russian Charge d’Affaires had
							interposed to prevail upon Forsyth not to leave Madrid, as he had
							threatened. A few days since I received a despatch from <persRef
								ref="campbell-george">G. W. Campbell</persRef>, reporting an
							interview, with <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl">Count
								Nesselrode,</persRef> the Russian Minister of foreign Affairs, in
							which the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef> solicitude for
							the amicable arrangement of our differences with Spain was manifested;
							and <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">Poletica</persRef>, has shewn and
							read to me extracts of a despatch from Nesselrode, and of private
							Letters from <persRef ref="kapodistrias-john">Capodistrias</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="pozzodiborgo-carlo">Pozzo di Borgo</persRef> to him
							expressing the same Sentiments, and earnestly dissuading us from taking
							measures of self-satisfaction— <persRef ref="gallatin-albert"
								>Gallatin’s</persRef> despatches indicate the same wishes, and
							advice from the French Government— I took Forsyth’s despatch to the
							President, and suggested to him the question, whether it would not be
							advisable to send a Message to Congress, communicating these facts and
							documents, and recommending to them, to postpone acting upon the Florida
							questions till the next Session. The motives for this measure are
							various, and among the rest is that of changing the position of the
							Executive in reference to the Legislature— It has become very awkward—
							Before the Florida Treaty was signed, <persRef ref="clay-henry"
								>Clay’s</persRef> tactics were to push the Executive if possible
							into a quarrel with Spain. As he did not play his game very skilfully,
							his impetuosity contributed to promote the conclusion of the Treaty.
							Without involving the Executive, as he intended, it alarmed Spain, and
							gave us argument to bring her to reasonable terms. When the Treaty was
							signed it was so generally considered as highly advantageous to the
							United States, that it was considered very creditable to the
							Administration, and Clay though he betrayed his ill-will to it, yet
							dared not make any opposition against it. As soon as the question about
							the grants arose, Clay seized upon it as a means of defeating the
							Treaty. Spain by withholding the ratification beyond the stipulated
							period has thrown away the bargain, and the United States are no longer
							bound to abide by it. In the course of the discussion with Spain, it
							became necessary to shew, that <persRef ref="onis-luis">Onis’s</persRef>
							instructions authorized him to have conceded more than he did. Upon
							which Clay immediately argues that more was conceded than Onis asked. At
							the commencement of the Session the President proposed that a
							discretionary power should be given to the Executive to take possession
							of Florida, and to indemnify the Claimants upon Spain, as if the Treaty
							had been ratified, from the Florida Lands— The house manifested no
							disposition, to comply with this proposal, and the Committee of Foreign
							Relations brought in a Report, requiring positively that Florida should
							be taken, and leaving the Claims totally unprovided for. Clay’s
							professed project was to set the Treaty aside; to take the Province of
							Texas, and recognize the South-Americans; his real object was merely to
							defeat the Treaty, and do nothing. It has long been obvious that
							Congress would do nothing, and the danger to the Executive is, that by
							that termination of doing nothing the appearance to the world will be of
							dissension between the Executive and Legislature—the worst of all
							possible positions for negotiating with the Spaniard when he comes— In
							the mean time the Missouri question and its compromise have sharpened
							the greediness of the Southern interest for more Southern-Territories,
							to make more slave States, and given the Northern and Eastern interest a
							distaste even for Florida, because that would become another Slave
							State— The new disturbances in Spain also threaten a revolution of the
							Government there; and put an end to all question as to the issue of the
							revolution in South America— The only powerful interest therefore that
							Spain had for settling her differences with us, is disappearing. There
							is no prospect of the Ratification of the Treaty, and there is at this
							moment scarcely any great interest in this Country that desires its
							ratification— Forsyth in his despatches says that probably the Spanish
							Government wishes that we may take possession of Florida, for the sake
							of having stronger ground for insisting on the confirmation of the
							grants, and the proposal of the Committee of foreign relations falls
							into this view, as completely as if it had been drawn up by the <persRef
								ref="alagon-unknown">Duke of Alagon</persRef> himself. I suggested
							most of these Considerations to the President as motives for a Message
							to Congress proposing to postpone measures of reprizal for the present—
							As this will unquestionably be the result, it will shew the Executive
							and Legislature as at least not in direct opposition to each other— It
							will be an example of moderation and magnanimity to Spain in the time of
							her distress: of deference and regard to the wishes and advice of
							Russia, and France; and of sound policy as relate to the internal state
							of our affairs— The President appeared to <pb type="ms" n="288"/>concur
							in these opinions generally, and asked me to put in writing such of them
							as I might think of particular Moment, and to see him again on the
							subject next Monday— I was much engaged all the Evening at home.</p>

								<persRef ref="mccormick-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Cormick’s.</persRef> He read the service for the fifth Sunday in
							Lent, and preached from IX Mark 43–48. enjoining that the offending hand
							or foot should be cut off, and the offending eye plucked out— Like all
							the Sermons which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Cormick reads, this
							discourse was sensible, ingenious and well written. Sound morals,
							without doctrinal speculation, and without enthusiasm. This text and the
							context from the 33<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> verse to the end of
							the Chapter afford an admirable theme for contemplation, upon the
							Christian morality, and the duty of suppressing envious emulation: for
							it is the discourse of Jesus upon the question which arose among his
							disciples, who should be greatest. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							M’Cormick’s Sermon did not consider it in this light— It generalized the
							precepts of the text— But this injunction thrice repeated, to sacrifice
							the most precious and useful members of ones own body, rather than
							retain them, and go to hell, where their worm dieth not, and the fire is
							not quenched— This sacrifice to be salted with fire; concluding with the
							command, Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another; what
							is it but the proof of the deep solemnity with which the founder of the
							Christian system warned his disciples, against the passion of self
							aggrandizement. And what admirable illustrations of the torment of
							envious ambition are the worm that never dies, and the unquenchable
							fire: How appropriate then, the charge to cut off ones own hand or foot,
							and pluck out ones own eye, the prompters to usurping desires to rise
							above our equals, rather than indulge their propensities of
							encroachment— These are diseases in which the patient must administer to
							himself— It is himself that his hand or his foot or his eye offends when
							it urges him to aspire above his peers; It is from himself that the
							controul over these ravenous Passions must proceed— The hand, the foot
							and the eye were given to man, to provide for the necessities of his own
							nature, and not to enable him to Lord it over others; and when forsaking
							their natural uses, they are employed to raise dominion over equal
							brethren, and to seek or wield the rod of oppression, the time is come
							when they ought to be severed from the body to which they belong, by its
							own act, and cast away— At this moment I see the worm that never dies,
							at work, and the fire that is not quenched is burning— But I must
							forbear— I called after Church at the lodgings of<persRef

							and voted for it on condition that another member who had voted against
							the fixing of this District as the permanent residence of Congress
							should also come round and vote for it. This was one of the compromises

							Session. It referred to the despatches last received from <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">J. Forsyth</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="campbell-george">G. W. Campbell</persRef>— To the interposition
							of the Russian Charge <pb type="ms" n="289"/>d’Affaires at Madrid, to
							prevail upon Forsyth not to go away as he had threatened and intended—
							To the good offices of Russia and France, and Great-Britain to induce
							the ratification of the Treaty by Spain— To the wishes expressed by them
							both that the United States should take no measure of reprizal, at least
							without first waiting for the Spanish Minister, who is to come and ask
							for explanations—and to the distressed situation of Spain, which makes
							forbearance the dictate of a magnanimous policy; concluding with the
							remark that our position for asserting our right by our own force will
							not be impaired by the proposed delay. Crawford declared himself in
							favour of the measure more frankly and explicitly than I expected;
							though he saw and with us all remarked, that it was subject to much
							misconception and misrepresentation. Wirt’s opinion as usual, was not
							opposed to that of the President; the only objector, and quite to my
							surprize was Calhoun— First he said it was a change of ground, from what
							the President had recommended at the commencement of the Session; for
							which change, neither the interposition of Russia and France, nor their
							wishes, nor the new distresses of Spain afforded sufficient motives— The
							dispositions and wishes of Russia were indeed not so strongly marked in
							the despatch from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell, as in the
							Letters from <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl">Count Nesselrode</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="kapodistrias-john">Capodistrias</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="pozzodiborgo-carlo">Pozza di Borgo</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="poletica-pierre">Poletica</persRef>, which he had
							confidentially read to me, but which could not be communicated to
							Congress, and which rested only upon my report. The popular feeling
							would be jealous of every appearance of yielding to the interference of
							any foreign power, and any expression of compassion for the distressed
							Condition of Spain might be understood as discountenancing the
							insurrection, which has lately broken out in the expeditionary army near
							Cadix, which ought most cautiously to be avoided— That as to any
							compassion for Spain we were neither bound to feel it; nor should we get
							credit for it if we did— Instead of a motive to forbearance, the new
							difficulties of the Spanish Government rather should confirm us in the
							purpose of doing Justice to ourselves, as it took at once from Spain
							both the power of resistance and the disposition of resentment against
							us. Calhoun after enlarging in this strain of argument, still professed
							to submit these ideas with diffidence. Crawford replied; admitting that
							they were of great weight—but said that although there might be great
							objections to avowing publicly any deference for the wishes and opinions
							of other Powers, yet it was wise and proper to shew such deference— It
							was with Nations as with individuals— A man might profess to be
							perfectly independent, and to set at nought the opinions and wishes of
							others; but he could not get along without soon finding the
							inconvenience to himself of such a system. And so with Nations— However
							sturdily they may adhere to their Independence, they will not find it
							good policy to set the opinions and wishes of other Nations at defiance—
							He also thought the distressed condition of the Spanish Government, was
							a circumstance of considerable weight to urge forbearance on our part—
							He knew it was the feeling of several members of Congress, and named
							particularly <persRef ref="walker-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Walker</persRef> of Alabama, as having expressed the Sentiment to
							him— I added that this motive appeared to me to be of great power—
							Perhaps of itself sufficient to justify the whole change— As a real
							motive it was magnanimous, and true magnanimity was in my opinion the
							highest wisdom of a Nation— Nor had I any doubt that we should get some
							credit for it—not indeed in the opinions or acknowledgment of our
							envious enemies; but in that of all those who are disposed to befriend
							us— So too we should get credit from Russia and France for manifesting
							and avowing a deference for their opinions and wishes. They could have
							no motive for disbelieving us, and as it would flatter them in the
							estimate of their own importance, they would easily give credence to our
							assertion. The general disposition of the Power towards us, and the
							particular Spirit with which their wishes were manifested, were also
							very material in estimating the propriety of conciliating them with
							compliance— The general disposition of France and Russia towards us, was
							friendly— Their wishes were that Spain should do us justice and ratify
							the Treaty. Their advice to us was in favour of Peace—of our own Peace,
							with Spain, and of the general Peace of Europe, in which they are all
							interested.— There was a material difference between a wish manifested
							by such a power, and in such a manner, and the wish of a malevolent
							power, expressed in a dictatorial or menacing manner— To such a
							manifestation I would not only shew no deference, but would at once meet
							it with the most determined resistance. Calhoun readily admitted this
							difference— I said that as to a change of policy on the part of the
							Executive, there was in reality none. The President had recommended <pb
								type="ms" n="290"/>at the commencement of the Session, that a
							discretionary power should be given to take Florida, and indemnify the
							Claimants as the Treaty had provided; but to wait for the <persRef
								ref="vives-don">Minister</persRef> who is to come for explanations,
							if he should arrive during the Session of Congress— But Congress had not
							given that discretionary power; the minister had not arrived, but
							Forsyth says, may be expected in May, and <persRef ref="gallatin-albert"
								>Gallatin</persRef> says, not till after the close of the Session of
							Congress— The Committee of foreign Relations have reported a Bill,
							positively requiring the President to take possession of Florida;
							admitting in their Report that in that case the contested Grants will
							all be good against the United States, and proposing to look westward of
							the Sabine for future satisfaction of the claims. Forsyth intimates as
							probable that this is precisely what the Spanish Government wishes. That
							we should take possession; and thus strengthen their claim to the
							confirmation of the grants— If the Bill proposed by the Committee of
							Foreign Relations passes, it will play the game into the hands of Spain—
							If it fails, Congress will do nothing; but the Session will terminate
							leaving to the world, and to the expected Spanish negotiator, the
							appearance of disagreement between the Executive and the Legislature. A
							disagreement too after long and violent debates, which cannot fail to
							arise on the proposed Bill— The debates may perhaps take place,
							notwithstanding the message should be sent; but the vote in the end,
							will agree with the President’s recommendation— The Executive and
							Legislature will harmonize together, and all our resources for
							negotiation with the coming Spaniard will remain unimpaired. These
							arguments, entirely decisive to my mind were not satisfactory to
							Calhoun; he seemed apprehensive that the Executive would come in
							collision with the Committee of foreign Relations; and there was some
							question whether the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> of
							Russia himself would be pleased to have his name used in the Message—
							The President finally determined that I should take the draft of the
							Message, and shew it to <persRef ref="lowndes-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowndes</persRef> the Chairman of the
							Committee of foreign Relations, and to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Poletica the Russian Minister; and after hearing their opinions of the
							measure, it should be determined by another administration meeting,
							whether the Message should be sent or not— The news came this day of the
							Assassination of the <persRef ref="berri-charles">Duke de
								Bèrri</persRef> on the 13<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of
							February; an event by which <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi

								ref="wheeler-luke">her father</persRef> who is with her in suspense
							as long as possible— Wyer, who had seen Decatur told me that he could
							not survive the day— He died between nine and ten O’Clock this Evening.
							The Nation has lost in him one of its heroes— One who has illustrated
							its History and given grace and dignity to its character in the eyes of
							the world. He was warm-hearted, cheerful, unassuming, gentle in
							deportment, friendly and hospitable; beloved in social life; with a soul
							all devoted to his Country, and a sense of honour; too disdainful of
							life, since it could not attain that highest summit of magnaminity which
							deliberately refuses the guilt and exposure of private War. He has
							fallen in a duel, and his dying breath was a sigh, of compunction that
							it was not in his Country’s cause— The sensation in this City and
							neighbourhood produced by this Catastrophe was unusually great. But the
							Lamentations at the practice of duelling were and will be fruitless as
							they always are— <persRef ref="forbes-john">Forbes</persRef> called at
							my house this Evening; he had been sitting an hour with Barron, who is
							at <persRef ref="beale-unknown">Beale’s</persRef> Congress Hotel on
							Capitol Hill. He has a Ball in his body; which spared his life, by
							hitting and glancing from the hip-bone. The cause of the duel is said to
							have been Decatur’s resistance, as one of the Commissioners of the Navy,
							to the restoration of Barron to the Naval Service— Barron had been
							suspended for five years from 1807. by the sentence of a Court-Martial,
							of which Decatur was a member, for the <pb type="ms" n="291"
							/>unfortunate affair of the Chesapeake Frigate with <persRef
								ref="berkeley-george2">Berkley’s</persRef> Squadron— The five years
							expired, during our late War with Great Britain. Barron was then in
							Europe, and did not return to the United States during our War with G.
							B. though he made application for a passage in the John Adams, from
							Gothenburg in June 1814. After the Peace he came back, and claimed to be
							restored to active employment: which it is said Decatur prevented him
							from obtaining. He has also spoken of him in slighting and contemptuous
							terms— A Correspondence of mutual crimination and defiance has been
							passing between them since last June; and is now to be published. I left
							at Decatur’s house offers of any service in my power, or in that of
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef>, who also called herself and made the

							the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> intention to send

							to the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> that public
							reference should be made to the sentiments avowed by him, concerning the
							settlement of our differences with Spain. He said he was sure it would
							be entirely satisfactory, and even very gratifying to the Emperor. I

							from <persRef ref="kapodistrias-john">Capodistrias</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="pozzodiborgo-carlo">Pozzo di Borgo</persRef>, which he

							mentioned a singular Letter from <persRef ref="laserna-mateo">La
								Serna</persRef> the Spanish Charge d’Affaires to him complaining
							that I had alledged in a Letter, now published, to the <persRef
								ref="lowndes-william">Chairman of the Committee</persRef> of foreign
							Relations, that we had been told by France and Russia, that in the
							present State of our differences with Spain, all Europe was in our
							favour and against Spain—and with something like <hi rend="italic"
								>niaiserie</hi>, asking him whether he had told me so. La Serna, he
							said had written precisely such another Letter to <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De
								Neuville</persRef>, but had not yet sent it, owing to the Distress
							of De Neuville and his family consequent upon the news of the
							Assassination of the <persRef ref="berri-charles">Duke de
								Berri</persRef>. He said it was easy for him to have answered La
							Serna, that for what he said or wrote he was accountable to his own
							master only; but as they were upon good terms he had answered him that
							he certainly had never arrogated the absurdity of speaking in the name
							of all Europe. And that in the absence of all suggestions of reasons by
							Spain for withholding the ratification of the Treaty, the Emperor would
							very naturally conclude that the Treaty was favorable to Spain, since
							the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">King</persRef> had liberally bestowed
							favours upon every person concerned in the making of it— He said he
							would shew me the Letters to-morrow— <persRef

							I called for him there, and he returned with me to his house. I read to

							Congress upon the Affairs of Spain and Florida; and told him that the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> had directed me to
							consult him with regard to the expediency of sending it. He gave no
							distinct opinion, but from the tenour of his remarks I concluded that
							the Message would rather meet than oppose his views. He said that he was
							prepared to support the Bill reported by the Committee of Foreign
							Relations, though he had no expectation that it would pass; and if the
							Message should be sent, he would wish it to come in soon; before the
							Military Appropriation Bill shall have been finally acted upon: because
							it had very unjustly said in the house, and he had repelled the
							suggestion, that the object of the Report and Bill of the Committee had
							only been to get through the Military Appropriations without
							retrenchment. I observed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowndes, that
							the Report of the Committee appeared to admit that if we should take
							possession of Florida without the ratification of the Treaty we should
							be bound to recognize the contested grants as valid; in which case the
							claims of indemnity would remain totally unprovided for. He admitted
							that the Report might bear that construction, but said it was not
							intended— The intention merely was to signify to Spain, that if by the
							validity of the grants the fund from which the claims <pb type="ms"
								n="292"/>were to be indemnified should fail, we should then look
							Westward of the Sabine for the necessary substitute— <persRef
								ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poletica</persRef> called at my Office, and shewed me again the
							despatch which he has received from <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl">Count

								ref="kapodistrias-john">Capodistrias</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="pozzodiborgo-carlo">Pozzo di Borgo</persRef>, concerning our
							Spanish Affairs— I asked him if he was willing to let me have copies of
							the passages in them, relating to that subject— He said that the
							despatch being public and official, he did not think he could refuse me
							a copy of it; the extracts from the private Letters he should give me in
							confidence— He also shewed me the Letters which have passed between him
							and La Serna, which he had mentioned to me yesterday— After having made
							these communications to Poletica, I thought it necessary to shew the
							same attention to the <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French
								Minister,</persRef> and sent a Note to him, requesting him to call
							at my Office: he came, and I read to him the draft of the Message, with
							which he also declared himself to be highly gratified— At the
							President’s, I informed him of the Sentiments expressed by the French
							and Russian Ministers with regard to the proposed message; and told him
							that I had again seen the despatch and Letters to Poletica, which fully
							warranted what I had said of them— That he had also promised me copies
							of them in confidence— The President said he would then send the message
							without calling another Cabinet Meeting— Calhoun is indeed now detained

							crowded to overflowing— The ceremony was nearly three hours long, and a

							Irish Jesuit, named <persRef ref="kenny-unknown">Father Kenny—</persRef>
							With some peculiarities of manner—rather unpleasant; an occasional
							appearance of choaking as if his words were too big for the passage of
							his throat, an occasional bracing back of his Surplice Sleeves,
							reminding one of a butcher, baring his arms to stick a bullock, his
							language was refined and elegant; his sentiments, pious, benevolent and
							appropriate to the occasion; his notices of the murdered Prince,
							suitable and unaffected, without exaggeration or servility, his
							allusions to the particular incidents of the atrocious crime, ingenious
							and pathetic— He closed however with a professional, and somewhat
							common-place invective against the infidel philosophy of the age— After
							the service was over, I went to my Office; and attended the funeral of
								<persRef ref="decatur-stephen">Decatur</persRef>. There were said to
							be ten thousands persons assembled— An order of procession had been
							announced in the Newspapers, and was inverted at the house. The
							procession walked to Kalorama, where the body was deposited in the
							family vault of the <persRef ref="barlow-joel">Barlow’s</persRef>. A
							very short prayer was made at the vault by <persRef ref="hunter-andrew"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hunter</persRef>, and a volley
							of musketry from a detachment of the Marine Corps, closed the ceremony
							over the earthly remains of a Spirit, as kindly, as generous, and as
							dauntless, as breathed in this Nation or on this Earth. I walked with
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef>. <persRef ref="randolph-john">John
								Randolph</persRef> was there; first walking, then backing his horse;
							then calling for his phaeton; and lastly crowding up to the vault as the
							Coffin was removed into it from the herse— Tricksy humours to make
							himself conspicuous. Yesterday he made a motion in the House of
							Representatives, that the House should adjourn, over this day, to attend
							Decatur’s funeral, and that the members should wear crape, to honour his
							memory. <persRef ref="taylor-john">John W. Taylor</persRef> opposed the
							motion, professing great respect for Decatur’s character; but
							disapproving the manner of his Death— The house rejected Randolph’s
							motion, and one which he immediately afterwards made to adjourn— This
							day he repeated the motion to adjourn to attend the funeral, which was
							again rejected— This feeble and negative censure upon the practice of
							duelling is all that can be obtained from Congress. M<hi

						<p><date>25. V:45.</date> An old man by the name of <persRef
								ref="parsons-thomas">Thomas Parsons</persRef> came to my house this
							Morning, who was sailing master as he said of a vessel called the
							Cicero, in which my late brother <persRef ref="adams-charles"
								>Charles</persRef> in the year 1781. came with <persRef
								ref="jackson-william">Major Jackson</persRef>, from Corunna, and
							Bilbao to Beverley— Parsons supposed, or pretended to suppose that I was
							the person to whom he had at that time resigned his Hammock, and whom he
							had fondled as a child. He thought of course that I should assist him in
							obtaining a pension for which he came here from Newbury-Port, to make
							application— He said he had served in our revolutionary War, from its
							commencement to the latter part of the year 1778, and was in almost all
							the campaigns and battles of that <pb type="ms" n="293"/>time; of which
							he told me many interesting anecdotes. But his narrative was lame about
							the manner of his leaving the army— He says he had a furlough, at the
							end of which there remained only four Months to complete his term of
							enlistment for three years— That he gave almost the whole of his wages
							due to him then, to his <persRef ref="vose-unknown">Captain
								Vose</persRef>, to find a man to serve the rest of his time in his
							stead, and that it was to his utter astonishment and indignation, that
							on applying the summer before last, for a pension, he had been informed
							that he had been returned by Vose as a Deserter— He was now old and
							poor, and had worked his way from Newbury-Port here to see if he could
							not get his Pension— I gave him a minute for the Secretary of War,
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> but am apprehensive
							his case is hopeless. I asked him where he had been living since the
							Peace of 1783; he said at Salem and Newbury-Port; but appeared not
							inclined to tell what he has been doing in the long interval. He seemed
							to remember nothing but the revolutionary War; the latter years of which
							he had passed in privateering— At the Office I had successively visits
							from <persRef ref="otis-george">G. A. Otis</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M.
								Johnson</persRef> and <persRef ref="king-rufus">R. King</persRef>
							the Senator from New-York— Otis has seen and conversed with the <persRef

							and expects to obtain shortly a valuable employment. He is now going to
							Philadelphia, to proceed with his translation of <persRef
								ref="botta-carlo">Botta’s</persRef> History— Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M. Johnson came to inquire, about the
							agencies to South-America. <persRef ref="torres-manuel"
							>Torres</persRef>, and <persRef ref="forsyth-samuel">Forsyth</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="thornton-william">Thornton</persRef>, and <persRef

							his own views, while <persRef ref="worthington-william"
								>Worthington</persRef>, <persRef ref="irvine-baptis">B.
								Irvine</persRef>, and <persRef ref="robinson-william">W. D.
								Robinson</persRef>, are all groping in passages
							underground—continually crossing one another; and all masking interested
							projects under the garb of South-American patriotism. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> King had a conversation with me of two
							hours, upon various public concerns. He says our finances are in a very
							bad condition— Much worse than they have been represented by the
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef>, of whose currency Report as it is called he
							spoke with great contempt. I observed that the Resolution of the House
							of Representatives upon which that report was prepared, had an insidious
							aspect; and had led me to the suspicion that <persRef ref="spencer-john"
								>John C. Spencer</persRef>, a shrewd and warm partizan of <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt Clinton</persRef>, who introduced it,
							had among his motives that of ensnaring Crawford the rival Candidate for
							the future Presidency against Clinton, into the disclosure of some
							doctrine which would affect his popularity. The Report seemed also aware
							of such a design, and its character most strongly marked was that of
							avoiding commitment upon every important question belonging to the
							subject. King said Spencer might have had such an intention, and
							certainly the result had been to shew that Crawford was quite
							incompetent to the emergency to which our fiscal affairs are infallibly
							verging. The only merit of the Report was that it discouraged paper
							money; so far it was good; but it was not a subject upon which a doubt
							could be tolerable— The rest was common-place, culled from the Statistic
							and economic pamphlets of the last century; sometimes by the page at a
							time. Every important point was evaded— Nothing useful or even ingenious
							was proposed— A base metal coinage, questionable in its policy, was the
							only project proposed, and the end would be the indispensable necessity
							of a loan— King talked much also of the contested election, now
							approaching in New-York, between De Witt Clinton, the present Governor,
							for re-election, and <persRef ref="tompkins-daniel">D. D.
								Tompkins</persRef>, now Vice-President, who it seems prefers
							returning to the State Government. Both parties have been anxious to
							obtain the support of King, whose influence it is supposed would carry
							many federal votes. But he avoids taking a decided part in favour of
							either side— The objections against Clinton are political
							tergiversations; intrigues, caballing, and insatiable ambition— Those
							against Tompkins are that his accounts as formerly Governor of New-York
							are unsettled, and that a large balance stands against him for the
							expenditure of which he can produce no vouchers. They are both men of
							Talents, and from early youth have been in a succession of important
							public offices. Clinton supported by an aristocratic name and hereditary
							family influence; and Tompkins by extreme popularity of manners and
							deportment. Tompkins’s politics have always been moderate and
							consistent, Clinton’s have been sometimes violent and always changeable—
							His own aggrandizement has been the only test of his party attachments,
							and he has consequently been a mere man of Coalitions. As private
							character never can pass uninjured through the furnace of political
							contention, they are both charged by their opponents with personal
							intemperance. King, who by his position in the State of New-York has
							been occasionally the rival and antagonist of both has now a delicate
							and difficult course to steer between them. They are both his juniors
								<pb type="ms" n="294"/>as well in age as in public service by at
							least ten years, and both have stood and yet stand in his way. King is
							one of the men who have been held up as Candidates for the Presidency,
							and certainly one of the men the most qualified for it in the Union. He
							has had many vicissitudes of political fortune, ebbs and floods of the
							tide of popularity. He has been more than thirty years in the first line
							of American Statesmen, and lives in continual expectation of a chance
							which may raise him to the summit of our public edifice— It can but be
							favourable to him that Clinton and Tompkins should by their competition
							keep each other down; and would not suit his views to give strength or
							permanency to the triumph of either— One of Clinton’s partizans, some
							months since very indiscreetly boasted that King had expressed himself
							decisively in favour of his re-election— This was immediately denied,
							and was followed by a discussion in the Newspapers, at the close of
							which King authorised a disclaimer of it in the New-York Evening Post.
							On the other hand King told me that the <persRef ref="thompson-smith"
								>Secretary of the Navy</persRef>, whose <persRef
								ref="thompson-gilbert">Son</persRef>, married <persRef
								ref="thompson-arietta">the Vice-President’s eldest
								daughter</persRef>; had solicited him to declare himself in favour
							of Tompkins, which he had declined for two reasons— One because Tompkins
							had not been explicit in his conduct, on the late Slavery question; and
							the other that his accounts ought to be settled before he could stand
							fair as a Candidate for the Office of Governor— King told me also that
							he had last Summer purchased some shares in the U.S. Bank, for the sake
							of assisting them in their difficulties; and had attended the meeting of
							the Stockholders at Philadelphia in November. He intimated that it was
							by his influence that the Meeting had passed off with resolutions
							supporting the course of the President <persRef ref="cheves-langdon">L
								Cheves</persRef>; but that it would still meet with great and many
							difficulties; and said that immediately after his re-election as
							Senator, he had sold out all his Bank Stock again, to be wholly
							unshackled by any private interest in it, while he might be called to
							act upon it in his public station. He thinks as I have long thought that
							the Government is the party most interested in the continuance of the
							Bank, and that the interest of the Stockholders would be to surrender
							their Charter.— I went to the President’s, and took with me, the papers
							furnished me by <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">Poletica</persRef>—
							Copies of the Extracts of Letters to him on our Spanish Affairs— The
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> then asked me,
							whether it would not be better for him to strike out that paragraph of
							the Message which mentioned the wishes expressed by the Russian and
							French Governments that we should abstain from all forcible measures and
							wait to hear the expected <persRef ref="vives-don">Spanish
								Minister</persRef>— I told him that after all the reflection that I
							could give to the subject, my opinion was that it would be best to
							retain the paragraph— It would certainly excite some censure in
							Congress, and some in the Country; but the manifestation of that very
							censure would strengthen the executive in the Negotiation, and have a
							favourable counter-effect in Europe— The interposition was of a
							character justifiable in itself, and the jealousy against it was over
							sensitive— For as a War between us and Spain could scarcely fail to
							kindle a war in Europe which would involve both France and Russia, they
							had a strong interest of their own in the event, which gave them a
							right, at least to advise Peace. The President concluded to retain the
							paragraph, and desired me to have two copies of the Documents to be
							transmitted with the Message, ready to be sent to Congress on Monday.
							And to ascertain from Poletica, whether he was willing that a
							translation of the extract from <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl"
								>Nesselrode’s</persRef> despatch to him should be communicated with
							the other papers— I received this day no Letters from North of
							Baltimore; the mail from Philadelphia to that place having been robbed,
							and the driver murdered, about six miles before reaching it.</p>

						<p><date>27. VI:</date> I had received a Note from <persRef
								ref="brown-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
								Brown</persRef>, Chairman of a Committee of the Senate to whom had
							been referred two Resolutions offered by <persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> King</persRef> of New-York, proposing
							further prohibitions of the commercial intercourse between the
							United-States and the British Colonies, to attend the Committee at ten
							O’Clock, this Morning. I was there accordingly. The Committee consisted
							of Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs: </hi>Brown, <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Barbour</persRef>, <persRef ref="hunter-william"
								>Hunter</persRef>, <persRef ref="macon-nathaniel">Macon</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="walker-freeman">Walker</persRef> of Georgia. The
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> was also there at the request of the Committee,
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King himself attended. The object of
							the Committee was to ask for information with respect to the operation
							of the Navigation Act of April 1818: also concerning the effect of the
							French Tariff of duties upon our shipping; and the opinions of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford and myself upon the expediency of
							extending the prohibitions to the British Colonies which are yet to
							open, and to pass counteracting duties to meet the French oppressive
							discrimination between importations in French or in American Vessels.
							The opinions both of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford and myself
							were in favour of both these measures— There appeared no decided
							aversion to their adoption, in the Committee. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Macon who is a sort of political <persRef
								ref="shandy-walter">Walter Shandy</persRef>, expressed however some
							doubts, whether the people in the United States interested in the trade
							to be affected by the prohibitions, would have the firmness and
							perseverance necessary for allowing them to produce their full effect
							upon the adverse party— That we might rely upon it this effect would not
							be speedily produced. That Great-Britain especially was not going to
							give up in this contest, within one, two, or three years— Great-Britain
							and the other European Powers would wait to see how we should get along
							with our own concerns— During the whole discussion of the Missouri
							question, every one of the Ministers from all the European powers,
							residing here, was attending the debate as constantly as he himself did;
							and he was not absent from it an hour. They were not there for nothing.
							He had no doubt every one of them had reported to his Government what
							had passed; and the consequence would be that Great-Britain and France
							too would be in no haste to yield to us upon any point of difference
							which we have with them— Great-Britain, especially upon commercial
							Affairs was not a yielding Power— Her colonial system was nearly two
							hundred years old— We had been struggling against it ever since the
							acknowledgment of our Independence, and we might be sure we should not
							now bring her to our terms in the course of a few Months— It would be
							better therefore to abandon even the restrictions which we have already
							laid, than to increase them, if after all they will bear upon our own
							people so severely as to disgust them; for in that case we shall <pb
								type="ms" n="296"/>lose character by retracting and shall never be
							able to renew the contest— I concurred entirely with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Macon that we must not expect that either
							France or Great-Britain would soon or easily be brought to terms. That
							their giving up at-all, and in any degree, would depend upon the success
							of our measures, which are and necessarily must be experimental— It was
							however certain that in the case of the Gypsum Laws, Great-Britain had
							yielded completely to a pressure like that now proposed, and if upon the
							trial she should now find it for her interest I had no doubt she would
							yield again. It was true that this conflict had arisen immediately after
							the acknowledgment of our Independence, but it was equally true that we
							had never until now had the opportunity of trying our strength by
							countervailing Laws. The Congress of the Confederation had no authority
							to regulate commerce, and no concurrence of the States could be obtained
							to concert countervailing regulations— Massachusetts attempted a
							Navigation Act, which only threw all her trade into the Ports of the
							neighbouring States— The French Revolution broke out the same year that
							the present Constitution of the United States was adopted— The
							Revolutionary Wars, immediately followed, during which the Colonial
							system of Great-Britain was suspended; and so continued until the Peace
							of 1815. It was then renewed and only since then that we have had
							occasion to oppose it. I then related the substance of a Letter, lately
							received from <persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>, shewing
							that the Navigation Act of 1818. had already produced a considerable
							effect, and was likely to produce still more, and mentioned the Reports
							received from <persRef ref="maury-james">J. Maury</persRef> the Consul
							at Liverpool from which it appears that nearly all our direct trade with
							England is now carried on in American vessels. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Crawford’s information was of the same complection. He was
							asked whether the proposed prohibitions would not have an unfavourable
							effect upon the revenue, and said he thought not. The trade would be
							carried on to as great extent as heretofore; but it would be through the
							medium, of the Swedish or Danish Islands. Some questions were asked as
							to the expediency or practicability of preventing the smuggling trade on
							the Northern frontier, with Canada; but it was supposed it would not be
							considerable; and the prevention of it was considered as hopeless. Some
							difficulties were also anticipated as to the means of preventing frauds
							in the proof of origin of the restricted Articles; but experience
							indicated that this object could be secured to a competent extent by
							regulation. Almost all the papers received at the Departments and
							bearing upon the enquiry, were in the hands of the Chairman of the
							Committee of Commerce of the House of Representatives, who was absent
							from the City, and the papers could not now be obtained— We left the
							Committee in Session, and I went into the House of Representatives,
							where they were debating at the third reading <persRef
								ref="pindall-james">Pindall’s</persRef> bill for reducing to
							twenty-five the number of newspapers in which the Laws are to be
							printed— The question upon the passage of the Bill was taken by yeas and
							nays, and carried 79 to 77. the Clerk had recorded the votes 77 to 79.
							but two of the members who had been entered in the negative changed
							their votes— While I was there, the Message from the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> upon Spanish Affairs and
							Florida was brought in and read. <persRef ref="hay-george">G.
								Hay</persRef> was sitting by my side— <persRef ref="archer-william"
								>Archer</persRef> the new Member from Virginia, immediately came up
							to me and asked, whether if Spain should now ratify the Treaty, it would
							not be necessary to have it laid again before the Senate— I said I
							supposed not. He said he was sorry for it— In his opinion it was the
							worst Treaty this Country had ever made— Hay asked him why? Because we
							should get by it nothing but Florida, and gave away for it a Country
							worth fifty times as much— I asked him if he had examined the validity
							of our title to the valuable country of which he spoke— He said no— I
							told him he would find it weak; and rather a claim than a title— Hay
							said that there had been on our side a strong argument and a weak title—
							Archer did not reply. The House soon after adjourned, and I went to my
							Office, but found it already shut— After a short call at the President’s
							I came home. <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> had a high
							fever, with delirium great part of last Night, and continued very ill
							the whole of this day. <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r </hi>Huntt</persRef> was here and
							prescribed for him, morning and evening—he apprehends no danger in the
							case, but says it may continue long, and is excessively painful in its
							severity. <persRef ref="caldwell-elias">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								E. B. Caldwell</persRef> was here this morning. I asked him
							something about a very extraordinary sally of <persRef
								ref="johnson-william">Judge Johnson’s</persRef> on the Bench, at the
							close of the late Session of the Supreme Court here, in which he had
							indulged himself in sharp reflections upon the Executive Government, the
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">Attorney General,</persRef> and among
							others upon me— He spoke it was said in great passion, and threatened to
							publish his speech; but afterwards thought better of it— Caldwell said
							that he had not remarked in it, any allusion to me, and if there was any
							it had been in very general terms as the Council on both sides in the
							argument had referred to an opinion said to have been expressed by me on
							the question at issue— This Judge Johnson is a man of considerable
							talents and Law knowledge; but a restless, <pb type="ms" n="297"
							/>turbulent, hot-headed, politician, caballing judge. He has been an
							ardent canvasser for Crawford, and though a Judge flaringly independent,
							a place hunter for himself and <persRef ref="johnson-james2">his
								brother,</persRef> a carpenter in Charleston— He obtained through
							Crawford’s influence the appointment of Collector for the Port of
							Charleston, kept it two or three Months in doubt whether he would accept
							it or not and then declined, attempting to bargain his brother into it,
							in his place— This is the man whose judicial virtue is so much alarmed
							at the suspicion of executive interference with his duties—Termagant
							virtue!</p>

							made him an offer, and upon which he is to call here again to-morrow
							Morning— He also told me an amusing anecdote of <persRef
								ref="pinckney-charles2">Charles Pinckney’s</persRef> being
							discovered last Sunday among the Ephesians at Georgetown. At the Office
							I had visits from <persRef ref="torres-manuel">Manuel Torres</persRef>
							who now styles himself Charge d’Affaires from the Republic of Colombia,
							and who came for an answer to his Memoir asking for a sale of arms upon
							credit to the Government of his Country— He told me that he expected
							here every day <persRef ref="zea-francisco">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Zea</persRef>, the Vice-President of the Republic with
								<persRef ref="salazar-jose">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Salazar</persRef>, both men of great merit— That Zea had important
							proposals to make to the Government of the United States— That he would
							shew there was a good understanding and concert, between the Government
							of Colombia, and the leaders of the Insurrection now prevalent in Spain—
							It would be proved by Letters from the organic revolutionary Committee
							residing at Gibraltar. He said also that he supposed <persRef
								ref="bolivar-simon">Bolivar</persRef> and the Patriots had by this
							time possession of Carthagena, and that <persRef ref="morillo-pablo"
								>Morillo</persRef> had been obliged to abandon the Country— In which
							case he further predicted that the Revolution would again appear
							triumphant in Mexico, with the <persRef ref="apodaca-juan">Viceroy
								Apodaca</persRef>, himself at its head— It is likely there is in all
							this some exaggeration, but the Union of Venezuela and New-Grenada
							certainly now presents the most remarkable and most powerful of the
							revolutionary South-American Governments. I told Torres that I would
							take the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> directions
							and send him an answer to his Memoir; but that to deal candidly with him
							I apprehended there was a want of authority in the Executive Government
							to dispose of arms belonging to the Public; to the purposes for which he
							wanted them; without the sanction of Congress— He appeared to be fully
							aware of this objection and to have expected it. He said he only wanted
							an answer to send to his Government— I repeated to the President the
							substance of what Torres had told me, and he determined to take the
							opinion of all the members of the administration, upon the proposal for
							the purchase of arms, and desired me to notify a Meeting at his house
							to-morrow at one O’Clock. <persRef ref="partridge-alden">Captain
								Partridge</persRef> was also at my Office, and his object was to
							urge the necessity of continuing the agent to the Commission under the
								5<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>Article of the Treaty of Ghent—
							Under the 6<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>and 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th. </hi>Articles, <persRef ref="hawkins-samuel">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l. </hi>Hawkins</persRef> has been worse than
							useless, and the expenditure for his salary and contingencies has really
							been a waste of public money. Congress have been long dissatisfied with
							the management of that Commission, and they have now struck out of the
							general appropriation Bill, the sum estimated for the Salaries of the
							Agents under both the Commissions. Partridge came to say that he had
							himself been employed last Summer in the Surveys, of the Commission
							under the 5<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>Article; and that the surveys
							of the agent, <persRef ref="bradley-william2">Bradley</persRef> had been
							and would continue to be highly important— That the Commissioners would
							be called to decide which of two positions was the place described in
							the Treaty of 1783. as the highlands, dividing the waters that flow in
							to the Atlantic, from the waters that flow into the S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Laurence— That this would be a subject of
							argument and discussion before the Commissioners for which Bradley had
							made laborious preparation— The question too whether Rouse’s Point is in
							the State of New-York or in Canada is another object to be settled upon
							argument by that Commission. I mentioned all this to the President who
							requested me to see the Chairman of the Committee of the Senate to whom
							the general Appropriation Bill is referred, and to obtain the
							restoration at least of the item for the Salary of the Agent to the
							Commission under the 5<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>Article—and if

							who was this Evening at my house— There were only three other gentlemen

								Ironside’s</persRef> school which he requested me to attend— But I
							was obliged to excuse both myself and Charles. This Morning <persRef
								ref="tyler-benjamin">B. O. Tyler</persRef> came with his Deed of the
							Square 592 which I had agreed to purchase of him; and as he had here his
							Carry-all (Carriole) I went with him and found that Square. There was a

							name was <persRef ref="pomphrey-james">Pomphrey</persRef>, and that he
							had rented this Square with two or three others for several years of
								<persRef ref="brent-robert">Robert Brent jun<hi rend="superscript"

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pearson</persRef>. They told him he
							had a Deed of the Land from the <persRef ref="smallwood-samuel">Mayor of
								the City</persRef> and had sold it to me. At this information he
							appeared uneasy; but I told him that at all events I would give him no
							trouble, and if I should finally become the owner of the Land, I would
							agree to any equitable arrangement by which, he should pay me the
							proportion of the rent for this year, which the Square bears to the
							whole parcel rented by him. I returned Tyler his Deed till we can
							ascertain by what claim Brent jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> and
							Pearson rent it; and by what right it was sold to Tyler for the taxes—
							After calling at my Office, I attended at one O’Clock the Meeting of the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>. Mess<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi><persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford</persRef>, <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="thompson-smith">Thompson</persRef>, the Secretary of

							procession at <persRef ref="decatur-stephen">Decatur’s</persRef>
							funeral— <persRef ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef> was not at the
							Meeting this day; being confined, unwell at home. The President proposed
							for consideration the question, upon the proposal of <persRef
								ref="torres-manuel">Manual Torres</persRef>, that the Government
							should sell upon credit to the Republic of Colombia, any number short of
							twenty thousand Stand of Arms, to enable them to extend the
							South-American Revolution into Peru and Mexico— By one of those
							Back-stair proceedings which I often feel, without seeing, a Report has
							been made from the Ordinance department to the Secretary of War, just at
							the critical moment, that there are some thousand stand of English arms,
							which might, with advantage to the public service, be sold— In all this
								<persRef ref="mason-john">General Mason</persRef> of Georgetown, and
								<persRef ref="bomford-george">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Bomford</persRef> of the Ordnance department have some concern— At
							first it was said there were eight thousand Stand; then it was reduced
							to four, and now Calhoun says, not more than two thousand— <persRef
								ref="duane-william">Duane</persRef>, knew all this when he wrote his
							place-hunting Letters to <persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M. Johnson</persRef>, for he wants
							to smuggle a commission of five per cent out of the transaction for
							himself— To this complection ninety-nine hundredths of the
							South-American Patriotism, which has for three years been flaunting in
							such gorgeous colours in this Country must come at last— Well— The
							question was first discussed whether the Executive could sell at-all,
							without a special authority from Congress, arms, belonging to the
							Public. This was principally between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford, and M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Calhoun— The right of the
							Executive to sell was maintained by Calhoun, entirely upon the ground of
							usage, and yet he adduced no well authenticated precedent of a sale
							without a special authority by Law— This conversation came to no
							determinate result— There was reference to a certain <hi rend="italic"
								>loan</hi> of gunpowder, which was made by this same Ordnance
							Department in 1816. which was afterwards worked into an exchange; then
							into a purchase and finally became a total loss to the public; and it
							actually went to these same South-Americans, who with the richest mines
							in the world, now want arms upon credit, and offer to furnish specie
							hereafter; for arms to be delivered now— This gunpowder plot shews to be
							sure how the Executive may dispose of public ammunition—and why not
							arms?—without authority from Congress— But unluckily, during this very
							Session this <hi rend="italic">loan</hi> of gunpowder has been made a
							subject of enquiry by Congress, and although no vote of censure has
							passed upon it, it has left a slimy track of public opinion behind— Just
							upon the back of this detection it would not be safe to make an
							experiment of selling upon credit, arms to carry the South-American
							Revolution into Peru and Mexico. There was a strong wish expressed by
							Calhoun and Thompson, that we might furnish these arms if we could—
							Crawford was less explicit, and more shy— I gave no opinion, till
							directly appealed to by him—observing that it was a question
							particularly involving the Foreign Relations, and of the resort of the
							Department of State— What says M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Adams? I
							said there was no hesitation in my Mind— To supply the arms professedly
							for the purpose set forth in the Memorial of Torres would be a direct
							departure from neutrality; an act of absolute hostility to Spain, for
							which the Executive was not competent by the Constitution, without the
							authority of Congress— This was enough for me— But I would go no
							further— It would in my opinion be not only an act of War, but of
							wrongful and dishonourable War; committed in the midst of professions of
							neutrality— It would also be as impolite, as wrongful and
							unconstitutional— Neutrality to foreign Wars had from the establishment
							of the Constitution of the United States, been justly and wisely fixed
							as the permanent policy of this Nation— It was of the utmost importance
							to adhere inflexibly to that system— Between it, and that of mingling in
							every European National War, I saw no middle term; and if we once
							departed from it I saw no other prospect for this nation than a career
							of washing their blood-stained hands in blood, upon every principle
							therefore of right, <pb type="ms" n="299"/>of Justice, of Policy and of
							Humanity, I was opposed to the measure— There was thenceforth not a word
							said in its favour— Crawford intimated to me that he did not agree with
							me as to its being an act of War. Thompson asked him, what he would say
							if the same application should be made by the other party—Spain—to which
							he replied laughing that he should certainly reject it— At all Events he
							said it was a measure not expedient to be taken without the concurrence
							of the Legislature— Calhoun was most struck with the Constitutional
							difficulty, and thought the refusal ought to be put upon that point— The
							decision was unanimous that the proposal could not be complied with, and
							I am to answer M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torres accordingly. A
							remark that I have occasion frequently to make is that <hi rend="italic"
								>moral</hi> considerations seldom appear to have much weight in the
							minds of our Statesmen, unless connected with popular feelings. The
							dishonourable feature of giving secret aid to the revolutionists while
							openly professing neutrality, was barely not denied— The President
							admits it. No one else seems to think it ought to stand in the way of
							measures otherwise expedient, especially if supported by popular
							prejudice. My own deliberate opinion is, that the more of pure moral
							principle is carried into the policy and conduct of a Government, the
							wiser and more profound will that policy be. If it is not the uniform
							course of human events that virtue should be crowned with success, it is
							at least the uniform will of Heaven, that virtue should be the duty of
							man— There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked:— Time and
							Chance happeneth to them all. So says divine Revelation, and so proves
							constant experience— The path of virtue is indeed not always clear; and
							in the complication of human affairs, artifice and simulation itself
							must occasionally be practised— The sternest moralists allow it in time
							of War and there may perhaps be occasions when it is justifiable in
							contemplation of War, or defensively against deceptions of the same
							kind— But it may I believe be laid down as an universal maxim, that <hi
								rend="italic">fraud</hi> is never justifiable, where <hi
								rend="italic">force</hi> would not be equally justifiable to effect
							the same object. Fraud is therefore a weapon essentially belonging to
							the relations of War; and in them to be very sparingly resorted to; for
							every instance of it, even when justifiable, tends when discovered to
							impair the confidence of mankind, in the sincerity and integrity of him
							who uses it— I passed this Evening at home—</p>

						<p><date>30. V:45.</date> It was this Morning instead of yesterday that I
							went with <persRef ref="tyler-benjamin">Tyler</persRef> to the Square
							592. At the Office. Visits from the <persRef
								ref="goupydequabeck-alexander">Viscount de Quabeck</persRef>, Charge
							d’Affaires from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and from <persRef
								ref="forsyth-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S. D.
								Forsyth,</persRef> the ambidexter personage, who is a sort of agent
							here from Venezuela, and has been winding up-stairs here to get
							appointed agent from the United States, to that Country. Quabeck came to
							tell me, that he had received from his Government, permission of absence
							till the next Session of Congress. That he was desirous of obtaining an
							Audience of the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> to take
							leave— He added that as he was to return here before the next Winter,
							the <persRef ref="william-i">king</persRef> had not thought it necessary
							to appoint any person to act in his stead during his absence— And that
							on taking leave, he was charged to express the regret of his Government,
							at the perseverance of the representations made in their name, in behalf
							of claims for which the kings Government thinks it ought not to be
							responsible. I observed that the discussion of these claims had been
							hitherto entirely carried on in Europe; and I did not suppose his
							Government had directed him to enter into the merits of them with me. He
							said, certainly not— I then remarked that it was the earnest desire of
							this Government to maintain the most friendly relations with that of the
							Netherlands, and to do every thing that could manifest in the most
							unequivocal manner, that disposition— But it had also obligations of
							duty towards our own citizens which it could not neglect; that it
							considered the claims of those for whom it had applied to the King of
							the Netherlands, as just, and undeniable— It had entertained the hope
							that they would ultimately be so considered by the king himself—that we
							should not incline to press them with unsuitable importunity; but that
							relying upon their justice, and hoping that they would finally be
							recognized and satisfied, they could by no means consent to abandon
							them— He said there was and could be no question of the injustice which
							our Citizens who brought forward these claims had suffered— It was plain
							downright robbery— But then it had been perpetrated by the universal
							robber— In ordinary times, and under the usual Law of Nations a
							Government was answerable for the wrongs of its predecessors; but the
							present condition of Europe, presented a case sui generis, to which
							ordinary principles could not apply— The Government and people of the
							Netherlands were among the first and greatest victims of <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Bonaparte</persRef>— They had been
							themselves, <pb type="ms" n="300"/>robbed and plundered by the same
							party, till they had scarcely any thing left. It would be too much to be
							obliged to put up with their own losses, and to make good those of
							others too. His duty was however discharged, and he should communicate
							faithfully to his Government the observations that I had just made to
							him— Forsyth, before calling upon me, had been with the President, from
							whom while he was with me I received a note, concerning him— This note
							requested me to furnish Forsyth with a spare copy of <persRef
								ref="waite-thomas">Waite’s</persRef> State papers and of <persRef
								ref="niles-hezekiah">Niles’s</persRef> Register— To give him a
							Letter of recommendation or Certificate of approbation for <persRef
								ref="bolivar-simon">Bolivar</persRef>, and if possible to give him
							some agency for the recovery of the claims which had been made by
								<persRef ref="irvine-baptis">B. Irvine</persRef> and afterwards by
								<persRef ref="perry-oliver">Perry</persRef>— Also to tell him that
								<persRef ref="todd-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Todd</persRef> was appointed the agent to Venezuela— I directed the
							Books to be sent to his lodgings if they could be found in the Office,
							but we were interrupted, before I had told him of the appointment of
							Todd— He told me that he was now about to return to Venezuela, and
							should embark from New-York, with the arms that they have procured. That
							he should go with <persRef ref="torres-manuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Torres</persRef>, the day after tomorrow, first to
							Philadelphia, where he should stay only two or three days, expecting to
							sail this day week. He spoke of the New Republic of Colombia and of
							General Bolivar in a manner suited to give a high opinion of them, and
							as he had not always expressed the same opinions, at least of the man,
							he now accounted for the change. Bolivar has had many vicissitudes of
							Fortune, and his reputation as usually happens has ebbed and flowed with
							his success— His last Summer’s Campaign, was a Spring tide with the Moon
							in Perigee. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsythe thinks that he has
							greatly improved by his experience, that he has learnt virtue in
							adversity— That he is another and now quite a great man— He also thinks
							there is now a stability in the new Republic, which it never had before,
							because all the <hi rend="italic">talented</hi> men of the Country have
							now found their places in the system, and are attached in interest, and
							Fortunes to his success— I told him I should immediately send a written
							answer to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torres, upon which he said he
							wished I could make it not absolutely positive because <persRef
								ref="zea-francisco">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Zea</persRef>,
							the late Vice-President of Venezuela, was coming out as Minister to the
							United States, and he would bring proposals very important, and which
							would deserve great Consideration from this Government. He then repeated
							the intimation that Bolivar was in correspondence and communication,
							with the leaders of the insurrection in Spain, and that there would
							shortly be one in Mexico, with the Vice-roy <persRef ref="apodaca-juan"
								>Apodaca</persRef>, himself at its head. He said <persRef
								ref="gual-pedro">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gual,</persRef> who
							was mortified and ashamed at the part he had taken with <persRef
								ref="mcgregor-gregor">M’Gregor,</persRef> was now sent on a Mission
							to Buenos-Ayres, with a view to negotiate a reconcilement between
								<persRef ref="artigas-jose">Artigas</persRef> with his party, and
							the Buenos-Ayrean Government and <persRef ref="clemente-lino">General
								Clemente</persRef> who on his first return home had been arrested
							for his participation in M’Gregor’s affair, had since been appointed
							Governor of the Island of Margaritta— The great object of Bolivar would
							now be to write the whole Continent of South-America in a confederation
							of which New-Grenada and Venezuela would be the central State— The
							Doctor asked me for a copy of the Law of the United States relating to
							our Privateers, and of the Regulations and Instructions under which they
							had sailed during our late War— These were furnished him, and he
							promised and sent me a printed blank Commission, such as those issued by
							Bolivar— He said Aury had been ordered to report himself, and if he did
							not, would be declared a Pirate— But he added they had no Prize-code,
							and merely followed the old privateering Ordinances of Spain, and had
							hitherto required no Bonds to be given by the owners and Captains of
							Privateers; which had been the principal cause of the excesses committed
							by privateers under the Venezuelan flag. After Forsyth left me, I went
							over to the President’s. His direction to me to write to Bolivar,
							recommending Forsyth had perplexed me— I suggested to him that Bolivar,
							being the Supreme Chief of the Republic, might take exception at a
							Letter from a subordinate Officer of this Government, the rule of
							Correspondence between Nations being that principal writes to principal,
							and Minister to Minister. He then asked me, if I could not write to
							Bolivar’s Minister, or Secretary of State— I said certainly, if he
							thought proper; but I must acknowledge, I felt some distrust of every
							thing proposed and desired by these South-American Gentlemen. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Torres and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Forsyth, had pursued a different system from that of Lino Clemente and
								<persRef ref="pazos-vincente">Vicente Pazas</persRef>. Instead of
							bullying and insulting, their course had been to sooth and coax— But
							their object was evidently the same— The proposal of Torres was that
							while professing neutrality we should furnish actual warlike aid to
							South-America— And Forsyth’s insinuation was that Zea was coming to
							tempt us by some offer of actual and exclusive advantages. For What he
							wanted this Letter of recommendation, to those whom he was now serving I
							knew not; but when he got it, he would make the most of it that he
							could— The republic of Colombia too would be disposed to make the most
							of it; and I should not be surprized if they should among them make as
							pompous a display of it, as they did of Baptis Irvine’s reception— I
							believed the best way to write the Letter of recommendation, which he
							had promised, would be for me to address it to Torres, and let him
							communicate it to his Government— The President agreed to this, and said
							he believed he had promised Forsyth more than he <pb type="ms" n="301"
							/>ought to have done— But Forsyth had been useful to Commodore Perry,
							and on going back to Venezuela, might be useful again; he had thought it
							would be best therefore to let him go back with dispositions friendly
							towards us, and he had the more confidence in Forsyth, because <persRef
								ref="trimble-david">Trimble</persRef> the Kentucky member, <persRef
								key="clay-henry">Clay’s</persRef> particular friend, and a zealot
							for South-America, had spoken of him with the utmost contempt. Forsyth
							has played his card very adroitly with the President, though Baptis
							Irvine, since he found him interfering with his own views of returning
							as agent did completely unmask him— Irvine discovered that Forsyth had
							been undermining him, but thought he had directly asserted against him
							by name, what Forsyth had only insinuated without naming him at all—
							Irvine then wrote two furious Letters, of the bitterest invective
							against Forsyth, painting him, his character and conduct in colours of
							the darkest hue. Forsyth got wind of them; went to Irvine, protested to
							him that he had never so much as mentioned his name to the President, to
							whom he appealed for the truth of what he said— Irvine became
							compunctious for his overhastiness in believing that his friend Forsyth
							had disserved him, and actually came to the President, and apologized
							for what he had written under erroneous impressions, and recanted all
							that he had written against Forsyth—a great part of which, from other
							evidence, I have no doubt was true— Tis an intrigue of Plot and
							Counterplot, fit for <persRef ref="shakeseare-william"

						<p><date>31. VI:</date><persRef ref="edwards-ninian">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Ninian Edwards</persRef> a Senator from the State of
							Illinois came to me this Morning, upon business which had been also
							yesterday been mentioned by <persRef ref="cook-daniel">Cook</persRef>.—
							The nomination of a Marshal for that District, in the room of<persRef
								ref="lemmon-robert"> R. Lemen</persRef> resigned— He had a
							recommendation from judge <persRef ref="pope-nathaniel">Pope</persRef>,
							of a <persRef ref="conner-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Conar,</persRef> who is also supported by him and by Cook. He also
							talked much about <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay’s</persRef> two
							Resolutions, offered to the House of Representatives last Tuesday; the
							day after the Message from the President, on Spain and Florida was sent
							in. Clay’s affairs, private and public have been growing desperate, ever
							since the commencement of <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s</persRef> Administration— He
							then refused the War Department and the Mission to London— Nothing would
							satisfy him but the Department of State, and failing to obtain that he
							projected a new opposition, of which he should be the head, and which
							should in the course of two Presidential terms, run down Monroe, so that
							he might come in as the Opposition Successor. His Engines the first
							Session were South-America, and Internal improvement— Both then failed—
							The next Session, he took up the Seminole War, but of that mighty
							controversy he was no longer the primary leader— He had ranged himself
							under the <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>
							banners. That struggle was more stubborn, but also failed— The great
							majority of the People took the other side— The Missouri question then
							arose, and disconcerted Clay’s projects by presenting party combinations
							and divisions very unsuitable to them— It looked to a dissolution of the
							Union, upon principles which could not serve his purposes. But that
							question having been for the present, compromised, he recurs to
							South-American and Spanish Affairs for his main Engine of opposition.
							The Florida Treaty when concluded last Winter, was universally
							considered as obtaining so much more for us than had ever been expected
							that not a voice could be raised against it in either house of Congress,
							now the public feeling is different— For while the <persRef
								ref="ferdinand-vii">king of Spain</persRef> refuses to ratify
							because he says his Minister conceded too much; the people of our
							Western Country have been instigated against the Treaty, as not having
							obtained enough. The Missouri question too has operated to indispose
							every part of the Union against the Treaty; the North and East, because
							they do not wish even to have Florida, as another Slave State; and the
							South and West because they wish to have all the Territory to the Rio
							del Norte, for more Slave States. Clay seizes upon this state of things;
							and has brought forward these Resolutions <pb type="ms" n="302"/>which
							are to operate in every possible contingency against the Administration—
							By raising a party against the Treaty, it may prevent its ratification,
							in which case all our differences with Spain recur to clog the course of
							the Administration: if not; and the ratification should be obtained, the
							Treaty itself will be rendered obnoxious; and the Administration odious
							for accepting it—and most especially the Secretary of State who
							negotiated it— Clay’s Resolutions are 1. That Congress alone have power
							to cede Territory, and that no Treaty can cede it without their sanction
							and 2. That the Florida Treaty, ceded territory without an adequate
							equivalent, and ought not to be renewed— Edwards says he had at first
							been told that these Resolutions would not have much support; but
							afterwards that they would, and perhaps might be carried in the House—
							That all the western members would vote for them, and that the Treaty
							had been rendered unpopular in the Western Country— He also said a
							member had told him that the President’s last Message would be the most
							unpopular that he ever did, because it recommended to postpone acting at
							the interposition of Russia and France, after having refused to accept
							the Mediation of G. Britain, and to abide by the decision of the allied
							powers— I told Edwards that I had very little attachment to the Treaty—
							I believed it now as when it was signed, an acceptable bargain; but I
							had been the last man in the administration to agree to accept the
							Sabine for the Western Boundary; and shall now be very ready to abandon
							the Treaty if the opinion of an adequate portion of either house of
							Congress should be adverse to it— That as a servant of the whole Union
							the interests of every part of the Union were equally dear to me— There
							was neither East, West, North or South to my duty or my feelings. But as
							an eastern man, I should be disinclined to have either Texas or Florida,
							without a restriction excluding Slavery from them, and if I were now a
							member of either house of Congress, I would offer Resolutions, that the
							Treaty ought not now to be accepted without an Article prohibiting and
							excluding Slavery from the territory to be acquired— I had been
							continually expecting that such resolutions would be offered, by some
							one of the Northern or Eastern Members— As to the President’s Message;
							there were other reasons for sending it in, besides those apparent upon
							the face of it— Reasons of transcendent influence, but not proper to be
							publicly assigned—one was to prevent a long, angry, dangerous and
							unprofitable debate which would certainly have arisen from the report of
							the Committee of Foreign Relations— A second was to avoid the certain
							issue of that debate, which would have exhibited to the Nation and the
							World, a disagreement of the worst kind between the Executive and the
							Legislature— In all probability the issue would have been the indefinite
							postponement of the subject, with nothing done, and with great mutual
							irritation and excitement— A third was, that even if the Law for
							occupying Florida, could have passed, we had reason to believe it was
							precisely what Spain desired, for the purpose of having ground to insist
							upon the confirmation of the contested grants, and the Report of the
							Committee gave anticipated countenance to that pretension— The Message,
							puts an end to all this; and now Clay may offer his Resolutions and make
							his speeches— We know that the vote of the house, will concur with the
							recommendation of the Message. Why the reference to the interposition of
							France and Russia should make the President unpopular I could not easily
							see. The Committee of Foreign Relations had written to me through their
								<persRef ref="lowndes-william">Chairman</persRef> expressly
							enquiring, what information the Executive had of the views of the
							European Powers in relation to our affairs with Spain, and what part
							they would probably take in the Event of a War between the United Sates
							and her— The question before the House upon the report and Bill of the
							Committee was a question of Peace and War— What would have been said of
							the President, if he had withheld from the house, the fact of the
							interposition of France and Russia? That interposition has been
							altogether friendly, with an unequivocal expression of opinion in our
							favour on the points of difference with Spain— It was not of a character
							offensive in the slightest degree to our Independence, and it was in a
							concern upon which they had a right to interpose— They had important
							interests of their own involved in the issue— The interest of general
							Peace, which was threatened with imminent danger, in the event of a War
							between us and Spain— It would be a perversion of sound principle to
							pernicious prejudice, to spurn at such interposition— The President
							therefore deliberately determined the send the message; well aware of
							the gloss that would be put upon it, but knowing also that whatever
							opposition it might encounter here, would produce a favourable reaction
							in Europe; and believing that the whole result would be advantageous not
							only to the Country, but to the administration. Edwards assented to all
							this, and agreed that the message was a judicious measure. He intimated
							a wish that there might be some means of explaining the subject, by
							writing, for publication in the Western Country Newspapers; but for this
							I have neither time nor means— I took the recommendations of Conar, for
							the appointment of Marshal in Illinois, to the President who determined
							to send immediately the nomination to the Senate. The President also
							concluded upon the case of the Pirates under conviction; of whom there
								<pb type="ms" n="303"/>are seven at Baltimore<space/> at Richmond,
							Virginia, four at Charleston S.C. four at Savannah and eighteen at
							New-Orleans— Two are to be executed at each place, and the rest
							reprieved for two Months; excepting one at N. Orleans who is to be
							immediately pardoned. The warrants and necessary Letters to the Marshals
							of the Districts are to be made out immediately— <persRef
