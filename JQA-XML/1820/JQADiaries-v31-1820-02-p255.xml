						<p><date>1. VII:</date> Tuesday. There came to my Office this Morning three
							persons from Switzerland, who have the project of forming a settlement
							in the United States, to which they expect that some thousands of their
							countrymen will emigrate— They brought me a pamphlet containing their
							petition for a free grant of land, and certain privileges, and they say
							that the late <persRef ref="onis-luis">Spanish Minister Onis</persRef>
							promised them a grant of such extent as they should wish, and all
							encouragements possible, to induce them to settle in the Province of
							Texas— But not having heard from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis
							since his return to Spain, and preferring to settle in the United States
							they now apply for lands to Congress. They were desirous of seeing the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, and went from the
							Office to his house. But Congress will not probably give them Lands. The
							names of two of them were <persRef ref="dupasquier-unknown"
								>Dupasquier</persRef> and <persRef ref="leuba-unknown"
								>Leuba</persRef>. The name of the third I did not ascertain.
								<persRef ref="wyer-edward">Edward Wyer</persRef> our Consul at
							Hamburg came and sat with me perhaps two hours, talking upon all sorts
							of subjects. He says Jonathan Russell is coming to Washington, and he
							hates him as much as ever— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> had this Evening her
							usual weekly tea-party which was attended by about fifty persons— Among
							the company were <persRef ref="skinner-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> J. S. Skinner</persRef> the Postmaster at Baltimore, and
							his <persRef ref="skinner-elizabeth">wife</persRef>. He is a man of
							mingled character—of daring and pernicious principles, or restless and
							rash temper, and yet of useful and honourable enterprize— Ruffian,
							Patriot and Philanthropist are so blended in him, that I cannot
							appretiate him without a mingled sentiment of detestation and esteem— I
							consider him as the originator and cause of all the Baltimore piracies,
							which have injured and still dishonour this Nation. He has infected not
							only that City, but the moral feeling of this whole community, and the
							public Councils of the Country, to such a degree as to stay the hand of
							Justice itself. He has embroiled us with two foreign Nations whose
								good-<pb type="ms" n="256"/>will it is most important to us to
							possess— He has been now nearly two years under indictment for being
							concerned in the Baltimore piracies; and has contrived to get his
								<persRef ref="bland-theoderick">father in law</persRef> appointed
							the judge to decide upon them. Yet his private character is such that he
							has numerous and very ardent friends— He made to the Government at a
							critical period important disclosures concerning <persRef
								ref="macgregor-gregor">M’Gregor</persRef> and his Amelia Island
							buccaneering expedition; and he has been during the last year Editor of
							a weekly newspaper called the American Farmer, devoted altogether to
							agricultural improvements, and which is a very valuable publication.— I
							conversed with him upon it and he told me that the next number would
							contain a Letter from <persRef ref="pickering-timothy">M<hi

						<p><date>2. VII:</date><persRef ref="forbes-john">J. M. Forbes</persRef>
							called here this morning, and afterwards at the Office— He has some
							inclination for the appointment of Collector of the Port of Plymouth in
							Massachusetts, from which he says <persRef ref="warren-henry">Henry
								Warren</persRef> is to be removed as a defaulter, in his accounts—
							Among the vicissitudes of human affairs, the fate of that family of
							Warren is to me a source of melancholy and would it might be of useful
							reflection. Ambition and Pride have been their ruin— Their <persRef
								ref="warren-mercy">mother</persRef> was a sister of <persRef
								ref="otis-james">James Otis</persRef>, one of the fathers of the
							American Revolution— With no other advantages of education than those
							common to females of respectable families in the country part of
							New-England fourscore years ago, she had a mind capable of aspiring to
							the summit of literary fame— She has given herself to the world, and has
							challenged the notice of posterity, as a dramatic poetess and a
							historian of the American Revolution— In both cases she had formed a
							delusive estimate of her powers— Her two Tragedies are to criticism,
							what a bottled foetus is to natural history; curious conceptions but
							without an organization ever susceptible of receiving life— Even her
							fugitive poems, which in manuscript might have passed for proofs of mind
							beyond an ordinary level, became despicable in print, and a bound
							volume. Her History has higher though still feeble pretensions to merit.
							It was scarcely worth the waste of paper and type upon three octavo
							volumes; but it may hold its place upon the shelf with many other
							worthless Histories of that period. If a flying fish could fancy itself
							an Eagle it would make the same mistake of its nature and its element as
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Warren made of hers— Her <persRef
								ref="warren-james2">husband</persRef> was a man of some talents, but
							under the ascendancy of hers to his and her misfortune— They were ardent
							Patriots in our Revolution, and during my earliest infancy were the
							dearest and most intimate friends of my <persRef ref="adams-john"
								>father</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail">Mother</persRef>.
							They had then five sons—<persRef ref="warren-james">James</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="warren-charles">Charles</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="warren-winslow">Winslow</persRef>, Henry and <persRef
								ref="warren-george">George</persRef>, of whom the two youngest were
							very nearly of my age— They were five as handsome, well-bred and
							promising boys as ever kindled the hopes of a parent; and among the
							earliest and profoundest of my recollections are the constant and urgent
							admonitions of my dear mother to look to those children as my model and
							to imitate their deportment and manners— Yet everyone of them has turned
							out unfortunately— James entered the Navy at the beginning of our
							Revolution, and was saved from destruction by losing his leg in the
							battle by which the Serapis was taken. James was then a Lieutenant of
							Marines been in the frigate Alliance and has been ever since a helpless
							cripple, subsisting upon his pension, his Parents, and perhaps the
							Post-Office— Charles, the flower of the family, died of a consumption at
							twenty-two— Winslow, the victim of his own beauty; led a licentious and
							adventurous life, with the varying fortunes of a gamester, and the
							dissipations of an homme a bonnes fortunes the longing of prurient
							virgins, and the plaything of practised harlots, one day wallowing in
							profligate affluence, and another pining in the debtors dungeon, till
							driven by desperation at the age of thirty to enter the army as a
							lieutenant, he was killed by the Savages at the butchery of <persRef
								ref="stclair-arthur">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Clair’s</persRef> defeat in November 1791— Henry has maintained for
							many years a more respectable standing in Society— Married to a very
							amiable <persRef ref="warren-mary">woman</persRef>, and has raised and
							well-educated a large family of children— But his life has not been
							regular; and he is now to be removed from a public office for
							malversation— George settled in the District of Maine, as a practicing
							lawyer— Was two or three years a member of the Massachusetts
							Legislature, but burnt out with early intemperance and died young— When
							the Constitution of Massachusetts was made in 1781. James Warren the
							father was chosen the first Lieutenant-Governor under it— But he
							declined accepting it, at the instigation of his wife, who persuaded him
							that he ought to have been chosen the Governor instead of <persRef
								ref="hancock-john">Hancock</persRef>— This was the turning of the
							tide of his Affairs— From that time he gradually lost his popularity and
							political influence; became a discontented and disaffected man—declined
							in fortune and reputation favoured <persRef ref="shays-daniel"
								>Shays’s</persRef> insurrection; courted in their last days Hancock,
							and <persRef ref="adams-samuel">Samuel Adams</persRef>, turned against
								<persRef ref="washington-george">Washington’s</persRef>
							Administration, and became inveterate against my father’s; and when
								<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef> came in to
							power, the Post-Office and the Collectorship of Plymouth for James
							Warren junior and Henry were the rewards of the republicanism of the
							whole family— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Warren published her
							History, and adopted it to the popular prejudices of the time,
							sacrificed all the antient friendships and social affections of her
							youth, to join in vulgar aspersions and venomous <pb type="ms" n="257"
							/>imputations upon my father, and was paid by the Post-Office and the
							Collectorship for her sons. At the Commencement at Cambridge in 1817.
							Henry Warren had a son who graduated, and we were invited to the chamber
							where they entertained their friends. He there treated us with great
							civility— Some months since he wrote me a Letter, proposing to resign
							his office, upon condition that his son should be appointed in his
							place. I took his Letter to the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef>, but his Office being one of those depending
							upon the Treasury Department, I did not think proper to interfere with
							the disposal of it— And this is what I now told Forbes; who said he
							would speak to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford himself, and
							observed that the delicacy which I practiced was not returned in the
							same way— I called at the President’s and asked his directions for
							answering the Letters of <persRef ref="clarke-john2">Governor Clark of
								Georgia</persRef>— He said he had concluded to refer them and
							particularly the one charging the <persRef ref="mitchell-david">Indian
								Agent Mitchell</persRef> to the <persRef ref="wirt-william"
								>Attorney-General</persRef> for his opinion, in what <hi
								rend="strikethrough">manner</hi> the charges may best be
							investigated; and after that, it was his intention to put the papers
							into the hands of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef>, who was
							particularly friendly to Mitchell, and to whom it will be but candid to
							make the communication— The President said that his accusation had been
							brought against Mitchell last Winter by <persRef ref="gaines-edmund"
								>General Gaines</persRef>; Mitchell had been here without authority
							or permission; to clear it up. The President said he himself had not
							been satisfied with Mitchell’s conduct, and in going into Georgia, had
							avoided seeing or being accompanied by him. He feared there was too much
							foundation for the charges against him in the Governor of Georgia’s
							Letter— Yet a full opportunity to justify himself should be given him,
							and the accusation of an Enemy ought not to be taken for granted. I told
							him I should then wait for his further directions— Evening at home; but
							without writing; and arrears of Journal still running up.</p>

						<p><date>3. VI:30.</date> I received on the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.

								R. King</persRef> came and passed a couple of hours with me at my
							Office. He has been returned again to the Senate by the Legislature of
							New-York, in a manner which is unparalleled in this Union— The choice
							ought regularly to have been made this time last Winter; but there were
							three parties in the Legislature, of which that in favour of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> King was the smallest. <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">Governor Clinton’s</persRef> influence was all
							exerted against him and the republican opposition to Clinton had a
							Candidate of their own— When the next house of Assembly were chosen,
							last May, it turned out that the federalists had gained <pb type="ms"
								n="258"/>ground, which Clinton’s party had lost— He therefore to
							maintain himself found it indispensably necessary to conciliate the

							in the State he changed his policy towards M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> King, to such a degree, that in his Speech to the New-York
							Legislature he recommended King to their choice, not indeed by name, but
							designating him in terms not to be mistaken. The republican opposition
							took also the same direction, and King who after ten trials last Winter
							could not get so many as twenty votes out of 150. now came in by an
							unanimous vote of the Senate, and by all but three in the House of
							Assembly. Shortly before the Meeting of Congress, he published at the
							request of a Missouri-question Meeting at New-York, the substance of his
							two Speeches last Winter in the Senate on that Bill, which was then lost
							by the disagreement between the two Houses on the restricting clause—
							This publication has largely contributed to kindle the flame now raging
							throughout the Union, on that question, and which threatens its
							dissolution. King is strongly affected and agitated by it— Whether he
							sees the consequences in their full extent and has made up his mind to
							promote them, even to the separation of the Union I am not sure—but my
							own opinion is that no man ought to take an active part in that

								ref="adams-george">George</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> departed in the Stage for Baltimore, returning to
							the University at Cambridge, where the term commences next Friday— The
							six weeks of vacation which they have spent with us here have been much
							enlivened by their company— There is nothing vicious in their morals,
							and nothing unamiable in their dispositions— George is of a slender,
							infirm Constitution, with symptoms of occasional illness, alarming to
							the <unclear>. . .</unclear>ight and affection of a Parent— John is more
							vigorous, though his childhood was yet more weakly than George’s.
								<unclear>They</unclear> have both Understandings, naturally good,
							but George’s turn is more to contemplation and study, and Johns to
							active life. The Powers of George’s mind are now unfolding themselves,
							and afford reasonable grounds for hope— John’s ambition is not yet
							excited beyond the standard of keeping pace with others. He is on a par
							with some of the best Scholars in his Class and has no ambition to
							outstrip them— George struggled sometime for the first place, but was
							overcome in competition, and gave up the contest in despair— He
							maintains a respectable station in his Class, and feels sufficiently the
							spur of emulation. He has some excentric habits, and some awkwardness in
							his deportment— This however could probably wear gradually away by
							intercourse with the world— I have introduced them while they have been
							here as much into company as I could and prevailed upon them both to
							dance, at the parties where there has been opportunity for it. There is
							a bashfulness in young persons, first coming into general Society very
							painful to themselves, and disadvantageous to their estimation with
							others, which their Parents and friends should assist them in throwing
							off. An easy but respectful and delicate familiarity with conversation
							with women is essential to the perfection of good-breeding; and nothing
							contributes so effectually to give it, as dancing— I never possessed it
							myself, because though taught to dance when a child, I did not till late
							in youth, break through the timidity which restrained me from dancing in
							company, and having no fund of Conversation adopted to the taste and
							feelings of the sex, I have always been reserved and cold in my
							intercourse with them. Conscious of <pb type="ms" n="259"/>this defect
							in my own character, I would fain preserve my children from it, and
							perceiving at their first introduction into company here that their
							timidity withheld them from dancing and gave them an awkwardness of
							appearance not creditable to them, I urged and insisted upon their
							dancing, which they at first did with great reluctance, but before they
							left us, relished so highly that I trust no further instigation will be
							necessary to break them into the practice. My opinion is strongly
							favorable to the usefulness both physical and moral, of dancing, to
							young people of both sexes— My Sons have also had an opportunity of
							hearing the debates in both Houses of Congress during their visit here;
							another source of improvement which I was glad of providing for them. I
							hope their time here has not been lost; and that the blessing of God may
							attend them through life— I attended Church at the Capitol and heard a
								<persRef ref="rice-luther">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rice</persRef> preach; said to be a man of reputation for pulpit
							eloquence, but not according to my estimation of the Art— The weather
							was warm, and the streets and roads so bad for walking that after

							The <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> is much dissatisfied
							with the proceedings of <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyt</persRef>h at Madrid; and

								<persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hyde de Neuville</persRef>, the French Minister’s Letter of 29.
							January on the Baltimore piracies— After the Letter and my answer had
							been seen by all the Members of the Administration, the President
							thought upon <pb type="ms" n="260"/>further reflection that it would be
							better for me to see De Neuville, and suggest to him verbally the
							objectionable character of some passages in his Letter, which he thought
							would induce him to take it back— As the relation of De Neuville with us
							has been of a very friendly character, and as he was induced at the
							President’s request to remain here this winter, after he had actually
							engaged his passage to France on a leave of absence; the President was
							very unwilling to assume with him a tone of asperity— This is at once
							mild and considerate. In the Evening, I attended with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> the Drawing-Room at the President’s— I had
							Conversations there with <persRef ref="walker-freeman">F.

							despatches, and with <persRef ref="johnson-richard">R. M.
								Johnson</persRef> of Kentucky about <persRef ref="duane-william2"
								>Duanes</persRef> Letters— Walker has introduced into the Senate a
							Resolution, calling upon the President for further information relating
							to the Negotiation with Spain. I told him that the despatches received
							from Forsyth, and his Notes to the Spanish Minister of State had not
							given satisfaction to the President, and he thought they would if
							published give great dissatisfaction to the Country, and Mortification
							to Forsyth’s friends— He had therefore directed that they should be
							shewn to the <persRef ref="elliott-john">Senators from
							Georgia</persRef>, suggesting to them the consideration whether it would
							not be most advisable to forbear pressing the call for papers which
							could only be compiled with by making them public. Walker said that
							although Forsyth was one of the most intimate friends he had in the
							world; he could not possibly approve that part of his diplomatic
							correspondence which had been made public— That he would readily follow
							the course recommended by the President—he would call at the Department
							of State, and read the despatches; and would not call up his Resolution
							for the Present— <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Poletica</persRef> the Russian Minister was also very
							inquisitive concerning the despatches last received from Forsyth; and
							told me he had received himself Letters mentioning that he was on the
							point of leaving Madrid— I did not however think it proper to be
							communicative with him on this occasion, just at this time; nor to ask
							him to be more explicit— I told Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M.
							Johnson, what the President had said of Duane’s Letters and proposals;
							and asked him if was willing that the Letters should be shewn to the
							other Heads of Departments— Johnson said he should be willing, if there
							was reason to suppose the advice they should give, after the perusal,
							would change the President’s present opinion, and induce him to comply
							with Duane’s wishes— I told him I could not answer for the operation of
							the Letters upon other men’s minds, but I had no reason to suppose they
							would think differently from the President on this subject or advise him
							to a different course from that which he had determined to adopt—
							Johnson said if that that was the case, he did not wish that the other
							Heads of Departments should see the Letters; but he would call at my
							house, and take them back— I mentioned to him the President’s idea, of
							employing <persRef ref="todd-thomas">judge Todd’s</persRef><persRef

						<p><date>10. VI:30.</date> There was a fall of Snow, which turned to Hail
							and Sleet, which began soon after Sunrise this morning and continued
							till Night. In the Evening it held up— The ground was entirely covered
							with Snow, perhaps four inches deep, but there was not much of a Storm.
							I took <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> to school in the
							Carriage, and paid several visits— Attended the Cabinet Meeting at the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> at One O’Clock—
							The Secretaries of the <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Treasury</persRef>, <persRef ref="calhoun-john">War</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="thompson-smith">Navy</persRef> were there— The
							Attorney General, <persRef ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef>, absent—
							The question was what should be done, with the French Minister, <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Hyde de Neuville’s</persRef> Letter of
							29 January— It was unanimously concluded most expedient that I should
							see and converse with him upon it— As to the part which contains a
							menace of measures to be taken by France; as I was satisfied he had no
							authority from his Government, for using it; I was persuaded he would
							upon being asked what he meant by it, explain it away— But I asked what
							I should say to the other part of his Letter, which was a request that
							the Attorney General of the United States should be employed to manage a
							prosecution of <persRef ref="chace-unknown">Chace</persRef>, the Captain
							of one of the Baltimore Pirate-Privateers, for robberies and outrages
							committed against certain French vessels and property— There was a
							question whether it could be required of the Attorney-General as a part
							of his Official duty; and agreed that it could not— The necessity for
							supplementary aid to the prosecution, was inferred from what was stated
							to be the notorious incompetency of the District Attorney, <persRef
								ref="glenn-elias">Glenn</persRef> for the Office of public
							Prosecutor— Crawford was very decided, and somewhat earnest <pb
								type="ms" n="261"/>for his removal, but there was found to be great
							difficulty in fixing upon a person more competent, and willing to accept
							the Office for his successor— It would indeed be a very invidious act to
							remove him upon such grounds and the idea was soon given up— The
							question about employing the Attorney-General rests upon the mode of
							compensating him for the service; there being no fund appropriated for
							it— He was actually employed in one of the Portuguese cases last Winter,
							and obtained for it, by direction of the President a fee of 1500
							dollars— It was paid partly from a fund at the disposal of the Treasury
							Department, and the rest from the Contingent fund for foreign
							intercourse— But some of the Members of the House of Representatives
							having heard of it, made it the subject of a formal enquiry; upon which
							a Committee is at this time occupied. The President and all the members
							of the Administration were of opinion that it would be proper to employ
							the Attorney General to assist in the prosecution, and that his fee
							might be paid from the contingent fund for foreign intercourse, unless
							there should be some vote of disapprobation in Congress upon the
							application of part of the fund to a similar payment before. I was
							directed therefore to say to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De Neuville,
							that if the Attorney-General could without inconvenience be employed, he
							would be, but that no promise to that effect could be given. Something
							was said about <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth’s</persRef>
							despatches, and I was directed to write to him immediately, giving him
							permission to return to the United States— The President was inclined to
							do more, and to express his positive disapprobation of Forsyth’s
							conduct, and of the style of his official Notes at Madrid— I thought it
							would be sufficient to recall him without any mark of approbation of his
							conduct; and although it is impossible to justify the style that he has
							used, and still less the determination which he took of his own head, to
							leave Spain without instructions from his Government, yet great
							allowances were to be made for the provocation under which he had acted.
							Crawford said he regretted that some disapprobation had not been made
							known to Forsyth, when the first of his offensive Notes had been
							communicated here— The object of this remark was to transfer the blame
							of Forsyth’s conduct to me, but I took no notice of it— Forsyth was
							appointed to that mission by Crawford’s influence, strongly against my
							inclination— He had neither the experience, nor the prudence, nor the
							sincerity, nor the delicacy of sentiment, suited for such a Station. But
							it suited Crawford’s views that Forsyth should be pushed forward, and he
							was so— Calhoun said that Forsyth’s diplomatic Notes, were exactly like
							his speeches in Congress—ironical—that he gave more personal offence to
							his opponents by indulging himself in that style, than any other member,
							with whom he ever sat in a deliberative assembly— Now the great faults
							of Forsyth at Madrid, have been indiscretion and indecorum; faults quite
							sufficient to shew that he was not qualified for the Office of a public
							Minister, on a highly critical mission, but which ought not to be
							severely punished by those who appointed him knowing his character— The
							meeting broke up about four O’Clock, and I sent a Note to the French
							Minister requesting him to call at my Office at one to-morrow. I rode
							home, the Snow still continuing to fall. Evening in my chamber, reading
							newspapers and writing arrears of Journal.</p>

						<p><date>11. VII:</date><persRef ref="hersant-michael">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hersant</persRef>, one of the persons,
							attached to the French Legation, came this morning, with a request that
							I would receive him at a different hour from that which I had appointed;
							to which I agreed, and named four, instead of one— I went up to the
							Capitol and heard <persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> King</persRef> in the Senate, upon what is called the
							Missouri question— He had been speaking perhaps an hour before I went in
							and heard him about an hour. His manner is dignified, grave, earnest,
							but not rapid or vehement. There was nothing new in his argument; but he
							unravelled with ingenious and subtle analysis, many of the sophistical
							issues of the Slave-holders— He laid down the position of the natural
							liberty of man, and its incompatibility with Slavery in any shape; he
							also questioned the Constitutional right of the President and the
							Senate, to make the Louisiana Treaty; but he did not dwell upon those
							points nor draw the consequences from them, which I should think
							important in speaking to that subject. He spoke however with great
							power, and the great Slave-holders in the house gnawed their lips, and
							clenched their fists as they heard him— The Senate adjourned to Monday,
							immediately after he finished, and I went into the House of
							Representatives, where I found <persRef ref="anderson-richard">R. C.
								Anderson</persRef> of Kentucky speaking upon the same subject, but
							the other side of the question— He speaks with fluency, as do almost all
							the members of Congress— This facility is one of the greatest
							impediments to our Legislation. In the British Parliament there are
							about ten or twelve Ministerial Speakers, and as many on the Opposition
							side who perform almost all the debating part of deliberation. There are
							never more than two or three long speeches on each side, and the
							question <pb type="ms" n="262"/>is always taken before the House
							adjourns— Here a single question is sometimes debated three weeks, and
							Members make speeches three days long— After the adjournment I went to
							my Office, where <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de Neuville</persRef> the French
							Minister came according to appointment at four O’Clock. I had only the
							translation of his Letter of 29. January, and asked him for an
							explanation of those passages which threatened certain measures to be
							taken by France, unless the Baltimore piracies should be effectually
							suppressed by ourselves— He disclaimed any intention of threatening
							at-all; and as invariably happens, when men attempt to maintain by
							argument that which they have said or written without Consideration, he
							was obliged to prevaricate in order to explain away his own meaning— He
							spoke no more of what France had <hi rend="italic">deferred</hi> to do,
							from motives of Confidence, in us, but must do, unless we should, and
							that, soon, make it unnecessary; but of his private opinion, that she
							ought to do it, and the thing was no more a general search of suspected
							or signalised vessels, under our flag, but merely Instructions to her
							naval Officers, such as we had given to those of our Ships of War— I
							told him that as it had the appearance of a menace, I had been under the
							necessity of asking an explanation, and had at first put that request in
							writing— But as this would necessarily have led to a discussion, which
							it might also have been necessary to make public, the President had
							thought it best I should see him; and ask the explanation verbally. I
							had sent all his former communications on the Baltimore piracies to the
							Committee of the House of Representatives on foreign relations, who had
							that subject before them, and they had been most earnestly urged to
							propose to Congress a revisal of the Law, and other measures to suppress
							that abomination—but I had not sent them this last Letter, because it
							would certainly have had with them a counteracting tendency and their
							first question would have been what answer had been given to it— As I
							had always transacted business with him rather on terms of individual
							friendship than in diplomatic formality, I wished him to let me send him
							back this note, rather than enter into a written correspondence to
							explain it— He was exceedingly unwilling to do either, and asked a day
							or two for reflection to which I assented. He said it was derogatory to
							the character of a Minister to take back a Note once sent—that on
							returning home he would re-examine his note, and would give me any
							explanation of it to shew that he intended no menace by it. That as I
							had sent his other Notes on the subject to the Committee, he was
							satisfied, and that if the Commanders of French vessels of War, were
							authorised to do as much and no more than our own Officers had been
							instructed to do for the suppression of the Slave-trade, that though
							useful might be attended with inconveniences and abuses— He asked if the
							Attorney-General would be directed to manage the prosecutions at
							Baltimore against the piracies committed upon French vessels— I told him
							that would depend upon circumstances: intimated to him the objection
							that had been made to the employment of him in similar cases before, and
							said that in the event of the entire removal of that objection, the
							President would readily engage him to attend in the French cases at
							Baltimore— We attended an Evening party at <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s</persRef>, and heard
							of nothing but the Missouri question, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							King’s Speeches— The Slave-holders cannot hear of them without being
							seized with cramps— They call them seditious and inflammatory, when
							their greatest real defect is their timidity. Never since human
							sentiments and human conduct were influenced by human speech, was there
							a theme for eloquence, like the free side of this question now before
							the Congress of this Union— By what fatality does it happen that all the
							most eloquent Orators of the Body are on its slavish side— There is a
							great mass of cool judgment and plain sense on the side of Freedom and
							humanity; but the ardent Spirits, and Passions, are on the side of
							oppression— Oh! if but one man could arise with a Genius capable of
							comprehending, a heart capable of supporting and an utterance capable of
							communicating those eternal truths that belong to this question, to lay
							bare in all its nakedness that outrage upon the goodness of God, human
							Slavery, now is the time, and this is the occasion upon which such a man
							would perform the duties of an Angel upon Earth.</p>

							extricate himself from it. My duty is only to lay all such applications
							before the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> for his

							Clerks in the Department of State, spoke to me this day about certain
							attacks upon him in the newspapers— He has talents for the despatch of
							business, beyond any other man in the department, excepting <persRef
								ref="bailey-john">Bailey</persRef>, and having been many years
							Editor of a Newspaper he has much knowledge of the general politics of
							the Country, and writes in a handsome and forcible style— But his life
							has been dissipated and wasteful—charges of a heinous complection are in
							circulation against his moral character— A general opinion prevails that
							he is utterly unprincipled, and with abilities far above his station
							which he holds, he is almost entirely destitute of friends— He was
							appointed a Clerk in the Department of State by <persRef
								ref="smith-robert">Robert Smith</persRef> in 1809. and when Smith
							went out of Office and quarreled with <persRef ref="madison-james"
								>Madison</persRef>, Colvin gave him the coup de grace, by publishing
							that he had been the writer of some of Smith’s most important State
							Papers— This disclosure was fatal to Smith, but it gave no favourable
							opinion of Colvin’s trust-worthiness to the Public— While M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe was Secretary of State, he always
							distrusted Colvin, and <persRef ref="brent-daniel">Brent</persRef> has
							told me that Colvin wrote much in opposition to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe’s election to the Presidency. After I came into the
							Department of State, I had no intercourse with Colvin, but such as arose
							necessarily from his situation as Clerk in the Department, for about a
							year— He was said to be the Editor of the Washington City Gazette, which
							was in sharp opposition to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s
							administration, and was considered as entirely subservient to <persRef
								ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>— In
							the Summer of 1818. There appeared in the National Register, an Octavo
							weekly paper published at Georgetown, a panegyrical character of J. Q.
							Adams under the title of American Gallery of Portraits N. 1.— There has
							been no N. 2. and soon after the publication of the piece I learnt with
							surprize that Colvin was the author of it. The Washington Gazette
							continued an opposition paper through more feebly supported all the last
							Session of Congress, and part of last Summer— But at the last Session
							the two Houses of Congress chose by ballot printers for the work of
							Congress, <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef> Editors of the National
							Intelligencer, were almost unanimously chosen, and <persRef
								ref="elliot-jonathan">Elliot</persRef>, Editor of the Washington
							Gazette though a Candidate was not supported by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay or his friends. From that time Clay has been out of
							favour with the Washington Gazette; but I was out of its flavour too
							till the last Autumn— The National Register after changing hands several
							times was purchased by Elliot; and soon after I returned here last
							October, I found frequent Editorial Articles in the Washington Gazette
							defensive against attacks in other papers upon me, and otherwise
							flattering to me, and also frequent bitter attacks upon Clay— So long as
							Colvin had been considered the Editor of a Paper devoted to Clay, and
							hostile to me, I had taken no notice of it, at-all. When I found he had
							become my encomiast, I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent to
							give him a hint, that if he was Editor of a Newspaper and was disposed
							to vindicate against unjust aspersions the general course of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Monroe’s Administration, I should be well
							pleased with it; but that although duly sensible to his good opinion, I
							wished him to abstain entirely from publications of personal
							commendation upon me— Early after the commencement of the present
							Session of Congress, Colvin told me, that he had undertaken to be the
							Editor of the Washington City Gazette for this Winter, to prevent its
							falling into bad hands; and to assist the Printer, Elliot, who was poor,
							and had a family to maintain— But that he received no compensation for
							it, whatever. The management of the paper has thus been in a manner
							placed entirely placed at my disposal, but I have made no use of the
							power— It has not been discreetly managed, but has defended the
							administration, with considerable ability, and has particularly repelled
							several indignant assaults upon me— It has been beyond necessity and
							propriety severe, and even abusive upon Clay— And it has courted the
							hostility of several Newspapers of some influence some of them without
							apparent motive— It has carried on a spirited War with the Aurora of
							Philadelphia, the most furious, and yet most powerful of the Prints in
							opposition, and with the Kentucky Reporter, which is the creature of
							Clay—and it has occasionally assailed other popular Papers, of
							opposition Politicks or doubtful <pb type="ms" n="264"/>complection,
							partly I suppose to push the paper into notice— When Colvin first threw
							down the gauntlet to defy the Aurora, <persRef ref="duane-william2"
								>Duane</persRef>, its Editor blustered and bullied, declaring that
							he would have no altercation with the subalterns of the Department of
							State, but would carry the War, directly to Head Quarters— For nearly
							two years before, there was no species of vilification but the Aurora
							had been pouring forth upon me, without intermission. Colvin however by
							continuing his attacks on Duane, and by touching his sore parts soon
							provoked him to a frenzy, and Duane suddenly ceasing all abuse upon me,
							is now constantly raving with personalities upon Colvin— In the mean
							time Duane has been, by means of his correspondence with <persRef
								ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M.
								Johnson</persRef>, hoisting the white flag to the President and to
							me. He is continually reproaching Colvin with his dissolute private
							life, and with his treachery to Robert Smith— This last Article was that
							upon which Colvin spoke to me this day— He said he hoped I did not give
							credit to Duane’s aspersions upon him. I told him that knowing at least
							nine tenths of everything published by Duane against myself was willful
							falsehood I generally inferred that what he said of others whom he
							wished to injure was of the same character. I gave no credit therefore
							to his abuse of any man. That as to Colvin’s conduct towards Robert
							Smith: I had known of it only what had been made public— I had very high
							ideas of the confidence between man and man—and if Smith had
							confidentially employed him to write diplomatic papers for him, the
							provocation must be great indeed which could justify him in divulging
							the fact, at a time and in a manner, which might must necessarily injure
							Smith in the public opinion more than from the intrinsic nature of the
							transaction, it ought— He said the facts had never been correctly known
							to the Public— That it was not Robert Smith, but M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Madison, who had brought him into this Department— That
							Robert Smith, instead of bringing him into the Department had attempted
							to put him out of it, in order to introduce the late <persRef
								ref="blake-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Blake</persRef> in
							his stead. That there had been nothing particularly confidential in
							Smith’s employing him to write papers for him. That the first time he
							had engaged him to answer a Letter of <persRef ref="turreau-louis"
								>General Turreau’s</persRef>, he had said to him—come, you may now
							try your hand at a diplomatic note. Colvin said he had really never
							valued himself much upon his Style, and should never have revealed to
							the world that he had written R. Smith’s papers, if Smith had not,
							besides treating him very ill made his unprincipled attack upon M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison, whom Colvin considered as his
							benefactor— As to Duane, he said there had been a time when he had been
							very intimate with him. He had now a large bundle of Letters from him.
							That he had broken off all intercourse with him upon a proposition which
							Duane had made to him which had convinced him that Duane was an
							unprincipled scoundrel— It was that he Colvin should write in a
							disguised hand, an anonymous Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Madison, to urge him to remove <persRef ref="granger-gideon">Gideon
								Granger</persRef> from the Office of Post-Master General for
							propagating false and scandalous Stories, affecting the character of
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Madison— There was something so
							infamous in the part which Duane thus wanted him to perform, that the
							proposal of it had disgusted him, to the degree that he had resolved to
							hold no further intercourse with him— True it was however that Granger
							had circulated dishonourable tales about <persRef ref="madison-dolley"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Madison</persRef>; and for two
							or three years before he was removed from the Post-Office he had been
							continually caballing with Members of Congress against M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison— He had lived on the Capitol-Hill;
							and his house was a seat of perpetual caucusing of malcontent members.
								<persRef ref="leib-michael">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Leib</persRef> then a Senator from Pennsylvania was one of them; and
							Granger appointed him Postmaster at Philadelphia; contrary to an express
							injunction from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison to appoint
							another man— Now Colvin knows nothing of Duane’s proposals to surrender,
							and fancies he is rendering me an important service by undertaking my
							defence against Duane; while Duane fancies that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe will be glad to buy off his foulness of mouth, with a
							South-American agency— As I was returning home, I overtook and walked
							with <persRef ref="macon-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Edward Everett</persRef>, the Professor of the Greek language, at

							short”—and it was without comparison the most splendid composition as a

							Evening <persRef ref="adams-george">where</persRef><persRef

								>Sons</persRef> had heard him; and George had written to me that it
							was the finest Sermon he had ever heard, and foretelling that he would
							preach it again here. Hacknied as this subject, the shortness of time
							is, I never before saw so forcibly exemplified the truth, that nothing
							is stale or trite in the hands of Genius— His composition is more rich,
							more varied, more copious more magnificent than was that of <persRef

							that reminded me perhaps too much of <persRef ref="massillon-jean"
								>Massillon</persRef>: but the whole Sermon was equal to any of the
							best that Massillon ever wrote— It abounded in splendid imagery, in deep
							pathos, in cutting Satire, in profound reflections of morals, in
							coruscations of wit—in thunderbolts of feeling— His manner of speaking
							was slow, and his articulation distinct, perhaps to excess— There <pb
								type="ms" n="265"/>was some want of simplicity, both in the matter
							and manner— A still greater defect was a want of unity in his subject—
							He gave as one Sermon a cento of Extracts from two or more— There was a
							description of the destructive operations of Time, absolutely
							terrific—and a portrait of blessings and future glories of this Country,
							wrought up like a work of enchantment— The house was full but not
							crowded. The New England hearers were rapt into enthusiasm. <persRef

								<persRef ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice Marshall</persRef>, told

								Holley’s</persRef> manner better— Clay started however immediately
							to the Missouri question, yet in debate before both houses of Congress,
							and alluding to a strange Scene at Richmond Virginia last Wednesday
							Evening, said it was a shocking thing to think of; but he had not a
							doubt that within five years from this time, the Union would be divided
							into three distinct confederacies— I did not incline to discuss this
							subject with him— We found Judges <persRef ref="livingston-henry"

								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, and premised to
							take immediately his directions with regard to the remainder. <persRef
								ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M.

								ref="duane-william2">Duane’s</persRef> two Letters. The Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> was uneasy at being under the necessity
							of returning a negative answer to both Duane’s applications, and asked
							whether he might not hold out to him an expectation of being employed
							hereafter if an opening should present itself for an agency in Mexico. I
							told <pb type="ms" n="266"/>him I thought it would be most candid<hi
								rend="strikethrough">ate</hi> with Duane to hold out no expectation
							to him whatever. The same objection against him now existing in the
							Presidents mind, would probably continue to exist namely that the
							appointment to an office of considerable emolument and of high
							confidential trust of the Editor of a Newspaper, the daily columns of
							which had for years been filled with imputations of the grossest kind
							both upon the capacity and integrity of the President and every member
							of his Administration would be generally disgusting to the Public, who
							would take it as a mere buying up of an enemy— Duane talked of the
							President’s obligations to him, which the President altogether denied.
							Duane would not pretend I was under obligations to him— I owed him
							neither love nor fear— But I should not stand in his way. Johnson said
							Duane was a man of great information and considerable talents, but
							without judgment—a proof of which, was in his complaints against the
							President, in the very Letter by which he was soliciting favours from
							him. He asked whether, if he should obtain recommendations of Duane from
							the <persRef ref="lowrie-walter;roberts-jonathan" type="multi">two
								Senators from Pennsylvania</persRef>, I thought they would influence
							the President in his favour. I said I could not tell—perhaps they might—
							At least I was sure the President would give all due consideration to
							any recommendation from the Pennsylvania Senators— How far it might be
							advisable to apply to the Pennsylvania Senators, for their
							recommendation I was sure he would duly consider. I doubted whether they
							would give it— At least two years ago, it was at the most earnest and
							vehement intreaty of the Pennsylvania Senators and most particularly of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Roberts that the Aurora was dismissed
							from the publication of the United States Laws. Roberts then reasoned
							the affair over both with the President and with me; and his principal
							argument was the indecency of continuing public patronage to a Printer
							whose papers were teeming with the most willful and malicious Slander
							against the President, his Administration and all its friends— Now Duane
							having a daily newspaper to work with; and being in the constant habit
							of venting all his private resentments and all his splenetic humours in
							his paper, against whoever displeased him, it might be no very agreeable
							thing to the Senators of Pennsylvania to be asked in his favour, for
							that which they could neither honestly grant, nor safely refuse— When
							compliance would only be to promote the views of a common defamer, and
							refusal would expose them to all his malevolence— Johnson said he should
							duly consider all this; and added that he had also been requested to
							recommend <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thornton</persRef> for a mission to South-America, and <persRef
								ref="allison-burgess">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Allison</persRef>, to succeed him as superintendent of the Patent
							Office—Johnson is a man who can refuse no favor to any person— He would
							recommend ten persons for one and the same place, rather than say no, to
							any one of them— I told him of the President’s intention to appoint
							judge Todd’s son to go to Venezuela, with which he was very well
							pleased. The President had already spoken if it to him— <persRef
								ref="eddy-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eddy</persRef> one
							of the Members of the House of Representatives from Rhode-Island, came
							to make complaint against <persRef ref="robbins-asher">Asher
								Robbins</persRef>, District Attorney of the United States, and
								<persRef ref="collins-charles">Charles Collins</persRef>, Collector
							of the Port of Bristol in that State; for connivence at, and
							participation in the African Slave-trade. He said that the fact was
							notorious as daylight that vessels were constantly fitted out and
							despatched from Bristol for the Guinea trade. That Collins had a
							plantation in the Island of Cuba which he had lately stocked with
							negroes, and where he had spent the last Winter— That Robbins during the
							late War with Great-Britain had made a trade of the Laws against the
							trading intercourse with the enemy— That <persRef ref="carlile-john"
								>John Carlile</persRef> of Providence, had told him that he had paid
							Robbins 500 dollars for discontinuing a prosecution which as District
							Attorney he had commenced against a man for trading with the enemy,
							contrary to Law— That he had told him <persRef ref="blodget-william"
								>William Blodget</persRef> had as agent for several such foul
							traders paid Robbins from five to eight hundred dollars each, for
							discontinuing several prosecutions against them. And he said that now,
							Robbins was carrying on the same kind of traffic in the Laws against the
							Slave trade— Eddy said that it was extremely disagreeable to him, to
							feel himself under an obligation of duty to give this information; but
							as no one else would do it, he had resolved that the Session of Congress
							should not pass over leaving the President uninformed of these flagrant
							violations of the Laws— He further referred me to <persRef
								ref="burrill-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burrill</persRef>
							the Senator for a confirmation of the facts— He said something of a
								<persRef ref="pitman-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pitman</persRef> as a suitable person for the appointment of
							District Attorney in place of Robbins— I told him I would make report of
							his information to the President, and let him know the result— At the
							Office, <persRef ref="torres-manuel">Manuel Torres</persRef> the agent
							from Venezuela came and told me that his Negotiation with the Bank of
							the United States for money had not succeeded, and he therefore now came
							for a supply of arms from the Government. I desired him to make the
							application in writing, and promised to lay it before the President— He
							shewed me the Letters which had passed between him and <persRef
								ref="cheves-langdon">L. Cheves</persRef>, the President of the Bank,
							with whom he professed to be entirely satisfied. But the main object of
							Torres in this visit manifestly was to discredit <persRef
								ref="robinson-william">William D. Robinson</persRef>. He had already
							written me a Letter disclaiming a publication in the Washington City
							Gazette of 6. December last, and of which he now told me that Robinson
							was the author— He said that Robinson while in England had <pb type="ms"
								n="267"/>fastened himself upon <persRef ref="devereux-john">General
								Devereux</persRef>, and had persuaded him to transcend his
							instructions and authority from the Government of Venezuela in a manner
							which would certainly be disapproved. He had induced him to delay and to
							change his plan of operations and to undertake a foolish expedition
							against Cuba and Mexico, for which he had no sort of authority, and
							which if pursued would certainly fail. Robinson was very ardent in the
							Patriot cause, and he Torres was very grateful to him for his zeal; but
							he was very well known, and not much esteemed in Venezuela. Before the
							commencement of the Revolution there he had been employed as a spy by
							the Spanish Government, and in consequence of it had now claims on the
							Government of Spain. He had induced Devereux in England to issue
							Commissions for Officers in the name of the Government of Venezuela, and
							to entrust him with blank Commissions of the same kind to be sold in
							this Country; and Robinson had been making attempts to put some of them
							off, here and at New-York. But all this was unauthorized and would
							undoubtedly be disapproved in Venezuela. The people there were not at
							all disposed to submit to the assumption of Sovereign and Independent
							authorities in their name by foreigners and especially by heretics— The
							English troops who had enlisted in their service would be well
							maintained and well paid for their services; but the assistance wanted
							of them was military and not political— They were soldiers, and not
							Sovereigns— The Venezuelan Government had already been disappointed by
							two English Agents, one of whom was named <persRef
								ref="hamilton-unknown3">Hamilton</persRef>, and who had failed in
							furnishing supplies of arms for which they had contracted, and been
							paid, and this was one principal cause of the necessity they were under
							of obtaining a supply in this Country— Much of this information of
							Torres had already been given in Duane’s Letters to R. M. Johnson, and
							the coincidences shews where Duane obtained it, as well as the
							confidential intimacy of Duane, both with Torres, and with Robinson— It
							discloses also the management of Robinson here as Devereux’s agent,
							while he is soliciting the agency from the United States to Venezuela—

						<p><date>18. VII:</date> I went up this morning to the Capitol, to converse
							with the members of Congress from Rhode-Island, concerning the charges
							against the <persRef ref="robbins-asher">District Attorney
								Robbins</persRef>, and the collector of Bristol, <persRef
								ref="collins-charles">Collins</persRef>. In the Senate I spoke to
								<persRef ref="burrill-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Burrill</persRef> and <persRef ref="hunter-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hunter</persRef>, both of whom spoke
							of it as a very unpleasant subject. Burrill to whom <persRef
								ref="eddy-samuel">Eddy</persRef> had referred me as being acquainted
							with the material facts, said he had no desire to give testimony in the
							case, but that from various circumstances which had come to his
							knowledge, he believed the facts charged by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Eddy against Robbins were true— The Slave-trade carried on
							by vessels fitted out from Bristol was perfectly notorious, and the
							Merchants at Providence were obliged to give higher wages to Seamen in
							their ordinary traffic, because they were told and knew that such high
							wages could always be obtained by the Sailors, by entering for the
							Guineamen at Bristol. It was impossible that this should be unknown to
							the Collector of the Port— Yet Burrill said he knew nothing to which he
							could positively testify against Collins. Hunter was yet more reluctant,
							being a Townsman of Robbins who resides at Newport, and a brother
							practitioner at the Bar. He said he had often heard rumours and surmises
							derogatory to the character of Robbins, but knew nothing against him to
							which he could testify— He would not attempt to screen him from enquiry
							or from punishment if he was guilty, but wished he might not be
							dismissed without having a previous opportunity of defending himself. He
							wished also if Robbins should be removed that the Delegation might be
							consulted, upon the appointment of his Successor— He knew that <persRef
								ref="story-joseph">judge Story</persRef> favoured the appointment of
								<persRef ref="pitman-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pitman</persRef>, but he hoped it would be another person— In the
							House of Representatives, <persRef ref="hazard-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hazard</persRef> was quite displeased
							at this complaint; said he was a friend of Robbins who was a man of
							talents and of estimable character in private life— There were many
							rumours unfavourable to his conduct as a public officer in circulation—
							What truth there was in them he could not tell; he wished not to
							interfere between Robbins, and the course of Justice; if he had been
							guilty, let him be dismissed; but at least his successor should be a
							Newport man. Perhaps the Attorney-General of the State— Almost all the
							best Offices both of the State Government and of the Union, in Rhode
							Island were held at Providence; and Newport ought to have her share—
							What he hoped especially was that Robbins should be informed of the
							charges against him, and have the opportunity to repel them, which I
							told him was the <persRef key="monroe-james">Presidents</persRef> full
							determination— I finished by speaking of this matter again to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Eddy. He seemed mortified to find himself
							alone in an accusation the cause for which was so notorious that he was
							unquestionably convinced it was as well known to every one of his
							associates, as to himself. I believe there is nothing so difficult as to
							detect and punish a public Officer for venality and corruption— I have
							not a scintillation of a doubt that both these men, Robbins and Collins,
							are guilty of Slave-trading or connivence at it. But informing is always
							an invidious task; and generally a very dangerous one; for when a man
							becomes an accuser, and fails of convicting the person accused even
							though really guilty, the charge recoils upon himself, and he incurs the
							odium of passing for a defamer; instead of obtaining credit as a terror
							to evil-doers— While in the House of Representatives, I heard <persRef
								ref="lowndes-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowndes</persRef> speak about two hours upon the Missouri Slave
							Question. The House adjourned about three O’Clock, and I went to the
							President’s and gave him the substance of my Conversations with the
							Rhode-Island members. Here the matter rests for the present— Evening at
							home.</p>

								ref="bloomfield-joseph">General Bloomfield</persRef>, who with many

							Nation and in Congress from the Missouri or Slave question. The
							territory of Missouri is a part of the Louisiana cession. At the Session
							of Congress before last, a Bill was introduced for enabling its
							inhabitants to form a State Constitution— There was then not time to
							pass the Bill, which was referred over, and brought forward again at the
							last Session. When it was under debate at the second reading in
							Committee of the whole, an amendment was proposed by <persRef
								ref="tallmadge-james">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> James
								Tallmadge</persRef>, seconded by <persRef ref="taylor-john">John W.
								Taylor</persRef>, both members from the State of New-York, making it
							one of the conditions of the admission of Missouri that the further
							introduction of Slavery should be prohibited, and that Slaves hereafter
							born there should be free at the age of 25. This amendment excited a
							very angry debate, but was adopted by the House, disagreed to by the
							Senate, and each house <hi rend="italic">adhering </hi>to its views the
							Bill was lost between them. When the amendment was first presented, its
							importance and consequences were certainly foreseen by no one, not even
							by those who brought it forward. Its discussion disclosed a secret—it
							revealed the basis for a new organization of parties— <persRef
								ref="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> had been two years labouring, first
							upon South-American Patriotism, and then upon the Seminole War, first in
							defiance of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>
							and then as a subaltern to him, to get up a new party. In both instances
							he had failed— But here was a new party ready formed, but of no pleasing
							aspect ether to Clay of Crawford: terrible to the whole Union, but
							portentously terrible to the South—threatening in its progress the
							emancipation of all their Slaves; threatening in its immediate effect
							that Southern domination which has swayed the Union for the last twenty
							years, and threatening that political ascendancy of Virginia, upon which
							Clay and Crawford both had fastened their <pb type="ms" n="270"
							/>principal hopes of personal aggrandizement. The failure of the Bill,
							and the attempt to exclude Slavery from the future State of Missouri,
							produced great fermentation here, and in the Southern States, but
							particularly in Virginia. North and East it excited less feeling, but
								<persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								King</persRef> who had taken a considerable part in the debate at
							the last Session in Senate, in the course of the Summer set on foot and
							organized a concert of measures which have resulted in the struggle
							which now shakes the Union to its centre— Bloomfield, though a member
							from New-Jersey took at the last Session the Southern side of this
							question, and still adheres to it— But he says he received yesterday a
							Letter from a very sober and respectable neighbour of his, who asks him
							whether a civil War, would not be preferable to the extension of Slavery
							beyond the Mississippi.— This is a question between the rights of human
							nature and the Constitution of the United States— Probably both will
							suffer by the issue of the controversy— When I came home, I found here,
								<persRef ref="livingston-van">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van

							of Representatives from New-Hampshire called upon me, and conversing on
							the Missouri-Slave question, which at this time agitates Congress and
							the Nation, asked my opinion of the propriety of agreeing to a
							compromise. The division in Congress and the Nation is nearly equal on
							both sides. The argument on the free side is the moral and political
							duty of preventing the extension of Slavery in the immense Country from
							the Mississippi river to the South-Sea. The argument on the Slave side,
							is that Congress have no power by the Constitution to prohibit Slavery
							in any State, and the zealots say not in any territory. The proposed
							compromise is to admit Missouri, and hereafter Arkansaw, as States
							without any restrictions upon them regarding Slavery; but to prohibit
							the future introduction of Slaves in all territories of the United
							States North of 36:30 Latitude— I told these Gentlemen, that my opinion
							was, the question could be settled no otherwise than by a compromise—
							The regulation, exclusion, or abolition of Slavery in the system of our
							Union, is among the Powers reserved to the People of the several States
							by their separate Governments; though I have no doubt that Congress have
							Constitutional powers to prohibit any internal traffic in Slaves,
							between one State and another— In the States where Slavery does not
							exist, neither Congress, nor the State Legislature nor the People have
							any rightful power to establish it. For the admission into the Union of
							a State where no Slavery exists, Congress may prescribe as a condition
							that Slavery shall never be established in it; as they have done, to the
							States of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois; but where it exists, and where
							there are already Slaves in great numbers, as in Missouri and Arkansaw,
							the power of extirpating it is not given to Congress by the
							Constitution. To proscribe Slavery therefore in Missouri and Arkansaw I
							believe to be impracticable— But if a provision can be obtained
							excluding the introduction of Slaves into future territories, it will be
							a great and important point secured— I apprehend <pb type="ms" n="271"

							for which he gave the Note— I took this proposal for consideration, and
							am to give him an answer, to-morrow or the next day. I called at the

							found I could without difficulty make the necessary arrangements there.
								<persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Aspinwall</persRef> was at the Office; pressing for the settlement
							of his account and for the allowance of a per centage of 2 1/2 and 5 per

							some question made at the Comptroller’s Office whether such an allowance
							has heretofore been made. I called at the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef>. He directed me to see <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							and consult with him upon the answers to be given to <persRef
								ref="clarke-john2">Governor Clark</persRef> of Georgia; and upon the
							Letter to be written to <persRef ref="mitchell-david">D. B.
								Mitchell</persRef>— He said <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> who was
							Mitchell’s friend approved of the course which it was intended to
							pursue— I called at Calhoun’s Office; and he told me that he would write
							to him to-morrow, and send me a copy of his Letter— Calhoun added that
							he was himself convinced that Mitchell was guilty—that his conduct last
							winter, when the charge was first brought against him was not at all
							that which would have been natural to an innocent and honourable man— He
							came here last Winter, and was certainly treated with a very lenient
							hand. The other Letter from the Governor of Georgia requests that a
							Treaty may be held with the Creek Indians, to obtain a cession of Lands—
							Calhoun is strongly averse to this: says that very large cessions have
							lately been obtained by two Treaties, from the Creeks and Cherokees—
							That it would be very difficult if not impossible to obtain more from
							them now; and certainly not without paying more than the worth of the
							Lands. I had also some conversation with Calhoun, on the Slave question
							pending in Congress. He said that he did not think it would produce a
							dissolution of the Union, but if it should the South would be from
							necessity compelled to form an Alliance Offensive and Defensive with
							Great-Britain— I said that would be returning to the Colonial State; he
							said yes—pretty much; but it would be forced upon them— I asked him
							whether he thought, if by the effect of this alliance offensive and
							defensive, the population of the North, should be cut off from its
							natural outlet upon the Ocean, it would fall back upon its rocks bound
							hand and foot to starve, or whether it would not retain its powers of
							locomotion, to move Southward by Land. Then he said they would find it
							necessary to make their communities all military. I pressed the
							conversation no farther, but if the dissolution of the Union should
							result from the Slave question, it is as obvious as any thing that can
							be foreseen of futurity, that it must shortly afterwards be followed by
							the universal emancipation of the Slaves— A more remote but perhaps not
							less certain consequence would be the extirpation of the African race on
							this Continent, by the gradually bleaching process of intermixture;
							where the white portion is already so predominant, and by the
							destructive progress of emancipation, which like all great religious and
							political reformations is terrible in its means though happy and <pb
								type="ms" n="272"/>glorious in its end. Slavery is the great and
							foul stain upon the North-American Union; and it is a contemplation
							worthy of the most exalted soul, whether its total abolition is or is
							not practicable— If practicable, by what means it may be effected, and
							if a choice of means be within the scope of the object, what means would
							accomplish it, at the smallest cost of human sufferance— A dissolution
							at least temporary of the Union, as now constituted would be certainly
							necessary, and the dissolution must be upon a point involving the
							question of Slavery, and no other. The union might then be reorganized,
							on the fundamental principle of emancipation— This object is vast in its
							compass—awful in its prospects, sublime and beautiful in its issue. A
							life devoted to it would be nobly spent or sacrificed— This Conversation
							with Calhoun led me into a momentous train of reflection. It also
							engaged me so much that I detained him at his Office, insensibly to
							myself till near five O’Clock, an hour at least, later than his dining
							time— In the Evening, with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams, I

							not make them known more completely— It would be still agreeable to me
							to be silent upon the subject, if Harris had not made it my duty if
							called upon, to tell the whole truth under Oath, and made it necessary

							Two subjects were presented for their consideration; one the payment of
							what is called the Mississippi Stock; and the other the claim of certain
							holders of the three per Cent Stock, to its redemption at its nominal
							value— From the Statement of the Treasury Department, it appeared that
							funds sufficient have been received for the discharge of two thirds of
							the Mississippi Stock, and the measure proposed by the Secretary of the
							Treasury and adopted by the board was that 66 per Cent of all the
							Certificates of that Stock should be paid of in May next— There was some
							discussion of the question concerning the redemption of the three per
							Cent Stocks; and I came to the conclusion that the claim is in substance
							well founded, and that the public faith is unequivocally pledged, for
							the redemption at par of the three per Cents from the proceeds of the
							North-western Lands. The time however is not yet arrived when the
							obligation takes effect; and it may be perhaps protracted for many
							years— But I suggested the question, whether the Commissioners of the

							examination of the Acts of Congress defining their functions and
							circumscribing their power, the Chief-Justice immediately declared his
							opinion that it was not within our competency, and that the Claimants
								<pb type="ms" n="273"/>must resort to Congress— The meeting was over

							Representatives, where <persRef ref="randolph-john">John

							Wit, Fancy, Generous feelings, and malignant Passions, constitute a
							Chaos in his Mind, from which nothing orderly can ever flow— The House
							was in Committee of the whole; <persRef ref="cobb-thomas">Cobb of

								>Clay</persRef> the Speaker twice called Randolph to order— The

							t’other tack— It was useless to call him to order. He can no more keep
							order than he can keep silence. It was past four when he sat down—
							Twenty yards of tape-worm had come from him, but there was an endless
							length left within. <persRef ref="beecher-philemon">Beecher</persRef> of

							at the head of half the Union, despairing of ever being able to obtain
							the highest powers and honours of the whole— It is not easy to account
							for the course that King has pursued throughout this affair, without
							allowing something for the instigations of personal expectancy. He has
							probably been pushed forward, eagerly by his friends and he has been
							spurred into more violent exertions and has opened his heart to warmer
							hopes on this occasion than I think the event will justify. He reckons
							more upon the apparent ardour of the popular Sentiment against Slavery,
							to the North, than it is worth— The question to the North and in the
							free States is merely speculative; the People do not feel it in their
							persons or their purses. On the Slave side, it comes home to the
							feelings and interests of every man in the community— Hence if this
							question is ultimately decided as it will be in favour of Slavery in
							Missouri, the people in the free States will immediately acquiesce in
							the decision, and it will be impossible to keep the controversy alive.
