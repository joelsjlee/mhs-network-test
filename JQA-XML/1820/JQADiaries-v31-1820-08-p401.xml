								Herrera,</persRef> one of the most distinguished members of the

							has made here; and are now going to try their Fortune elsewhere. We all
							attended Church at <persRef ref="mccormick-andrew">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Cormick’s</persRef>— He read prayers
							for the tenth Sunday after Trinity, and his Sermon was from Genesis
							XXII.1.2. And it came to pass after these things that God did tempt
							Abraham, and said unto him, “Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am:
							And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest
							and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt
							offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.” It was a
							communion day Sermon which commenced by remarks, on the astonishing
							character of the Event therein commemorated, seemingly more suited to a
							cruel deity like Moloch, than to the gracious and merciful Jehovah— The
							subject then was considered according to the incidents attending it as
							related in the context; followed by practical reflections applicable to
							the auditory— The severity of the divine injunction, the terrible
							struggle in the heart of <persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef>
							between his duty of obedience to God, and his faith on one hand, and his
							affection for his child, his beloved son, the child of a miracle, the
							child of promise that in his seed all the nations of the Earth should be
							blessed, on the other, was well described—the submission of <persRef
								ref="isaac">Isaac</persRef> then upwards of thirty years of age; the
							pathetic occurrences of the Journey and of the Story till Abraham had
							the knife raised to bury it in the bowels of his child were all noticed—
							The interposition of the Angel at the moment of the Catastrophe, and the
							rewards of Abraham’s obedience, led to the practical reflections of
							Instruction to Christians, of reproof to Sinners, and of Consolation to
							the afflicted and bereaved which resulted from the subject— The
							Instruction was Faith and Obedience to the divine commands— Obedience,
							universal, willing and prompt. The reproof to sinners was for their
							disobedience; so inexcusable by its contrast to the submission of
							Abraham—the command to him requiring a conquest over the strongest
							affections and most virtuous feelings of nature; and the commands to
							them—being only the sacrifice of Passions which lead to wretchedness and
							destruction— The consolation to the bereaved, within the assurance given
							by God in the Event of this History, that he will reward the faithful,
							and has a power always ready to wipe the tears from the eyes of human
							sufferance. He concluded by considering this threatened but averted
							sacrifice, as the typical and prophetical <pb type="ms" n="403"
							/>representation of the great sacrifice of Jesus Christ; a sacrifice by
							God, of his only begotten, and beloved Son, upon the same spot. A
							sacrifice which no hand of an angel arrested; but which was actually
							consummated— The transition now was easy to an exhortation of attendance
							to the ordinance of the communion; which was earnest and vehement; but
							in substance the same which he gave on Whitsunday. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Cormick dwells with so much urgency upon
							this duty, and holds out the neglect of it as so criminal, that he
							almost startles me while I hear him. I do not however subscribe to his
							doctrine of the indispensable necessity of partaking of the dispensation
							of this ordinance— I recollected having once heard at New-York, a Sermon
							from this text, by the late <persRef ref="smith-samuel3">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef>, President of
							Princeton College, and found by truing to my Journal it was on the 17<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>of November 1805. and that my only
							remark upon it was, that it was a difficult subject— I have since then
							written some remarks upon it to <persRef ref="adams-george">my Son
								George</persRef>— The mystical part of it, the typical image of the
							sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the same mount is altogether beyond my
							comprehension— God was not the father of Jesus Christ, as Abraham was
							the father of Isaac— The term Son, as applied to Christ, in his relation
							to God the Father conveys a false idea to the mind— It is a figurative
							father; and if the sacrifice of his life in his human nature was
							painful; why did he ordain it as necessary? That omnipotence should
							suffer pain, is absurd; that it should deliberately inflict pain upon
							itself is ridiculous—that it should sacrifice itself to atone for the
							guilt of others incurred by its own predetermined acts and will, is at
							once absurd, ridiculous and unjust. Thus much for human reason— Faith is
							founded upon other promises— With <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"

								<persRef ref="carbery-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Carberry</persRef>, a member of the Common Council of the City of
							Washington— They are about beginning to build a City Hall; and he came
							to ask a Register of the Officers of the General Government, as last
							published; to put with some other documents into the corner Stone— I
							wrote several Letters concerning the collection of the State Laws, for
							the Department— By a Resolution of Congress of 23. September 1789. it is
							made the duty of the Secretary of State to procure from time to time,
							such of the Statutes of the several States as may not be in his Office—
							This Resolution has never been carried systematically into effect— The
							removals, changes, and fires, together with the British invasion in
							1814, and the want of system in the administration of the Department,
							had reduced its library almost to nothing. There were no regulations for
							keeping it. Any body took out Books from it, and no one was responsible
							for the return of them. They were accordingly all in broken sets—
								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> while acting in the Department had written a circular
							requesting the District Attornies to procure and forward the Statutes of
							the several States where they resided, which some of them had answered
							and some had not. Until the new Offices were built there was neither
							Library room nor Shelves nor Librarian— With the view of introducing a
							better order of things I had an apartment laid out in the new building
							to which the Office was last summer transferred, equal in extent to two
							of the other Rooms, and appropriated it to the Library. Shelves were
							procured for putting up the Books— I charged the youngest Clerk in the
							Department <persRef ref="thruston-thomas">Thruston</persRef> with the
							custody of the Library, and directed him to let no book go out without a
							minute of it being made, and notice given to the person taking it, that
							he must be responsible for its return— And now I undertook to obtain a
							collection of the State Statutes— I wrote last November a circular to
							all the District Attornies, requesting each of them to send me, a
							Statement of every edition of <pb type="ms" n="405"/>the Statutes of the
							State, whether in the Colonial Condition, or since Independence, and to
							procure and send me a copy of every one of them that could be obtained
							at a moderate price— The answers have been coming in from time to time
							ever since; and there are three or four from whom no answer is yet
							received. The pressure of other business, has made it impossible for me
							to attend to every Letter as it came in— I have now a Collection almost
							complete of the Statutes of the States, but there are still wanting
							those of Virginia, North-Carolina, Tennessee; and the territory of
							Missouri; and those of several other States are yet incomplete— To keep
							the collection complete when made, we must receive from twenty-four
							States, and two Territories, from year to year, and from some of the
							States twice a year, the Laws passed at every Session of the
							Legislature— To effect this I wrote last Winter a circular to the
							Governors of the States, requesting them to furnish the Department with
							a copy of their Laws from Session to Session, <unclear>and</unclear>
							suggesting to them the example of Massachusetts, which by a Resolution
							of the Legislature, sends four copies of its Laws, one for the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, one for each house of
							Congress, and one for the Library of Congress. Some of the Governors
							have complied—others have taken no notice of my Letter; and as the
							Governors of the States themselves are changing from year to year, and
							the successor will probably have no knowledge of my Letter to his
							predecessor, this expedient will not answer the purpose— I this day
							bethought myself of writing a circular to the Official Printer of the
							State Laws in every State; requesting him to furnish one copy of the
							Statutes from Session to Session—and I made a draft of such a circular—
							The <persRef ref="stanard-robert;beeson-jacob" type="multi">District
								Attorneys of Virginia</persRef> had suspended the execution of my
							orders to procure the respective Statutes, and in January had written
							Letters asking explanations of my first Letter. When theirs were
							received I was driven by other more urgent business, from immediately
							replying, and laid by their Letters for a moment of leisure which I have
							not found till this day— I now replied to them. It also occurred to me
							as necessary to draw up a Letter of Instruction to Thruston as keeper of
							the Library— This will require more leisure. It was near seven O’Clock
							when I dined— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi

						<p><date>15. IV:</date> About three this Morning there came up one of those
							terrific thunder showers, which here almost universally succeed a turn

							cloud met, rising from the West and proceeding slowly till it covered
							the horizon. There were in a space of fifteen minutes five dazzling

							Candle-light. From the experience of the two preceding summers I

							the brass chain by which it was suspended— It also brought the beam
							itself with violence down from the Agate upon which it was poised— I
							found therefore two faults in my own mode of making the experiments, and
							two faults in Pollock’s Scales— My errors were; in not perceiving before
							hand that the Scales were not strong enough to bear so heavy a weight—
							This was the greater, because <persRef ref="thruston-thomas"

							accident, which now happened; and the second that the Construction of
							the Scales is altogether too Slight, scarcely suitable to bear without
							straining, a weight of ten Pounds— I found I could not restore the ring

						<p><date>19. IV:15.</date> Bath in the Potowmack alone. Returned home just
							as the Sun rose. Took up my draft of a Report upon Weights and Measures,
							in which new Views present themselves the farther I proceed, and the
							more I meditate— The Resolutions of the two Houses calling for a Report,
							embrace three objects. 1. A Statement of the regulations of the several
							States— 2 Of the proceedings of foreign Nations to establish uniformity,
							of weights and measures 3. An opinion what measures it would be proper
							to adopt by the Government of the Union. The plan I have formed is to
							invert the order of the first and second branches of the Resolutions— To
							state first the Proceedings of foreign Nations; secondly the regulations
							of the States; and lastly the opinion of what ought to be done— But this
							opinion must be deduced 1. from abstract reasoning upon the nature of
							the subject. 2. From what is practicable 3. From the Constitutional
							powers of Congress, And the whole is to be connected together so that
							the opinion shall result from the abstract reasoning, and the experience
							of what is practicable proved by the result of the proceedings of other
							Nations and our own. This plan I adopted when I first began to draft the
							Report and I see no reason to change it; but the subject and is great
							and complicated, and in treating it I find “hills over hills and Alps on
							Alps arise.” At the <pb type="ms" n="408"/>Office, I had a large mail,
							and consequently, wrote only part of a Letter to the <persRef

							the <persRef ref="bulloch-archibald;bulloch-john" type="multi"

							and the connivence of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford</persRef> in regard to these most infamous transactions
							have forced me to push the subject again and again— Two of the
							Bulloch’s, one of whom is the collector of the Port of Savannah, have
							against them the most violent presumptive evidence of having committed
							crimes punishable with death— <persRef ref="bulloch-james">The
								third</persRef> has strong presumptive evidence against him of

								ref="bulloch-hester">the daughter</persRef> of the present <persRef
								ref="elliot-john">Senator Elliot</persRef>; they are all men of
							consequence in the State of Georgia, and open standing puffers of
							Crawford’s pretensions to the Presidency— It sickens me to the heart to
							be forced to action this case; but a duty paramount to every other
							consideration urges me; and I will not shrink from it. Read the

							Frye says too that Calhoun makes profuse allowances for extra-services

							this case— Frye has been upwards of twenty years a Clerk in the
							Paymaster’s Office, always faithful, assiduous and correct. The case of

							He was perfectly satisfied with the dispositions of the Executive; but
							the Nation must be answerable to others for the Acts of its People.
							These depredations had excited great resentment among the Portuguese,
							which others (the English) were always ready to inflame— I told him they
							had the same complaint against others as against us— The Pirates were of
							all Nations— He said the same complaints had been made to England who
							had given ample satisfaction— They had hung some of the Pirates, and did
							not admit the Artigas flag into their Ports— I finally told him that the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> would decide upon
