						<p><date>2. V:</date><persRef ref="worthington-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Worthington</persRef> of Ohio, called
							at my house this Morning. <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning</persRef> came by appointment
							to the Office at two O’Clock, and I had with him a Coversation of more
							than two hours upon the Slave-trade. He renewed and urged the proposal
							heretofore made by the British Government, that the United States should
							accede to the principle of Treaties made by Great-Britain with the
							Netherlands and Portugal by which the vessels of either Nation are
							allowed to be searched by the Captains of the armed vessels of another;
							and two mixed Courts of Commissioners are instituted to try all such
							captures— We have rejected this proposal on two grounds; one a want of
							Constitutional authority to establish such a Court, and the other; as
							disapproving the principle of allowing the search—in time of peace, of
							our merchant vessels by the armed Cruizers of another Nation. The
							British Government have been endeavouring to obtain from the members of
							the European alliance their assent to such stipulations, but hitherto
							without success. France has been the most decisive in her objections—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning re-urged the subject with
							much earnestness, and endeavoured to answer objections. He suggested
							that one of the two reciprocal tribunals might be established within the
							United States— I stated to him that besides the two broad and decisive
							reasons, which had been alledged, there were others which it was best in
							candour to mention— The first was the general Extra-European policy of
							the United States; a policy which they had always pursued as best suited
							to their own interests and best adapted to harmonize with those of
							Europe— This policy had also been that of Europe, which had never
							considered the United States as belonging to her system— The European
							Alliance, consisting of the five principal powers had since the
							overthrow of the French Revolutionary domination, regulated the Affairs
							of all Europe; without ever calling the United States to their
							consultations— It was best for both parties, that they should continue
							to do so—for if the United States, should become a member of the body,
							they would even now be a power entitled to great influence, and in a
							very few years must become a first rate power in the League— They would
							bring to it some principles, not congenial to those of the other
							members, and those principles would lead to discussions tending to
							discord, rather than to harmony. It would also have a tendency to lead
							them into partial combinations with one or another of the great powers,
							parties to the alliance— Another objection was the peculiar character of
							the principle to which it was desired that we should accede— We had had
							one War with great Britain for exercising what she alone claims of all
							the Nations of the Earth, as a right—search of neutral vessels in time
							of War, to take out men— We had endeavoured both at the negotiation for
							peace and since to come to some agreement of principle with Great
							Britain, but had found it impracticable. It was a point upon which more
							than any other, not only the People but the Government of the United
							States were sensitive—and which would fix us in the determination, in no
							case, to yield the right of search, in time of Peace— He said there did
							not appear to be any analogy between the two cases. By the Treaties the
							right of search given was entirely reciprocal. It was limited and
							restricted in the most cautious and precise manner— Portugal and the
							Netherlands had assented to it; and he thought the objections which we
							made, might rather have been expected from them, than from France; and
							rather from the Swiss Cantons than from the United States— That Nations
							justly conscious of their power had less reason than others to fear the
							abuse of any concession— I told him that all concession of principle
							tended to encourage encroachment; and if naval Officers were once
							habituated to search the vessels of other Nations in time of peace, for
							one thing, they would be still more encouraged to practice it for
							another thing in time of War— That as to the concessions of Portugal and
							the Netherlands, they might be supposed to be actuated by a sense of
							dependence upon, or of obligation to Great-Britain— He thought this was
							rather imaginary than real; and that neither Portugal, nor the
							Netherlands were of a disposition at all accommodating to Great-Britain.
							He said also that the European alliance could hardly be said to have for
							its object the regulation of European affairs; at least it was only with
							reference to certain specific objects— He asked if our principle of
							rejecting the measures as <pb type="ms" n="427"/>concerted by the
							European allies, was so general as to induce a refusal to co-operate
							with them in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> measure— I said no— We had
							formed no such determination— There might be a concert of measure,
							proposed to which our objections would not apply, and that a free and
							mutual communication of what might be done on either side would
							contribute much to the attainment of the common object. But I observed
							that excepting the Communications which we had received from
							Great-Britian there had been none to us from any member of the European
							Alliance; and as the objections made principally by France to the
							British project of reciprocal captures, were much the same as those
							which we had urged against the thing itself, I thought it right to tell
							him that this coincidence was not the result of any consultation. There
							had been between the United States and France no communication whatever
							relating to the Slave trade— He said that though gratified
								<unclear>to</unclear> learn that we did not reject all concert of
							operation, he was apprehensive that the expedient which we
								d<unclear>id</unclear> reject was the only one that could prove
							effectual— For so long as hoisting a flag, was sufficient to shelter the
							Slave-trader from search and capture, it was scarcely possible that any
							vigilance or care should avail. He add<unclear>ed</unclear> that as it
							was the earnest desire of the British Government to soften the
							asperities existing in the feeling of the two Countries towards each
							other, and was convinced that the same disposition existed here, there
							could be nothing done which would more strongly have that tendency, than
							our accession to these arrangements— I said that the disposition to
							conciliate was perfectly reciprocal, and very earnest on our part— That
							he must take all I had said to him in this Conversation as expressing
							only my private opinions— As soon as the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> should return to the City, I should report to
							him the substance of it, and should receive his instructions what
							further answer to give. He asked if I was willing that in the mean time
							he should report to his Government the purport of our conference this
							day—to which I answered, certainly— I called at the Register, <persRef
								ref="nourse-joseph">Nourse’s</persRef> Office, to transfer United
							States 6 per Cent Stocks to <persRef ref="mceuen-thomas"

							last night, which he attributed to its having been undermined by

							cellar for the addition to our house, and to enquire whether Van Coble
							was working under my directions or by contract— I told him, by contract,
							and that I had given him no authority to encroach upon the neighbours
							grounds— He said he should then apply to Van Coble to repair the damage
							done by the falling down of the Wall— Van Coble was here afterwards and
							said that far from undermining he had not dug within several inches to
							the extent of my ground— That the Wall had fallen because it was only
							one brick thick, and had nothing but clay and sand for cement, without
							mortar. This was the fact, confirmed by <persRef ref="forrest-richard"
								>R. Forrest</persRef> and others who had remarked the dangerous
							manner of building the wall when the house was built— The whole side of

								Homans</persRef> the Chief Clerk, who noted its presentation— Cruft

							over <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> that he believed him entirely
							innocent, and he had written so here: and he Crawford had requested that

							punishment are marked with desperation— It is impossible he should
							believe him innocent— But at heart he thinks Slave-smuggling no crime,
							and suppose his own political fortune depends upon Mitchell’s being
							cleared— Wirt said he was embarrassed how to make up an opinion, which
							would not implicate Crawford for neglect— He Wirt had given two years
							ago an opinion upon the same case in which he recommended that a
							Prosecution should by direction of the Treasury Department be commenced—
							Instead of which Crawford wrote, directing that the documents should be
							all submitted to the Court before which it was supposed the prosecution
							had been commenced— This supposition was directly contrary both to the
							fact, and to the recommendation of the Attorney-General; but the
							consequence was that Mitchell escaped for the time: <persRef

							Understanding.”— The Sermon was an ingenious and elegant exposition of
							the whole Chapter, which is full of the obscurities of oriental imagery
							as well as of their transcendent beauties— There is a connection between
							every part of the chapter contrasting wisdom and understanding with
							riches, and with learning— It is a dissertation to shew that neither the
							depth of the sea, nor the bowels of the Earth, can yield the knowledge
							or the price of wisdom— The preacher noticed the internal evidence of
							the chapter, that it was written in an age of refinement and
							civilization; by a person acquainted with the process of mining; at a
							time when the precious stones were in high demand and value, and when
							the extraction and use of Coal for fuel were habitual— <persRef

							patelinage that belongs to the Spanish character. He is withal not a
							little vain, and fancies himself very profound. The substance of his

							this time or very shortly would be in possession of Carthagena, and of
							all Terra firma. That <persRef ref="bolivar-simon">Bolivar</persRef> was
							with <persRef ref="montilla-mariano">Montilla</persRef>, and that there
							was a perfect good understanding between them. That <persRef
								ref="morillo-pablo">Morillo</persRef> the Spanish General must very
							shortly be compelled to evacuate the Country; but that the European
							Sovereigns were hostile to the cause of the South-Americans, and that
							Bolivar preferred a very intimate connection with the United States. He
							then went into a long argument to prove that there could be no rivalry
							of Commerce between the United States and the Republic of Columbia, the
							only production of export common to them both being tobacco, and that of
							Varinas being so different from any of ours that there could be no
							competition between them. That between the Coast of Terra firma, and
							Mexico, and other parts of South-America, there must always be an
							immense coasting trade; and as the Colombians themselves were not
							navigators having neither shipping nor Seamen, the carrying of this
							trade might be secured by Treaty to the people of the United States—
							This idea was however indistinctly and obscurely presented—apparently as
							a bait, and with qualifications affording means of withdrawing from it,
							if a disposition should appear on our side to accept it. I listened to
							him with all the patience and attention that I could command, without
							entering into discussion upon any of his proposals, but finally
							requesting him to address them to me in writing, which he promised he
							would— I dined at <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">W. S.

							Such challenges always mortify me, by testing a cold and sluggish

							with her, and I wrote the following lines to be covered with the
							geranium leaves, and the myrtle.</p>
						<p><lg>
								<l>Leaves of unfading verdure! here remain!</l>
								<l>Myrtle of beauty! still thy place retain!</l>
								<l>Still o’er the page, your hope-ting’d foliage spread;</l>
								<l>Imprison’d still, your genial fragrance shed.</l>
								<l>But Oh! could language, worthy of the theme,</l>
								<l>Give instant utterance to fond fancy’s dream;</l>
								<l>When your frail forms, <hi rend="italic">her</hi> gentle hand
									shall raise,</l>
								<l>The page should blossom with perennial praise:</l>
								<l>A sweeter fragrance than your own should rise,</l>
								<l>And more than mortal verdure greet her eyes.</l>
							</lg></p>
						<p>I consider this as one of the brightest of my poetical effusions, and it
							may serve as a sample for the rest. It will at least be the cause of wit
							in others, and breed better contributions for the Album.</p>

							nature of the difficulty arising from the Constitution of the United
							States, to the establishment of any tribunal before whom citizens of the
							union should be amenable upon penal Statutes; from which tribunal there
							should be no appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the
							judges of which should not be impeachable by our House of
							Representatives and before our Senate— I also went largely into the
							objection arising from the analogy between the right of visitation and
							search proposed to be given by the Convention, and the claim of G
							Britain to the right of visitation and search to impress men— The
							conversation was altogether free and unreserved; the discussion
							invariably temperate, and on his part full of courtesy— He suggested
							various expedients for obviating the Constitutional difficulty—thought
							that the American members of the tribunal might be subject to
							impeachment as Officers of the United States—alledged by was of
							precedent the Commissions to which we had agreed by Treaty to submit
							questions of property and territorial rights, and could not clearly
							discern the difference between these questions of property and trials
							for forfeitures. He contested the analogy between the right of search
							and seizure proposed, and the claim of search for impressment; hinting
							some regret that we should even harbour the sentiment that there was any
							analogy between them, or bring that subject into view at-all, in this
							case, which I told him I should certainly not have done on its own
							account; but observed that it was indispensable to unfold with candour
							and sincerity, all our objections to the proposed Convention. He finally
							suggested that if we could not agree to the proposals of Great Britain
							for cooperation; his Government wished us to offer any proposals on our
							part tending to the same object, upon which I told him the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> would deliberately consider
							the subject, and if any proposal should occur to him, as suitable to be
							made, I should communicate it to him hereafter— To vary the
							conversation, I told him there were other subjects upon which I believed
							a concert of operations between the United States and Great-Britain
							would be useful to both Nations, and mentioned the Report upon weights
							and Measures for which I have calls from both houses of Congress. I
							observed that this was a subject upon which the British Government have
							been almost incessantly engaged more than sixty years without doing any
							thing—that there were now Royal Commissioners charged with the duty of
							reporting a plan for uniformity, who had already reported in part, and
							were to report further— That they had reported generally against any
							considerable changes in the existing system; but recommended slight
							ones, which I hoped would not be adopted— My report would be against any
							change here, unless concerted with the same change in England, so that
							we might not by grasping at the shadow of one uniformity lose the
							substance of another which we possess. I entered into some detail upon
							the principles of my intended report, and told him I should send him a
							copy of it, when printed by order of Congress. He had not seen the
							report of the British Commissioners and I promised to send it to him— In
							the confusion of our removal, we had no dinner prepared to day, and
							finally sent for it to <persRef ref="julien-honore">Julien</persRef>— We
							dined between 7 and 8 in the Evening.</p>

							had scarcely returned to the Office, when <persRef
								ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef> called, and kept me two hours or more upon the
							subject of the Slave-trade. He brought with him a long written paper,
							containing what he had understood as the substance of our former
							conversations, which he said he had informally drawn up, and wished to
							read to me, to ascertain that he had correctly understood the purport of
							my observations— He read it accordingly. There were several very
							important variations in the paper, from what I had actually said; all of
							which I successively noticed— The first was an inference of his own,
							which he had apparently written down as an experiment, to see what I
							should say to it— The remark was almost at the beginning of the paper,
							and was an avowal of satisfaction that in reviewing the Conversation
							between us he had perceived that none of the objections which had been
							suggested by me to the project of Great-Britain applied to the plan
							itself— I stopped him immediately and said that was more than I thought
							could safely be said. I had told him there was one, certain
							Constitutional difficulty which we saw no way of getting over— This of
							itself was decisive for the present— I had not thought it necessary to
							mention that there was another, which might prove no less embarrassing.
							I then read to him the fifth Article of Amendment to the Constitution,
							which amounts to an express prohibition to subjecting any Citizen of the
							United States to trial before such a tribunal as that proposed. I said
							further that the objection to the principle of admitting the right of
							search by foreign Officers in time of peace, for its analogy to search
							for impressment in time of War, was an objection to the plan itself— He
							then commenced a discussion upon this point, and said that I had been so
							long and so fully conversant with it, that he was sure I knew and
							appretiated the merits of their side of the question;—I knew that it was
							on the part of Great-Britain a conviction of necessity which compelled
							her to adhere to what she considered as a right— When she is at war, the
							temptation and opportunity is so great for a portion of her Seamen to
							come into the merchant service of the United States, that without some
							controul over them, the danger to her was vital and he went through the
							usual topics of the British doctrine on this controversy— I told him
							that it was not my wish to debate the point— We had more than once
							exhausted the argument with his Government— We had endeavoured to adjust
							it at Ghent— We had renewed the effort twice since the War; and by
							various Ministers— We greatly regretted that the differences of opinion
							and of principle between the parties were so radical, that they had
							found all compromise of it impracticable. But such having been the issue
							we were in no wise disposed to renew the subject at present; we
							acquiesced in the result so far as to have concluded to say no more
							about it— The question had no immediate <pb type="ms" n="438"/>practical
							interest connected with it; and our hopes were that if Great-Britain
							should again be engaged in a naval War, she would of her own accord give
							such instructions to her naval officers as would prevent the question
							from arising— We knew it depended entirely upon her, and we were willing
							to hope, her government would not be disposed to seek a contest with us—
							But we knew also that it depended upon the temper of her administration,
							and that every change of that would endanger our peace. We went over the
							whole ground of impressment, and as usual to no purpose— His paper
							concluded with the remark, that if our objections to the mode of
							co-operation proposed by Great-Britain were insuperable, she had reason
							to expect we should bring forward some propositions on our part— I told
							him I should submit the whole subject to the Consideration of the
							President; and if any thing should occur to him as suitable to be
							proposed, I should advise him, Canning of it— It was between six and
							seven O’Clock when I came home.</p>

							four ounces. I filled it with several parcels the produce of different
							fields, and found a difference between them in weight amounting to half
							an ounce. I also weighed a penny weight Troy by them and found it vary
							from 40 to 50 kernels. The specific gravity of wheat therefore differs
							at least to the amount of one eighth; but the result of the experiments
							does not shew any settled proportion, between the average weight of each
							kernel, and the weight of a given quantity in measure for the weight of
							my cup full of one parcel 50 kernels of which went to a <hi
								rend="strikethrough">grain</hi> penny Troy weight was the same
							within ten grains as the same cup full of another parcel of which 40
							kernels balanced a penny weight. But decisive results can only be drawn
							from multiplied experiments.</p>

						<p><date>30. III:30.</date> A <persRef ref="canne-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Canne</persRef> from Baltimore called
							this morning at my house, upon private business, with certain papers;
							but others were necessary for the purpose upon which he came, which I
							advised him to procure and forward to the Department. Young <persRef
								ref="bourne-george">G. S. Bourne</persRef> came again to renew his
							solicitation for an appointment— <persRef ref="davis-isaac">Isaac P.
								Davis</persRef> of Boston called at the Office— <persRef
								ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef> came and we had a conversation of two or three
							hours which began upon weights and measures and thence digressed to the
							general state of European Politics— I had sent him the first Report of
							the Commissioners of the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince
								Regent</persRef>, dated 24. June 1819. which he returned yesterday,
							with a Note mentioning that he should this day call, to have some
							conversation with me concerning the subject. He had paid little
							attention to it, and understood little of it. I told him that as it was
							of common interest to the British Nation, and to the people of the
							United States; as his Government were occupied in the search of
							uniformity as well as ours; and as my report contained views somewhat
							different from those of any English writer upon the history of English
							weights and measures, and English Laws relating to them, I should send
							him a copy of it, when published, and proposed to send a copy of it to
							the President of the Royal Society. He said he found that the general
							principle of the Report of the English Commissioners coincided with
							mine; that is they are averse to any material change. I said I had been
							happy to find them adopting that general principle, and wished they had
							carried it through. But they did propose changes, which I hoped would
							not be sanctioned without further consideration. There were two
							coincidences in the English system of weights and measures which I
							deemed of the highest importance—One was that the Avoirdupois Pound
							weighed exactly 7000 Grains Troy, and the other that a cubic foot of
							Spring water, weighed 1000 ounces avoirdupois— The uniformity and unity
							of Standard for the whole system hung upon these two coincidences— The
							Commissioners proposed changes which would destroy them altogether— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning took a minute of these two
							observations which he said he he would communicate to his Government— On
							the present state of European politics our Conversation was on my part
							free, and on his very cautious and reserved— I told him, I was much
							gratified to see that the British Cabinet had disclaimed all intention
							of interposing by force in the changes which had taken place in Spain,
							Portugal and Naples: but that it seemed to me they would find it very
							difficult to adhere to that system— There were symptoms of a separation
							between the kingdom of Naples and the Island of Sicily. Austria was
							marching troops, defensively to guard her own Italian territories, or
							offensively against Naples— If the plan was only defensive, would it be
							adequate? If offensive, Austria must conquer Naples, and after
							conquering must hold it as a conquest— How would this suit the views of
							Great Britain, of France, of Russia? how would it stand with reference
							to the newly settled balance of power? In Portugal, there were symptoms,
							which threatened the sovereignty of the house of Braganza— Great-Britain
							was bound by Treaty to guarantee the possession of Portugal to them— The
							Sceptres of all the European continental Monarchs were turning to ashes
							in their hands— Their Crowns were dropping from their heads. the very
							instruments of power upon which they were leaning pierced their hands
							and sides. Government was melting into its original elements— Would it
							be possible for England to witness this in all its consequences and
							remain quiescent? And how could she act in cases where the struggle as
							it now appears is for free and liberal institutions against absolute
							power?— He said that Great-Britain had never taken part against liberal
							institutions, but on the contrary had been contending for the liberties
							of Europe. But it was scarcely possible to foresee what would be the
							course of the Present agitations in Europe, but he hoped they would not
							disturb the subsisting peace. The establishment of Constitutional
							Government could not only be unopposed by Great-Britain, but would be
							congenial to the wishes of her Statesmen <pb type="ms" n="440"/>but
							whether the proceedings for obtaining these desirable objects would be
							marked with the principles of good order and of humanity necessary to
							render them effectual was naturally a subject of great solicitude—
							Before leaving me, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning repeated an
							observation which he had made to me once before—that he should always
							receive any observations that I may make to him with a just deference to
							my advance of years—over his— This is one of those equivocal
							compliments, which according to <persRef ref="sterne-lawrence"
								>Sterne</persRef>, a Frenchman always returns with a bow— It was
							quite dark before he left me; but I called at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> before going home— It was
							near seven when we dined.</p>
