						<p><date>1. V:</date> Friday. <persRef ref="morse-jedidiah">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Morse</persRef> called this Morning at
							my Office— He has been the last Summer, upon a mission partly from the
							Society for propagating the gospel in foreign parts, and partly from the
							Government of the United States, among our North-western tribes of
							Indians, and is here to make his report to the <pb type="ms" n="458"
							/>Department of War. He is occupied also upon the publication of a new
							Edition of his Geography, and wished for some information respecting the
							boundaries claimed by the United States. I told him that our boundary
							was not definitively settled, and the definition of it in the new
							Edition of his book must depend on the final determination of Spain upon
							the Florida Treaty— If that should be ratified, our Southern, and
							South-western boundary would be defined from the gulph of Mexico to the
							South-Sea— Should Spain refuse the ratification our Southern boundary
							would remain as it has been, unsettled— Our claim was to the Rio Bravo
							del Norte, the course of which I shewed him on the antient maps which we
							have at the Department— And I referred him to my discussion of the title
							with <persRef ref="onis-luis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Onis</persRef> in 1818— I also referred him to the Convention of 20.
							October 1818 with Great-Britain for the Northern and North-western
							Boundary. He made enquiries also concerning returns of the Census, and
							whether he could be furnished with abstracts from them before they
							should be reported to Congress, which they cannot be till the next
							Session. I told him it was doubtful whether I could allow this. I
							thought the official Report, must first be made to Congress. He
							recommended <persRef ref="morse-richard">one of his Sons</persRef>, for
							any assistance that I may want to make abstracts from the returns of
								manufactures—<persRef ref="barbour-james"> M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p><date>2. VI:</date> In the early parts of the Session of Congress, both
							houses are in the practice of making holidays of the Saturday, by
							adjourning over from Friday to Monday. There are therefore always on
							those days numerous visitors at the public offices— I had this day
								<persRef ref="dana-samuel">S. W. Dana</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="johnson-richard">R. M. Johnson</persRef> of the Senate—
								<persRef ref="edwards-henry">H. W. Edwards</persRef>, <persRef

								ref="hendricks-william">William Hendricks</persRef>, members of the

							delegate from the territory of Michigan, who brought me a Letter from
							the late delegate <persRef ref="woodbridge-william"
							>Woodbridge</persRef>— Edwards came to enquire whether a new appointment
							would be made of a district Attorney in Connecticut, or whether the
							present Attorney—<persRef ref="huntington-hezekiah">Hezekiah
								Huntington</persRef> would be nominated for re-appointment. His
							Commission will expire in a few weeks— Edwards said he had no complaint
							to make against Huntington, nor any objection to state against his
							re-appointment; but if another person was to be appointed he should wish
							to present the name of one, whom he could pledge himself to be in every
							respect perfectly well qualified for the office— I told him I did not
							know, what were the <persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>
							intentions, in this matter; but if they should be not to renominate
							Huntington, he Edwards should have notice, in time to recommend the
							person to whom he now alluded— I observed that the rule of the President
							with regard to all Offices, which expired by limitation, was to
							re-nominate the same officer, unless there were special circumstances
							requiring a change. Whether they existed in this case, I did not know,
							perhaps the President might— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hill came
							for some information, respecting the progress of the Commissioners under
							the fifth Article of the Treaty of Ghent— He spoke also something of
							general politics— Hill is a man of moderate character and good
							dispositions—without much energy. Dana, has been more than twenty years
							in succession a member of Congress—but this is his last Session. His
							time of service, expires with this Congress, and <persRef
								ref="boardman-elijah">a successor</persRef> has already been chosen
							to supply his place in the next. He <pb type="ms" n="459"/>is a man of
							talents and integrity, of cheerful humour and pleasant manners, a little
							tinged with levity, and a little addicted to flattery. His Conversation
							is amusing, and he has wit and humour— His manner is to treat every
							thing apparently in joke. He came now to make some enquiries about
							expenditures in the public offices— Hendricks came to recommend the
							re-appointment of <persRef ref="vawter-john">John Vawter,</persRef> as
							Marshal for the District of Indiana. There have been complaints against
							him, which he appears to have repelled; but the President has not yet
							decided to renominate him. Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M.
							Johnson came with an order from <persRef ref="todd-charles">C. S.
								Todd</persRef> who was appointed to go last Spring to Venezuela, but
							who has yet reached no further than the Island of Margarita. Todd asks
							for a translator, or interpreter, or to come home in the Spring.

								<persRef ref="jennings-unknown2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							number of visits. To <persRef ref="edwards-ninian">N. Edwards</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="walker-freeman">Freeman Walker</persRef>, Senators
							from Illinois and Georgia lodging at <persRef ref="peyton-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Peyton’s</persRef>— Edwards is still
							afflicted with the influenza, which continues to prevail almost
							universally. I have it yet myself, slightly, with the ordinary symptoms
							only of a cold, but with the peculiarity that it seems to be
							intermitting; occasionally disappearing for three or four days and then
							returning. Walker is a young man, and enjoys a high reputation for
							abilities and integrity. He has also a handsome person, and pleasing
							deportment. Edwards says that in the party controversies of Georgia,
							which are exceedingly violent, Walker is neutral. The heads of the two
							parties, are <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> the Secretary of
							the Treasury, and <persRef ref="clarke-john2">John Clark</persRef>,
							Governor of Georgia. Clark and Crawford have fought one duel, in which
							Crawford was wounded in the left hand. About two months since Clark
							published a pamphlet containing a history of the feud between him and
							Crawford which is of nearly twenty years standing— The narrative
							exhibits Crawford in the most odious light; as sacrificing every
							principle to his ambition, and states a series of facts supported by
							documents, so very disadvantageous to Crawford’s character, that it
							seemed to require an answer— None however has yet appeared— Clark
							complains that at the duel, Crawford, countenanced by his second,
							refused to take another shot, merely because his left hand was disabled;
							and that he afterwards declined fighting him on a second Challenge. As
							Crawford had already killed <persRef ref="vanalen-peter">one
								man</persRef> in a duel, these refusals to fight are more to his
							credit than his disadvantage— But the whole tissue of his conduct
							towards Clark, as stated in the pamphlet has been altogether
							unjustifiable. He proves, beyond reasonable doubt, that the attack upon
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, and through
							him upon me; in the affair of the Seminole War, was commenced,
							organized, and instigated by Crawford. But he more than insinuates that
							Crawford was concerned with the Indian agent <persRef
								ref="mitchell-david">Mitchell</persRef> in smuggling African Slaves
							into Georgia, from Amelia Island— This I totally disbelieve— The
							pamphlet has produced an effect unfavourable to Crawford’s reputation as
							a man, and the present state of the Treasury does him no credit as a
							financier— His friends however are numerous, persevering, and well
							trained to political intrigue— Edwards thinks that Walker will be at the
							head of a third party in Georgia. I also visited at Georgetown <persRef
								ref="otis-harrison">H. G. Otis</persRef>, Senator from
							Massachusetts, <persRef ref="king-rufus">R. King</persRef> from
							New-York, and <persRef ref="gorham-benjamin">B. Gorham</persRef> the new

						<p><date>4. III:30.</date> This was a rainy day, and I had as visitors at
							the office only <persRef ref="lee-william">William Lee</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="wyer-edward">E. Wyer</persRef>. My office hours were
							spent in the library, weighing various samples of wheat, the Washington
							City weights, and the water containable in the French Litre. The
							experiments with the wheat, are not entirely satisfactory. The weight of
							the kernels differ from 30 to 50 to a penny-weight Troy, <pb type="ms"
								n="460"/>and the specific gravity of the kernels is not exactly in
							proportion to their bulk. The corporation of the city of Washington
							lately sent <persRef ref="leonard-jacob">Leonard</persRef> the Sealer of
							weights and Measures to Baltimore to compare and correct them by the
							standards there. Their avoirdupois pound weighed only 6970 grains
							Troy—and was therefore 30 grains too light— He has now brought it back
							plumbed, and weighing ten grains too much, or 7010 grains— The two pound
							weight is 24 grains and the four pound 62 grains too heavy. My principal
							object however this day was to ascertain the weight and cubical contents
							of the French litre— <persRef ref="hassler-ferdinand">Hassler</persRef>
							brought from France two standard brass Kilogrammes, and two litres of
							the same metal, made by <persRef ref="fortin-jean">Fortin</persRef>—One
							of each of which has been lent me from the Department of War— The
							Kilogramme weighs 15435 grains Troy, which is three grains less than my
							Kilogramme in a nest; which I brought from Paris. The French Litre is by
							Law a cylindrical vessel of 86 millimetres diameter and 172 Millimetres
							depth— Assuming <persRef ref="katers-henry">Captain Katers</persRef>
							admeasurement of the Metre as correct and taking it for 39.37079 inches
							English—then the diameter of the Litre is 3.386 inches, and its depth
							6.772 inches— Its cubical contents then must be 60.979. inches, which
							may with all possible accuracy be set down for 61— Now the Brass Litre
							Modele, made by Fortin, measured with all possible attention upon
								<persRef ref="troughton-edward">Troughton’s</persRef> scale was
							3.4167 inches in diameter and 6.6710 inches deep— Its contents thus are
							61.1637 inches—the diameter being more and the depth less than perfect
							accuracy would require, and the result giving about 1/6 of a cubic inch,
							more than the standard— This Litre, filled with rain water, at the
							temperature of 40 degrees of <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel"
								>Fahrenheit’s</persRef> thermometer; being precisely that of its
							greatest density, and the atmosphere of the room being at the same time
							at 45. contained 15402 grains Troy of Water—to which two additions are
							to be made—one of 19 grains for the weight of the air contained in the
							Litre when weighed before filling it with water, and the other of 8
							grains, for additional weight of the water at 10 of <persRef
								ref="reaumur-rene">Reaumur</persRef> or 54 1/2 of Fahrenheit, being
							the temperature at which the Litre is to contain an exact Kilogramme—
							With these allowances Fortin’s Litre contains 15429 grains Troy, of rain
							water; which is 6 grains less than the standard Kilogrammes brought by
							Hassler, 9 grains less than my Kilogramme, and 16 grains less than its
							weight as compared with the old pound poids de Mare— My result makes the
							apparent specific gravity of my rain water 252 1/2 grains Troy to the
							cubical inch. These experiments must be more than once repeated.</p>

							principle that I considered the plan too extensive for the circumstances
							and prospects of this place, and that money, given for an object of
							which the end was so disproportioned to the means would not be usefully
							bestowed. This was a delicate and disagreeable communication to make;
							but in the public situation, that I occupy scarcely a week passes
							without bringing its subscription paper. I make it a rule <pb type="ms"

								Morse</persRef> called again at the Office— He is about to return to
							New-Haven— The D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> is a man of considerable
							ability, cramped and trammeled by a vicious religious education— He was
							born and educated in Connecticut, but more than thirty years ago, was
							settled as a Minister at Charlestown, Massachusetts. Bred to the most
							straightest sect of the Calvinistic creed, he has drilled his faith in
							special providences to aquiescence of mind in the grossest absurdities—
							Living in the immediate vicinity of Boston, whether the fashion of
							Religion has of late been running to an opposite excess, he has more
							than once been drawn into controversy and like all religious polemics
							has displayed an intolerant temper. At the same time he has taken in the
							things of this world an interest deeper than the general opinion
							indulges to persons of the clerical profession— He has devoted the
							leisure of his life chiefly to Geography. Before his settlement at
							Charlestown he had published a volume of American Geography with
							encouraging success. Many Editions of this work have since been
							published, and every revisal gives him a new copy-right— He has also
							thrown it into various forms, sometimes by turning it into a Gazetteer,
							and sometimes reducing it to an abridgment— He also associated with
							another Clergyman, a Religious and political fanatic by the name of
								<persRef ref="parish-elijah">Parish</persRef>, in publishing an
							abridged History of New-England, intended for a school-book. But its old
							woman’s tales of special providences were too ridiculous— All these
							labours had a direct eye to profit, but they did not withdraw the Doctor
							from the religious field— He commenced and carried on a War against the
							Unitarians of Boston, till he found his own Congregation deserting and
							taking part against him— Some of them went off and built a new Church
							where they settled a Minister with a different Creed. With the remnant
							he fell into questions about his Salary, and finally parted from them
							last year, I fear without being desired. He returned to his primitive
							residence at New Haven, and has become a missionary among the Indians.
							He is a man of indefatigable industry, and if his religion were more
							liberal, or his practice less worldly minded would present a more
							consistent and even a more respectable character— <persRef

						<p><date>9. VI.</date> I repeated my experiments in the Library of the
							Department upon the weight of Water containable in the French Standard
							Litre— <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheits</persRef>
							Thermometer stood in the room at 50. I had several buckets brought
							filled with River Water at 40. Rain Water at 46 and Pump Water at 54.
							Neither of them was therefore at the temperature of the atmosphere in
							the room— The river Water was no doubt of the temperature of the
							atmosphere where it was drawn, and the rain of that where it had fallen—
							The pump water was several degrees warmer. The Litre is a cylinder of
							polished brass of an inch thick, the edge round its upper border being
							perfectly flat. There is with it a disk of ground glass of diameter just
							more than that of the outer edge of the Litre. In filling the vessel, by
							the natural property of fluids the liquor forms a convex surface at the
							top, rising at the centre before it overflows at the borders— When thus
							full, without overflow the glass disk is slided over the top of the
							Litre, entirely covering it, and excluding every bubble of air. The
							vessel then through the transparent glass disk looks to the eye as if it
							were empty, but such is the cohesion of the water to the glass, that the
							Litre with its contents weighing upwards of seven pounds Troy weight may
							be lifted by the edges of the glass disk alone, without separating from
							it. I first weighed in the Scales the Litre itself, with the glass disk
							and found them weigh 4 Pounds 6 ounces 12 pennyweight 8 grains <pb
								type="ms" n="463"/>Troy— Then leaving those balancing weights in the
							scale, after filling the Litre with Water, I added weights to balance
							it, and thus found that it contained 15400 grains of rain, 15404 grains
							of Pump, and 15405 grains of river water— The principal remark I make on
							this result is of the very slight difference between the specific
							gravity of the different kinds of water. The next is that the weight
							falls short of what it ought to be, even with the allowances made for
							the weight of the air expelled from the Litre by filling it with water.
							A third is some distrust with regard to the perfect accuracy of the
							Scales. I am satisfied that the beam ought not to be entirely loose; for
							sometimes when the Scales appear to be perfectly balanced, and addition
							of ten or fifteen grains in one of them will fail to turn it, when half
							a grain ought to be sufficient to bring it down. I broke one of my
							thermometers this day in wiping it after using it to prove the
							temperature of the water in the buckets. Evening at home.</p>

						<p><date>10. VI:</date> Heard at the Capitol <persRef ref="campbell-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell</persRef> the Chaplain
							to the House of Representatives, preach Luke XVI:31. “And he said unto
							him, if they hear not <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef> and the
							prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the
							dead.” He is not without eloquence, but to such an Audience as the
							Chaplains of Congress must be supposed to have for hearers, the Sermon
							ought rather to be a didactic than a pathetic discourse. And if
							extemporaneous appeals to the feelings, are more powerful than those
							that are studied, moral instruction must be the better for meditation
							and precision. This text opens profound views of human nature— The
							parable of which it forms a part is one of the most remarkable passages
							in the gospels. The conclusion from the argument of the parable, would
							seem to be that the mission of Christ himself was useless— Suppose one
							of the Pharisees to whom the discourse was addressed had said in
							reply—“Thou bearest witness against thyself— If Moses and the prophets
							are sufficient for securing the joys of Paradise in the world to come—
							If they who believe not Moses and the prophets would not be persuaded
							though one should rise from the dead, why comest thou with a voice as of
							one from the dead? And how can those believe thee, who would not believe
							one from the dead?[”] The answer to this obvious, and as it appears, to
							me powerful objection, would give one of the best opportunities to
							descant upon the true character of Christ, and of his mission— The basis
							of the argument would be that the voice of Christ was more than that of
							one from the dead—that the objects of his mission were not only to give
							clearer ideas of the future world than had been disclosed to Moses and
							the prophets, but to improve the condition of mankind in this world,
							independent of its connection with the next. A parallel between the
							force of evidence resulting from the voice of an apparition from the
							dead and that of the Christian revelation would belong to the subject.
							But it is doubtful whether such a view of it could be taken by an
							extemporaneous discourse. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell took
							of it a quite different— He applied to the gospel itself that which
							Christ supposes <persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef> to have said of
							the disbelief of Moses and the prophets, and reasoned upon the broad
							position, that they who will not believe the scriptures would resist
							even the evidence of a messenger from the dead. A more superficial, but
							I think less correct doctrine than that which properly flows from the
							parable. <persRef ref="talbot-isham">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="grayson-letitia">Grayson</persRef>. The old Commodore
							was in high Spirits, fought all his battles oer again, and told me much
							of his history since the War of the Revolution— It has not been
							fortunate— He lost all the hard-earned fruits of his of his
							revolutionary services, by the failure of a man to whom he had lent it.
							The man no sooner had the money than he absconded, and Tucker never saw
							him again till after an interval of more than thirty years, he met him
							at Portland, as a member of the Convention, which lately made the
							Constitution for the State of Maine— And he then had nothing. By this
							disaster Tucker was himself obliged to abandon his residence, and remove
							from Massachusetts down to a small landed Estate in the District of
							Maine where he has been many years living in a log-house and on a scanty
							farm— He is now the only surviving Officer of his rank, who served
							through the whole revolutionary War; and there was not one Officer, who
							served with more effect in that War— He was admitted this day within the
							body of the House of Representatives under the rule which admits all
							persons who have received the thanks of Congress— I went with the family
							this Evening to a concert given by a musical <persRef

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanderson to ascertain the principles upon
							which this work will be conducted, and how far the proper sources of
							information have been explored— I asked him whether the lives, were to
							be panegyrics, or historical biographies— The applications have been to
							the families of each individual, who will furnish what materials they
							please, and whose contributions to the biographies will be tainted at
							least with all the partialities of friendship. I asked him if the
							dissensions and antagonisms of all these Patriots among themselves—their
							mutual oppositions and animosities, their errors and their views were to
							be included in the narratives of their lives— He was not very well
							prepared to answer these questions— He did not exactly know how the work
							would be conducted— I asked him who was to furnish the life of <persRef
								ref="chase-samuel">Samuel Chase</persRef>. He believed that was not
							settled. At this I expressed some surprize; and enquired whether the
							publishers of the work were aware how conspicuous that name ought to <pb
								type="ms" n="468"/>be in the Catalogue of the Signers of the
							Declaration. He said that application had been made to his family for
							access to his papers, but they had no papers, that could be applied with
							any use to this purpose— I told him I considered M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Chase as one of the men whose life conduct and opinions had
							been of the most extensive influence upon the Constitution of this
							Country. He not only signed the Declaration of Independence, but was an
							active and distinguished member of the Congress during the early and
							most critical period of the Revolution— He was a man of ardent passions,
							of strong mind, of domineering temper— His life was consequently
							turbulent and boisterous. He had for some years almost uncontrouled
							dominion over the politics of the State of Maryland. At other times,
							unpopular in the extreme—and was more than once impeached— Appointed by
								<persRef ref="washington-george">President Washington</persRef>, one
							of the Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, he had
							continued in that office upwards of twenty years, until his death— He
							was the only judge of that Court who had ever been impeached— His
							impeachment had settled some principles and some practice of our
							Constitutional Law. But he himself as a judge had settled others of the
							highest importance; one of them in my opinion of very pernicious
							importance— He decided as I think directly in the face of an Amendatory
							Article of the Constitution of the United States (the seventh) that this
							Union in its federative capacity has no common Law— A decision which has
							crippled the powers not only of the judiciary, but of all the
							Departments of the National Government— The reasons upon which he rested
							that decision are not sound; but as they flattered the popular
							prejudices, it has remained unreversed to this day. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Chase’s life is among those which if
							historically written, will be of the highest interest, and may give
							occasion to the freest and most useful discussion— Sanderson said the
							intention was to write the lives freely, but not controversially. He was
							however convinced of the importance of the views I had taken of the life
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chase. <persRef
								ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef> came, and occupied the remaining Office hours till
							six. His principal object was to have further conversation upon the
							subject of the Slave-trade— On the fourth of this Month a Resolution
							passed the House of Representatives on the motion of <persRef
								ref="mercer-charles">C. F. Mercer</persRef> calling upon the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> for copies of the
							Correspondence, with any of the foreign maritime powers relating to the
							Slave-trade— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning now reminded me,
							that in some of our former Conversations, I had told him that after the
							meeting of Congress; when there would be opportunities for consulting
							the opinions of members, the President would again take into
							consideration the proposals of the British Government, and determine
							upon some proposal to be offered in its stead, if he should finally
							consider it as inadmissible. I told him that there was no change in the
							President’s opinions concerning the British proposals, but if he would
							write me a note referring to them, they would be deliberately
							considered, and a written answer given; after which both papers would be
							communicated with the answer to the call from the House of
							Representatives— Our conversation also diverged upon the trial of
								<persRef ref="caroline-brunswick">the Queen</persRef>, and the part
							which <persRef ref="canning-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								George Canning</persRef> has taken in that affair, which I thought
							very creditable to him: and also to the aspect of political affairs in
							Europe, arising from the recent Revolutions in Spain, Naples and
							Portugal. Upon all this M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning was
							cautious to avoid expressing any opinion of his own; but he told me that
							his Cousin upon differing with his Colleagues, in relation to the
							prosecution of the Queen had tendered his resignation to the king, who
							had declined accepting it— The funeral of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hazard was this day, but I could not attend it.</p>

						<p><date>23. VII:</date> There were a succession of members of Congress this
							morning at the Office— And at one O’Clock, a meeting of the members of
							the administration at the President’s, to consider the proposals in the
							note of the 20<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>respecting the Slave-trade
							received from <persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Canning</persRef>. The British proposals are that the
							several powers which have enacted Laws for the abolition of the Slave
							trade, should agree that the Ships of War which each of them may station
							upon the African Coast, to intercept vessels carrying on the trade under
							its own flag, should have the right to search vessels sailing under
							other flags; and if upon such search, Slaves should be found on board
							the vessel, to seize her and carry her into some port or place in
							Africa, to be tried by a mixed Court of two judges, one belonging to
							each of the two Nations, and two arbitrators, one of which also, from
							each of the two Nations; to be called in, upon any difference of opinion
								<pb type="ms" n="471"/>between the judges. The British Government
							have by treaties obtained the consent of Portugal, Spain and the
							Netherlands, to this system, and they are using every exertion with
							unwearied importunity to obtain the assent to it, of all the great
							European Powers, and of the United States— They pressed it, at the
							Congress of Aix-La-Chapelle upon France, Russia, Austria and Prussia,
							neither of whom however agreed to it— The refusal of France was explicit
							and very decisive—supported by spirited and cogent reasoning. The
							present British Ministers, who care little about it themselves, are
							pressed by the party of the Saints in Parliament, and therefore,
							wherever they meet resistance to their proposal urge it with the more
							apparent earnestness— It has been repeatedly rejected by the Government
							of the United States— It was now considered again— The opinion was
							unanimous that we could consent to no such tribunal for the trial of
							Citizens of the United States— That it would be repugnant to the Article
							in the Constitution, concerning the organization of the judicial power—
							That there is no authority given by the Constitution to establish such
							Courts; and that the mode of trial without grand or petit juries would
							be alike repugnant to the 5<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>and 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>Articles amendatory to the
							Constitution—all which I have repeatedly alledged to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning. On the question relative to the
							other point; granting mutual right of search <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef>, the Secretary of the Navy had some doubts— He
							was not so clear in the principle of persisting to refuse it. He did not
							think it would give any countenance to the British practice of
							impressing men from our merchant vessels in time of War— He thought
							there was very little analogy between the two cases— That this mutual
							right of search, for the particular purpose of suppressing this trade
							would undoubtedly be an expedient highly efficacious to the attainment
							of the end— That by declining it, we shall expose ourselves to the
							imputation of unsincerity, as to our purpose of suppressing the trade,
							and that the British Government would avail itself of it to discredit us
							with the rest of Europe. That there was a strong feeling, and anxious
							desire among the people of this Country for the suppression of the trade
							and some discontent at the notorious fact that all the measures hitherto
							taken have proved insufficient. If therefore the arrangement could be so
							made that vessels under our flag should be brought for trial into our
							own jurisdiction, and tried by our own Courts, he inclined to think that
							the mutual right of search and seizure might be agreed to— <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							the Secretary at War, strongly expressed the contrary opinion— He said
							he gave no credit to Great-Britain, for her extreme ardour in this cause
							of abolition— He thought her professions of benevolence merely
							ostensible— Her real motives, were her own interest, and ambition. After
							having prohibited the traffic by her own people she had a most powerful
							individual interest against its being carried on by others. Her
							Colonial, her commercial, her shipping interests were all deeply
							affected by it. They could not bear to see a profitable trade enjoyed by
							rivals, and competitors, in which they were not permitted to share,
							themselves. Then this right of searching foreign ships was precisely the
							thing upon which she was at issue with us on the impressment question.
							It exactly suited her views to devise an expedient under colour of its
							necessity for suppressing the Slave-trade, which should familiarize
							other commercial and navigating Nations, to the practise of submitting
							to the search of foreign armed ships— All this was to pass to the
							account of benevolence and humanity. At the same time if we accede to
							this proposal, the credit of it all goes to her— We follow her lead— We
							appear to the world, as the Satellite, and she the primary planet; a
							position the more disparaging to us, because in point of fact she was
							merely following our lead; the first example of prohibiting the trade
							having been set by us. I concurred generally with these views of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun, adding that with regard to the
							motives of the British Government, I was rather more charitable— I
							believed the Ministers themselves were not very earnest for the
							abolition of the trade— But there was a powerful Party in Parliament,
							and in the Nation who had set their hearts upon it. The Ministers were
							obliged to conciliate them. I believed great multitudes of this party
							were honestly, and disinterestedly actuated by real motives <pb
								type="ms" n="472"/>of humanity— I gave credit even to the Ministers
							for some part of this motive— The impulses to action in this as in most
							other cases are not simple but compounded— I would not deny the
							existence of those that are laudable, nor neglect the detection of those
							which co-operate with them— The <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> said that whatever the motives of the British
							Government might be, our refusal to accede in this case to the mutual
							right of search and seizure, would hereafter strengthen our cause, in
							any discussion with them upon the question of search for men, during
							war. This alone was he thought a decisive reason for persevering in our
							refusal— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning’s note required
							proposals to be made on our part, if we declined those presented to us—
							What should we offer?— Several expedients were proposed— One was a
							stipulation to keep a certain force constantly on the Coast of Africa,
							and in the latitudes where the trade is chiefly carried on— But it was
							concluded that this might become inconvenient, and even useless. It was
							finally thought best not to propose any formal convention; but to state
							the fact that we have had for some time a vessel constantly cruizing on
							that Coast, and that it was intended to keep such force there. That by
							concert with the British Government, instructions might mutually be
							given to the Commanders of these Cruizers on both sides, to cruize in
							company, whenever they might find it useful or convenient, and to
							furnish one another, every aid and assistance in their power, for the
							furtherance of the common object— I was directed to prepare the draft of
							an answer to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning’s note, conformable
							to this determination— It was near five O’Clock, when the Cabinet
							Meeting broke up— I was belated therefore, in going to <persRef
								ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poletica</persRef>, the Russian Minister’s to dine— I found the
							company already seated at dinner. It was his anniversary banquet to the
							diplomatic corps, on the Emperor’s birth-day— This day instead of
							to-morrow which will be Sunday— The <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor
								Alexander’s</persRef> and the President’s healths were as usual
							toasted in Champagne. I retired immediately after dinner and spent the
							Evening with all our family at <persRef key="smith-william-steuben">W.

						<p><date>26. VI:30.</date><persRef ref="burrill-james">James Burrill jun<hi

							Rhode-Island died this day. He was one of the most useful and
							respectable members of that body and alike estimable both in his public
							and private character. This third case of death among the members of

							timid and valetudinarian of their colleagues. Some of them are disposed
							to draw conclusions of unhealthiness in the place, which are without
							foundation. The place has all the healthiness of a rural situation of
							land waving in hill and dale, of running waters, and briskly circulating
							winds— <persRef ref="johnson-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Francis Johnson</persRef> a member of the House of Representatives
							from Kentucky came with a remonstrance signed by a great number of
							persons against the superseding of the Newspaper at Russelville for
							printing the Laws. I told Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson that
							the responsibility of this alteration must rest upon his kinsman and
								<persRef ref="johnson-richard">namesake the Senator</persRef>, at
							whose instance alone, it had been made. He said that it was personally
							to him a subject of perfect indifference— He had no wish that the
							printer at Russelville should be preferred; but as the remonstrants were
							his Constituents he was obliged to deliver to me their representation.
							But he said he would answer them that the reason for the change, had
							been a more convenient location for the distribution of the Laws, and
							there would be no necessity that I should answer the memorial at-all. I
							told him I should answer it, and state that the change had been made at
							the desire of Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M. Johnson, that
							being the simple fact, and my principle for complying with his wish
							having been my confidence in his knowledge, of that distribution of the
							printing which would best suit the local interest of the State— <persRef
								ref="roberdeau-isaac">Major Roberdeau</persRef> came by appointment
							to the Office and we weighed with all possible accuracy the contents in
							various kinds of water of the French Standard Litres— There was a
							difference amounting to nearly a penny weight, between the contents of
							the two— That which I have already tried containing so much more than
							the other— Major Roberdeau had procured for me a large jug full of
							distilled water which together with the other kinds of water that I had
							has been several days in the Library room to acquire the same
							temperature as that of the room— They were all at 32.5 or just above the
							freezing point. The Litre and glass weighed 4 pounds 6 ounces 12
							pennyweights Troy; or 26208 Grains— And it is a circumstance worthy of
							remark, that upon four weighings on as many different days this is the
							second time that they have shewn this result; while at one weighing they
							were four grains and at another eight grains heavier. Whether this
							difference was in the things, and resulted from that in the state of the
							atmosphere, or whether it was inaccuracy in the scales, or imperfection
							in the mode of weighing I know not, but it proves how exceedingly
							difficult it is to ascertain with perfect exactness quantities
							comparatively so minute— On weighing the different <pb type="ms" n="474"
							/>kinds of water we found the Litre contained 15402 grains of distilled
							water 15403 of river water 15406 of pump, and 15407 of rain water, a
							result singularly favourable to the purity both of the Spring and river
							water of this place— I therefore set it down from the average of all my
							experiments that the French standard Litre contains 15405 grains of rain
							water—without allowance for the weight of the excluded air. I called at

							the two successive Vice-President’s <persRef ref="clinton-george">George
								Clinton</persRef>; and <persRef ref="gerry-elbridge">Elbridge

							demolish— We were remarking how exclusively by the nature and genius of
							our institutions, we confine all our thoughts and cares to present time—
							We have neither fore-fathers nor posterity— This burying yard, is remote
							from any Church— The funeral is a mere commitment of earth to earth—
							There is nothing to sooth the afflicted, or to rouse the thoughtless, by
							the promise, and the warning which a Church would give of the connection
							between time and eternity— Nothing to remind the attendant at the
							funeral that death is a transition from this to another world. There is
							a Resolution of Congress, existing ever since the death of <persRef
								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>, that a monument in
							honour of his memory, should be erected— I said to Calhoun, that I
							thought under that Resolution Congress ought to build a Church of
							durable Stone; equal in dimensions to Westminister Abbey, or the
							Pantheon at Paris— That sheltered under the roof and within the walls of
							this Church, should be the sepulchral monument of Washington; and around
							it, suitably disposed, those of the Statesmen and Legislators of this
							Union, whose lives may from time to time, honourably close during their
							attendance here on the service of their Country. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Calhoun thought that Congress would not be supported in the
							expence of such a measure, by the public opinion; of which I am well
							aware. He observed that it would be of great advantage to this Country,
							to have Statesmen of a philosophical turn of mind. He is himself of that
							character and it has brought him to high distinction at a very early
							age. But he is the only man of the present administration, who does
							possess it. We are obliged to live from hand to mouth; to provide for
							the day that is passing over us, and to leave posterity to take care of
							itself— After I returned to the Office <persRef ref="cook-daniel">D. P.

						<p><date>30. V:30.</date><persRef ref="plumer-william2">William Plumer
									jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> of New-Hampshire,
							and <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">General S. Smith</persRef> of Maryland,
							members of the House of Representatives, called this morning,
							successively at my Office. Plumer’s object was to express the wish for
							the re-appointment of <persRef ref="humphreys-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphreys</persRef> as District
							Attorney for New-Hampshire. He hinted that there was personal and party
							feeling concerned in the efforts for the removal of Humphreys, as well
							as in those made at the commencement of the Session, to have the
							printing of the Laws of the Union transferred from the New-Hampshire
							Patriot, to another paper. Plumer is the Son of <persRef
								ref="plumer-william">my old friend</persRef> and once fellow
							Senator— The son, is one of the most promising young men now in public
							life— There was a Meeting of the Members of the Administration at the
							President’s, when my draft of an Answer to <persRef
								ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef> upon the Slave-trade note, was fully considered—
							Its principles had all been agreed to at the former meeting; and now the
							draft was approved with the suggestion of some slight alterations, and
							some omissions, to soften the harshness of refusal. I had drawn the
							paper in terms of the strongest characters with a view to leave no
							occasion for further discussion upon the subject. The consequence had
							been that the same Sentiment was expressed in the draft two or three
							times. It was proposed to curtail it of its repetitions, and of some
							expressions which might be offensive; to which I agreed. There was some
							deliberation upon the proposals to be offered instead of those from
							Great-Britain which we decline. That the draft was merely to concert
							between the two Governments mutual Instructions to the Commanders of the
							Cruizers upon the African Coast, that they may cruize in company, and
							otherwise render each other every assistance in their power towards the
							attainment of the common object— This may be done, without any formal
							Treaty stipulation; but the question was made, whether we might not
							offer further, an engagement by Treaty to keep a certain force, without
							intermission, say two or three armed vessels always cruizing on the
							coast. But <persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef>, the Secretary of the Navy, said that we were not
								suffi-<pb type="ms" n="476"/>ciently informed of the kind of force
							which might most usefully be employed upon that coast. Smaller vessels,
							drawing less water than those we now have there may be found better
							adapted to the service. It was not until the present year that we had
							any force there; and much information might be expected from the reports
							of the Officers who have been and are now employed upon it— There might
							also be inconvenience in an engagement which would deprive us of the
							power of adapting the disposal of all our naval force to the exigencies
							of circumstances from time to time— We could not foresee how long <hi
								rend="italic">any</hi> force might be necessary there— From the
							captures which have already taken place, it is probable that the use of
							our flag may be altogether abandoned by the Slave-traders. A compact to
							keep Cruizers, where they could effect nothing would be troublesome, and
							give dissatisfaction to our own people— To these objections, <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							added one of a political, and more general nature— He was averse to any
							compact with Great Britain upon this subject; because he believed she
							was pursuing private ends upon pretences of public Spirit— We began and
							are pursuing a system of policy of our own for the suppression of the
							Slave-trade— While we keep that course we stand upon Independent
							ground—but of any compact, to which at the proposal of Great-Britain we
							might accede, we should bear the burden, and she would monopolize the
							credit— On these Considerations it was concluded to leave the proposals,
							as they were in my draft— I attended this Evening a Meeting of the
							Columbian Institute, a learned Society of which I have been more than
							three years a member, but the Meetings of which I have never before had
							leisure to attend. <persRef ref="meigs-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Josiah Meigs</persRef>, Commissioner of the land Office
							is the President— <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">Asbury
							Dickins</persRef>, a Clerk in the Treasury department, Secretary— There
							were not more than five or six members who attended— I was obliged to
							leave the Meeting before it broke up; but was placed upon a Committee
							for an application to Congress for a Lottery to raise funds for the
							benefit of the Society— This petition had been resolved upon at a former
							Meeting, but the Committee appointed to prepare it had not agreed upon
							their Report— <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thornton</persRef> the Chairman had prepared one which
							was now recommitted with Instructions, at my instance, to report first
							whether any petition to Congress for a Lottery would be expedient; and
							if so, a new draft— This was agreed to, but I was immediately added to
							the Committee.</p>

						<p><date>31. VII:15.</date> Heard <persRef ref="ryland-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ryland</persRef>, the Chaplain to the
							Senate, at the Capitol— His text was from Lament III:22 “It is of the
							Lord’s mercies, that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail
							not.” His eloquence does not please me. It is vehement in manner and
							empty of substance—less than ordinary thoughts in tumid and creeping
							language— His doctrines, are the common topics of Calvinism— It was
							remarked that he took no notice, by the most distant allusion, either in
							his prayers or Sermon, of the unexampled incident of the decease of
							three members of Congress within the space of ten days. After Church, I
							paid visits to <persRef ref="edwards-ninian">N. Edwards</persRef>,
							Senator from Illinois, and <persRef ref="talbot-isham">Isham
								Talbot</persRef> from Kentucky— Edwards only was at home, and still
							confined to his chamber, though recovering— He renewed his complaints
							against the partialities of the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> in favour of the enemies of his administration
							and adverse to its friends, especially in the appointments to Office in
							the Western Country— He spoke much also of the two Senators elected from
							Missouri, <persRef ref="barton-david">Barton</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="benton-thomas">Benton</persRef>, and was particularly anxious
							that a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stewart should be appointed the
							District judge in Missouri, in preference to a <persRef
								ref="gray-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray</persRef>—
							They have both been territorial judges, but Edwards says that both for
							character and talents, Stewart is by far the superior man. Benton
							however will strain every nerve for the appointment of Gray— I told
							Edwards that the third territorial judge <persRef ref="lucas-john">John
								B. C. Lucas</persRef>, was also a Candidate; but he said there could
							be no possible chance for him. Benton to be sure, would much rather it
							should be Stewart than Lucas, whose <persRef ref="lucas-charles">son he
								killed</persRef> in a duel, but Lucas was too unpopular— He was a
							man of singular and repulsive manners, and his appointment would give
							satisfaction to no party. I did not enter into discussion with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards upon this subject— Lucas will not
							be appointed, because he stands upon his own merits, and powerful
							interest is made in behalf of others. Gray will be appointed, because he
							is Benton’s man and because his influence will be backed by that of
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef>— But Lucas would be the most suitable
							man for <pb type="ms" n="477"/>the Office— His enemies are his virtues.
							He has resisted the depredators upon the Nation who swarm in that
							Country with fraudulent land-claims, and he has been of the party which
							would have left open a door for the possible future emancipation of
							Slaves. But he is a man of unimpeached integrity— Born in France; bred
							to the knowledge and practice of the Civil Law; many years settled in
							the United States; and having been sometime a Representative in Congress
							from one of the Districts of Pennsylvania. His misfortune has been in
							going to reside in a Country to the vices of which he could not
							accommodate his principles, and such is the Constitution of human
							nature, that virtue herself becomes obnoxious when she cannot adapt her
							principles to times and places— Edwards himself is a warm friend of the
							President’s— But there is a rivality of influence between him and his
							colleague <persRef ref="thomas-jesse">Jesse B. Thomas</persRef> in their
							State; and as Thomas is a partizan of Crawford’s, it provokes Edwards to
							see all the appointments by the General Government in the State bestowed
							upon Thomas’s creatures. He declared his determination to oppose in
							Senate the confirmation of some of these nominations— <persRef
								ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef>
							paid us a visit.</p>

						<!-- This is a summary entry without a date.-->
						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> The range of my rising hour through the month has been
							from III:15 to VII:30. the average V:40. during the Session of Congress
							later Evenings always produce later Mornings— We have now a more
							numerous family than we had ever before been accustomed to— <persRef

								Sons</persRef>, <persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary Hellen</persRef>, and <persRef

							Company at home and abroad absorbs much time and attention. Evening
							study has been abandoned, and become so irksome that I fear never to be
							able to resume it. My Office hours in spite of every exertion to change
							them remain as heretofore— From twelve or one, to five or six— The
							morning hours are necessary to me at my house; and if I go earlier to
							the Office, I still find it impossible to return earlier from it.</p>
						<p>The year has perhaps been the most laborious one of my life. It has been
							without vacation, and that portion of the Summer and Autumn, which in
							the two preceding years, I had borrowed for a short visit to my nearest
							friends has been this year the most deeply engaged in the performance of
							public duties. Had I enjoyed my usual indulgence, it would not have been
							possible for me to have prepared the Report upon weights and measures,
							first required by a Resolution of the Senate of 3. March 1817. and again
							by a Resolution of the House of Representatives of 14. December 1819. On
							this I have been the last six Months constantly engaged, and the Report
							is not yet ready to be sent in. Neither am I satisfied with my own work
							as it must be sent in; but intend if the public should take any interest
							in it, to revise it, at a period of greater leisure— No incident of
							material importance has occurred in my family during the year, but there
							appears to be no reason to doubt that the Florida Treaty has been
							ratified by Spain— The state of my private affairs is less favourable
							than at the close of the last year, yet such as calls for unceasing
							effusions of gratitude to the giver of all good— At the Commencement of
							the Session of Congress, my Diary was already a week or ten days in
							arrear. I have since been unable to resume it. The difficulty of writing
							has much increased in the course of this year— It will probably be
							impossible for me to go through another year, with as much detail— I
							would fain continue it until the termination of my public service, which
								<hi rend="italic">may</hi> continue, through the second Presidency
							of <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef>— But I have no reason to flatter myself that the
							powers of my hand will hold out even one year longer— Thy will be
							done!</p>
						<!-- Bill, should this be encoded with the 16 April 1821 metadata even though it's in the Dec. 1820 file? Thoughts? -->
						<p> N.B. 16. April 1821. The arrears of the Diary continued through the
							Session of Congress, and until the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of
							March, when I resumed it, at the 7<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of
							November, since which thus far has been redeemed— Let me give the future
							to Hope.</p>
