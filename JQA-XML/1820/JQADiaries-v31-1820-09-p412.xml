								<persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Madison</persRef>. I told Lee he might inform Noah that there was no
							prospect of any such appointment’s being made— I asked Lee what was the
							usual size of the Bordeaux Hogsheads; but he had nothing but general
							knowledge about it—that four hogsheads went to a ton; that they should
							contain 63 Gallons each, but never did quite so much—that those sent to
							this Country particularly fell short; but that in England they always
							make deductions for any amount less than 63 Gallons to the Hogshead— On
							returning home I consulted <persRef ref="kruse-jurgen">Kruse’s</persRef>
							Contorist, and <persRef ref="kelly-patrick">Kelly’s</persRef> Cambist
							for the contents of the Bordeaux Hogshead; and find that they contain
							usually between 61 and 62 Gallons of 231 cubic inches which makes as
							exactly as possible 63 Gallons of 224 inches, and adds another spoke to
							the wheel of my theory— I find also that as the Avoirdupois hundred is
							of 112 lb. if the 112 is divided by 100 it gives a Pound of 7840 grains
							Troy weight, rather heavier than that of the Poids de Marc, and with the
							half Kilogramme tallying much nearer—being exactly 1/4 of an ounce Troy
							weight heavier— I discover also another curious coincidence between the
							number of Pounds avoirdupois to a Ton. 2240. and the number of cubic
							inches to the old Wine-Gallon 224. I know not yet how to account for it;
							and it perplexes me profoundly— I wrote two Letters to <persRef

							enquiring whether the Bank would make the payment for the Government—
							The Bank are willing, but an Article of their Charter prohibits them

							the money, and take the Stock, in a form that shall not in law have the

							that it is—in Law— Cheves sends the Case, with the Project of the Bank,
							and the opinion of Pinkney to Jones, requesting that the opinion of the
							Attorney General may also be taken upon it— Wirt expressed much surprize
							that an affair of this importance should be left to be transacted by a

							should not have known of this defalcation of the revenue; or if he knew
							it, should neither have made provision for meeting the emergency, nor
							communicated it to the other Commissioners of the sinking fund— I was
							surprized at it too— I thought, and told Crawford last Winter that the
							deficiency of the revenue would be more than three Millions— He might
							just as easily have obtained authority to borrow five; but he did not
							expect to want more than three, and under the authority given him by a
							Law to borrow that sum he has yet actually borrowed only two— I
							concluded that Jones had given notice of this State of things to the

						<p><date>19. III:</date> Accomplishing my morning task somewhat earlier than
							usual, after calling at my Office I went to the President’s where I
							found <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef>. He had brought the papers concerning the proposed
							accomodation to be furnished by the Bank of the United States to the
							Government; but the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> had
							not heard before, one word of the deficit in the revenue. His motives
							for coming here were principally relating to the state of our foreign
							affairs; and chiefly with regard to Portugal and France. I had a
							conversation of nearly three hours with him upon these points which it
							is impossible for me to record in detail. With regard to Portugal he
							seemed inclined to ascribe the hostile aspect of our relations with her
							in a great measure to the ill-will of the <persRef ref="correa-joseph"
								>Abbe Correa</persRef>, to whom he imputed motives not very
							laudable— The abbe has been upon a visit to <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef> to whom he talked so much about an American
							system in which his Government and ours should be united, and by concert
							with the European powers, should agree to keep the Coasts of this
							Hemisphere clear of Pirates, on condition that they should sweep the
							Seas of the Eastern hemisphere clear of Barbary Pirates, that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson had been disposed to favour the
							project, and thought it might be carried into effect, so that our
							Squadron might be withdrawn from the Mediterranean.— The President said
							he had observed to the President that an American system upon that plan
							would be an alliance between the United States and Portugal against the
							South-American Independents, which was hardly reconcileable with any
							just view of our policy, and this was certainly true— I added that the
							Abbe had more than once broached this subject of an American system to
							be concerted between the two great Powers of the western Hemisphere;
							meaning the United States and Portugal— I had never disturbed the abbe
							in his romancing; but Portugal and the United States are the two great
							American powers, much as a jolly-boat and the Columbus are two great
							line of battle-ships—and as to an American System, Independent of
							Europe, Portugal is neither American nor Independent: So long as
							Portugal shall recognize the house of Braganza for her Sovereign, so
							long the house of Braganza will be European and not American; a
							Satellite and not a primary Planet— As to an American System, we have
							it; we constitute the whole of it—there is no community of interests or
							of principles between North and South-America. <persRef
								ref="torres-manuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torres</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="bolivar-simon">Bolivar</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="ohiggins-bernando">O’Higgins</persRef> talk about an American
							system as much as the abbe Correa—but there is no basis for any such
							system— The President said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson had
							told the Abbe that as to the appointment of Commissioners to try the
							captures of Portuguese property by Baltimore pirates, it was out of the
							question—there could be no such thing— That the Abbe had been
							exceedingly irritable, and talked under very high excitement; for which
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson could not account— I said
							that in his communications with me here; the Abbe had been mild and
							moderate— That I believed the subject was very disagreeable to him, and
							that he was very glad to be relieved from all further agency relating to
							it— But I had no difficulty in accounting for his excitement and
							irritability— The Portuguese property taken by the Pirates, notoriously
							and openly fitted out in Baltimore; officered and manned by our own
							People was enough to make any man in his situation irritable. The
							sufferers of course immediately resorted to their Government, and the
							Government by their Instructions to him— It was my opinion that Portugal
							had real grounds of complaint against us, and that if the case had been
							reversed, and we had suffered in the same way, and to the same extent by
							her People, we should have declared War against her without hesitation.
							War was not to be dreaded from her—she had too strong an interest
							against it; but she might assail us by commercial regulations and
							restrictions, and the Abbe had told me she infallibly would— The
							President wished me to write to the Abbe and call for his proofs against
							the naval Officers and judges of the United States whom he has
							denounced, and also his proofs in all the cases of Portuguese vessels
							captured by Baltimore Pirates— He <pb type="ms" n="420"/>said if there
							was proof against any of our naval officers they ought to be dismissed;
							and if against any of the judges, it should be laid before Congress—
							With regard to France he thought that notwithstanding the resentment of
							France at our late Tonnage duty, the French Government after satisfying
							their own pride will conclude to negotiate— He wished me therefore to
							draw up instructions for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin upon
							all the points in discussion between the two Countries— The
							discriminating Tonnage duties, direct and indirect—the Consular
							Convention—the delivery of deserting Mariners—the Claims of our Citizens
							upon the French Government—and a claim on the part of France of special
							privileges in Louisiana— I asked him on what principles the Instructions
							upon each of these points were to be drawn— I told him what I supposed
							would be the proposals of France on the Tonnage duties—that is that the
							duties on both sides should be so proportioned that each party should
							have half the shipping employed between them— I stated their argument
							upon it; that upon equal terms they cannot stand a competition with us
							in navigation, and that the advantages which our navigators have over
							theirs must in some manner be countervailed to enable them to have their
							just proportion of the carrying trade— He said he thought there was
							weight in it; but I observed I did not see how we could possibly assent
							to the principle. We had offered to all the world entire reciprocity.
							Great Britain, and several other Nations had accepted the proposal—
							France now called upon us to agree to be clogged, in order to enable her
							people to hold competition with us— If we should assent, our own people
							would first be dissatisfied, and next, all the Nations with which we
							have stood on terms of reciprocity— We should have clamour and
							discontent from all quarters. As to the Consular Convention, that, with
							France was an affair of State— She wanted by means of Consular
							Jurisdictions, to retain all her power over Frenchmen in this Country—
							The operation of the system was always odious here— The old Congress had
							refused to ratify the Convention which had been negotiated by <persRef
								ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Franklin</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson finally
							signed one with the <persRef ref="montmorin-armand">Comte de
								Montmorin</persRef>; which was the most unpopular Treaty ever made
							by us— It gave constant dissatisfaction while it lasted, and would be no
							less disapproved if now renewed. The President thought it would be best
							to keep the subjects separate, and to postpone the matter of the
							Consular Convention— That we should agree to the Article for restoring
							deserting Seamen; and persist in rejecting the claim of privilege in
							Louisiana— With regard to the claims of our Citizens as there will be no
							prospect of obtaining any indemnity for them at present, <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> should be instructed to endeavour to obtain an
							article stipulating that they shall be considered hereafter— On
							returning to my Office I began the draft of Instructions to M<hi

						<p><date>21. III:30.</date> This morning <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel"
								>Fahrenheits</persRef> Thermometer was at 42. and I was so pinched
							with cold that it was with the utmost difficulty, I could write without
							a fire— <persRef ref="cornell-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								>Bestor</persRef>, and <persRef ref="jones-frances">M<hi

								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> would now see
							her—that an immediate pardon could not probably issue; but a further
							reprieve would probably be granted during which new applications in
							favour of her son might be made— She said if his life could but be
							spared he would cheerfully submit to any term of imprisonment. M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Jones I referred as the President had
							directed to the Commissioners of the Navy— At the President’s I found he
							was preparing to leave the City again to-morrow morning for his seat at
							Oakhill, in Loudoun County, Virginia. I had a long conversation with him
							again upon the Instructions to be given to <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>. We concluded that the basis of arrangement
							proposed by <persRef ref="pasquier-etienne">Baron Pasquier</persRef>
							could not be accepted by us— The motives and principles upon which we
							arrived at this conclusion are to be stated in the Instructions, for
							which reason as well as for want of time I shall omit the detail of them
							here. But it appears to me that the greatest difficulty of our present
							position is with Spain— When the Session of Congress comes, we shall be
							still with the Treaty unratified, after threatening measures to take
							possession of Florida; and postponing them only to give the Cortes an
							opportunity to do us Justice— The Cortes will do nothing, and the
							question what we are to do will come upon us with double recoil. The
							President I found had no inclination to take forcible measures. Symptoms
							of convulsions in Europe are thickening— The revolution in Spain has
							been acted over again at Naples— The <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor
								of Russia</persRef> has issued a fulminating declaration against the
							Spanish Revolution, and Austria is marching troops against that of
							Naples— A plan of Counter revolution has exploded in Spain and a civil
							War between Naples and the Island of Sicily appears to be impending.
							France, England Germany emit volcanic smoke, and time is teeming with
							another great political earthquake— Our own situation is uncomfortable;
							our finances disordered; our resources decayed; and tranquility seems in
							the <pb type="ms" n="422"/>view of the President, the pole-star of our
							policy. Of all political courses the easiest for execution is that which
							consists in doing nothing— Far niente— But it has a result, which seldom
							turns to good account; it effects nothing— I told the President that the
							non-ratification of the Treaty would give no dissatisfaction in this
							Country, excepting to the persons, whose claims were provided for in it.
							The Southern and Western People would be glad to have the Treaty set
							aside. But as Spain will do nothing and is likely to fall into civil
							War, a movement of the People of Pensacola, and Saint Augustine may be
							anticipated and might be hastened by which they would assume the
							Government into their own hands, and then apply to the United States,
							for protection— Under some such circumstances whether hastened by any
							agency on our part, or merely waited for, I was convinced we should
							ultimately be obliged to take possession of Florida, and with it, I
							thought the recognition of the Republic of Colombia, ought to be
							simultaneous— The President did not appear to think the time was matured
							for the recognition of any of the South-American Governments— He told me
							he should be at Oakhill, ready at any time at a days warning to come to
							the City— He read me a letter from New-York being an account of his Son
							in Law <persRef ref="gouverneur-samuel">Gouverneur’s</persRef> being
							dangerously ill with a bilious fever.— There was a <persRef
								ref="washington-unknown2">Doctor Washington</persRef> at the Office,
							who came to ask for a subscription to a medical Miscellany— I was alone
							at home, morning and Evening; but so occupied that I was scarcely
							sensible of the lapse of time.</p>

							just from New-York— Kirkpatrick was formerly a member of Congress from
							New-York, and I had been then acquainted with him but did not remember
							him. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutts came to tell me that he and
							his family were evacuating the house in F. Street into which we are to

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> The range of my rising hour has been from three
							quarters past two to three quarters past four. The average about four.
							The summer heats continued through the first half of the Month, and it
							was irksome to read or write by Candle-light— I then retired to bed
							between eight and nine of the Evening, and rose between three and four.
							As the Evenings have grown cooler I make them longer, retire at ten and
							rise between four and five. I sit down immediately to my draft and am
							employed till near noon, writing three pages— Then the journal of the
							preceding day, and reach my Office seldom before one. My attempt to get
							there earlier has again failed for I found that once there, I had no
							command of my occupation, but was compelled to give my time to the
							current business of the Office— Between five and six I come home to
							dinner, and in the Evening read the newspapers. I have no leisure.</p>
