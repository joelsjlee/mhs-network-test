						<p><date>2. V:</date> After being up two or three times in the Night— This
							was the fourth day in succession of overpowering heat. <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> the
							greater part of the day at 92. though with a light breeze of air, which
							made it supportable for reading but not for writing. I attended Church
							with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> at <persRef
								ref="mccormick-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								M’Cormick’s</persRef>— He read prayers for the fifth Sunday after
							Trinity, and after reading the first Lesson, which was the 49<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of Genesis, the prophecy of
								<persRef ref="jacob">Jacob</persRef> at his Death, concerning the
							future Fortunes of his posterity; made some remarks upon it, specially
							noticing the prophecy of the Shiloh, or Messiah— This is one of the most
							remarkable, and unintelligible Chapters to me of the whole Bible— That
							Jacob at the hour of his death should call his sons together to give
							them advice for their future conduct in the world, would have been
							indicative of a great, a wise, and a good man; and the occasion might
							have been taken to administer good counsel through them to all their
							posterity and to all mankind. And such good counsel there is; but
							delivered in obscure and mysterious language— It is said in 28. that
							these were the twelve tribes of Israel; and that he blessed them, every
							one according to his blessing— But some of the fortunes which he
							portends have not much the appearance of blessings— The two favourites
							are <persRef ref="judah">Judah</persRef>, and <persRef ref="joseph3"
								>Joseph</persRef>, the forefathers of the two dynasties of the Kings
							of Judah, and of Ephraim, or the ten tribes.— Judah was the fourth son
							by <persRef ref="leah">Leah</persRef>, and Joseph was the eldest son by
							the darling <persRef ref="rachel">Rachel</persRef>.— Jacob begins by
							admitting that <persRef ref="reuben">Reuben</persRef> was entitled to
							special distinction as the <hi rend="italic">first-born</hi>—but says he
							had forfeited that right by his misconduct. The passage in the common
							English bible—“Unstable as Water, thou shalt not excel” is a moral
							lesson of inestimable value; but I am afraid is not in the text— In my
							Latin, French and German translations it is, thou art poured out like
							water, and shalt not increase— The offence of Reuben was not mere
							instability but something worse— The abhorrence with which Jacob viewed
							it, (and most justly) is marked by the reproach addressed first to
							Reuben himself; and then repeated to all the brethren, in the third
							person—he went up to my couch— <persRef ref="simeon">Simeon</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="levi">Levi</persRef> too are declared to have
							forfeited their older birthright, by their cruelty— It appears therefore
							to be given to Judah, to whom the Sceptre and the lawgiver is secured
							until Shiloh come; and unto him should the gathering of the people be—
							The transcendent blessing of the Shiloh was to come through Judah;
							though it is said 1. Chronicles V.1. that the birth-right, meaning the
							double-portion was given to the sons of Joseph— Joseph was the most
							amiable and virtuous of all the Patriarchs, and in this Chapter of
							blessings is the only one of whom Jacob speaks with the tenderest
							affection and unqualified approbation—for magnificent as the blessing is
							of Judah, it is only a portent of glory, prosperity and power—while that
							of Joseph is ascribed to his piety, and the special favour of the deity—
							Judah was the Lion’s whelp whom <hi rend="italic">his brethren</hi>
							should praise; but Joseph’s arms of his hands were made strong by the
							hands of the mighty God of Jacob. In reviewing this Chapter, my
							reflections crowd upon me too much for the time to record them— A
							question occurs to me, why the Fortunes of the Posterity of these
							Patriarchs, was made to depend so much upon the solitary incidents in
							the lives of their respective first progenitors?—why for example was the
							whole tribe of Reuben in after ages made to suffer, for his incestuous
							crime? and why was that of Judah, with <persRef ref="tamar"
								>Tamar</persRef> suffered to pass not only without punishment, but
							without notice?— The broken sentences, and the figurative language of
							the Chapter deserve to be analyzed with care— The poetical imagery is of
							the oriental character—and there is a curious mingling of the past and
							future tenses, which could be appropriate only for prophecy— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Cormick’s Sermon was from Luke
							XVI.19–31. The Parable of the rich man and <persRef ref="lazarus"
								>Lazarus</persRef>.— I was not so much pleased with this, as I have
							been with other Sermons of his reading— He spent rather too much of his
							discourse in explaining what was to <pb type="ms" n="383"/>be understood
							by a rich man—this was one division of his sermon—the other w<hi
								rend="strikethrough">h</hi>ere; why the rich man was punished and
							how— In exposition of the why, he remarked that the parable did not
							ascribe to the rich man, any crime, or even any vice, it barely referred
							to the costliness of his apparel, and of his food—from which he inferred
							that eternal perdition was denounced to the mere possession of wealth if
							applied to mere selfish purposes though innocent— He also inferred from
							this parable that the punishment of Hell, is by elementary fire, and
							that it is endless— There is certainly foundation for this reasoning so
							far at least as that the idea was countenanced by Christ— The Parable
							represents a rich man possessed of all the luxuries, and a poor man in
							want of all the necessaries of life— The rich man dies and goes to the
							place of punishment—the poor man dies and is carried by angels into
								<persRef ref="abraham">Abraham’s</persRef> bosom— But neither the
							poverty of Lazarus, nor the Wealth of the rich man were the causes of
							their reward and punishment after death— The causes are not mentioned in
							either case; the fact is simply stated— It was not the purpose of this
							parable to prove that virtue and vice would meet with appropriate
							retribution in a future life; but that enjoyment and misery in this
							life, are generally reversed in the future— On another occasion Jesus
							had said that it was easier for a camel to go through the eye of a
							needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. The general
							doctrine of the gospel is, that those who possess riches here will be
							subject to divine punishment hereafter. The moral of the gospel is that
							the only way for a rich man to excape this penalty is to distribute his
							riches to the benefit of the poor— What he prescribed to the rich man
							who consulted him, and who had fulfilled all the duties required of him
							by the Mosaic Law, was to sell <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that he had,
							and give it to the poor, and to follow him— It was not a limited
							distribution of superfluous income, but a direction to divest himself of
							all his property; to make himself one of the poor, for the benefit of
							those who were so and to follow him— It has not been inferred by any
							denomination of Christians that this injunction was applicable to all,
							though during the time of the Apostles it appears they did for a short
							period hold all property in common— In the first fervour of enthusiasm,
							after the Holy Ghost descended upon the Apostles, the new converts
							practiced upon this precept; <persRef ref="barrabas">Barrabas</persRef>
							among the rest sold the Lands he owned, and laid the proceeds at the
							feet of the Apostles— But the Story of <persRef ref="ananias"
								>Ananias</persRef> and <persRef ref="sapphira">Sapphira</persRef>
							soon shewed how human nature worked under such a rule of discipline—
							They sold their possessions and pretended to give the proceeds to the
							Apostles, but kept back part of the price— For this attempt at fraud
							they were miraculously struck dead, but at the same time <persRef
								ref="peter">Peter</persRef> by reminding Ananias, that the property
							had been his own, that the donation of it had been voluntary, and that
							his crime had consisted in the deception, appears at least to have
							released all other disciples from the obligation of selling all they had
							to give to the poor— In the parable of Lazarus, when the rich man, being
							in the torments of Hell, called on Abraham for Mercy and to send Lazarus
							to dip the tip of his fingers in water to cool his tongue— Abraham in
							his answer assigns for his reasons of refusal, not that the rich man was
							suffering the punishment of his crimes; but that he had received his
							good things in his life time—and Lazarus evil things. The rich man had
							misused his wealth in the habitual indulgence of pride and sensuality.
							Abraham also alledges that there is a great gulf fixed between Heaven
							and Hell; which cannot be passed by those on either side— The latter
							part of the Parable presents the rich man in a favourable light; for
							when he finds there is to be no end or relief to his own torment, he
							intreats Abraham to send Lazarus to his father’s house; to admonish his
							five brethren to repent, and avoid the punishment that he is enduring—
							There is something so amiable in this trait of brotherly affection,
							stronger than death, stronger than Hell, that it always excited in my
							breast a sentiment of compassion in favour of this unfortunate rich man—
							This sympathy for others in the midst of his own torment and despair
							shews him at least as not wholly reprobate, and leads me to wish that
							there might at least have been an end to his miseries— The reference to
								<persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef> and the prophets was hardly
							sufficient if it be true that the sanctions of the Mosaic Law were all
							temporal, and that <persRef ref="johnthebaptist">John the
								Baptist</persRef> was the first who proclaimed repentance as the
							condition of Salvation— Neither does the declaration that if they
							believe not Moses and the prophets they <pb type="ms" n="384"/>would as
							little be persuaded by a Messenger from the dead, tally with the
							necessity for a new dispensation in the person of Christ himself— I
							examined <persRef ref="hewlett-john">Hewlett’s</persRef> Commentary upon
							this parable; but his only remarks are upon the idea of Hell contained
							in it; which is observed to be analogous to that of the Pagan Mythology.
							M’Cormick observed upon the statement that Lazarus was in Abraham’s
							bosom, that it was founded on the ancient idea that the bliss of Heaven
							consisted in a perpetual banquet, and that Abraham as father of the
							faithful, being at the head of the feast, and that the guests being
							arranged according to their honours and dignities, he who reclined next
							to him was said to lie in his bosom— He also remarked upon the
							intimation that the blessed in Heaven and the accursed in Hell can see
							one another; and observed that we can see fixed Stars at the distance of
							many hundred Millions of Miles— But he said nothing of the Conversation,
							between Abraham and the rich man— We cannot hear at the distance of a
							fixed Star— There is no doubt in my mind that this and all the other
							Parables of Christ were fictitious narratives, to inculcate moral and
							religious principles.— Here is now a scruple of my Meditations upon the
							religious services which I have this day attended— Would it have been
							well or ill, if I had followed this practice these forty years?— I
							called this Evening to see <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>, but he was not at
							home; I therefore closed the Evening with a short walk.</p>

							Account— This is the third time that O’Brien settles, and he certainly
							will make application to Congress again— The system of our Consular
							Establishments in Barbary has always been bad; and was formerly worse
							than it is now— O’Brien was an Irish Sailor, who had got to be a master
							of a Vessel; the first taken by the Algerines under the American flag,
							in 1785— His only qualification for being Consul, was his having been
							ten years in <pb type="ms" n="385"/>Algiers as a Slave. He took part in
							the negotiation of our first Peace with Algiers, and claims great credit
							for it; <persRef ref="cathcart-james">Cathcart</persRef> does the same,
							and both with little cause— There were too many makers of that Treaty,
							and it was a very bad one. O’Brien was then sent as Consul; and what
							with annual tributes to pay, and presents to make, and trading
							speculations with Algerine Ministers and Jew-Brokers, and French and
							Spanish captures, O’Brien contrived to scatter enormous sums of public
							money, and to open an inexhaustible fountain of claims for himself.
							Cathcart has done the same; and they will both be laying siege to
							Congress for more grants and allowances as long as they live. Pleasonton
							brought me this morning a book containing a full settlement of O’Brien’s
							Accounts in 1806 when every charge that he made was admitted.
							Notwithstanding which he made new claims and obtained a new Settlement
							in 1808— Last Summer he worried a further allowance out of the <persRef

							account; but the material quality which has accomplished it, has been
							perseverance. Perhaps the greatest advantage of this custom is, its
							continual tendency to restrain useless expenditure. Its result after any
							given length of time, is invariably to shew greater expence than at any
							particular time would be expected. The situation of an American Minister
							in Europe, is dangerous and difficult on the score of expense, beyond
							all others— The difference of my expenses in different years, though
							with a family has been as one to ten, being in 1802 and 1804. less than
							two thousand two hundred dollars, and in 1817 little short of twenty two
							thousand— At present I have still great difficulty to keep my current
							expenses within my income, and my <pb type="ms" n="386"/>book shews for
							each of the years 1818 and 1819. an amount exceeding ten thousand
							dollars. At the Office, I had visits from <persRef ref="mullowny-john"
								>Captain Mullowney</persRef>, going as Consul to Morocco, for
							Instructions; and from <persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron de
								Stackelberg</persRef> the Swedish Chargé d’Affaires to inform me
							that he is going to be absent for two or three Months; and to ask again
							for answers to his notes upon the Sailors and upon the yellow fever— I
							told him I should send him answers shortly, and if not before he left
							the City, I would forward them to him at Philadelphia— I was drafting
							Instructions to <persRef ref="forbes-john">Forbes</persRef>, and a
							Letter to <persRef ref="prevost-john">Prevost</persRef>, but lost much
							of the day, by the unhinging properties of the weather— The succession
							of thunder showers continued through the day, but without clearing the
							atmosphere— I did nothing in the Evening.</p>

								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>— The heat of the weather
							continues, with a succession of Thunder-Showers which have not yet
							purified the atmosphere— The habit of indolence grows upon me at the

							Office, little before noon, and was occupied with the drafts of
							despatches to <persRef ref="forbes-john">Forbes</persRef> and to
								<persRef ref="prevost-john">J. B. Prevost</persRef>. I was unable to
							complete them; and was much dissatisfied with what I did. I found no
							small difficulty in preparing the Letter to Prevost, whose conduct has
							in my opinion been very exceptionable, but who is in such high favour
							with the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, that he judges
							of him more indulgently than I do— My duty being under these
							Circumstances to convey to him the President’s Sentiments rather than my
							own. I am always apprehensive in alluding to the parts of his conduct
							which I think improper, of manifesting the displeasure which I feel, and
							of touching upon them with a hand not sufficiently gentle— The President
							has directed that the Affair of <persRef ref="cochrane-thomas">Lord
								Cochrane’s</persRef> capture of money, belonging to Citizens of the
							United States should be specially committed to Forbes—that Prevost
							should be informed his conduct had been criticised, and that a Copy of
							the intercepted Letter concerning him should be sent to him. Of the
							authenticity of that Letter, I myself have doubts, but even if it is a
							forgery, written with the express purpose of injuring Prevost here, it
							shews too much knowledge of his real conduct, and tallies too well with
							his own Letters to leave him altogether justified. Its point is that it
							extols in the highest terms of commendation that which was in reality
							gross misconduct; and of the very species of misconduct, which Prevost
							has not been scrupulous of charging upon <persRef ref="biddle-james"
								>Biddle</persRef>, though on the other side, Biddles conduct was
							perhaps indiscreet; and not entirely disinterested— But he turned it at
							least to the account of his Countrymen; for whom he saved and rescued
							property to a very large amount— He obtained also the release of many
							Citizens of the United States who were prisoners— Prevost has never
							saved a dollar, nor obtained the release of a man— And in the case of
							the property 145000 dollars plundered from American Citizens by Lord
							Cochrane, instead of espousing and maintaining the interest of his own
							Countrymen, he has rather taken side against them; seizing a most
							unsuitable time in the very Letter giving an account of this transaction
							to pass a high panegyric upon that swindling robber— There is something
							disheartening in all our correspondence and transactions relating to
							South-America— We have done every thing possible in their favour, and
							have received from them little else than injury in return. No
							satisfaction has been obtained from them upon any complaint, and they
							have been constantly endeavouring to entangle us with them and their
							cause. Prevost has been one of their dupes if not worse; and by his
							correspondence has contributed all in his power to make us dupes also. I

								>Cardelli</persRef> came with his two associates this Morning to my
							house and requested me to witness their Articles of Agreement which I
							did— There are three of them, but they have only two copies of their
							Articles. They asked me if I could not furnish them Passports to go into
							Mexico, but I could not. With <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> I attended Church at
								<persRef ref="mccormick-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Cormicks’</persRef>— He read prayers for the sixth Sunday after
							Trinity and preached from Jeremiah XVII:9–10. [“]The heart is deceitful
							above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?— I the Lord
							search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to
							his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.” M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Cormick enlarged upon the necessity
							which required that <persRef ref="jeremiah">Jeremiah</persRef> should
							proclaim severe though wholesome truths, and upon the ill-will and <pb
								type="ms" n="387"/>cruel treatment which he experienced for this
							discharge of his duty; and he hinted that the same truths were to be
							proclaimed by the Ministers of the Gospel though at the same hazard.
							There was little in the discourse to be remembered; but the moral
							sentiment contained in the text is of infinite importance, and every one
							to whose remembrance it is called should reflect upon it, for repentance
							and improvement in moral virtue— The ideas expressed by these two verses
							in the Latin vulgate are— [“]The heart of all men is wicked and
							unsearchable—who shall know it? I, the Lord, searching the heart, and
							trying the reins; who give to every one according to his way, and
							according to the fruit of his inventions.” The sentiment in the English
							Bible that the heart is <hi rend="italic">deceitful</hi> implies that it
							deceives itself— The Latin Bible seems only to represent it as
							inscrutable to others— But if the heart deceives itself, who can detect
							the deception?— I the Lord, is the answer, and will reward and punish
							according to the merits of every one; which would imply that every one
							has at least the power of detecting and correcting the deceptions of his
							own heart— And what is intended by the Heart? it is here the seat of all
							the affections and passions. In the New Testament Christ teaches that
							all human wickedness proceeds from the heart— For its self deceptions
							the remedy is close and severe self scrutiny and prayer. After reading
							the whole chapter which contains these verses, it does not appear plain
							to me why they are in it— They do not apply particularly to the subjects
							of the chapter— There is, as in almost all the prophetical writings a
							want of continuity in the composition. This chapter begins by
							complaining of the idolatry of <persRef ref="judah">Judah</persRef>—
							Then comes a curse upon the man who trusteth in man, and a blessing upon
							him who trusteth in the Lord— The curse and the blessing are contrasted
							by the similitudes of a blasted and a flourishing tree— The verses of
							the text then follow, and their connection with the preceding verses is
							not very apparent—but the next verse, also an admirable moral lesson
							appears to be still more out of its place, and disconnected with the
							subjects of the chapter— “As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth
							them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them
							in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.” The wretched
							end of misbegotten wealth is here represented by an elegant allusion;
							but why is it introduced here? it would have seemed more suitable among
							the proverbs of Solomon— The simile itself is incorrect in the English
							translation— It should be that the Partridge hatches eggs which she did
							not lay— But the brood desert her for their natural mother— After this
							the prophet prays to be protected from persecution; and the last nine
							verses are a solemn admonition to the kings and people of Judah, to
							hallow the sabbath day in Jerusalem, and to allow no burdens to be borne
							through the gates upon it— This mixture of subjects has much
							incongruity; and tends to make the bible unintelligible— My business is
							to lay to heart the instruction which it gives, and to apply it to the
							conduct of life. As the injunction of <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon</persRef> is— Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of
							it are the issues of life— Prov. IV, 23. After Church we called at
								<persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye’s</persRef>, and saw their infant <persRef ref="frye-thomas"

						<p><date>10. IV:30.</date> A great part of this morning was absorbed in a

							the <persRef ref="protagoras">Protagoras</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="plato">Plato</persRef>, and from thence in the <persRef

							pretenders; of whom he names <persRef ref="periander"
								>Periander</persRef> of Corinth, <persRef ref="epimenides"
									>Epimenides</persRef> the Sicilian, and the Scythian elder
							Anacharsis— If I had more books I should very probably waste a week upon
							this enquiry; for in the Greek dictionary of <persRef ref="schrevelius"
								>Schrevelius</persRef> there is a list of them, with one wise saying

							Some of these sayings are obscure and need explanation— In the

						<p><date>11. V:</date> I enter upon the fifty-fourth year of my age— Morning
							bath in the Potowmack, alone. <persRef ref="cook-thomas">T.
								Cook</persRef> was here. <persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron
								Stackelberg</persRef> was at the Office, to take leave for an
							absence of two or three Months. I finished my drafts of Instructions and
							Letters to <persRef ref="forbes-john">J. M. Forbes</persRef>— In
							consulting the <persRef ref="protagoras">Protagoras</persRef> of
								<persRef ref="plato">Plato</persRef>, in search of the Grecian wise
							men, I was drawn to read a great part of the Dialogue, of which I have
							two French Translations; one by <persRef ref="dacier-andre"
								>Dacier</persRef>, and the other by <persRef ref="grou-jean"
								>Grou</persRef>. The Grecian Sophists were professed teachers of
							wisdom; or as they would now be called professor’s of moral philosophy.
								<persRef ref="socrates">Socrates</persRef> appears to have
							considered them as dangerous corruptors of Youth; yet he treats them all
							with great civility and apparent respect— There are three of them
							introduced in this Dialogue— Protagoras, of Abdera, <persRef
								ref="prodicus">Prodicus</persRef> of Ceos, and <persRef
								ref="hippias">Hippias</persRef> of Elis— The form of the discourse
							is a conversation between Socrates and one of his friends to whom he
							relates what had passed at an interview between himself and these
							Sophists, at the House of Callias where they were lodging, in presence
							of many young Athenians— Socrates relates that he had been roused from
							his bed before daylight by a young man named <persRef ref="hippocrates"
								>Hippocrates</persRef>; inviting him to go and see and hear
							Protagoras who had just arrived at Athens—that he had accordingly gone
							with him; but while on the way, had examined Hippocrates to ascertain
							what his motive was in wishing to hear Protagoras— He tells him it is to
							learn wisdom—upon which Socrates after proving in his manner to
							Hippocrates, by a series of questions, that he does not distinctly
							understand what he means by wisdom earnestly cautions him against
							putting himself into the hands of a professed teacher of wisdom, who
							sells his doctrines as merchandize, and cries them up, as a Pedlar his
							wares; but who perhaps passes off poison for medecine— When they come to
							the house the incidents are dramatically disposed and the dialogue
							between Socrates and Protagoras is engaged— The enquiry is naturally
							brought on, what it is that a Sophist professes to teach— Protagoras
							after passing a censure upon other Sophists says that he for his part
							teaches Prudence, domestic and political; that which enables a man to
							manage both his own affairs and those of the public to the best possible
							advantage— Socrates maintains that this cannot be taught— The question
							of the Protagoras therefore is, whether Wisdom can be taught, as a
							Science; and at the conclusion of the Dialogue Socrates remarks, that in
							the result the disputants have changed sides— Protagoras concluding that
							wisdom is not a teachable Science, and he Socrates that it is. Socrates
							speaks in terms of exalted esteem of Prodicus; but introduces him making
							a continual display of nice distinctions between words nearly
							synonymous—as neutral and indifferent—approbation and applause— Pleasure
							and Delight, all of which he defines to shew the difference between
							them— I have a great veneration for Prodicus, as the author of that
							admirable fable, the Choice of <persRef ref="hercules"
								>Hercules</persRef>. If the sayings of the Sophists had all been of
							the same Stamp, Socrates would have found it difficult to prove against
							them that wisdom is not a teachable Science— Warm and idle evening.</p>

						<p><date>12. IV:30.</date> Intermitted the morning bath, without improving
							the time spared by the intermission; returned to the <persRef
								ref="protagoras">Protagoras</persRef> of <persRef ref="plato"
								>Plato</persRef>— It is to be remembered that no such dialogue ever
							took place; but that the object of Plato was to decry the Sophists—
								<persRef ref="socrates">Socrates</persRef> viewed them much in the
							same light with regard to morals, that Jesus did the Scribes and
							Pharisees in religion. The Grecian Sophists have had the ordinary <pb
								type="ms" n="389"/>fate of a vanquished party— They have suffered in
							reputation more than they deserved. The real object of the Protagoras is
							to prove that virtue is knowledge, and a teachable Science, but that
							Protagoras, and the other Sophists could not, or did not teach it upon
							its true principles. The doctrine of Socrates that Virtue is the first
							beautiful and good, the only source of human happiness, is not formally
							disclosed in this dialogue— You see it running through the whole chain
							of his reasoning; but without laying it down— He applies it like a
							chemical test to the reasoning of Protagoras; whose argument against the
							ostensible position of Socrates, that virtue cannot be taught, is sound
							and conclusive— The discourse of Protagoras indeed contains many
							ingenious and admirable things— His Fable of <persRef ref="prometheus"
								>Prometheus</persRef> and <persRef ref="epimetheus"
								>Epimetheus</persRef> is a curious History of the Creation of man,
							strictly moral in its tendency, and pleasant as a narrative. His
							argument that virtue is teachable drawn from the practice of punishing
							criminals, not to avenge the past but as example for the future,
							Socrates does not attempt to answer. It seems unanswerable; and contains
							in itself a whole theory of criminal Jurisprudence— The victory that
							Socrates obtains over him is by shewing that his first principles are
							not settled. That he has no distinct idea of what Virtue is— He puzzles
							him by asking him whether by Virtue he means one whole, of which
							Temperance, Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, and Piety are parts—and upon
							the answer that he does— Socrates enquires whether by parts of the whole
							he means that each of those qualities is a distinct part like the
							different members of one body or whether they are like particles of the
							same substance each possessing all the properties of the whole— This is
							the Snare into which Protagoras falls— He answers that they are distinct
							and separate parts of the whole, each unlike the whole, and each unlike
							the others— From this concession Socrates soon leads him into
							self-contradiction and absurdity— The dialogue is then managed with
							great dexterity. The Sophist attempts to escape by general declamation,
							and sallies out of the subject. Socrates presses him to the last hairs
							breadth of his temper— The discussion once or twice threatens to
							terminate abruptly— The other interlocutors, <persRef ref="alcibiades"
								>Alcibiades</persRef>, <persRef ref="callias">Callias</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="prodicus">Prodicus</persRef> and Hippias occasionally
							interpose, and always in a characteristic manner— Socrates resumes,
							alternately frets and soothes his opponent; demonstrates unanswerably,
							that he has no fixed first principles; no fountain of Virtue, and then
							conciliates him by the concession, that he himself is equally in
							fault—that his conclusion is in direct contradiction to his promises—
							And proposes to take up again at another time the question what is
							virtue; and whether it can be taught— I could extend my observations
							much further on this Dialogue, and would gladly review all the works of
							Plato—but this is now waste of time. At the Office, <persRef
								ref="obrien-richard">Captain O’Brien</persRef> came to take leave,
							till next winter— He said he had now got his schooner off the Stocks,
							and should then come to launch his brig. I wrote a supplementary, and
							final Instruction to <persRef ref="forbes-john">J. M. Forbes</persRef>.
							When I came home to dinner I found at my house the Osage Indians
								<persRef ref="bigbear">Big Bear</persRef>, <persRef ref="bigroad"
								>Big Road</persRef> and <persRef ref="blackspirit">Black
								Spirit</persRef>; but they were without interpreter, and we could

							accord, and were sitting in the entry, enjoying the freshness of the
							breeze, and admiring the prospect in front of the house. They sat with
							us about half an hour, and particularly noticed the glass lamp in the
							entry; the lustre in the drawing room; the Sopha and the Harp— One of
							them spanned <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary Hellen</persRef> round the
							waist, and then applying the same span of his fingers to himself,
							marvelled how she could be so small— They talked much with one another;
							and I observed in the sound of their utterance frequent use of the
							guttural <hi rend="italic">g</hi> as pronounced by the dutch, and of the

								>Alcibiades</persRef> an<unclear>d Cr</unclear><persRef
								ref="critias">itias</persRef> come in immediately after Socrates— It
							would seem that there were no fixed hours at which the Sophists taught
							their Science— Their disciples followed them; and they delivered their
							doctrines in formal harangues— Socrates finds fault with this mode of
							instruction, by saying that he is forgetful and cannot remember long
							discourses. His method of teaching was by interrogatories and familiar
							conversation— There is a keen stroke of Satire upon the declamation of
							the Sophists, thrown in by way of incident in the narrative— When
							Socrates and his young friend come to the house of Callias, they stop a
							few minutes in the porch to finish the Conversation in which they were
							engaged on the way. They then knock at the door— The Porter, an old
							Eunuch, half opens it and seeing them exclaims—So! More Sophists? He has
							not time!—and shuts the door upon their faces— They have quite an
							expostulation with him, and solemnly protest they are no Sophists, and
							only want to see Protagoras, before he lets them in— There is in the
							dialogue a long and acute critical analysis of a Song of Simonides,
							which is first quoted by <persRef ref="protagoras">Protagoras</persRef>,
							as containing two contradictory passages, but which Socrates vindicates
							against the charge of inconsistency— He calls in aid the nice
							distinctions of <persRef ref="prodicus">Prodicus</persRef>, and makes
							free use of them in this discussion, but concludes by censuring the
							introduction of quotations from Poets; which he compares to the
							introduction of music at entertainments; by those who have no resources
							of conversation in themselves— This passage opens a train of reflections
							which I should be glad to pursue— But my Sylph or Demon must say like
							the old Eunuch of Callias, he has not time— After I had passed an hour
							or two at my window, reading there came up a shower of rain, followed by
							a change of wind and a fall of ten or twelve degrees of the thermometer—
							I sat down to write, and brought up my Journal— But for this I was
							obliged to encroach upon my Office hours after breakfast— At the Office,
							I finished my draft of Instructions to <persRef ref="mullowny-john"
								>Captain Mullowney</persRef>, and wrote to <persRef ref="simpson-jj"
								>J. J. Simpson</persRef>, <persRef ref="simpson-j">the son of the
								late Consul at Tangier</persRef>— Two men by the name of <persRef
								ref="audley-unknown">Audley</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="florence-unknown">Florence</persRef>, came to the Office,
							saying that they belonged to Charleston South-Carolina, which they left
							nearly a year since; that they had been residing some time at New-York;
							then went upon a visit to Boston— There took passage in a Coasting
							vessel for Alexandria—went ashore at Barnstable, and passed the Night;
							during which their vessel made sail and left them behind— Then they took
							passage in another vessel to Baltimore, and thence walked to this place,
							to enquire after Commissions in the army; but were informed there was no
							vacancy— And now they were here in want of the necessaries of life— They
							had the dress, and pretensions of Gentlemen, and Audley pretended to be
							personally acquainted with the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef>— They were not truant boys, escaped from
							school, and pushing to seek their fortunes, but one avowed <pb type="ms"
								n="391"/>himself to be twenty, and the other twenty-four years old.
							After putting several questions to them, which I found them shy to
							answer, I told them that their account of themselves was so strange that
							I could only advise them to write to their friends at New-York or
							Charleston whom they represented as respectable and wealthy, for relief.
								<persRef ref="roth-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="adams-abigail">my dear mother’s</persRef> constant

							Conversation is an art of the highest importance, and a school in which
							for the business of life, more may perhaps be learnt than from books— It
							is indeed, and must be desultory and superficial; and as a school
							consists more in making others talk, than in talking. Therein has been
							and ever will be my deficiency— The talent of starting the game— A man
							who has that need talk but little himself—when once the ball is set in
							motion, it will roll, and in considering conversation as a school, I
							mean it as a school to learn, and not to teach.</p>

						<p><date>16. V:30.</date> Attended Church at <persRef ref="mccormick-andrew"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Cormick’s</persRef> with
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>. He read prayers for
							the seventh Sunday after Trinity, and his Sermon was from Isaiah
							I.VIII:13.14. “If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing
							thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of
							the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways,
							nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:—Then shalt
							thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the
							high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of <persRef
								ref="jacob">Jacob</persRef> thy father: for the mouth of the LORD
							hath spoken it.” The Sermon was upon the duties of the Sabbath, which he
							said were more fully and comprehensively described in this text than in
							any other of the Scriptures. The composition was of modern date; perhaps
								<persRef ref="sherlock-thomas">Sherlock</persRef>, or <persRef
								ref="leed-unknown">Leed</persRef>. After some general remarks <pb
								type="ms" n="392"/>upon the character of the institution of the
							Sabbath, as a day of religious meditation, and of abstraction from the
							labours, the cares, and the pleasures of the world, with a note of
							censure upon the Roman Catholic Church for devoting great part of the
							day to amusement, and upon a great proportion of other Christians who
							give it up to worldly concerns, writing Letters, posting books, making
							useless visits or dissipation, which were indicated in the text by the
							terms, doing thine own ways, he divided his discourse into three
							parts—first considering those things from which it is the Christian’s
							duty to abstain on this day; Secondly, those things which he ought to
							perform; and thirdly the benefits and advantages of this Institution to
							mankind. On the first point his doctrine was that we should abstain in
							thoughts, conversation and conduct from every thing not only sinful, but
							of a temporal and worldly nature; and he enlarged upon the duty of
							subjecting our thoughts to discipline and of bringing ourselves to a
							deep and practical conviction that we are answerable to God not only for
							our words and actions but even for the conceptions of our hearts—
							Passing then to the positive duties of the day, he insisted upon that of
							attending the public ordinances of religion—upon family and closet
							prayer, upon reading and meditation of the Scriptures upon
							self-examination; upon due attention to the morals and religion to the
							members and domestics of our families; and a suitable remembrance to
							perform acts of brotherly kindness and Charity— The third part of the
							Discourse was that in which he rose to the highest flights of eloquence—
							The first great advantage which he pointed out as resulting from the
							Sabbath was its affording the means of moral and religious
							Instruction—of enlightening the mind; of purifying the heart; of
							improving in virtue; and preparing us for a better discharge of all our
							duties in this world, and for appearance before our judge in the next—
							The second was its furnishing us with the means of acquiring our eternal
							salvation, by propitiating the favour of our Creator. He observed that
							the first Institution of the Sabbath was to commemorate the repose of
							the Supreme being after the first Creation of the world—when the morning
							Stars sung together, and the Sons of God shouted for joy— That its
							observance was enjoined in the Law from Sinai, written with the finger
							of God, and proclaimed amidst the trembling of the mountain, the
							swelling sound of the trumpet, the flashes of lightening and the voice
							of Thunder.— That it was the day of the second Creation, when the
							Saviour of mankind rose from the dead, and completed the redemption of
							mankind from the thraldom of sin and death— The day when the gift of the
							Holy Ghost was poured out upon the apostles with that of tongues, and
							the power of prophecy— These striking recollections were followed by a
							rapid view of all the blessings of the Sabbath to man in a style of
							composition of the highest order, closing in a climax of beauty and
							sublimity, to which it seemed to me neither the speaker nor his auditory
							were sufficiently sensible.— The house was fuller than usual, but nobody
							appeared to be aware that it was other than an ordinary Sermon; and
							although while it was delivering I fancied I could almost repeat every
							word of it, yet when I came home it had all vanished from my memory,
							save what is here noted down— On returning home, I answered a Letter,
							which I have had five Months upon file from <persRef
								ref="jennings-jonathan">Governor Jennings</persRef> of Indiana, and
							read the Letters and newspapers that came by the Mail. <persRef
								ref="rowse-adeline">Adeline Rowe</persRef> a young girl who lives
							with <persRef ref="colvin-john;colvin-unknown" type="multi">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Colvin</persRef> dined with us. I called this Evening with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> to see <persRef ref="calhoun-john;calhoun-floride"
								type="multi">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Calhoun</persRef> but they were not
							at home— Elegant and forcible as the Sermon this day read by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Cormick was, its doctrine was driven to
							extremes— The sanctification of the Sabbath is prescribed in the
							Scriptures; but the real doctrine of the New Testament on this subject
							is a relaxation from the rigour of the old— Neither works of necessity,
							nor of benevolence, nor of good neighbourhood, nor even innocent
							recreation are incompatible with the duties of the day. The general
							character of its occupations ought to be religious and meditative; but
							the Sabbath, said Jesus, was made for man and not man for the Sabbath—
							My practice throughout life has been various, and modified by the usages
							of the different Countries in which I have resided; it is not upon
							reflection, entirely satisfactory to myself. It has not been what it
							ought to have been— It has not been so constantly devoted to my own
							moral improvement, as it might have been, and has too often been to me a
							day of mere relaxation and amusement— For I agree in the Sentiment
							expressed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Cormick, that the Sunday
							is not meant for a day of idleness, but for a day <pb type="ms" n="393"
							/>of eminent exertion and assiduity. May it hereafter be so to me. The
							general tenour of the chapter of <persRef ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef>
							of which these are the concluding verses, is an indignant contrast
							between the pretended merit of <hi rend="italic">fasting</hi>, and the
							real virtue of relieving the oppressed, and the poor— These are duties
							inculcated with the greatest earnestness throughout the Bible— It may be
							termed the great foundation of Bible Morality— These duties are very
							slightly touched in the ethics of paganism— The sentiment in <persRef
								ref="terence">Terence</persRef>—Homo sum, nil humani a me alienum
							puto, electrified a Roman auditory; because it was new— It is the
							veriest of all commonplaces in the Bible. In the Hebrew system, religion
							and morals were grappled indissolubly together— Analyze the Decalogue,
							and you find the first Commandment prescribing the <hi rend="italic"
								>unity</hi> of God—the second forbidding the idolatry of graven
							images—the third, forbidding the light and idle use of God’s name—the
							fourth enjoins the observance of the Sabbath— These four embrace the
							duties to God. The fifth sanctifies the special relation between Parent
							and child— It seems to be a connecting link between the two tables— The
							rest are all duties of man to his neighbour that is to his fellow
							creature— They are all negative; prohibiting the violation of the rights
							of others— The sixth forbids violence to his life—the seventh to his
							marriage rights, the eighth to his property; the ninth to his
							reputation; and the tenth goes directly to the heart; stops
							transgression in its first conception, and spreads a shield over all the
							possessions of man in Society, by interdicting all unlawful desires.
							“Thou shalt not covet.”— The commandments of the first table were
							enjoined with awful solemnity and sanctioned by dreadful penalties; but
							the burden of all the prophets, and of all the New Testament is the
							scornful rejection of every pretence that the performance of the duties
							to God, operates as an exemption from the fulfilment of those to
							man.</p>

						<p><date>22. V:</date> The day was cooler than it has been for some time. I
							bathed in the river alone. Upon taking up my old draught of a Report
							upon Weights and Measures I found I should be obliged to write the whole
							over again. There is scarcely a page of what I have written that will be
							proper for the Report— At the Office I wasted much time by inserting a
							list of new appointments in the Register of Officers; and wrote to the
								<persRef ref="clarke-john2">Governor of Georgia</persRef>, to give
							him certain explanations. When he applied last winter, by virtue of
							Resolutions of the Legislature of that State, for the holding of
							Treaties with the Creek and Cherokee Indians, he requested that <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> might be appointed
							one of the Commissioners on the part of the United States. He was not
							appointed, the reason of which I believe to be, the enmity between him
							and <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>. But the
							reasons assigned to me by <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>
							were two—first that Jackson himself had earnestly requested not to be
							employed again as a Commissioner to treat with Indians—and secondly that
							the State of Mississippi had already applied for his appointment to
							treat with Indians in that State, which had been declined for the same
							reason. I wrote therefore to Governor Clark, <pb type="ms" n="395"
							/>assigning these reasons for the non-appointment of Jackson. A few days
							since the Newspapers announced the actual appointment of Jackson as a
							Commissioner to treat with the Mississippi Indians— I spoke of it last
							Evening to Calhoun, and told him what I had upon his suggestion written
							to Governor Clark— He said he had told me that the appointment of
							Jackson, on the Mississippi application was <hi rend="italic"
								>withheld</hi>, till it should be ascertained whether he would
							accept it— And as there had been a strong solicitation to him from the
							whole delegation of the State of Mississippi, he had very reluctantly
							consented to serve in that case. An explanation from me to Clark became
							necessary for which purpose I wrote to him. This whole affair of
							negotiating Treaties with the Creeks and Cherokees is made an affair of
							violent party oppositions in Georgia— <persRef ref="cobb-thomas"
								>Cobb</persRef>, the member of the House of Representatives who the
							year before last, brought forward the Resolutions against Jackson, last
							Winter, after getting a hint from Crawford, that a Message from the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> to Congress, founded
							upon Clark’s application, would go recommending an appropriation to hold
							those Treaties, made a motion in the House to the same effect; and
							although in his Speech he told the House that he understood such a
							Message would come; yet he afterwards published his Speech with a Note,
							insinuating that the Executive of Georgia, had neglected to transmit the
							Resolutions of the Legislature to the members from the State in
							Congress, and that the President’s Message had been got up, in
							consequence only of his motion— And there has arisen from this a long
							newspaper controversy, not yet concluded, to whom, Clark or Cobb, the
							merit of obtaining this appropriation belongs—all which, as well as the
							screening of <persRef ref="mitchell-david">Mitchell</persRef> and the

								<persRef ref="ramsay-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							to see me. It is little more than a year since he went out as Minister
							Plenipotentiary to Rio de Janeiro; but he was hypocondriac before he
							sailed, and his health became very infirm, soon after he arrived in
							South-America; he applied for a leave of absence, which was granted— But
							meeting with an opportunity to come home he availed himself of it,
							without waiting for this permission which was forwarded to him about two
							Months ago. He came in a vessel bound to Alexandria, and the first I
							heard of him was this arrival in the City. Kerr says he has the
							appearance of being very greatly reduced and emaciated— With my family I
							attended Church— <persRef ref="mccormick-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> M’Cormick</persRef> read prayers for the eighth Sunday
							after Trinity; and preached from 1. Corinthians XV:32. “Let us eat and
							drink: for to-morrow we die.”— A Discourse far inferior to that of the
							last Sunday, but of which the doctrine was Temperance. He spoke of the
							text as being a maxim of the Epicurean philosophy, given out at the time
							when the Grecian Sages were first speculating upon the nature of man,
							and the sources of human happiness. That it was founded upon the assumed
							principle that the present life comprized the whole sum of our
							existence; physical enjoyment the whole mass of our happiness, and
							selfishness the whole compass of our duties. That in modern times it was
							adopted by many of those who are disbelievers in the religion of Christ,
							with whom the maxim of a short life and a merry one was as familiar as
							the aphorism of the text was to the antient epicureans. But to those who
							were conscious of possessing immortal Souls; to those who were desirous
							of attaining the great and real ends of existence; to those who expected
							to be accountable hereafter for the deeds done in the body, it was
							proper to enquire into the soundness of the maxim, and to ascertain
							first whether eating and drinking, pampering the body, really are the
							principal sources of happiness; and secondly whether the reason assigned
							in the text for the indulgence of the appetites is a sound and
							sufficient one to warrant the conclusion to which it points— He then
							shewed the superiority of moral and intellectual pleasures, over those
							of mere sensuality— The weariness and satiety with which these were
							followed, the diseases of the body, distress of mind, ruin of estate and
							reputation to which they lead, and the anguish, remorse <pb type="ms"
								n="396"/>and despair which they brought to the bed of death— These
							topics are obvious, and they were handled in an ordinary manner— A
							deathbed scene was introduced of a man of pleasure, contrasted with one
							of a temperate and pious Christian, which <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> said was taken from <persRef ref="massillon-jean"
								>Massillon</persRef>— To the question why if the indulgence of the
							animal appetites was vicious, they were thus baited with pleasure; the
							question was retorted why, if sensual pleasure was the aim of life,
							faculties of intellectual and moral enjoyment so much more exquisite
							were given? In the latter part of the Discourse, the hand of the
							Preacher himself was discernable. It was an exhortation to temperance,
							not very well adapted to the Style of the rest— <persRef
								key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> W. S.
								Smith</persRef> and <persRef ref="cook-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> T. Cook</persRef> accompanied <persRef

								Adams</persRef> to Church— As I came home, <persRef
								ref="bulfinch-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bulfinch</persRef> lent me a pamphlet published at Boston, upon the
							occasion of the new Episcopalian Church just built there— A dissuasive
							from the weakness of joining it, written with much ingenuity, keen
							satire, and bitter invective upon the Episcopalian form of Church
							service under a shew of candour and moderation— At home I read the
							Chapter from which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Cormick’s text was
							taken, and <persRef ref="hewlett-john">Hewlett’s</persRef> commentary
							upon it— The whole chapter is an argument to prove the resurrection of
							the dead— <persRef ref="paul">St Paul</persRef> appeals to the fact of
							the Resurrection of Christ as proof of the Resurrection of the dead— The
							text is taken from Is. XXII.13. and Hewlett from <persRef
								ref="secker-thomas">Secker</persRef> observes that it stands not in
							opposition to temperance, but to mortification and fasting— Its Logic is
							if there be no future life, let us enjoy the present— This Chapter is
							very unsatisfactory— S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul supposes an
							objector to ask how the dead are raised, and with what body they come?
							He answers by calling the questioner a fool; and by likening the
							resurrection to a plant raised from a seed. Now although the raising of
							a plant from the seed is a wonderful, and almost inconceivable operation
							of Nature it has no analogy with the resurrection of an organized body
							destroyed by death. In the Phadon, the principal argument of <persRef
								ref="socrates">Socrates</persRef>, in favour of the immortality of
							the Soul, is the analogy of nature, by which life and death alternately
							proceed from each other— S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul’s allusion
							to the seed and plant is a specification of this argument; but its
							analogy does not hold— The analogy of the Resurrection of the body,
							would be that an imperishable tree should shoot out from the trunk of a
							dead tree, or from its ashes if burnt. The death of the body is followed
							by the decomposition of its parts— It falls to dust, or becomes the
							flesh of worms— The growth of a plant from the seed gives me no
							conception how these scattered particles of matter are reassembled; nor
							have I any distinct idea of what S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Paul
							means by comparing the resurrection of the Body, to the different kinds
							of flesh of animals or to the different glories of the Sun, Moon and
							Stars— All the rest of this chapter is unintelligible to me: a natural
							body and a spiritual body, a living Soul, and a quickening Spirit; an
							earthy man, and a heavenly man; a corruptible <hi rend="italic"
								>body</hi> which at the sound of the trumpet, puts on incorruption,
							all this to me is dark and inconceivable— It leaves the question of
							Resurrection more doubtful than before. The resurrection of the Spirit
							disencumbered of the body, I can imagine; but the resurrection of the
							body—a body too which will no longer be flesh and blood is beyond the
							compass of my understanding— This evening, with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Adams I called at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ramsay’s,
							and saw M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. Graham, who is reduced to a

						<p><date>30. IV:30.</date> We all attended Church at <persRef
								ref="mccormick-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Cormick’s</persRef>. He read prayers for the 9<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity, and gave notice
							that he should administer the communion next Sunday— His Sermon was from
							Luke XVIII. from the tenth to the thirteenth verse inclusive, being the
							Parable of the Pharisee and the Publican— And the doctrine which he drew
							from it was an exhortation to <hi rend="italic">humility</hi>. After an
							exordium, remarking upon the earnestness with which this quality is
							recommended in the Scriptures generally, he divided his subject into a
							comparative view of the conduct of the Pharisee and the Publican— He
							noticed the Pride, the self-sufficiency, the vain-boasting of the
							former, and observed how inconsistent it was with the Spirit of Prayer—
							How unsuitable to a being whose very act of going to the temple to pray
							implied a condition of dependence and of want. He contrasted this with
							the humble and contrite exclamation of the publican, which he
							recommended to the imitation of his hearers, concluding with a solemn
							admonition to them all, that there was not among them one but who on
							faithfully and rigidly scrutinizing his own heart and conduct would find
							himself called to say with the Publican, God be merciful to me a
							Sinner.— This was an ordinary Sermon, in which the topics of spiritual
							arrogance, and self abasement were handled in an obvious manner— But the
							Sermon of <persRef ref="sterne-lawrence">Sterne</persRef> upon this
							Parable, has left scarcely any thing else to be said by others. The
							great and peculiar foundation of the Christian system of morals is the
							union of humility and benevolence— Every man must consider himself as a
							sinner towards God; as always needing and never capable of deserving
							mercy— The Pharisee was fully sensible of all this as applicable to
							others— He was sensible too that every good and perfect gift was from
							god— He thanks God for his Virtues, which all consist in the observance
							of the positive Law— He does no wrong— But his active virtue is all
							confined to fasting and paying tithes. The publican is painted—standing
							afar off—not daring even to raise his eyes—but smiting his breast—every
							incident heightens the image of sincere and profound humility— It is not
							intimated that there was any falsehood in the words of the Pharisee—it
							is implied that the sins of the publican were greater than those of the
							Pharisee—the lesson was to those who trusted in themselves that they
							were righteous and despised others. The doctrine is that the repentance
							of a Sinner justifies him before God more than the self-confiding virtue
							of the righteous— The Pharisees were rigid observers of the Letter of
							the Law; but their leaven was hypocrisy. The Pharisees were in high
							repute for their sanctity, and had an overruling influence among the
							People. The publicans were the taxgatherers for the Romans; universally
							detested, and every where admitted throughout the gospels to be vicious.
							Christ call was for repentance and he came to seek and to save that
							which was lost— It has been objected by some modern speculators in moral
							philosophy, that the Christian doctrine lays too much stress upon this
							virtue of humility: that by assuming as a principle that man is a fallen
							and degraded being, utterly incapable of himself, either of doing any
							good or of redeeming himself from the destruction which he has incurred
							it makes him a coward and a hypocrite—that it gives him the appearance
							in prayer of a recreant slave before an incensed and tyrannical master—
							That the doctrine of the Stoics which rested upon an exalted estimate of
							human nature and human powers, which supposed the will of man to be
							above all evil physical or moral was a sounder basis of ethics than that
							of Christ— There is weight in these remarks; but the natural passions of
							man are so selfish, and his feeling for others, excepting his own
							offspring is so <pb type="ms" n="400"/>weak that they require a
							counteracting check of positive precept to restore the balance— The
							tendencies of the Stoical doctrine, and indeed those of all the Grecian
							Sects of Philosophy were all selfish— The end of their enquiry was
							Happiness—the Supreme Good—Enjoyment— <persRef ref="epicurus"
								>Epicurus</persRef> found it in pleasure— <persRef ref="zeno"
								>Zeno</persRef>, in virtue— The end of the Christian, and before it
							of the Jewish doctrine was not happiness, but <hi rend="italic"
								>duty</hi>— No enquiry for the Summum bonum— Man is told that he was
							created with it, that his first forefather lost it by disobedience—that
							the capacity to recover it was secured to him by the atonement of
							Christ’s Death; and that he must complete the recovery by repentance, by
							obedience and by doing good to others. The Christian system therefore is
							in all its tendencies eminently social— The end of its enquiries, is the
							happiness of others. After returning home, I read the Chapter, of the
							text, and <persRef ref="hewlett-john">Hewlett’s</persRef> commentary
							upon it— Wrote to my Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>;
							and read <persRef ref="shenstone-william">Shenstone’s</persRef> Choice
							of Hercules— It is much inferior to <persRef ref="spence-joseph"
								>Spence’s</persRef> version of the same Fable in Stanza’s— The ideas
							are all diluted, the images indistinct— The Portraits of the two Ladies,
							are coarsely drawn; the voluptuousness of the one is without
							fascination, and the severity of the other without dignity— I spent the
							Evening at <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun’s</persRef>— The day was showery with thunder and
							lightening.</p>

						<!-- This is a summary entry without a date.-->
						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> The range of my rising hour through the Month has been
							from four to half past five; and the average, five about half the days,
							I borrow an hour and a half before breakfast to bathe in the river. The
							rest of the time, I am writing the Journal of the preceding day and
							sometimes ten days of the old index. We usually breakfast from nine to
							ten— Seldom interrupted now by visitors at my house, it is yet Noon or
							later before I leave it to walk to my Office—the distance is just a
							mile. Some of the hottest days I ride to it in the Carriage; but
							scarcely ever, except after having walked to the river— I remain at the
							Office till five or later, occupied with the current business, writing,
							and looking occasionally into Newspapers— Between five and six I walk or
							ride home and immediately dine. After dinner, while day-light lasts I
							read the Newspapers, but from the dusk of Evening, pass an hour or two
							of total vacancy, sitting at the porch of the door, or the chamber
							window; almost gasping for breath and maintaining the war with Spiders,
							bugs and musquitoes— Between nine and ten I usually retire to bed; and
							sleep with open windows— The morning from the time of rising till
							breakfast is the delightful part of the day; the heat being then
							supportable, and employment turning it to enjoyment. The Evening on the
							other hand is irksome—sultry; peopled with noisome insects, calm,
							breathless, and worst of all, idle— The Newspapers absorb too many
							hours, and mere nothingness, trifles of which I can give no account even
							to myself, many more. The consciousness of duty unperformed is ever
							present with me.</p>
