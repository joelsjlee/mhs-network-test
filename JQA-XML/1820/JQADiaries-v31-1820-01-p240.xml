								ref="bayard-william">Bayard</persRef> and C<hi rend="superscript"
								>o.</hi> at New-York, who fancy that Congress have unawares
							entrapped themselves into an obligation to pay off at par, the three per
							Cent Stocks of the United States, from the proceeds of the Western
							Lands; immediately after the old six per Cent, and deferred Stock shall
							have been all discharged— After taking the opinion of a Lawyer, <persRef
								ref="ogden-david2">David H. Ogden</persRef> to this effect, they
							made a large speculation in the Stock, which has raised it from 64 to 72
							per Cent, thinking that they have discovered a pledge for its redemption
							at par, within a very few weeks; but of which neither Congress nor any
							other holder of Union Stock seems to be <unclear>interested</unclear>.
							This supposed trap is in the Act of Congress of 4. August 1790. the
							first Law by which the debts of the United States were funded under the
							present Constitution. The wording of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.
							</hi>and 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Sections of the Law, give some
							countenance to this pretension; but it has never been so understood
							either by Congress or by the holders of the Stock; and it is surely not
							now for sharping Speculators to come and trump up a claim never thought
							of by the original parties to the bargain. M<hi rend="superscript"

							in form as a lawyer— A <persRef ref="boyd-john2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> John Jay Boyd</persRef> is the Agent of the house, which
							now raises this pretension; which I should incline to dispose of in a
							very summary manner— The President again fixed on next Monday at one
							O’Clock for a Cabinet Meeting to consider the question of the
							intercourse, with the British Colonies— After the Meeting at the
							Treasury, I called at my Office, but it was shut— Evening at home—
								<persRef ref="forbes-john">Forbes</persRef> was here— Last Night was

							House of Representatives from New-Hampshire called this morning at my
							house to ask for certain certificates, which are evidences of claims
							upon the Mississippi Stock, and which are deposited under a Law of
							Congress at the Department of State— I told him I was not authorised to
							give up any of those papers, and had invariably declined complying with
							applications for any of them. He said he had expected it would be so— At
							one O’Clock I attended a Cabinet Meeting at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>— All the members of <pb
								type="ms" n="241"/>the Administration were there— The question was
							discussed what should be communicated to the Committee of Commerce as
							the opinion of the Executive concerning further prohibitions upon the
							commercial intercourse with the British Colonies in America— It was
							concluded to recommend prohibition, both of the intercourse and of the
							importation of Articles the produce of the British Colonies— <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							pleaded hard for the exception of Plaister of Paris—as quite necessary
							to carry the remainder of the prohibition into effect by assent of the
							House of Representatives. The discussion was exceedingly languid; and no
							one appeared to take any interest in it— The final conclusion was to
							recommend additional prohibition generally, but to leave the extent of
							it, entirely to the discretion of the Committee— The question concerning
							our affairs with Spain, appears to be much more agitated among the
							members of Congress. <persRef ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef> says
							they will do nothing— That the Proposition in the Message, to carry the
							Treaty into Execution as if it had been ratified is producing a very
							great fermentation in the House of Representatives, and is very much
							censured— The objection is, that there is no precedent for it— Wirt
							himself made that objection at the time which the Message was preparing;
							and it is a natural County Court objection. The <persRef
								ref="barbour-james;barbour-philip" type="multi">Barbour’s</persRef>
							are taking it up in both houses, and as it is apparently now the
							interest and the policy of all the intriguers that the Treaty should not
							be ratified, nor Florida taken possession of, it is quite apparent that
							nothing will be done— The real motives operating to produce this effect
							will be altogether different from those disclosed— There will be a
							difficulty in resuming the negotiation with Spain, without disgracing
							the Country in its own eyes and in those of other Nations. But the real
							interests of the Nation will not be otherwise much affected by it— For
							this and deeper mortifications it behooves me to have my mind prepared—
							I mentioned that <persRef ref="lowndes-william">Lowndes</persRef> had
							told me the Missouri question, might ultimately affect the vote on
							Spanish concerns—I found the observation worked not kindly. The Missouri
							question thrills in every Southern nerve— It is yet in a state of Chaos
							in my Mind— It was past four, when the Meeting at the President’s broke
							up— <persRef ref="cardelli-pietro">Cardelli</persRef> was here this

							sufficient. The Government also required that each of them should have a
							young man, to reside with him three years as Clerk, or assistant;
							without expence to the Government, but with a claim after the three
							years to be employed in the Consular line— Baker himself has been with

						<p><date>8. VII:</date> The weather has moderated, and the greatest part of
							this day was a warm rain, which carried off great part of the Snow— At
							one O’Clock I attended at the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President’s</persRef>, and presented to him the <persRef
								ref="goupydequabeck-alexander">Viscount de Quabeck</persRef>, the
							Charge d’Affaires from the Netherlands, who delivered a Letter from
								<persRef ref="william-i">the king,</persRef> announcing the Death of
							his only Sister the <persRef ref="brunswick-frederica">Dutchess of
								Brunswick</persRef>. These official notifications become so
							frequent, and the foreign Ministers are all so punctilious to deliver
							them in form and ceremony that they have become quite tedious to me—
							This like the rest however was only an Audience of five minutes— After
							he was gone, I had a conversation of at least two hours with the
							President in which I partly opened to him the anxiety which has long
							been labouring upon my mind— He said that <persRef
								ref="walker-freeman;elliott-john" type="multi">the two Senators from
								Georgia</persRef> had been with him yesterday, and had freely
							consulted with him on the State of Affairs with Spain; and this affair
							of the Florida Treaty— As members from Georgia they were apprehensive
							that their State would become impatient if nothing should be done, and
							they came to discuss the various measures which are projected in
							Congress. The predominant disposition in that body is to do nothing upon
							this subject; and this disposition will certainly prevail. Nothing will
							be done— But as this will not exactly suit the temper of the People; the
							object of the opposition is to appear to stimulate Congress to something
							else than what was recommended by the President. I have ever since the
							question arose upon the ratification of the Florida Treaty, indistinctly
							foreseen that it would come to this result. A little more intense
							thought would have drawn the deductions as irresistible from a few very
							simple principles. Congress will do nothing; because to do any thing
							they must assume the responsibility of consequences—because they must
							incur at least the hazard of a War—taxation upon the people—and after
							all the Executive would get the principal credit of all that Congress
							would do— One of the most remarkable features of what I am witnessing
							every day is a perpetual struggle in both houses of Congress to controul
							the Executive, to make it dependent upon, and subservient to them— They
							are continually attempting to encroach upon the Powers and authorities
							of <pb type="ms" n="243"/>the President. As the old line of demarcation
							between parties has broken down, personal has taken the place of
							principled opposition— The personal friends of the President in the
							House are neither numerous nor so active, nor so able as his opponents.
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawfords</persRef> personal
							friends, instead of befriending the Administration, operate as
							powerfully as they can without exposing or avowing their motives against
							it— Every act and thought of Crawford looks to the next Presidency. All
							his Springs of action work not upon the present but upon the future; and
							yet his path in the Department is now beset with thorns from which he
							shrinks, and which I think he will not ward off with success— In short,
							as the first Presidential term of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe’s administration has hitherto been the period of the greatest
							national tranquility enjoyed by this Nation, at any portion of its
							history, so it appears to me scarcely avoidable that his second term
							will be among the most stormy and violent. I told him this day that I
							thought the difficulties before him were thickening, and becoming hourly
							more and more formidable. In our foreign Relations, we stood upon terms
							with England, as favourable as can ever be expected, but with a state of
							things dissatisfactory for the present, and problematical for the
							future, with regard to our commercial intercourse with her American
							Colonies. With France our situation was much less pleasing and more
							unpromising— She is pressing absurd claims, and refusing satisfaction
							for the most just and equivocal claims on our part. She is screwing down
							upon us the most unequal and burdensome Navigation Laws, and leaves
							unanswered repeated and urgent proposals for a commercial Negotiation—
							Our affairs with Spain are such that the Administration has lost all the
							credit and strength which it would have derived from the Florida Treaty
							and although no immediate danger from that quarter is to be apprehended
							the Government is injured by the failure of Congress to adopt the
							measures recommended by the Executive, and it will be scarcely possible
							without a disposal of Providence, over which we have no control, and
							which we have no right to expect, to come out of that controversy
							without loss of national character. With the Netherlands, Naples, Sweden
							and Denmark, we have claims for indemnity or restitution, which there is
							no prospect of obtaining; with Portugal we have angry discussions upon
							claims against us, which we cannot admit, but for which too much cause
							has been given; and although we have done more than any other Nation for
							the South-Americans, they are discontented because we have not espoused
							their cause in arms, and with empty professions of friendship they have
							no real sympathy with us. A prospect thus dark and unpropitious abroad,
							is far more gloomy and threatening when we turn our eyes homeward— The
							Bank, the national currency, the stagnation of commerce, the depression
							of manufactures, the restless turbulence, and jealousies and
							insubordination of the State Legislatures, the Missouri Slave Question,
							the deficiencies of the revenue to be supplied; the rankling passions
							and ambitious projects of individuals, mingling with every thing,
							presented a prospect of the future, which I freely acknowledged was to
							me appalling— I asked him whether these apprehensions were visionary;
							and if not, whether he had contemplated any distinct system of measures
							to be in preparation, for the embarrassments which it was obvious to
							foresee as inevitable, at no distant day— He said that as to the
							Missouri question, he apprehended no great danger from that— He believed
							a compromise would be found and agreed to, which would be satisfactory
							to all parties— I did not enquire further, though I was much surprized
							at this remark— All the public appearances are directly the reverse, and
							either there is an underplot in operation upon this subject of which I
							had no suspicion, or the President has a very inadequate idea of the
							real state of that controversy; or he assumed an air of tranquility
							concerning it, in which there was more caution than candour; more
							reserve than sincerity. With respect to the Bank, he said no man had a
							more convincing experience of its absolute necessity than he had during
							the late War, when he had been obliged to borrow money on his own
							responsibility wherever he could obtain it; and which at one place was
							at one stage of depretiation, and another at another— And as to the
							Constitutional objections, <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef> himself had considered them as settled by twenty
							years of practice and acquiescence under the First Bank— I said that the
							existence or continuance of the Bank, appeared to me to be a matter of
							perfect indifference to the Stockholders; and indeed if I were one of
							them, I should incline to petition Congress to take back their Charter,
							and restore to the proprietors their Capital; but it was my firm belief
							that this Union could not hold together, while every State exercised an
							unlimited power of making paper money under the pretence of
							incorporating Banks; unless the General Government by such a Bank,
							substantially <pb type="ms" n="244"/>under its controul, and always
							regulating the National Currency, by preserving specie payments
							inviolate, could preserve the obligations of contracts and give security
							to property, against the frauds of paper swindling. I also believed that
							the present deadly struggle in so many of the States, with all its
							lumbering machinery of State Legislatures was nothing more or less than
							a combined effort of State Bank interests and of desperate debtors
							thursting for a paper spunge to wipe off their debts— And that the very
							process of purgation against which they so convulsively heaved was the
							only effectual remedy for the disorders of the currency— He said he was
							entirely of the same opinion. I asked him whether any plan was matured
							for meeting the deficiency in the revenue, announced in the annual
							Report on the finances, of the Secretary of the Treasury; and which
							deficiency I apprehended would turn out to be larger than he had
							estimated. He said he did not know— That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford, conformably to a practice which had been observed from the
							time when <persRef ref="hamilton-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hamilton</persRef> was Secretary of the Treasury, had
							made the annual Report without shewing it to him; and he did not know
							what M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s views for supplying the
							deficiency were. I was much surprized to here that Reports so important
							to the whole system of Administration as the annual exposition of the
							State of the finances should be made to Congress without being first
							even shewn to the President— I thought it altogether inconsistent with
							the Spirit of the Constitution, and that the practice ought immediately
							to be changed. Now this Report of Crawford, after indicating the
							supposed deficiency, skulks from a specific recommendation of a remedy;
							for it mentions three or four without marking a preference for either—
							The President said we had ample resources for covering the deficiency;
							to which I readily assented. But the necessity was, and I apprehended
							the difficulty would be to fix upon that particular resource upon which
							we are to rely— For the principle of opposition tactics is, when they
							agree with administration as to the end, to differ from them as to the
							means; and as there is a choice of means it behooves the Administration
							to select that which they may think the best, and be prepared to support
							it by their friends in Congress, where it will be difficult enough to
							get any one through; and where that which they prefer will for that very
							reason be encountered by all the bickerings of systematic opposition. I
							added that I thought the best and easiest mode of providing for the
							deficiency of the current year, was to suspend the purchases of the
							sinking fund. He said that was his own opinion; but <persRef
								ref="smith-samuel2">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Smith</persRef> of Maryland, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and
							Means had been to him this morning, and told him he had made yesterday a
							motion to that effect in the House, which had been rejected; because the
							members entertained the opinion, that the deficiency might be covered by
							retrenchment of expenses; and thought the retrenchment would be lost, if
							the means of covering the deficiency should be granted from the sinking
							fund— I said I thought the project of retrenchment, to the amount of the
							deficiency would prove fallacious, or if carried into effect, would be
							more injurious to the public than the saving of the money could do them
							good. But while these plans were afloat it became still more essential
							to the administration to have some plan of its own to meet the exigency
							of the case; for if the drain upon the revenue should remain unprovided
							for, until it should come to press upon the detail of current business,
							it would injure the character of the Administration, and the credit of
							the Country, more than a deficiency of ten times the amount of that now
							to be provided for could do— The President desired me to look into the
							Law, requiring these Reports from the Secretary of the Treasury to
							Congress, which he said he would also do; and if it should warrant the
							measure, he would have a consultation with the members of the
							Administration, to advise upon what it may be proper to do. He said it
							had always struck him that this practice of reporting by the Secretary
							of the Treasury, directly to Congress, without communication with the
							President was wrong, and the occasion upon which he was first informed
							of it was itself an instance of its bad effects— It was a Report made by
								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> just at the commencement of the late War with
							England— A report, the tendency of which was exceedingly unfavourable to
							the measures then contemplated by M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Madison. He himself had been so much surprized, upon first reading it
							that he immediately enquired of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison
							how it had been permitted to appear; he answered that it had been
							equally unexpected and displeasing to him; but that he had not seen it
							before it was presented to the house, and that from the practice having
							originated with Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Hamilton, it was
							supposed that there were considerations of delicacy, for its being
							withheld from the President until after having been presented to
							Congress— I said I could see no reason for such delicacy; but numerous
							motives for every such paper’s being submitted to the President before
							it goes to Congress— He also told me that <persRef ref="holmes-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes</persRef>, a member of
							the Committee of Foreign Relations, had been to him and told him, that
								<persRef ref="lowndes-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowndes</persRef> the Chairman had <pb type="ms" n="245"/>drafted
							and presented to the Committee a Report, disapproving the measure
							recommended by the President, of giving him a discretionary authority to
							take possession of Florida, and proposing a postponement of any measures
							for the present. It was objected to this Report that if presented to the
							House, by shewing a disagreement with the Executive it would weaken his
							hands in any Negotiation with the <persRef ref="vives-don">Minister who
								may come from Spain</persRef>, and upon this Consideration it was
							determined not to report for the present at-all— I told the President I
							thought it quite immaterial, whether they reported against the measure
							recommended in the Message, or did not report at all— The game was up in
							either case— We should neither have the Treaty ratified, nor Florida for
							the present— The Treaty was gone forever; but the ground upon which we
							stand is safe— Some convulsion may take place in Spain, upon which we
							may be obliged to occupy Florida, or some chance may again occur upon
							which we may receive it by Treaty— The advantages of the abortive Treaty
							and more may be ultimately secured to the Country, but all the benefit
							which was hoped from it, for the Administration is lost— From the
							President’s I returned for a short time to my Office— Spent the Evening
							with <persRef

								<persRef ref="trimble-david">Trimble</persRef>, both drew me into
							Conversation upon the Florida Treaty; Trimble to shew his profound
							sagacity, and Clay, to entrap me if he could into some unguarded speech,
							which he might hereafter turn against me, in debate at the House— We
							came home about eleven O’Clock.</p>

								81<hi rend="superscript">st. </hi>Section of the Collection Law of
							2. March 1799. but as the whole of that Section could not be applied, I
							proposed that a Section containing its principal provisions should be
							drawn &amp; modified so as to be introduced into this bill itself; and
							Crawford to prepare a draft of such a Section in concert with me. There
							is not much interest taken in this subject. I had prepared a draft of a
							Letter to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">A. Gallatin</persRef> giving
							the President’s consent to his return to the United States next Summer,
							according to a request in the last despatch received from him— But the
							President thought the request itself, was so equivocal an indication <pb
								type="ms" n="247"/>of Gallatin’s real wish, that he supposed its
							object was to obtain from the President a request that he would remain
							another year in France— On examination of the Letter it was agreed that
							it did not expressly warrant this conclusion; yet the Letter does open
							an avenue to such a request— I told the President that if he thought it
							would bear this exposition, there were ample reasons of a public nature
							for requesting M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin to stay a year
							longer. I observed that our commercial relations with France, were in a
							very unpleasant and unpromising condition— That Congress were even now
							called upon to take defensive measures against the French tariff of
							duties; which was throwing the carriage of all our trade with France
							into French vessels. That France declined a general commercial
							Negotiation, while she earnestly pressed for a Convention upon some
							special points; such as Consular privileges and deserting Seamen— That
							no person in the United States could supply the place of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, as a suitable negotiator upon
							commercial Articles— To all this the assent was general, and the
							President directed me to write to him, and request him to stay another
							year— But Crawford declared a strong aversion to any Act of Congress
							affecting our commercial relations with France at present. He had not
							seen M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s late despatches urging

							Russia; and also to write to <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi

							to come home upon a leave of absence, with direction to leave <persRef
								ref="brent-thomas">T. L. L. Brent</persRef> there as Chargé

							with the Spanish Ministers; and seemed inclined to pass some positive
							censure upon it; concluding however at last that it would be sufficient
							to give him leave to come home, and then take care not to let him go
							there again— After I returned to the Office, the Russian Minister
								<persRef ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poletica</persRef> called there, with a packet of despatches for the

							shake this Union to its foundations— Poletica seems already to have
							taken his side; for he said he considered it a question whether this
							Country should hereafter be a Colony or an independent Power— I entered
							not however into conversation with him upon the subject— Evening at

						<p><date>16. VII:</date> There was no preaching at the Capitol; and I passed
							the morning not profitably at home. I had some private business to which
							it was necessary that I should attend, and I wrote according to the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> directions to
								<persRef ref="middleton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Middleton</persRef>. In my walk for exercise before dinner, I paid
							several visits and called upon <persRef ref="lowndes-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowndes</persRef>, with whom I had a
							long conversation upon public affairs— I told him the President wished
							that the Instructions to the late <persRef ref="perry-oliver">Commodore
								Perry</persRef> should be communicated to him; but thought there
							might be some inconvenience in making them public, which they must be,
							if given to Congress, or even to the Committee— Lowndes said that in
							that case it would perhaps be better that he should not see them;
							because it would be difficult to use any information contained in them
							in debate, without giving rise to suspicions and to allusions, which
							would rather counteract than promote the views of the Administration— We
							had also much conversation upon the Missouri or Slave-question— Lowndes,
							who is from South-Carolina, and a large Slave-holder is of course on the
							Slavery side of the question, which there is now every appearance will
							be carried by the superior ability of the Slavery party—for this much is
							certain that if Institutions are to be judged of by their results; in
							the composition of the councils of this Union, the Slave-holders are
							much more ably represented than the simple freeman— With the exception
							of <persRef ref="king-rufus">Rufus King</persRef> there is not in either
							house of Congress a member from the free States, able to cope in powers
							of the mind, with <persRef ref="pinkney-william">William
								Pinkney</persRef> or <persRef ref="barbour-james">James
								Barbour</persRef>— In the House of Representatives the freemen have
							none to contend on equal terms either with <persRef ref="randolph-john"
								>John Randolph</persRef> or <persRef ref="clay-henry"
							>Clay</persRef>— Another misfortune to the free party is that some of
							their ablest men are either on this question with their adversaries, or
							lukewarm in the cause— The Slave men have indeed a deeper immediate
							stake in the issue than the partizans of freedom; their passions and
							interests are more profoundly agitated, and they have stronger impulses
							to active energy than their antagonists, whose only individual interest
								<pb type="ms" n="248"/>in this cause arises from its bearing on the
							balance of political power between North and South. Lowndes is a member
							of great weight and influence in the house, which he has acquired, and
							maintains as much by the urbanity of his manners as by his talents. He
							is a man of easy fortune, and entire independence, and the winter before
							last declined the offer of a mission either to Russia, or to
							Constantinople— Yet, with various acquirements, and a character of
							perfect integrity, there is a want of energy and of activity in his
							mind. He has too much love of ease, and aversion to labour— As to the
							Committee of Foreign Relations, Clay the Speaker who appoints all the
							Committees, selected that one, with a view to prevent any thing’s being
							done congenial to the views of the Administration.</p>

						<p><date>18. VII:</date> The effect of displacement is unpropitious to all
							my occupations. I could do nothing this day, but copy some of my own
							private papers. <persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Richard M. Johnson</persRef> a Senator from Kentucky
							called at my Office, and told me that the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> had referred him to me, upon certain proposals
							made by <persRef ref="duane-william2">Billy Duane</persRef>, who was a
							very foolish, and unaccountable fellow; who might have made twenty
							fortunes, but having always been the worst enemy to himself that lived,
							was now poor, and embarrassed, and involved in a lawsuit with the
							Government; and had written him two Letters, containing projects in
							which he should be glad to assist him— His first project was that
							understanding this government were about to furnish ten thousand Stands
							of arms to the South-Americans of Venezuela, Duane would be glad to have
							the agency of selling them, for which an allowance of five or six per
							Cent should be made to him by way of Commission— The other was that he
							Duane should be sent as Agent for the Government to Venezuela and New
							Granada— I told Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson that <hi
								rend="strikethrough">from</hi> the virulence, with which Duane in
							his Aurora, was incessantly pouring upon me the most violent and
							groundless abuse upon me, I thought it necessary as preliminary to
							answering his proposals to say that I retained no resentment against him
							whatever; and should be ready and willing to render him any service in
							my power— What the President’s feelings were, I could not say; but I
							knew nothing of any intention on his part to furnish arms to the
							South-Americans; or to send for the present an agent to Venezuela, or
							New-Granada. The Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> said he would send me
							Duane’s two Letters to him. He said he thought he had been in some
							respects ill used by the Government— He was now sued for a balance of
							seven thousand by dollars, due by him as a Quarter master in the army—
							He had found a receipt from his successor, for 3000 dollars of the
							money, and if he knew any thing about the way of keeping accounts he
							would be able to shew that he had also paid all the remainder of the
							balance— I called at the President’s and reported to him what Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson had said— The President said,
							that Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> Johnson might have been more
							worthily occupied than in becoming the medium of such proposals— That
							the project of furnishing ten thousand stands of arms to Venezuela, for
							the sake of making a profitable job to Duane, had something in it that
							was disgusting, and that it was to be secretly done made it worse. If we
							were to furnish arms to the South-Americans, it should be done openly in
							the face of day— As to sending Duane as an agent to S. America, he had
							no confidence in him; and believed him to be as unprincipled a fellow as
							lived. There was not and had not been for years a day passed, but his
							newspaper had been filled with abuse and Slander upon the
							administration; and if such a man should be sent off as a public agent,
							it would give a general disgust to the people of this Country, who would
							universally consider it as a buying off of his opposition.— He was not
							worth buying. His abuse was a recommendation— His own relations with
							Duane had been few— After his (M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s)
							return from France, he had published the account of his Mission, and
							employed Duane to print it— He had taken a sufficient number of copies
							of it to pay for the publication—paid 600 dollars for those copies, and
							left the rest with Duane, to account for the disposal of them— And he
							took the Aurora, to be reckoned in part payment. Duane, supplied him
							with his paper, and at the end of six years, sent him a bill for one
							hundred Dollars for newspapers. This Bill he had paid, rather than have
							a controversy with him; but he had been in <pb type="ms" n="249"
							/>employment under almost every Department of the Government, and always
							gave dissatisfaction— His accounts as quartermaster had remained for
							years unsettled, and if there had been anything wrong in the War
							Department with him, it had been in the forbearance to sue him for the
							balance due, too long— This Duane is an Irish adventurer—bred for a
							Roman Catholic Priest; but who after some years of turbulence in his own
							Country, and then in India, finally settled here, and has been nearly 25
							years editor of the Aurora the most slanderous newspapers in the United
							States— But as his industry is indefatigable, and as he writes with
							facility, his editorial Articles are often interesting, and he has often
							had much influence, especially in the State of Pennsylvania. He is now
							poor, and growing old, and his present proposal is substantially to sell
							his Silence— The President offers nothing for it, but his contempt—
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> had this Evening a tea-party Ball at

							connection with his parish at Charlestown next May; and to devote his

							which was that of compleating a History of the United States begun by
								<persRef ref="trumbull-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Trumbull</persRef> of Connecticut; and of which one Volume has been
							published. He said it was a History written with particular reference to
							the Special Providences which have befallen this Country. He requested
							to have access as far as might be proper to the archives in the
							Department of State, which I promised him he should have. In speaking of
							Indian Affairs he told me that he had particularly noted the discussion
							of the rights of Indians to territorial possessions, in my Oration
							delivered at Plymouth, the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of December
							1802. I told him the same question had been more fully debated on a more
							important occasion—namely at the Negotiation of Ghent; and referred him
							to the Notes in which it was controverted, which are published in
								<persRef ref="waite-thomas">Waits</persRef> collection of State
							Papers— D<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Morse appears to be in a very
							indifferent state of health. He says his intention is to reside in

							New-York, and proposed to leave the City next Tuesday. He came to say
							that the Senators to whom he had shewn my Letter all disclaimed any
							pretension to claim a first visit from me; but that they had supposed it
							was a claim that I had set up of receiving it from them— The fact is
							that those Senators who have set up the pretension are ashamed of

							it, that <persRef ref="gaillard-john">Gaillard</persRef> and <persRef

								<persRef ref="erving-george">G. W. Irving</persRef> in 1809.
							relating to a claim of <persRef ref="hackley-richard">R. S.
								Hackley</persRef> which Bloomfield has purchased. It is before
							Congress, and I have made a report upon it to a committee. But
							Bloomfield wants me to settle and allow it without the intervention of
							Congress, and has made numerous applications to <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>Congress</hi> me, for that purpose— He brought me these Letters
							this morning to see if they would not change my opinion— But they could
							give me no authority to act, and left the case just where it was before.
								<persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R.
								M. Johnson</persRef> called upon me to enquire what the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> had determined upon <persRef
								ref="duane-william2">W. Duane’s</persRef> Letters— This man has been
							many years Editor of the Aurora, a daily newspaper printed at
							Philadelphia; in which language has been exhausted in abuse and
							invective upon every administration of the Government of the United
							States, excepting that of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson</persRef>. During the last
							two years scarcely a day has past without columns upon columns assailing
							the character of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, and all his
							Secretaries— And now this personage comes with one proposition to be
							sent with a Salary, outfit and travelling expences as a Charge des
							Affaires to New-Grenada and Mexico, and with another that the President
							should trick Congress to a sale of ten thousand or thirty thousand stand
							of arms to the Patriots of New-Grenada; and give him Duane the job to
							make the contract, with a Commission of five or six per Cent on the
							sale—promising so to transact the business that neither the Government
							nor he shall appear in the business at-all— These projects are mingled
							up with complaints of ill usage from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe—with threats of vengeance if he is not gratified; and with
							promises that no body shall ever have reason to repent it if he is—
								Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson is the medium through whom
							he conducts this negotiation. I told him that the President had the
							Letters— That I did not think he would clandestinely sell arms to the
							South Americans by an Act of Congress to be obtained by a stratagem, and
							without letting them know what they were doing. That it was too soon to
							send a Charge d’Affaires to Mexico, or even to New-Grenada, and if it
							were not, the President might have scruples about appointing M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Duane; since the public would be very apt
							to consider it, as a bargain to buy off his newspaper hostility— Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson said that he had expected this
							would be the answer; and had already written to Duane that he thought
							the plan for the sale of arms would not succeed— He himself thought it
							was not consistent with a fair neutrality— I walked with Johnson to the
							Senate chamber, and heard <persRef ref="pinkney-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pinkney</persRef> close his Missouri
							Speech— There was a great crowd of auditors— Many Ladies; among whom
							several seated on the floor of the Senate— His eloquence was said to be
							less overpowering than it had been last <pb type="ms" n="252"/>Friday.
							His language is good— His fluency without interruption or hesitation—
							His manner impressive but his argument weak, from the inherent weakness
							of his cause— After he closed <persRef ref="otis-harrison">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis</persRef> declared his
							determination to speak to-morrow on the subject. The Senators went into
							Executive conclave and all Strangers withdrew. I went into the Hall of
							the House of Representatives and heard debates there upon a specific
							appropriation Bill, and upon a motion to postpone a Bill authorizing the
							People of the Missouri Territory to form a State Constitution. There was
							some sharp debating, and the question was decided by yeas and nays,
							against postponement 88 to 87. It was past three O’Clock when I got to
							my Office, and I was of course but a short time there— Evening at
							home.</p>

							said—then Sagittarius admits the Treaty to be a good one— Oh yes! said

							that there are between three and four thousand stand of arms which it

							The services of which he boasted were nothing, but twenty years of
							perpetual abuse upon the best men in the Country—by which he had run
							himself so entirely out of credit that to be reviled by him, was a

							confidence would give general disgust; and he was besides so egregiously
							the dupe of his own prejudices and passions, that he could not safely be
							trusted— If Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson however was

								Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson would not feel himself
							rather delicately and awkwardly situated to give advice on that point
							while he was charged with this Negotiation in behalf of Duane— He said

									>r</hi> Newton</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of Commerce
							called this Morning at my house, and asked for some explanations of the
							remarks sent to him, with his draft of a Bill, prohibiting the
							commercial <pb type="ms" n="255"/>intercourse with the British Colonies
							in America— He said he thought the Committee would adopt the alterations
							recommended. At the Office I found two Letters from <persRef
								ref="clarke-john2">John Clark</persRef>, Governor of Georgia; one
							relating to their Indian Affairs, and the other containing a complaint
							against <persRef ref="mitchell-david">Mitchell</persRef> the Agent of
							the United States with the Creek Indians; of having been concerned in
							smuggling Slaves into Georgia. Governor Clark mentions a Resolution
							passed on the 31<hi rend="superscript">st. </hi>of last Month in the
							House of Representatives in Congress, calling for information concerning
							this unlawful introduction of Slaves; and he requests that the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> would communicate to Congress
							the documents enclosed with his Letter criminating Mitchell. I took this
							letter to the President who said he would read it with the papers; but
							who appeared disinclined to communicate them to Congress— He said there
							was a personal enmity between Governor Clark and Mitchell; and that if
							the charges against Mitchell appeared to be substantiated by testimony,
							it would be proper to make them known to him, and to give him an
							opportunity to defend himself against them— I suggested that there might
							be some inconvenience, if after the express request of Governor Clark
							that these papers might be communicated, they should be withheld; But I
							perceive this is an affair that will work hard— There was a party this
							Evening at <persRef ref="pleasonton-stephan">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pleasonton’s</persRef>, which our sons <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-john2"

							attended—</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> The Winter’s dissipations absorb great part of my time—
							I rise seldom before seven O’Clock, and then pass two or three hours in

									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> has a tea-party,
							which varies in numbers from forty to a hundred persons, and once a
							fortnight we have a company of twenty men to dinner— Once or twice a
							week I dine or pass the Evening abroad after which I am disqualified for
							reading or writing that Night, and for writing the next Morning. I have
							therefore only from two to three Evenings in the week for writing, and
							two thirds of the time in them I waste, and do nothing. Thus the arrears
							creep on, day upon day, and my duties are not discharged. My usual hour
							for retiring to bed is about eleven— May the account at the close of the
							next Month be more satisfactory.</p>
