						<p><date>1. II. Wednesday.</date> There was a meeting of the members of the
							Administration at the President’s; and a discussion of the proposals
							made by the French Government to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, concerning the
							Tonnage question, and that upon the eighth Article of the Louisiana
							Cession Treaty— The proposals are that as upon a system of reciprocity,
							the carriage of all the commerce between the two Countries would be in
							our ships because the French Shippers cannot stand an equal competition
							with ours, we should consent to an amount of discriminating duties
							against us, sufficient to restore the balance, and give the french
							shipping an equal share of the Carriage. The opinion was unanimous that
							we could not accept this proposal— The case of the returnpretended Port
							of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Joseph was considered— Immediately
							after the commencement of the new Tonnage duty upon French Vessels a
							ship called the Apollon came and entered the River S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s, keeping on the Spanish side of
							the Waters. The Captain, took his papers to S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Augustine; and there made a formal entry of the Ship— The
								<persRef ref="coppinger-jose">Governor of Florida</persRef> then, in
							collusion with this man, and with a person named <persRef
								ref="clarke-unknown3">Clarke</persRef>, a Spanish Consular agent at
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s, constituted a pretended Port
							of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Joseph, immediately opposite to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s, on the Florida side of the river,
							at a place where there is no settlement— Clarke was made Captain and
							Commander of the Port of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Joseph, and the
							plan was to furnish a Port both for French and British Vessels to come
							and receive their Cargoes, from S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s
							in evasion and defiance of our laws— Clarke wrote <persRef
								ref="forbes-james">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> James
								Forbes</persRef>, two Letters, disclosing the whole plan, and
							inviting him to take a share in it— Forbes enclosed the Letters
							confidentially to me— The purpose of defeating altogether the operation
							of our Navigation and French tonnage Laws, and the hope of keeping open
							the Tariff quarrel with France by it, is distinctly avowed in Clarke’s
							Letters— More than two years since when the Navigation act, partially
							interdicting the trade With the British West-India Islands in British
							vessels was made, there had been an attempt by a British vessel to enter
							the river S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s and remaining on the
							Spanish side, to trade with our Port in that way— The <persRef
								ref="clark-archibald">Collector</persRef> was then instructed by the
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> to permit no such vessel to go there, and in
							cases where the intention to evade or <pb type="ms" n="441"/>defeat the
							Law was manifest, to warn them off, and if they disregarded the warning,
							to seize the vessel— At that time the purpose was given up— When the
							Apollon came last Summer, the Collector of S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Mary’s wrote to the Secretary of the Treasury requesting
							new Instructions, and enquiring whether those given two years before
							were to be considered as applying to this case. When the Collector’s
							Letter was received here at the Treasury, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crawford was absent in Georgia. The President was in Virginia. The
								<persRef ref="anderson-joseph">Comptroller Anderson</persRef> asked
							my opinion, and I gave it that the Instructions on the former occasion
							were applicable to this case— The Apollon was accordingly seized after
							being allowed an opportunity to go away; but her Captain chose to
							protest and give up his vessel— <persRef ref="roth-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Roth</persRef> the French Chargé
							d’Affaires took up the affair very seriously and wrote me a high-toned
							note on the subject. At the Meeting this day it was determined that the
								<persRef ref="habersham-richard">District Attorney U.S. in
								Georgia</persRef>, should be directed by the Secretary of the
							Treasury to libel the Apollon for a violation of the Revenue Laws of the
							United States, and in case the decision of the cause should be against
							the Government, which was thought probable, he was to bring it by appeal
							to the Supreme Court; to be decided there. My opinion was that as a case
							of flagrant conspiracy against the Law of the United States, the Court
							would probably sustain the seizure, and decide in favour of the
							Government; but even if the decision should be adverse it cannot take
							place within fourteen Months from this time, and in the interval, the
							fraudulent and spurious Port of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Joseph,
							will not be accessible to a multitude of vessels, for a resort to defeat
							both our French tonnage Law, and our Navigation Acts— I was directed to
							send copies of Clarke the Spanish Agents Letters to Forbes, to the
							District Attorney, with directions to him to produce them at the proper
							time on the trial and in the mean time to keep them secret— After I
							returned from the President’s I received despatches from A. Gallatin,
							from which it appears that he has come to a stand in negotiating with
							the French Government and that they have determined to send <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef> back here and to transfer the negotiation to this
							place.</p>

						<p><date>3. IV:30.</date><persRef ref="hogan-michael">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Michael Hogan</persRef> was at the
							Office— He has been some time commercial agent at the Havanna: he told
							me that the profits of his place there amounted to about 2500 dollars a
							year— But that as they have the yellow fever there the whole year round,
							he was afraid to take his <persRef ref="hogan-unknown3">wife</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="hogan-unknown4">daughters</persRef> to reside there.
							He wishes therefore to obtain a similar appointment elsewhere; at some
							place with better prospects of life and health for a family, though less
							lucrative— He particularly desires a commercial agency, at some port on
							the South-Sea— In Chili or Peru— This person is an Irishman, who came
							more than twenty years since to settle in this Country, with a fortune
							of near 100000 dollars, which by misplaced confidence in others he has
							entirely lost.— He has been obliged to solicit these small offices as
							means of subsistence for his family— <persRef ref="lee-william">W.
								Lee</persRef> was also at the Office; I was at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef>, and referred to him the
							proposals of <persRef ref="lynch-jasper">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lynch</persRef> of New-York— Lynch is partner of a commercial house,
							owners of a Steamship called the Robert Fulton, which they built at a
							very heavy expence, and which is now employed as a packet between
							New-York, Charleston South-Carolina, the Havanna and New-Orleans— She
							has performed these passages once or twice, but they find the
							speculation unprofitable— They <pb type="ms" n="442"/>wish therefore to
							be disburthened of their ship, and have bethought themselves of applying
							to the Government to take it off their hands— They had been informed
							that <persRef ref="bainbridge-william">Commodore Bainbridge</persRef>
							who went out last Spring to the Mediterranean with the Columbus line of
							Battle Ship had been informally charged with instructions to endeavour
							to ascertain whether a commercial Treaty could be negotiated with the
							Porte— <persRef ref="bradish-luther">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Luther Bradish</persRef> had also some authority of the same kind,
							and went out with Bainbridge— Lynch’s project is that this Government
							should buy the Steam-ship, and make a present of it to the <persRef
								ref="mahmudii">Grand-Seignor</persRef>, for an advantageous Treaty
							of Commerce— He thinks the Turks would be so enraptured with the novelty
							and ingenuity of the invention, that it would buy us a Treaty upon our
							own terms— And as we are not quite so sanguine, Lynch says if the
							Government will not buy their ship, they propose to send her to
							Constantinople on their own account; and sell her for as many licences
							for commercial vessels to pass the Dardanelles and trade in the Black
							Sea, as they can obtain— But as this might interfere with the views of
							the Government negotiation, they make the first offer to the Government
							itself— The President directed a meeting of the members of the
							administration to consider the subject to-morrow— I wrote a despatch to

							for undertaking to accomplish it is not yet mature. The Commercial

							in other quarters, and great opposition to any movement of the

							engaged the whole Session of Congress in endeavouring to obtain the
							establishment of a Navy agency or agency for Seamen at Hamburg without
							success— It was with the utmost difficulty that I withstood the pressure
							of application to recommend it officially from the Department— He is now

							became a teacher of Languages at the Transylvania University at

							compensation for it, and wrote me that he expected something of a higher
							order of service than that— I had nothing of a higher order to give him,
							and he has been hanging on, renewing from time to time his applications,

							present habitation being about two miles and a half, I find it scarcely

								wife</persRef> is a Millener. His congregation seldom amounts to
							fifty persons. While there, I received a Note, addressed to the Heads of
							Departments requesting their attendance at the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> at one O’Clock— I met at
							Church my old Classmate <persRef ref="cushman-joshua">Cushman</persRef>,
							now a Representative in Congress from the State of Maine, and after the
							service walked with him to his lodgings at <persRef ref="fletcher-noah"
								>Fletcher’s</persRef>— There I found <persRef
								ref="vanrensselaer-solomon">General Solomon Van
							Rensselaer</persRef>, one of the Members from the State of New York, and
								<persRef ref="cook-daniel">Daniel Pope Cook</persRef> of Illinois— I
							then called upon <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> the Secretary at War, and rode with
							him to the President’s— As we were riding Calhoun spoke to me with great
							concern at the re-appearance of the question upon the admission of
							Missouri as a State into the Union. After all the difficulty with which
							it was compromised at the last Session of Congress, the Convention which
							made their Constitution has raised a new obstacle, by an Article,
							declaring it to be the duty of the Legislature to pass <pb type="ms"
								n="446"/>Laws prohibiting free Negroes and persons of colour from
							coming into the State; which is directly repugnant to the Article in the
							Constitution of the United States which provides that the Citizens of
							each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of
							Citizens in the several States. Calhoun said, that he did not know how
							this difficulty could be surmounted unless by considering the Article in
							the Missouri Constitution as null and void upon the very principle of
							its repugnancy. And he did not know whether even that could be
							sufficient— The meeting at the President’s was for the final reading of
							the draft of his Message to Congress. The composition of these Messages
							is upon a uniform plan. They begin with general remarks upon the
							condition of the Country noticing recent occurrences of material
							importance; passing encomiums upon our form of government, paying due
							homage to the Sovereign power of the people, and turning to account
							every topic which can afford a paragraph of public gratulation— Then
							pass in review the foreign Affairs—the Circumstances of our relations
							with the principal powers of Europe— Then looking inwards, adverting to
							the state of the finances—the revenues, public expenditures, debts and
							land-sales— The progress of fortifications, and naval armaments, with a
							few words about the Indians and a few about the Slave-trade— This is the
							analysis of a Session-opening message— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe’s messages have always had a long paragraph upon the civil War
							between Spain and her Colonies, and there is one in the present message—
							There was some discussion about it— I have always thought these
							paragraphs exotics to the proper region of the message; which might just
							as well descant upon the Wars of the English in India, or more suitably
							upon the Treaties and Congresses of the European Allies— The only
							difference is that <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef> having attempted to raise an opposition
							party upon a sympathetic feeling in the people of this Country
							favourable to the South-Americans, and having insinuated that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s Administration was partial
							against the South-Americans, the President has thought it necessary to
							counteract this party manoeuvering by professions of favour to them
							repeated at every Session of Congress— This course of policy has perhaps
							been necessary; it has been hitherto successful— There were some
							passages in the draft this day, much more favourable to the Colonists
							than the facts would warrant; objections were made to them by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Calhoun, and the President altered
							several of them— I raised none of these objections, repeating what I had
							said at the drafting of a former message, that whatever the President
							would strike out or soften upon that subject would be so much of
							improvement to the Message— My objection to it is that our system being
							professedly neutrality, any avowal of partiality for the South-Americans
							was inconsistent with it, and liable to raise doubts of our sincerity. I
							believe that these paragraphs of the Messages have been the principal
							real cause of the delay of Spain to ratify the Florida Treaty— The
							paragraph respecting the finances for this message has been of some
							delicacy— A loan of three Millions of dollars, authorized at the last
							Session of Congress has not been sufficient to cover the deficiency of
							revenue in the year— The depression of the agricultural manufacturing
							and commercial interests would scarcely admit of the proposal of new
							taxes if there were not other reasons to prevent it. <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> has motives of his own for steering clear of any
							proposal for taxation, and his resource is more borrowing.— The
							paragraph in the message concerning the finances was drawn by him— It
							presents only the fair side of the subject, dwelling entirely upon what
							has been done since the peace, and referring for the present state of
							the Treasury to the annual Report of the Secretary— The paragraphs
							respecting foreign Affairs, though first in order in the exposition of
							the Message, have been delayed, in the expectation of intelligence from
							Europe— For this part of the Message, the President usually refers to
							me— The subjects to be noticed were the state of our intercourse with
							the British West-Indies, that of the commercial negotiation with France;
							the Slave question referred <pb type="ms" n="447"/>to the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef>, and the present
							aspects of the Florida Treaty, in Spain— All these affairs excepting the
							first are in transitu— I have from time to time suggested what I thought
							should be said of them, and drew up the passages respecting the
							relations with France and with Russia, which the President adopted with
							some alterations. The view of Affairs depending on the War and Navy
							Departments consisted of Statements of the progress made in erecting
							fortifications, and in building a Navy— The last sentence mentioned the
							capture of several vessels concerned in the Slave-trade— The President
							said he had been thinking of adding another sentence of a general
							nature, by way of conclusion which I told him I wished he would; being
							quite unwilling to see him close with “disgraceful traffic.” These were
							the last words of the Message— He laughed heartily at the remark— The
							meeting broke up about four O’Clock, and Calhoun dropped me at my own
							door.</p>

								>John Binns</persRef>, Editor of the Democratic Press at

							been in opposition to a majority of the delegation. They have therefore
							addressed a Letter to me recommending the appointment of another paper
							for printing the Laws. Roberts who is a friend to Binns came to urge me
							not to make the change. I told him that I had resolved already not to
							change—for although saw no reason for approving the course lately
							pursued by Binns with regard to the State politics, yet I did not feel
							myself warranted to interfere with them, by selecting another printer
							for the laws on that account. There was however a principle of great
							influence in the choice of printers of the Laws— Namely a deference to

							for the appointment of another printer at Philadelphia the change will

									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Richard M. Johnson</persRef>,
							Senator from Kentucky, <persRef ref="newton-thomas">T. Newton</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="tucker-george">George Tucker</persRef>,
							Representatives from Virginia, <persRef ref="cook-daniel">D. P.
								Cook</persRef> from Illinois, <persRef ref="butler-josiah">Josiah
								Butler</persRef> and <persRef ref="clagett-clifton">Clifton
								Claggett</persRef> from New-Hampshire, with some others successively
							came— This rapid and continual change of persons, and of subjects
							calling for attention has such an effect upon the memory that the
							proverbial defect of that quality may be accounted for, without
							supposing it intentional or pretended. Every man comes with a story
							demand or solicitation of his own; almost every one comes to ask
							favours. No sooner has one left the Office than another enters— I have
							often attempted to keep a minute of the names of the persons who come
							from day to day but without success. I have not time to write the name
							of one who retires, before another comes in. Eight or ten thus succeed
							one another without leaving a moment’s interval— When they are gone;
							often while some of them are here, comes in a Mail of Letters,
							despatches and newspapers. Pressing business of the office<hi
								rend="strikethrough">s</hi> suspended while the visitors are with
							me, admits of no further delay— The Sun goes down, upon business
							uncompleted. The hour of necessary retirement comes, and if I attempt
							the next Morning to minute the names of visitors of the preceding day,
							the chance is that half of them escape recollection. Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson’s object this day was to obtain
							the appointment of a Printer of the Laws at Louisville in Kentucky; for
							which purpose one of those who have heretofore performed the service
							must be displaced. There was one at Lexington, one at Frankfort and one
							at Russelville— The two former, appointed, at the recommendation of
								Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson— He now said that
							Louisville was one of the most important points in the State, and when I
							asked him which of the three former printers must be set aside in its
							favour, he said that of Russelville; the place and the paper being
							equally insignificant— He added that as to the circulation, the Argus
							had more than all the rest of the Kentucky newspapers together— Newton,
							who is chairman of the Committee of Commerce, came to ask for
							information concerning our commercial relations with France, Spain and
							Great-Britain— I gave him a summary of them, according to the latest
							despatches received from our Ministers in those Countries, and promised
							to send him the material despatches themselves. Tucker and Cook had no
							special business— Their visits were merely of courtesy. Butler and
							Claggett came for two objects—one to have a printer of the Laws in
							New-Hampshire changed; the other to obtain the appointment of <persRef
								ref="clagett-william">Claggett’s son</persRef> as District Attorney
							in New-Hampshire— The printer of the New-Hampshire Patriot has offended
							these gentlemen, by taking part against their re-election; but the
							reason they assign is that the geographical distribution of the Printers
							in the State is not so exact as it might be— The Offices of the District
							Attornies, as well as of almost all the revenue Officers, by a late law
							is limited to four years. The present District Attorney in New-Hampshire
							named <persRef ref="humphreys-daniel">Humphreys</persRef>, is near
							fourscore. Claggett has been labouring nearly a year to get his Son
							appointed at the expiration of the present Commission of Humphreys in
							his place. He therefore obtained and sent here last Summer several
							written recommendations of his Son, and now M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Butler came with him to add his recommendation— The Law
							limiting the Commissions of all these Officers, was passed ostensibly to
							compel the periodical settlement of Accounts, of all persons entrusted
							with public monies. Its real object was to place the re-appointment of
							all such Officers, during the next four years <pb type="ms" n="450"/>at
							the discretion of the <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Secretary
								of the Treasury</persRef>, whom it will serve as an electioneering
							engine— The Russian Minister, <persRef ref="poletica-pierre"
								>Poletica</persRef> paid us this Evening a visit.</p>

							his conduct in the old controversy about the navigation of the

					<div type="docbody">
						<p><date>27. IV:</date> One of the obligations to which I must submit, and
							which during the early part of every Session of Congress, absorbs more
							time than I am willing to bestow upon it, is that of returning the
							visits of all the members of both houses who chuse to call upon me— A
							pretension was raised by some of the Members of the Senate that the
							Heads of Departments should at every Session pay a first visit to every
							Senator— With this I did not comply; whence it has happened that eight
							or ten Senators have declined accepting any invitation to my house. At
							the two last Sessions it was made a subject of caballing and intrigue
							against me, till in self-defence I was obliged to write a Letter to the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, and another to the
								<persRef ref="tompkins-daniel">Vice-President</persRef>, stating my
							principles, and my reasons for them. Since then, the clamour has in some
							degree subsided—it is known and understood that I pay no first visits of
							form to any member of either house of Congress, and that I expect none
							from them. <pb type="ms" n="454"/>Most of the Senators have accommodated
							themselves to this arrangement. A few of them call, at my house or at
							the Office, soon after their arrival— Others without visiting accept
							invitations to my house. Many Members of the House of Representatives
							visit me, and all such visits must be returned— I visited this morning
								<persRef ref="fuller-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fuller</persRef>, who introduced me to <persRef
								ref="darlington-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> William
								Darlington</persRef>, <persRef ref="clark-robert">Robert
								Clark</persRef>, <persRef ref="hibshman-jacob">Jacob
								Hibshman</persRef>, <persRef ref="hostetter-jacob">Jacob
								Hostetter</persRef>, and perhaps two or three others, members from
							Pennsylvania, with whom he lodges— I called also at <persRef
								ref="brown-jesse">Brown’s Hotel</persRef>, and left Cards for
							several members who lodge there, and at <persRef ref="peyton-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Peyton’s</persRef> where I found
								<persRef ref="edwards-ninian">N. Edwards</persRef>, the Senator from
							Illinois confined to his chamber with the Influenza. While I was with
							him <persRef ref="vanswearingen-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Van Swearingen</persRef> a kinsman of his member of the House of
							Representatives from Virginia came in— Edwards had begun to talk upon
							the subject which he has most at heart, when we were interrupted. His
							Colleague in the Senate, <persRef ref="thomas-jesse">Jesse B.
								Thomas</persRef> and he, are rivals in the State of Illinois; each
							of them has partizans to provide for, and each of them urges with great
							earnestness his particular friends for the appointments of the General
							Government in the State— Edwards says that his friends are the friends
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe and his Administration; and are
							also men of character and reputation—that the persons recommended by
							Thomas, are bitter enemies of the Administration, men of tarnished fame,
							partizans of Thomas and of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef>, and supported by
							Thomas for no other quality than their aptitude for electioneering in
							the bar-rooms of taverns— Yet of such persons the President has
							nominated to the Senate five out of six appointments to be made in the
							State— Edwards said that however reluctant he was formally to oppose the
							confirmation of a nomination made by the President in the Senate he
							should yet be compelled to do it, and had explicitly told his Colleague
							that he should— But he thought the President did not sufficiently
							consider the effect of his own course in the State— It might be
							magnanimous to distribute the Offices of the Government in equal
							proportions among his enemies and his friends; but to give five sixths
							of them to his enemies, was to advertise a premium for opposition and to
							denounce a penalty for friendship— Edwards intimated also that he
							thought I was not sufficiently earnest in pressing these things upon the
							consideration of the President— I had not the opportunity of explaining
							to him the principles of my own reserve, in my intercourse with the
							President respecting appointments. <persRef ref="roberdeau-isaac">Major
								Roberdeau</persRef> called at the Office, and left with me a minute
							of a new admeasurement by him of the two brass and the iron French Metre
							upon <persRef ref="troughton-edward">Troughtons</persRef> scale— He now
							finds the result to agree as precisely as possible with that of the last
							experiments of <persRef ref="kater-henry">Captain Kater</persRef>.

							complaint is very generally prevailing, and almost every person in my
							family has been affected by it— I have for several days past had
							something of it myself. I called at the President’s— There are various
							appointments to be made among which are a District Attorney in
							Louisiana, in the place of <persRef ref="dick-john">John Dick</persRef>,
							resigned: a commercial agent at the Havanna in the place of <persRef
								ref="hogan-michael">Michael Hogan</persRef>—a Commercial Agent at
							the Island of Trinidad, applied for in behalf of <persRef
								ref="comegys-j">J. B. Comegys</persRef> and there is also an
							application in behalf of <persRef ref="moore-george">George
								Moore</persRef> for the appointment of Consul at Trieste. There was
							an appointment made nearly two years since to this last office of
								<persRef ref="adams-f">Francis Adams</persRef> of Alexandria, but he
							has never repaired to his Post, for which reason the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> concludes to make another
							appointment. There is some difficulty about the appointment of a
							District Attorney. These are numerous applications in favour of <persRef
								ref="smith-john8">J. W. Smith</persRef>, a son of the late <persRef
								ref="smith-samuel3">President of Princeton</persRef> college. He has
							been for a <pb type="ms" n="455"/>year past in the actual performance of
							the duties of the Office by the appointment of Dick, and for him; and
							yet Dick now recommends another man; who is also supported by <persRef
								ref="robertson-thomas">Thomas Bolling Robertson</persRef>, Governor
							of Louisiana. Party politics are involved in this transaction, and in
							all such cases the President’s practice is to postpone making the

							been made for a person named <persRef ref="israel-unknown"
								>Israel</persRef> of Philadelphia— <persRef ref="roberts-jonathan"
								>Roberts</persRef> the Senator from Pennsylvania, solicited for him

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rodney</persRef> of Delaware in favour
							of a person named <persRef ref="warner-john">Warner</persRef>— He
							therefore directed me to suspend the issuing of the Commission— That to
							Comegys, for Trinidad was authorised— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Adams</persRef> had this Evening her first weekly Evening tea-party—
							Her Cards of invitation are issued for this evening, and every Tuesday
							evening during the Session of Congress, when agreeable— They were sent
							to her visiting acquaintance who are inhabitants of the City; and to the
							Members of Congress and Strangers who have called upon us. The party
							this Evening was well attended. <persRef ref="rhea-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Rhea</persRef>, a member of the
							House of Representatives from Tennessee, came about an hour before any
							of the rest of the Company, but would not stay— He said he came to shew
							that he accepted the invitation; but that he was obliged to go home to
							his lodgings and to bed. After a visit of about half an hour he
							accordingly went away. Rhea is a man of very respectable character and
							has been with some interval many years in Congress— He is by birth an
							Irishman, but from his youth a resident in this Country. He is at least
							70 years of age, and by his dress and manners a remarkable personage. If
							a picture of the House were to be painted he would be a very striking
							portion of the Scene— He is indefatigable in the discharge of his
							duties—constant in his attendance at the House. Chairman of one of the
							most laborious Committees, and takes part in every important debate.
							Always at this City several days before the commencement of a Session of
							Congress, and always remaining here several days after its close. He
							then prepares and prints a circular to his Constituents giving them a
							view of the state of affairs, and of what has been transacted by
							Congress during the Session. He is a very useful member of the house,
							and in the business of routine has much influence— He is always in good
							humour, indulges himself in no personalities and never gives Offence—
							Without appearing or aiming to be one of the ostensible leaders of the
							house he has great weight upon all but party questions— His
							singularities of person and deportment detract from his consideration
							because they afford subjects of amusement and derision. Men may respect
							a person at whose oddities they laugh. But the respect which confers
							power, must be serious.</p>

						<p><date>29. VII.</date> I have not for many months risen so late from bed
							as this Morning; the cause of which was, not only the late hour at which
							our company withdrew last Evening, but the influenza, under the effects
							of which I am suffering— I returned <persRef ref="baldwin-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin’s</persRef> visit, and had a
							long conversation with him on the subject of the Missouri question of
							the present Session, which he agreed was a totally different question
							from that of the last. He said however that those who now objected to
							the admission of Missouri on the ground of the exceptionable Article in
							her Constitution connected the restriction question of the last Session
							with it, and wish to re-open the whole controversy. I told him I
							believed there would be a very small portion of the house for that, and
							I thought it would be quite unjustifiable: but the Article in the
							Missouri-Constitution, was directly repugnant to the rights reserved to
							every Citizen of the Union in the Constitution of the United States— Its
							purport went to disfranchise, all the people of colour who were citizens
							of the free States.—The Legislatures of those States were bound in duty
							to protect the rights of their own Citizens, and if Congress by the
							admission of Missouri with that clause in her Constitution should
							sanction this outrage upon those rights, the States a portion of whose
							Citizens should be thus cast out from the pale of the Union would be
							bound to vindicate them by retaliation— And if I were a member of the
							Legislature of one of those States, I would move for a declaratory Act,
							that so long as <pb type="ms" n="456"/>the Article in the Constitution
							of Missouri, depriving the coloured Citizens of the State say of
							Massachusetts of their rights as Citizens of the United States within
							the State of Missouri, should subsist so long the white Citizens of the
							State of Missouri should be held as aliens within the Commonwealth of
							Massachusetts, not entitled to claim or enjoy within the same any right
							or privilege of a Citizen of the United States. And I would go further
							and declare that Congress having by their sanction of the Missouri
							Constitution, by admitting that State into the Union, without excepting
							against that Article which disfranchised a portion of the Citizens of
							Massachusetts; had violated the Constitution of the United States,
							wherefore until that portion of the Citizens of Massachusetts, whose
							rights are violated by the Article in the Missouri Constitution should
							be redintegrated in the full enjoyment and possession of those rights,
							no clause or Article of the Constitution of the United States should
							within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts be so construed as to authorise
							any person whomsoever, to claim the property or possession of a human
							being as a Slave— And I would prohibit by Law, the delivery of any
							fugitive Slave, upon the claim of his master— All which I would do not
							to violate but to redeem, from violation the Constitution of the United
							States— It was indeed to be expected that such Laws would again be met
							by retaliatory Laws of Missouri and the other Slave-holding States, and
							the consequence would be the dissolution de facto of the Union; but that
							dissolution would have commenced by the Article in the Missouri
							Constitution— That article was in itself a dissolution of the Union. If
							acquiesced in, it would change the terms of the federal compact— Change
							its terms by robbing thousands of Citizens of their rights— And what
							Citizens—the poor the unfortunate—the helpless— Already cursed by the
							mere colour of their skin—already doomed by their complection to drudge
							in the lowest offices of Society, excluded by their colour from all the
							refined enjoyments of life, accessible to others, excluded from the
							benefits of a liberal education; from the bed, from the table, and from
							all the social comforts of domestic life this barbarous Article deprives
							them of the little remnant of right yet left them—their rights as
							citizens and as men— Weak and defenceless as they are, so much the more
							sacred is the obligation of the Legislatures of the States to which they
							belong to defend their lawful rights— And I would defend them should the
							dissolution of the Union be the consequence— For it would not be the
							defence, it would be the violation of their rights to which all the
							consequences would be imputable; and if the dissolution of the Union
							must come, let it come from no other cause but this. If Slavery be the
							destined Sword in the hand of the destroying angel, which is to sever
							the ties of this Union, the same sword will cut in sunder the bonds of
							Slavery itself. A dissolution of the Union for the cause of Slavery
							would be followed by a servile war in the Slave-holding States, combined
							with a War between the two severed portions of the Union— It seems to me
							that its result must be the extirpation of Slavery from this whole
							Continent, and calamitous and desolating as this course of Events in its
							progress must be, so glorious would be its final issue that as God shall
							judge me I dare not say that it is not to be desired— Baldwin said that
							he entertained different opinions from mine, of this class of our
							population. That he thought them far more mischievous than useful— That
							of all the petty crimes committed in the part of the Country where he
							resided nine tenths were by free people of colour— That he believed it
							to be the same throughout the Country, though there might be an
							exception in the Eastern States— That all the States made Laws for the
							exclusion of paupers and vagabonds, and persons whose residence within
							the State would become a nuisance. But that for his part he was willing
							to admit Missouri, in any form in which it had been proposed; with the
							condition or without it— I asked him how he expected to succeed this
							Session with his Tariff. He said he <pb type="ms" n="457"/>hoped, better
							than the last; in which I think he will be disappointed— This evening we
							attended the first drawing room at the President’s. <persRef
