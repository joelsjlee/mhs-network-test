						<p><date>1. IV:15.</date> Thursday. <persRef ref="hickey-william"
								>Hickey</persRef> called this Morning at my house, and I gave him
							the papers relating to the house and lot in Square N. 173. which I have
							agreed to purchase of <persRef ref="edwards-james">James L.
								Edwards</persRef>, excepting the Deed of Edwards himself, of which I
							am preparing a draft, and for which Hickey is to come again on Saturday
							morning. a <persRef ref="mariano-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mariano</persRef> brought me a Letter of recommendation from
								<persRef ref="holley-horace">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Holley</persRef>, President of Transylvania University at Lexington
							Kentucky, where Mariano has been these eighteen Months, Professor of
							modern Languages. He is an Italian, of the Bonaparte School, self-exiled
							from his Country, and has formed the project of going with <persRef
								ref="todd-charles">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Todd</persRef>
							to South-America—and has Letters to the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> also, recommending him— Todd went some days
							since to Baltimore, where he is looking out for a passage to the Island
							of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Thomas, whence he is to proceed to
							the Republic of Colombia. This Mariano, a foreigner, not two years in
							this Country, comes to ask an appointment in one of its agencies abroad.
							I told him, that with every disposition to serve him there was no
							opportunity open for such an appointment. I called on <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> at the Treasury, with the application from
								<persRef ref="laserna-mateo">La Serna</persRef>, for the restoration
							of duties on the Cargo of Snuff said to belong to the <persRef
								ref="ferdinand-vii">King of Spain</persRef>— Crawford sent for the
							first Comptroller, <persRef ref="anderson-joseph">Anderson</persRef>, to
							consult him on it. They agreed that the duties might be restored, upon
							the principle that they ought not to have been levied. But M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Anderson wanted Evidence of the fact, that
							the Snuff belonged to the King of Spain; of which the mere allegation of
							the <persRef ref="ronquenet-donbartholome">Spanish Consul</persRef>, or
							of La Serna, was not for him sufficient proof. He therefore took the
							papers and is to write to the <persRef ref="steele-john">Collector of
								Philadelphia</persRef> for further information.— At the Office I
							found <persRef ref="bulfinch-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bulfinch</persRef>, with a letter from <persRef
								ref="bulfinch-hannah">his wife’s</persRef> brother, <persRef
								ref="apthorp-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> J. T.
								Apthorp</persRef> of Boston, soliciting for <persRef
								ref="bulfinch-thomas">his Son</persRef>, the appointment of Consul
							for the Philippine Islands; presuming that the present Consul there
								<persRef ref="stuart-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Stuart</persRef>, would be removed on account of his unfitness for
							the place; of which Evidence had doubtless been transmitted to the
							Government. I told Bulfinch that this was the first intimation of any
							unfitness in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stuart that had been
							received by me. That he had been appointed within these two years on
							urgent and very respectable recommendations— That his correspondence
							with the Government since his appointment had been satisfactory; and
							that he would not be removed unless solid cause of complaint should be
							made out against him— <persRef ref="forbes-john">Forbes</persRef> was at
							the Office, and proposes to go to New-York there to embark in the
							Constellation frigate, for Buenos-Ayres. I am yet unable to make out his
							Instructions for want of Time. I received last week a Letter from
								<persRef ref="middleton-henry">H. Middleton</persRef>, appointed
							Minister to Russia. He was at Charleston, and informed me, that he
							should embark there for New-York the 26<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi>
							expecting to reach it in five or six days, and requesting me to write
							him a Letter, to meet him there, with Instructions, in what manner, and
							when he should proceed upon his Mission— The crowd and multiplicity of
							business had almost made me miss the time for answering this Letter. I
							wrote to him yesterday, and the Letter went by this Morning’s Mail;
							advising him to take passage in the Amity Packet, bound to Liverpool,
							and to sail from New-York, the 10<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of this
							Month; and as this would leave him very little time to spare; if he
							should find it inconvenient to come here, I would forward his
							Instructions to him at New-York— <persRef ref="obrien-richard"
								>O’Brien</persRef> was again at the Office this day; and after much
							persuasion to induce me to admit all the charges in his new account, and
							offering to bring me an affidavit of what the Committee-men who reported
							the Bill had said, he finally took away his papers, and said he make
							them out more clear for me, and bring them again in a few days. <persRef
								ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron Stackelberg</persRef>, the Swedish
							Charge d’Affaires came to ask answers to two Notes which he has written
							me— I promised him an immediate answer to one, and an early answer to
							the other: The first is a complaint that our naval officers in the
							Mediterranean entice away Seamen from Swedish Merchant-vessels; with a
							specific charge of it against <persRef ref="stewart-charles">Commodore
								Stewart</persRef>, during his late command there— The answer has
							been sometime delayed, to get a Report from Stewart upon the case— I
							have had that now several days, supported by depositions of several of
							his Officers; and am waiting only for a half hour of time to answer his
							Note. The other is a piece of chicanery about the yellow fever; to
							answer which I shall take time— <persRef ref="seaton-william"
								>Seaton</persRef>, one of the Editors of the National Intelligencer
							being at the Office, I gave him <persRef ref="morris-charles">Captain
								Morris’s</persRef> Report of the late transactions at Buenos-Ayres
								<pb type="ms" n="360"/>with the documents accompanying it to publish
							in the paper, and promised him further accounts in future. I have had
							for several days papers from <persRef ref="clarke-john2">Governor
								Clarke</persRef> of Georgia, relating to the charges against the
							Indian <persRef ref="mitchell-david">Agent Mitchell</persRef>, which
							were to be transmitted to the War Department; and was going over there
							with them when I met <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>, who returned with me to my Office. He
							is going into the Country for a week, and asked me to keep the papers in
							the mean time— I answered Governor Clarke’s Letter.</p>

						<p><date>2: IV:15.</date> A rainy day; and of course fully occupied at my
							Office— <persRef ref="forbes-john">Forbes</persRef> came and took leave:
							going to New-York, there to wait for the Constellation Frigate, from
							Norfolk, to take him to Buenos Ayres, and perhaps round Cape Horn to
							Chili. His Instructions I am to make out and send after him— I have been
							writing short Letters to <persRef key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>,
							and to <persRef ref="graham-john">J. Graham</persRef> at Rio de Janeiro,
							whose health is so infirm, that he implores a leave of absence, which
							the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> has now determined
							to allow him— I was again devoted all the spare time of this day, to the
							preparation of Instructions to the Marshals for taking the Census— I
							wrote a short circular to the Marshals last week, promising Instructions
							as soon as they could be prepared, and asking them in the mean time, to
							appoint their Assistants and send me lists of their names— The <persRef
								ref="moore-andrew">Marshal of the Eastern District of
								Virginia</persRef> sends me a list of<space/>Assistants who have
							applied to him for as many Counties; and a list of<space/>Counties from
							which he has no applications. He says he will advertise in them for
							Assistants, but thinks no one will accept the appointment; the
							compensation being too scanty— It is so. The allowance to the Assistants
							is one dollar for every 100 persons returned, who live in the
							Country—and one dollar for every 300 in Cities or towns containing more
							than 3000 persons— It was the same in 1810 and in 1800. and there are
							three times the number of questions to be answered in each family that
							there were then. The time and labour consumed in taking every 100
							persons now is three times as great as it was then. Yet the compensation
							proposed is the same. This must be thought of hereafter—and I propose to
							keep a census Memorandum Book, in which all the important incidents
							attending this enumeration shall be minuted for future Consideration—
								<persRef ref="roth-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Roth</persRef> the French Chargé d’Affaires called at my house this
							evening, upon his return from Annapolis, whether he accompanied <persRef
								ref="hyde-de-neuville-jean;hyde-de-neuville-ann" type="multi">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								de Neuville</persRef>. They sailed in the Normande Frigate commanded
							by <persRef ref="bougainville-hyacinthe">Captain Bougainville</persRef>,
							for France on Wednesday— I shall probably never see Hyde de Neuville
							again— He resided several years in this Country as an emigrant, and
							practised Physic for a subsistance— At the Restoration he returned to
							France— Fled again to England during the second or hundred day reign of
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef>, and then
							returned to France, by a Passport obtained from me, by one of his
							friends, as a Louisianian named <persRef ref="u">Perrier</persRef>. He
							was soon chosen one of the deputies to the Legislative Assembly; was one
							of the most violent Ultra-royalists, and so conspicuous as a leader,
							that the members of that party were for some time called from his name
							the Hideux, in derision— His ardour became troublesome to the <persRef
								ref="louis-xviii">King</persRef>, and the Bourbon party itself, and
							he was sent here into honourable and lucrative banishment, to let his
							overheated passions evaporate— Soon after his arrival here his
							inflammable temper brought him into a short collision with the
							Government, for a foolish and indecent toast given at Baltimore by
								<persRef ref="skinner-john">Skinner</persRef> the Post-master; a man
							more hot-headed and wrong-headed than himself—against the King of
							France. This however soon blew over, and his conduct since that time has
							been unexceptionable—His private life irreproachable, and his social,
							friendly, kind and benevolent relations with the various classes of the
							people exemplary. His wife is a woman of excellent temper, amiable
							disposition, unexceptionable propriety of demeanor, profuse charity, yet
							of judicious economy, and sound discretion— No foreign Minister who ever
							resided here has been so universally esteemed and beloved; nor have I
							ever been in political relations with any foreign Statesman, of whose
							moral qualities I have formed so good an opinion, with the exception of
								<persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>— He has
							not sufficient command of his temper, is quick, irritable, sometimes
							punctilious, occasionally indiscreet in his discourse, and tainted with
							royalist and Bourbon prejudices. But he has strong Sentiments of Honour,
							Justice, Truth and even Liberty. His flurries <pb type="ms" n="361"/>of
							temper pass off as quickly as they rise— He is neither profound, nor
							sublime, nor brilliant, but a man of strong and good feelings, with the
							experience of many vicissitudes of Fortune, a good but common
							understanding; and good intentions, biased by party-feelings, occasional
							interests and personal affections— The diverting part of his character
							is the conflict between his Bourbon-royalism, and his republican fancies
							involuntarily contracted here from the irresistible fascination of
							practical freedom— They sometimes break out in his conversation in a
							manner almost ludicrous, as when at the dinner the other day at <persRef
								ref="antrobus-gibbs">Antrobus’s</persRef>, speaking of a Chamberlain
							of the King of France, a man of high birth and rank, but whom he did not
							like, he called him un Chambellan—c’est a dire, un Valet de Chambre— I
							told him that was a c’est à dire, that would have sounded very strangely
							in the mouth of a French Minister at a Diplomatic dinner, half a century
							ago— De Neuville is politically and his wife is piously religious. His
							catholicism like his royalism, pure at the fountain flows turbid with
							sediment from the bottom of the channel over which it passes. He now
							goes home with a professed intention of returning next winter; but I do
							not expect him; and perhaps ought not to desire that he should come
							back; to part in Peace once in a life with a diplomatic man is as much
							as can be reasonably anticipated.</p>

								<persRef ref="edwards-james">James L. Edwards</persRef>, which I had
							prepared— The business must be completed by next Thursday— A <persRef
								ref="speir-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Speir</persRef> of

								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, and Recommendations from
								<persRef ref="tompkins-daniel">Vice-President Tompkins</persRef> and
							other respectable persons— Speir is the uncle of a young man of the same name, one of the
							sixteen persons convicted and under sentence of Death, for Piracy
							committed on board the Irresistible; the same case for which seven
							others were convicted, two of whom have been executed at Baltimore— The
							sixteen of whom Speir is one, were tried at Richmond, but he was
							convicted and stands sentenced by the name of <persRef
								ref="oglesvy-francis">Frances Oglesvy</persRef>— I have been
							invariably averse to the execution of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> of the
							men in this case, which was more of a revolt against Piracy than piracy—
							The Captain of the same vessel, a man, who if he could undergo a
							separate hanging for every one of these men would not be too severely
							punished, has escaped repeated trials, and is now ranging the Ocean in
							the very same vessel, with impunity.— I told M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Speir that a pardon would issue for Speir; and for one other
							person convicted at Richmond. Reprieves for two Months are to go for all
							the rest excepting two, against whom the decree of execution, yet stands
							unrevoked. Speir asked me, if he might make known to his nephew that he
							was pardoned— I told him it would be more advisable and regular, to let
							it be communicated in due time by the Marshal. I paid a visit to the
							Vice-President who is at <persRef ref="strother-john"
								>Strother’s</persRef> Hotel— He has failed in his Election as
							Governor of New-York, <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt
								Clinton</persRef> the present Governor, his Competitor having been
							re-elected by a majority of 1460 in 94000 votes. He has some appearance
							of a disappointed Candidate— His great difficulties have arisen from the
							irregularity of his Accounts and his consequent inability to settle
							them— I spent this Evening at <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thornton’s</persRef> with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>

						<p><date>4. V:15.</date> We attended at <persRef ref="mccormick-andrew">M<hi

							their annual meeting on the 30<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of last
							Month, elected me their President— I answered the Letter and accepted
							the Office; because I thought there would be an appearance of
							affectation in refusing it— The Arts and Sciences have been the objects
							of my admiration through life; I would it were in my power to say they
							had been objects of my successful cultivation. Honours like these
							produce in my mind humiliation as well as pride. In this particular
							instance, I am mortified at being raised to the head of a learned
							Society, with qualifications so inadequate to the Station— Mortified,
							that in a Society which ought to include all the distinguished men of
							Letters and of Science in the State, there was no man so notoriously,
							and conspicuously superior to me, as to have prevented the thought of me
							from occurring at-all— As the time is fast approaching, when if my life
							continues, I shall be consigned to retirement from Public life; the idea
							presents itself to me, that I may still exist for some purpose useful to
							my Country, by devoting the leisure of my declining days to the duties
							of this Scientific Office. To promote the taste, the culture and the
							refinement of Art and Science in my Country— Should my exit from the
							public theatre be such as to leave me with a competency for the
							comfortable subsistence of my family, and therefore the choice of
							employment for my time, this will perhaps offer me the means of filling
							it with satisfaction and with honour— In the continual bustle and
							unceasing occupation of my present office, I feel nothing but the want
							of time— But in looking forward to the moment when discarded from all
							public concerns, my time will be all upon my hands, and instead of the
							rapid whirl of successive stimulants to interest, the lifeless languor
							of indifference to every thing around me will be predominant, what I
							principally dread is a dejection of Spirits, and atrophy of mind, which
							will throw me into a desultory, and idle because useless career of
							reading indolence— I shall want <hi rend="italic">an object of
								pursuit</hi>, and may the Spirit of Truth and of all Virtue and
							wisdom point me to it!</p>

						<p><date>5. IV:30.</date> I began this day, a new effort to attend at my
							Office earlier in the morning, with the intention of returning from it
							home to dinner, likewise earlier. The Office hours at the other
							Departments, and for the Clerks in mine are from nine in the morning, to
							three in the afternoon— I have hitherto found it impossible to keep
							those hours. For although I rise almost the year round before the Sun,
							my Journal employs me till past nine O’Clock, and then I have to
							breakfast and to give a cursory look over twenty or thirty newspapers—
							Eleven or twelve O’Clock thus comes almost as insensibly as those of
							Sleep in the Night— At the Office there is no quiet or retirement— An
							average of three visitors every day, each of whom consumes half an hour,
							may be set down for all the Months during which Congress are not in
							Session. The reading of the Mail absorbs yet more time and as the Clock
							strikes four, I am but just able to sit down for any writing— I shall
							nevertheless try to quit the Office henceforth at that hour. I found
							there this morning a <persRef ref="smith-unknown6">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> from the Roman
							Catholic Jesuit’s College at Georgetown, with five or six of their young
							Pupils who are going to Rome— They came to apply for Letters of
							recommendation to <persRef ref="appleton-thomas">T. Appleton</persRef>
							our Consul at Leghorn, and to <persRef ref="hammett-alexander">A.
								Hammett</persRef> Consul at Naples, which were given them. <persRef
								ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron Stackelberg</persRef>, the Swedish
							Chargé d’Affaires came to thank me for the packet which I had taken to
							him last Evening, and which he told me was from <persRef
								ref="stackelberg-unknown">his brother</persRef>. He also said that
							he had received my answer to his Note, complaining of the seduction of
							Seamen from Swedish Vessels in the Mediterranean by our Naval Officers,
							to which he should reply, by the request that in future our officers may
							be ordered in cases when it shall be found that they have shipped men
							belonging to Swedish vessels, to restore the men without exacting any
							payment of wages which they may have advanced to them— I told him that I
							should submit his reply to the Consideration of the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>— That it probably would
							seldom occur hereafter that our Ships in the Mediterranean would want to
							ship men— That it had been accidental in the case of the Franklin; the
							time of part of her crew having expired, before her return to the United
							States; and being obliged to discharge them <persRef
								ref="stewart-charles">Commodore Stewart</persRef> was under the
							necessity of recruiting others— But our usual system was to proportion
							the length of the Ship’s cruize to the time for which the men are
							enlisted, generally two years; about the expiration of which term the
							ships are ordered to return home— But I observed there might be some
							difficulty in ordering that men should be restored, without payment of
							the wages advanced to them— Because if our Officers in fact engage them
							without knowing that <pb type="ms" n="363"/>they belong to other
							vessels, it is hardly just that they should lose the men, and the
							advances for wages made to them too. He said that the wages given for
							men in our public ships were so much higher than Swedish seamen were
							accustomed to in their merchant vessels, that unless there should be
							some check upon the practice of enlisting them, there would be no safety
							for Swedish Vessels against being stripped of their Crews— <persRef
								ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poletica</persRef> came just as I was about leaving the Office, and
							read to me two despatches from <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl">Count
								Nesselrode</persRef>, to him; one of which related to the proposal
							of referring to the umpirage of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor
								Alexander</persRef> the question between the United States and Great
							Britain, upon the construction of the first Article of the Treaty of
							Ghent—which he declares his disposition to accept— The other was
							concerning the general policy of Russia, for which he refers him to a
							memoir upon the Relations between Russia and Persia, and between Russia
							and Turkey; and also to such despatches as he might receive from
								<persRef ref="pozzodiborgo-carlo">Pozzo di Borgo</persRef>, the
							Russian Ambassador in Paris— The Memoir and the despatch from Pozzo di
							Borgo, Poletica told me he had not yet read, but said he would bring
							them to me to-morrow— The Letter from Nesselrode, approved of the course
							of conduct observed by Poletica here, respecting our differences with
							Spain and exhorted him to persevere in it— I took the occasion to tell
							Poletica, that I should have communicated to him the progress of the
							Negotiation with <persRef ref="vives-don">Vives</persRef>, from step to
							step; but that I had seen he rather avoided communication with me, and
							concluded he would prefer keeping aloof from it, until it should have
							come to some result. As I thought this course on his part was correct, I
							had tacitly fallen in with it; and as all the documents were sent to
							Congress, there had been nothing afterwards to tell, that was not
							public. He said that he had purposely abstained from seeking information
							from me at that time; and had been equally reserved with Vivés, to whom
							he had never spoken a word on the subject of his Mission. His motives
							were to avoid intermeddling in any cases, where there was not an obvious
							utility in his interposition, and also to observe a proper delicacy
							towards <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> de Neuville</persRef> who having already taken much part
							in that affair, would naturally be averse to the interference of others
							which might have any effect upon his own— I asked Poletica, if he had
							any despatches from <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count
								Lieven</persRef>— He said no. Lieven was perfectly well in his
							place— An Ambassador in London, where Russia had nothing of material
							importance to transact. But Lieven would not take the trouble of writing
							much either upon general Politics, or upon the state of Affairs in
							England—being rather an indolent man— Pozzo di Borgo is evidently the
							favourite of Poletica.</p>

						<p><date>6. IV:30.</date> A moderate thunder-shower last Evening, swept away
							the sultry vapours of the atmosphere, and this day with a clear sky, a
							cool air and a genial Sun, was one of the finest to my feelings of the
							year. Others thought it too cool, but it was the precise temperature for
							labour; and this is the highest interest I have in the weather— It was a
							day of oppressive toil and turmoil at the Office— One of those in which
							the pressure and multiplicity of business crowds upon my brain, till it
							pains my temples as if labouring for expansion— <persRef
								ref="freeman-constant">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> C.

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Judah Lord</persRef>, who applies, and
							whom he recommends for an appointment as Consul or Commercial Agent at
							the Island of Porto-Rico. It was ascertained that the place was vacant,
							and I desired Lord to address to me a written application, and forward
							with it such recommendations as he could obtain, all which I told him
							should be laid before the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef>. Freeman asked me if I could now return him the
							confidential Letters which he put into my hands, implicating in
							piratical practices the <persRef ref="bulloch-archibald"
								>Bullock’s</persRef> of Savannah, the Collector of the Port and
								<persRef ref="bulloch-john">his brother</persRef>. I told them they
							were still in the possession of the President— He returned them to me
							twice, and took them back again, upon my asking him the question whether
							any thing was <hi rend="italic">to be done</hi>, with them— The
							blackness of darkness is but a shade of the villainy disclosed in these
							papers— But Bullock the Collector married the <persRef
								ref="bulloch-hester">daughter</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="elliott-john">Elliot</persRef> one of the Senator’s from
							Georgia, and “Robes and furred gowns hide all.”— The second time the
							President took back the papers after returning them to me, was when he
							was going into the Country. <persRef ref="foxall-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Foxall</persRef>, the Methodist Cannon
							founder came to ask a Letter of Introduction to <persRef
								key="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>, for a <persRef
								ref="emory-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
							Emory</persRef>; a preacher who was yesterday chosen at the Methodist
							Conference here, to attend the general Methodist Conference in England;
							he goes to-morrow to embark at Philadelphia— I gave him the Letter.
								<persRef ref="vives-don">General Vivés</persRef> came and told me
							that he was about despatching for Spain the same <pb type="ms" n="364"
							/>Messenger who had brought him his late despatches and Instructions,
							and he wished to have answers to his three last Notes to send by him. He
							offered at the same time to forward any despatches to <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>;
							and wished his messenger to go on Friday or Saturday— I promised to send
							him answers to his Notes before Friday; and said I should avail myself
							of his obliging offer, and write to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Forsyth— <persRef ref="morton-marcus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Morton</persRef> came for a few minutes— He is able to ride out; but
							is yet feeble and much emaciated. <persRef ref="tayloe-john">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Tayloe</persRef> called; going to
							Virginia. His principal object was to ask me, to give him my proxy, or
							vote for his <persRef ref="tayloe-benjamin">Son Benjamin Ogle
								Tayloe</persRef>, as a Director of the Bank of the Metropolis for
							the ensuing year. I told him I would attend the annual meeting, and vote
							with pleasure for his Son. <persRef ref="poletica-pierre"
								>Poletica</persRef>, brought me the Letter from <persRef
								ref="pozzodiborgo-carlo">Pozzo di Borgo</persRef>, with another from
								<persRef ref="nesselrode-karl">Nesselrode</persRef>; and the Memoir
							concerning the Relations of Russia, with Persia, and the Porte— He left
							these papers with me a couple of hours for perusal, and then came and
							took them again. I told him I should be glad to have some conversation
							with him concerning these papers hereafter. The Memoir is a fresh
							exposition of the political system of Russia; founded upon the basis of
							the European alliance for the preservation of universal Peace— It
							notices again the public comments and glosses upon the Alliances, and
							the different charges which have been occasionally brought against it,
							as a league of Great powers to oppress the smaller—or a combination of
							Sovereigns against the Liberties of the People; it defends the system
							against these and other objections, and holds it forth as a righteous
							and pure hearted league of powerful Sovereigns, for the maintenance of
							Justice, of good-Understanding and of Peace between them and all the
							world. There is an earnest solicitude manifested in this paper, to
							vindicate against reproach the system of the Alliance, and to commend it
							as peculiarly the Emperor’s system— It is <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Alexander’s</persRef> substitute for the armed neutrality. It then
							applies the principles of the system to the actual Relations of Russia
							with Persia, and with the Porte; with regard to the first of which it
							declares the Russian Government to be satisfied, and alluding obscurely
							to a secret Treaty of Alliance between Great-Britain, Austria and
							Persia, against Russia, supposes it to be merely defensive, to prevent
							encroachment upon Persia by Russia; which being as it observe not in the
							Emperor’s intention, is without effect as regards his Policy, and
							therefore can give him no dissatisfaction— The Article concerning
							Turkey, is less quiescent, but still entirely pacific— It charges the
							Turkish Government with many prevarications, and evasions of the last
							Treaty of Peace between the two Powers; and states that after many of
							these disingenuous practices, (stimulated and countenanced as it
							insinuates by foreign influence, meaning English and Austrian) the
							Emperor Alexander wrote, himself to the <persRef ref="mahmudii"
								>Sultan</persRef> hoping by this direct intercourse to come to a
							more explicit understanding with him—that the Sultan answered the
							Letter, dwelling however upon the same erroneous ideas, which had
							distinguished the correspondence of his Ministers— It proceeds to state
							that the objects in controversy being in possession or under the
							controul of Russia, will be so retained—leaving the matter for
							negotiation as long as the Turks may please; knowing that the policy of
							the Ottoman Porte will be <hi rend="italic">necessarily pacific</hi>— I
							told Poletica that I was glad to see from this Memoir, that there was no
							prospect of a War between Russia and Turkey; the newspapers from Europe
							having lately announced it as a probable event— The Letter from Pozzo di
							Borgo, related to Spanish, Portuguese and South-American Affairs, and
							referred him to the copy of another letter from him to <persRef
								ref="tuyll-diederick">General Tuyl</persRef> the Russian Minister
							now in Brazil, enclosed in the despatch— As this was not among the
							papers left by Poletica with me, I noticed it— He said he had not
							brought it, because there was something in it more peculiarly
							confidential— Nevertheless he would not withhold it; but would bring it
							with him the next time that he should come. I observed to him, that
							Pozzo di Borgo’s Letter spoke with disapprobation and concern of the
							late Events in Spain; at which I was not surprized— It was to be
							expected, that all the Governments in Europe would look at those Events
							at first, on their unfavourable side; as in this Country the first view
							of them had been universally on the favourable side— They were
							undoubtedly events of transcendent importance; and it would be very
							agreeable for us to know in what light they were and would be considered
							by the Emperor, and particularly whether any concert of measures would
							be adopted by the European allies, bearing upon the revolutionary state
							of Spain— He said it was certainly true that Pozzo di Borgo’s Letter did
							consider the changes in Spain, in an unfavourable light; and so far as
							they had originated, and been conducted by military mutiny, they could
							not be otherwise considered— To this I agreed, <pb type="ms" n="365"
							/>and remarked that there was no Country in the world, where military
							mutiny would be more disapproved than this— Nor any, where any operation
							of military force upon the civil Government would be more abhorrent to
							the general temper and character of the People— Military interference
							with the organization or administration of our Governments had been
							unexampled throughout our Revolution and ever since— On the other hand,
							there were many things in the recent transactions in Spain, which were
							universally approved here, and I presumed would even be well viewed by
							the European Governments— The moderation which had hitherto marked the
							revolutionary movement; the release of all prisoners for politics—and
							the abolition of the inquisition, for example—not to mention the liberty
							of the Press; which we indeed approve also, but which would not be so
							agreeable in Europe. I thought however that before the European
							Sovereigns should resolve upon any system for the treatment of the
							Spanish Malady, they would do well to consider the whole case, and
							particularly the temper of the Instruments with which they must operate:
							armies all over Europe, excepting Russia, being not precisely the same
							Machines that they have been heretofore. He said he was very sure that
							whatever might be the Event, unless the revolutionary party in Spain,
							like that of France should become aggressive, Russia at least would take
							no active, military measures against them— In the midst of all these
							visits, and avocations, I was preparing a Letter of Instructions for
								<persRef ref="todd-charles">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> C. S.
								Todd</persRef>, who from Baltimore has informed me that he has taken
							passage in a vessel to sail to-morrow for the Island of S<hi

								3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> from <persRef ref="middleton-henry"
								>H. Middleton</persRef> at New-York— He had arrived there from
							Charleston, that day—found my Letter there upon his arrival and
							immediately engaged a passage for himself and family, in the Amity
							Packet, to sail for Liverpool on the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>—
							He will therefore not have time to come here.</p>

							added that if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ravenscroft or any other

								>President</persRef>— I was again excessively pressed in preparing
							Instructions for <persRef ref="middleton-henry">H. Middleton</persRef>,
							and directing the Papers necessary for him to be transmitted—which must
							be at New-York next Saturday Morning. It was impossible for me to make
							the draft of his General Instructions in time— I therefore wrote him a
							Letter, merely directory with respect to his passing through England;
							and suggesting the measures to be arranged with the British Ministry,
							for proceeding on the reference to the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor of Russia</persRef>— As he will be necessarily detained
							some weeks in England, I shall send his general Instructions to him
							there— I consider this duty of giving Instructions to Ministers and
							Public Agents abroad, as the most important and difficult of the
							functions of a Secretary of State. There are many particulars of those
							Instructions which are the same or nearly the same for all— I have
							therefore adopted the practice of giving each of them two Letters of
							Instruction; the one under the denomination of <hi rend="italic"
								>General</hi>, and the other of <hi rend="italic">Personal</hi>— In
							this as in every thing else relating to the business of the Department,

							and Coach house, at and for the house which I have purchased in F.

							the House of Representatives, the person with whom Thornton had made his

							should go as Agent to South-America, and Allison succeed him as
							Superintendent of the Patent Office— Allison in the Letters comforts
							himself that although the Agencies to South-America, are otherwise
							disposed of, there will be another soon wanted for Peru— He enlarges
							upon the zeal with which he has promoted the re-election of <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>,
							by his influence as Vice-President of the general Baptist associations
							of Ministers, and of his willingness to travel about the Country, and
							labour industriously in the same good cause; but complains of his
							inability to carry his good wishes into effect, for the want of a little
							money— Neither Allison himself, nor D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thornton, appears to have a misgiving of Conscience as to the political
							purity or moral delicacy of this broad hint. To me it is very
							disgusting— Among the subjects which have lately occupied much of my
							time and attention, has been the disposal of the persons convicted and
							sentenced to death for Piracy, at Boston, Baltimore, Richmond,
							Charleston, Savannah and New-Orleans amounting to more than fifty— There
							are <persRef ref="warrington-thomas;rosewain-edward;holmes-william"
								type="multi">three at Boston</persRef>, sentenced for piracy and
							murder— They were part of a Prize Crew, bound to Buenos-Ayres, who
							murdered their <persRef ref="reed-unknown">Master</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="joseph2">Mate</persRef>; and brought the vessel into
							Scituate—Massachusetts— The transaction was among the most atrocious of
							those that have occurred; and yet there are circumstances of extenuation
							in the individual cases, which almost lay a claim to mercy for them.
							They petitioned the President for pardon, and <persRef
								ref="austin-james">J. T. Austin</persRef> one of their Counsel made
							a strong representation in their favour— But that of <persRef
								ref="blake-george">G. Blake</persRef>, the District Attorney, was
							strong and earnest against them; and the <persRef ref="wirt-william"
								>Attorney General</persRef>, to whom the President referred their
							petitions for his opinion, reported that it would be an abuse of the
							pardoning power to extend it to them. The President had determined not
							to interfere with the operation of the Law against them, and I had given
							the notice of it to Austin, and the Marshal, when two or three days
							before the President left the City, I received a private Letter from
								<persRef ref="prince-james">Marshal Prince</persRef>, most earnestly
							soliciting mercy, for one of the convicts named Rosewaine, on account of
							his Youth, his good conduct since he has been in prison, and his own
							statement and that of his fellow convicts that his case had been
							aggravated by false testimony of an accomplice, who was the only witness
							against him. I read this Letter to the President, on receiving it, two
							or three days before he left the City; and not having the other papers
							before him nor a distinct recollection of them, the President said that
							if there was any thing which would warrant him in making a
							discrimination, he would pardon this man— He left the City without
							giving any further directions, and in his Letter to me of the 2<hi
								rend="superscript">d. </hi>inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							referred to the principles already settled, to be applied, with the
							opinion of the Attorney-General, when necessary to the several cases,
							and directed me to report to him the cases in which pardons or reprieves
							would be proper— In the flood of business with which I have been
							incessantly overwhelmed I have till this day had no time for this— Today
							I took up and read all the papers relating to the persons convicted at
							Boston, including the last Letter of Marshal Prince; my impression from
							the whole was that Rosewaine could not with propriety be pardoned—but
							that of the President might be otherwise— The execution is fixed for the
								15<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>this day week— A Reprieve to go by
							the Mail, must go the day after to-morrow, or might be too late— I found
							upon enquiry that I could not write to the President, and receive his

							Department <persRef ref="warren-joseph">Joseph Warren,</persRef>
							Express, with directions to be back here with the President’s answer,
							within Office hours to morrow— I wrote to the President <pb type="ms"

							relating to it, with a request for an immediate decision— The despatches
							that were prepared for <persRef ref="middleton-henry">H.

								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, requesting them to call at my

								Wirt</persRef> is gone to Richmond— They came and I submitted the

							unanimous, concurring with that of the President, that Rosewaine could
							not with propriety be pardoned— I then referred to them the case of the
							Convicts at Richmond; of whom there are sixteen— All upon the case of
							the Irresistible, the same, for which <persRef ref="ferguson-john"
								>Ferguson</persRef> and <persRef ref="denny-israel">Denny</persRef>
							were hung at Baltimore— It had been originally decided, that two of

							they should be pardoned; if any circumstances of peculiar aggravation,
							which could point to a selection of the two who should suffer, they
							should be attended to, and the rest should be reprieved, for two Months,
							as those at Baltimore, Charleston, Savannah, and New-Orleans had been.
								<persRef ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice Marshall</persRef> had

								>Speir</persRef>, convicted by the name of <persRef
								ref="oglesvy-francis">Francis Oglesby</persRef> sufficient to issue
							for them a pardon— Chief Justice Marshalls Letter to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt names them as meriting particular

							execution— A list of their names, arranged according to the propriety of
							their conduct since they have been in prison has indeed been furnished
							by the District Attorney, but resting upon precarious testimony, and
							without any reference to particular facts— Their principal keeper,
							declining to make any discrimination between them. It happens also that
							of the two lowest on the list one is a Scotchman, and the other a man of
							colour. In the Richmond Enquirer of the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.
							</hi>which came this morning there is a Representation of four Columns,

							what had always been my opinion, and my wish, I heartily concurred with
							this determination. The President left his seat in Loudoun County this
							Morning for his Residence in Albemarle— The day fixed for the execution
							at Richmond is the 19<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>and as the
							Post-Office arrangement is not yet made, for conveying Letters to the
							President, there would scarcely be time to write to him, to receive his
							answer, and then to transmit the Warrant of Reprieve in season— I
							concluded therefore to presume upon the President’s approbation, and
							include the whole fourteen in the reprieve, which I directed to be made
							out to-morrow. And instead of making it for two Months, I directed it
							for an indefinite period, until the Marshal should receive further
							order. As it is the absolute determination of the President ultimately
							to pardon them; but to keep them a considerable time in prison, there
							would be much inconvenience, and some danger in having to renew
							Reprieves from time to time, for two Months, at four or five different
							places, and at different periods of expiration— Scarcely a week would
							pass without a necessity for issuing a new Warrant, and every time at
							the hazard of an accident, which might prevent the receipt of it by the
							Marshal in suitable time to put off the Execution— An indefinite
							Reprieve avoids all these serious inconveniences— Before leaving the

						<p><date>11. IV:30.</date> This morning as we were finishing our breakfast,
							a <persRef ref="fenwick-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								Fenwick</persRef> of Richmond came to my house with <persRef
								ref="strother-john">Strother</persRef> the keeper of the Hotel; and
							brought me a Letter of Introduction from <persRef ref="tompkins-daniel"
								>Vice President Tompkins</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Fenwick’s object was to solicit mercy for the convicts of Richmond— He
							had two printed copies of a petition to the President, signed by the
							Judges of the Virginia Court of Appeals, and by many other respectable
							persons, in behalf of the Prisoners— He had also a number of other
							papers; certificates from Clergymen, and Letters, with which he proposed
							to go to the President— Among the rest two Letters from a young woman at
							Portland Maine, sister to <persRef ref="poole-samnuel">Samuel G.
								Poole</persRef>, expressing very fervent religious sentiments—
							Fenwick himself spoke with much unction upon the case, and told me that
							Poole had become a very earnest preacher of the gospel to his brother
							convicts. I informed him that there would be no necessity for him to go
							to the President, as Warrants had already been forwarded yesterday to
							the <persRef ref="moore-andrew">Marshal at Richmond</persRef>, for the
							pardon and discharge of Poole and <persRef ref="oglesvy-francis"
								>Oglesby</persRef>, and a Reprieve for an indefinite term of time,
							for all the others— Fenwick said he should not wish that they might all
							be immediately pardoned, because they had not yet all been awakened to
							religious impressions; and said that when Poole had been informed that
							an effort would be made to obtain by petition a pardon for them, his
							first exclamation had been; “do not let those wicked ones know it.[”]—
							Fenwick intimated that the treatment of the Prisoners since they were
							sentenced had been rather more rigorous than was necessary; and
							mentioned particulars very disagreeable to think of. Such as the men
							being chained together two and two, and not allowed single moments of
							retirement from the presence of their guards— I told him that the
							Marshal, Moore was a man of humanity as well as prudence, and I had no
							doubt would allow every relaxation from the rigour of their confinement
							which was compatible with his duty of keeping them securely— But if upon
							his return to Richmond, he should find there was among those now
							reprieved, any who could be recommended as deserving a pardon sooner
							than others; or any alleviation to the rigour of their confinement,
							which could reasonably be desired but which the Marshal should decline
							to allow; he might make a statement of any such circumstances to me, and
							I would forward it without delay to the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> for his Consideration. With this, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fenwick declared himself to be satisfied.
							He told me that the Address to the President in the Richmond Enquirer,
							signed Publius, and the printed Petition, which was merely an abstract
							from it, were both written by <persRef ref="ritchie-thomas">T.
								Ritchie</persRef> the Editor of that Paper. <pb type="ms" n="369"

								>Charles</persRef> to <persRef ref="mccormick-andrew">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Cormick’s</persRef> Church; but
							there was no performance of service there. After dinner during an

							again this Morning, and told me he should immediately return to
							Richmond. He enquired if there had been any particular representations
							made to the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, in behalf
							of one of the Convicts by the name of <persRef ref="nelson-unknown"
								>Nelson</persRef>: there had not. He then intimated a wish that some
							favour might be extended to a person named <persRef ref="green-unknown"
								>Green</persRef> who had been chained with <persRef
								ref="poole-samuel">Poole</persRef>. I repeated the promise that if
							he would forward in writing a statement of any circumstances tending to
							recommend these or any other individuals to further clemency, it should
							be laid before the President who would give every just consideration to
							it; but I reminded him that with every proper sentiment of tenderness
							for these persons in their unhappy condition, it was not to be forgotten
							that they were all deeply involved in guilt— All had violated the Laws
							of their Country. After sparing their lives it was also proper to
							remember, that the crime of which they were convicted was not the only
							one that they had committed— The seizure of the Irresistible itself was
							a robbery, for which they had not been tried— Their shipping at
							Baltimore in either that vessel, or the Creola was a crime, and well
							known to be so by themselves— Speir, one of the persons pardoned, was
							tried and convicted by the name of <persRef ref="oglesvy-francis"
								>Oglesby</persRef>— How came he by that name?— He had assumed it at
							Baltimore when he shipped, conscious of the wrong he was doing, and
							anxious to shield his name from the reproach which he felt to be due to
							his conduct. As to the contrition and repentance of convicts between
							sentence and execution it was desirable for their own prospects of
							eternity that such should be their temper of mind—but it was a death-bed
							repentance. Such recoveries were subject to relapse, and we must not
							lose our duty of discriminating between repentance and virtue.
							Benevolence itself sometimes tended to excess— There had been a petition
							signed by four thousand persons at Baltimore, for the pardon of <persRef
								ref="ferguson-john">Ferguson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="denny-israel">Denny</persRef> the two men executed at
							Baltimore: and a written statement had been brought with the petition;
							not signed indeed, but consisting of a narrative, which if true would
							have secured their pardon— It was found upon enquiry to be wholly
							without foundation; and since the Execution of Ferguson, it had been
							proved that he had been guilty of other atrocious piracies, besides that
							for which he suffered— It had originally been intended that two of the
							men convicted at Richmond should also be executed— It had been thought
							necessary that examples should be made, to arrest this hideous crime of
							piracy— But it had been found impracticable to discriminate between the
							cases so as to select the victims, with propriety, and the interest
							taken in their behalf had finally prevailed to obtain mercy for them
							all. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fenwick assented to the Justice of
							these remarks, and professed to be quite satisfied— <persRef
								ref="hickey-william">Hickey</persRef> called at my Office, and
							brought me a deed from <persRef ref="vannness-john">J. P. Van
								Ness</persRef>, and <persRef ref="vanness-maria">his wife</persRef>
							of the lot and house in Square N. 173. with the opinion of <persRef
								ref="jones-walter">Walter Jones</persRef> to which he had referred
							me: and a strange opinion for a lawyer, it is. He considers the question
							as if Van Ness was a tenant by the Curtesy— I was still engaged upon my

							for the taking of the census— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi

							Months ago a draft of a lease, which he kept without hinting an
							objection till now— He brought the draft, and first said he did not wish
							the lease to extend to his Executors or Administrators, but in case he
							should die within the ten years that it should terminate at his decease.
							To this I readily assented— He next objected to the covenant on his
							part, to keep the place in repair, upon which I took him up sharply; not
							for the objection, but for his never having given me notice of it
							before— I told him if he had made it before I should not have concluded
							without having the first question settled between us— It was now too
							late— But I could not give up that clause of the lease—though I would
							most chearfully give him up the whole bargain if he would pay me back my

								>President</persRef> took with him to Virginia. He has not yet

							determination, whether any thing is to be done in the case— The
							President is perplexed between the sense of his duty to probe this
							matter further, and his reluctance to expose the <persRef
								ref="bulloch-archibald">Collector of Savannah,</persRef> a Man
							married to <persRef ref="bulloch-hester">the daughter</persRef> of one
							of the <persRef ref="elliott-john">Georgia Senators</persRef>. It is in

							into practice is great, and the numbers of instances in which I see
							corruption of the deepest dye, without being able to punish or even to
							displace it, is among the most painful appendages to my situation— There
							are numerous indications amounting in my mind to presumptive proof that
							this Collector of the Port of Savannah; was part owner of a Privateer
							fitted out at Savannah to cruize under South-American colours, with
							Instructions to take prizes of Spanish vessels, and others—to send them
							into Savannah, and if the vessels were other than Spanish to order the
							prize-master to personate the Captain of the vessel taken and make the
							entry at the Custom-house under that name. These Instructions, Clintock
							says were in the hand writing of<space/><persRef ref="bulloch-james"
								>Bullock</persRef>, a brother of the Collector. the Privateer took
							the Nordberg—a Danish vessel— <persRef ref="ferguson-john"
								>Ferguson</persRef>, the man, executed lately at Baltimore for
							another crime, carried with him from the privateer to the prize false
							Spanish papers, and made a pretence of finding them on board the
							Nordberg— They carried this vessel into Savannah—there entered her with
							her real papers as a Danish vessel, and Ferguson, according to the
							Instructions personated the Captain; she was entered without the
							observance of regulations required by Law, by the Collector— Her Cargo
							was sold, and the proceeds were received by merchants of Savannah, among
							whom was the Bullock, who had written the Instructions; brother of the
							Collector— The ship was afterwards libelled for the United States, and
							afterwards by her Supercargo for the owners— The Supercargo obtained
							judgment against several persons purchasers of the Cargo; and compounded
							for what he could get— The <hi rend="italic">Instructions</hi> were
							filed in court with the papers of the case; but another of <persRef
								ref="bulloch-john">the brothers Bullock</persRef> was the Clerk of
							the Court— After Clintock’s disclosure, this paper was searched for on
							the files of the Court; and was not to be found. Bullock is no longer
							Clerk of the <pb type="ms" n="371"/>Court. The annals of human depravity
							furnish no record of a baser transaction, and the presumption is violent
							against Bullock the Collector, as well as against both his brothers, of

								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">A. Gallatin</persRef> may not be

							Astor means that it is the wish of Gallatin himself; and says he has a
							Letter from another Gentleman, but who did not wish his name to be
							known, stating explicitly that it is Gallatin’s wish— The President
							therefore understood very exactly the state of mind in which Gallatin
							wrote the Letter last winter, requesting his recall. Gallatin has been
							twelve years Secretary of the Treasury and seven years a Minister
							abroad. His foreign nativity was at the opening of <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Madison’s</persRef> administration the insuperable bar to his
							obtaining the Department of State, and thereby cut off forever his

							contented in France, if the Salary would defray his unavoidable
							expences— But it will not; and although he may remain there one or two
							years longer, he will be compelled to return by want of means to remain.
							This condition of our Ministers abroad is a very difficult and
							treacherous one as respects themselves. The foreign Missions are of all
							the offices of the Country the most coveted, and the most likely to
							terminate in disappointment. I told Forrest that Gallatin would <pb
								type="ms" n="372"/>not return to the United States this year, and
							advised him to send Astor’s Letter to the President. Astor made
							enquiries also whether a young Sculptor of great talents, who wishes to
							come to America, could obtain employment and encouragement here. I told
							Forest to answer Astor no—not so much as bread and water—and gave him a
							history of my efforts to patronize Cardelli and their failure— He is an

							the Census should be charged with only one Cent postage for each— That
							in 1810. there was an application that the Census Instructions forms and
							returns should be charged only with pamphlet postage— That he had
							written to the Post-Masters at New-York and Philadelphia to enquire if
							such an order had been given then; and if by their answers it should
							appear that it had, the same order should be given now. I endeavoured to
							obtain the order, that newspaper Postage only should be charged, but
							without success, and was finally obliged to accept the offer of an order
							for pamphlet charges— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi

							questionable by expressing some Surprize that the Letter from <persRef
								ref="louis-xviii">the King</persRef> announcing the same event had
							not been answered: and enquiring whether by the usage of this Country
							these formalities were not approved. I told him the only reason why the

								<persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							that was delivered, was answered— That the proper direction of such
							Letters from Foreign Sovereigns was, to the President of the United
							States— The English and Spanish Kings however addressed their Letters to
							the United States of America— To that Style, we had no objection; but
							that of President and members of the Congress was an Anachronism, and an
							absurdity— There is no President of the Congress— Roth said he had
							supposed the Letters must be addressed to the President of the United

									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Cormick’s</persRef> Church. He read
							prayers for the third Sunday after Trinity, and preached a Sermon from
							1. Corinthians 1.20. “Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is
							the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this
							world?” It was upon the doctrine of atonement by the blood of Christ; a
							perilous and incomprehensible doctrine— A doctrine professedly resting
							upon the overthrow of all worldly wisdom— A doctrine suited as the
							Apostle himself says, neither to the Jews nor the Greeks, because the
							Jews required a sign, and the Greeks sought after wisdom— The idea that
							the execution as a malefactor of one human being should redeem the whole
							human race from a curse entailed upon them by a single act of
							disobedience by the first created man, is a compound of absurdities,
							which sets at once all wisdom, all the reasoning faculties at defiance.
							Neither the Indian Cosmogony, nor the heathen mythology, nor any the
							most delirious ravings of the Greek philosophers, contain any thing more
							incredible and inconceivable than this doctrine— The truth is to my Mind
							that where doctrinal religion begins, there human reason ends— If I am
							asked what was the tree of knowledge of good and evil, placed in the
							midst of the garden of Eden, my answer must be I know not— If I am asked
								<hi rend="italic">why</hi>, it was made to grow there; no reason is
							assigned; and none other appears than that it was at once to prohibit
								<persRef ref="adam">Adam</persRef> and <persRef ref="eve"
								>Eve</persRef> from eating its fruit, and yet to keep them for ever
							exposed to the temptation of breaking the injunction—a snare laid by the
							Lawgiver to entrap into guilt the creatures of his own hands— If I am
							asked, <hi rend="italic">why</hi> the prohibition was laid, by a Creator
							who knew and intended that it should be violated—I answer it is among
							the inscrutable ways of the almighty. But when the question is put how a
							beneficent Creator could inflict a curse upon the whole human race for
							the fault of one man, the idea of absurdity is swallowed up in that of
							cruelty and injustice— When after all this, I am required to overleap an
							interval of four thousand years during which time all the children of
							Adam lived and died under the curse—and see Jesus of Nazareth, crucified
							as a false prophet and blasphemer, and am told, first that this Jesus
							was the son of God, begotten upon a Virgin; secondly that he was
							Almighty God himself; thirdly that he was a lineal descendant from
								<persRef ref="david">David</persRef> and <persRef ref="abraham"
								>Abraham</persRef>, and fourthly that his blood shed upon the Cross
							has redeemed from the Curse Adam and all his posterity born and to be
							born to the end of time; what can I answer on principles of human
							reasoning, but “quodcumque mihi sic ostendis, incredulus Odi.” The
							atonement is a mystery; and if Christian preachers would take my advice;
							they would seldom say much about it to those of their hearers who are
							accustomed to exercise their reasoning faculties— It is enough for us to
							know that God hath made foolish the wisdom of this world— The weather

							and was for hanging two at Richmond, until <persRef ref="ritchie-thomas"

							inefficient in taking measures to arrest the piratical speculations— He

							I believe that his influence contributed to make <persRef

								<persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							to enquire concerning a Commission for <persRef ref="armstrong-andrew"
								>Andrew Armstrong</persRef> as Commercial Agent at Port au Prince.
							It had been transmitted to him at Savannah, where he now is. Gales,
							Senior Editor of the National Intelligencer, came to ask an account of
							some appointments which have been made, and have not yet been
							communicated to the public. In this as in many other parts of this

							now made, by nominations proceeding from each Department of the
							Government separately— The Commissions issue also from the separate
							Departments, and there is no one place where the names of all public
							Officers can be found— Gales came particularly to be informed of the
							names of the Commissioners for laying out the road from Wheeling to the
							Mississippi— This road is to be continued by an act of the last Session
							of Congress and appears to have introduced sufficiently for practical
							purpose the principle of expending public monies upon internal
							improvements. The reason assigned for laying out this road is to make
							the public Lands more valuable; and as the Land Office is an appendage
							to the Treasury Department, the road and all operations concerning it,

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> had a plan of

							of Government of the three States of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois— D<hi

							circumstance that two Letters addressed to him were enclosed under cover
							to me, one of which enclosed under a second cover a Letter to another
							person and a small box with trinkets, having no relation to the Patent
							Office, and of no public concern. The other covered a Letter to <persRef
								ref="elliott-william">Elliot</persRef> a Clerk under Thornton in the
							Patent Office, enclosing 7 dollars, part of which was said to be for his
							trouble— I had sent to Thornton, to enquire how the box of trinkets came
							to be sent to me, and whether Elliot received money, from individuals
							for business done at the Office? The Doctor gave as explanation that the
							sending the box of trinkets was accidental, and not authorized by him,
							and that the money sent to Elliot was sent for copying papers
							extra-officially, and not in Office hours— He said that Elliot, and he
							himself had repeatedly and invariably refused proffered fees for

							the Letter from <persRef ref="pozzodiborgo-carlo">Pozzo di

								Tuyl</persRef>— It relates to the recent Revolution in Spain—to the
							differences between Spain and Portugal, to the situation of
							South-America; the interests of the Portuguese Brazilian Government, and
							to the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander’s</persRef>
							favourite system for the preservation of general Peace— This Letter
							speaks in terms of unqualified disapprobation of the Revolution in
							Spain, considering it as a revolt of Subjects and of Soldiers against
							their Sovereign, and the Sovereign himself as acting entirely under
							compulsion; a prisoner of Rebellion— There are some faint remarks upon
							the indiscretions of <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">Ferdinand’s</persRef>
							Government but no intimation of a doubt whether wickedness and tyranny
							and imbecility can possibly forfeit a hereditary right to reign. He
							takes occasion to remark that this State of things ought to impress the
							Brazilian Government more than ever with the necessity of harmonizing
							with Spain upon South-American Affairs; but cannot avoid foreseeing that
							it accelerates the prospects of Independence of the South-Americans. I
							thanked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Poletica for the perusal of this
							paper, and told him I was not surprized at the light in which he viewed
							the Spanish Revolution. There was however another and a more favourable
							point of view in which the same event was to be considered, and which it
							was natural should be taken here. We considered it as a revolution
							favorable to Liberty, and hoped it would terminate in good government
							and order. It has furnished a new and decisive proof that <hi
								rend="italic">authority</hi> can no longer stand in Europe
							self-supported. It must have a Shield as well as a Spear, and that
							Shield can be no other than the hearts of the people. There was great
							danger in Spain both of Anarchy and of civil War, but there was none
							that Spain should overflow upon the rest of Europe as had been the case
							with France— To this Poletica assented, but he spoke with caution and
							reserve upon the affairs of Spain. He disapproves as much as his
							Colleague at Paris, but does not venture so strongly to express his
							disapprobation— I spoke to him of the Negotiation between France and
							Buenos-Ayres recently divulged, and found him still more unprepared to
							talk of that, than of Spanish Affairs: it confirms him however in his
							opinion that the South-Americans are not competent to maintain
							Independent Governments— <persRef ref="caldwell-charles">D<hi

							making himself a blind partizan, not only to their struggle for
							Independence, but to their internal feuds—and in the case of these
							plundering outrages of Lord Cochrane, he has been to say the least very
							remiss in supporting the rights and interests of his Countrymen— Prevost
							is a special favourite of the President’s, and I am aware there is some
							delicacy and danger in presenting these facts to him in a manner which
							attaches blame to him— The censorial Power of the President of the
							United States, over the moral and official conduct of the Officers
							appointed and subject to removal by him, is one of those, the exercise
							of which is of the most extreme delicacy. There are cases when it is
							proper to mark disapprobation without expressing it— Others in which it
							must be unequivocally expressed, and among them such as require
							different degrees of severity—others finally which demand the permission
							to resign, or last of all, peremptory removal— In the discharge of this
							most painful and ungracious duty, the President seems to me, more
							governed by momentary feelings, and less by steady and inflexible
							principle than I think he ought— But his failing leans to Virtue’s side—
							He is universally indulgent, and scrupulously regardful of individual
							feelings— He is perhaps too reluctant to exercise this power at-all— He
							rather turns his eyes from misconduct, and betrays a sensation of pain
							when it is presented directly to him. Whether this weakness, as it
							appears to me to be, is not better than its proximate energy, is perhaps
							doubtful. In the theory of a President’s duties, with almost as much
							indulgence, and the same tenderness for the feelings of individuals, I
							should look for a little more vigilance to observe, and a little more
							rigour to controul the faults of Executive Officers— One of the
							consequences of this tendency to censorial laxity is the necessity under
							which I have often found myself, of presenting to the President cases
							requiring censure; and after having presented them of bringing them
							again and again before him, until something is done; for whatever he
							consents to do, unless it is to be executed immediately, he never thinks
							of it afterwards, and in the way of censure or punishment, if an order
								<pb type="ms" n="377"/>that he gives should not be executed, I doubt
							whether he would ever notice it, unless by having it again called to his
							attention— The heat of the weather begins seriously to affect my ability
							to labour; and this evening, after dinner, I made two or three attempts
							to write and was obliged to give them up.</p>

							yesterday. A person by the name of <persRef ref="bailey-asael">Asael
								Bailey</persRef> came to my house with another man, to obtain a
							patent for a floating machine for net fishery. He had applied some time
							since for a Patent which <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi

								Delancey</persRef> of New-York, who had also claimed a patent for
							the same invention had given up his pretensions and had not taken out
							the patent— I told Bailey to apply again at the Patent Office, and ask
								D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Thornton to send me Bailey’s
							Petition, Specification and Model, and also the specification and
							drawing deposited by Delancy. They were accordingly brought by <persRef

							to my Office, and upon examination of them there appeared to me, to be a
							sufficient difference of principle between them to warrant the issuing

							them should be vacated for interference with the other. I directed
							therefore that the Patent to Bailey should be issued. The Doctor did not
							send his own Specification or model, and I suppose has never made them.
							He has such an inventive genius, that scarcely any person applying for a

						<p><date>25. III:45.</date> The Night was the hottest we have yet had for
							the Season, and as usual in such weather I had very little sleep. I rose
							with the dawn of day, and commenced a Memorandum for the compilation of
							a Manual for the distribution of the business in the Department of
							State— I began with a minute of the principal branches of business, as
							they occurred to my recollection, without order or arrangement. May this
							undertaking not share the fate of so many others which I have commenced
							and abandoned in the course of my life. Bath with <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> in the Potowmack, and
							returned to the place which I have most frequented, just above the
							Bridge— We all attended Church at <persRef ref="mccormick-andrew">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> M’Cormick’s</persRef>. He read
							Prayers for the fourth Sunday after Trinity, and preached from
							Ecclesiastes XI: 9. “Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy
							heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy
							heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these
							things, God will bring thee into judgment.” It was a plain and sensible
							discourse of admonition to youth. This Book of Ecclesiastes appears to
							be Supplementary to that of Proverbs. It contains some of the most
							exquisitely beautiful passages of the whole Bible. It is a moral
							dissertation, which commences with the assertion of the general Vanity
							of all human existence, and concludes with the exhortation to Fear God
							and keep his commandments; asserting this to be the whole duty of
							man—and reminding the reader that God shall bring every work into
							judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be
							evil. This the great foundation of the Hebrew system of Morals, which
							was thus grappled in union indissoluble with religion— It recurs in the
							Sentiment of the text, which is not intended to debar youth from the
							enjoyments in which it delights, but on the contrary contains not only
							permission but injunctions to partake of them freely, coupled only with
							the caution to enjoy within the bounds allowed by the Commandments of
							God— There is no <pb type="ms" n="378"/>more perfect morality than this—
							The general complexion of thought in the book is melancholy— It bears
							internal evidence of a man who had himself enjoyed too much; who had
							been satiated with good things; and miserable from the gratification of
							all his desires— There never existed indeed a man in whom the vanity of
							human life was so strongly exemplified as in <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon</persRef>— He was a king with absolute power, and had a
							reign of uninterrupted Peace and Prosperity till the last Stage of his
							life— He was the wisest and most pious of men— A prophet, divinely
							inspired—with an inextinguishable thirst of knowledge; and an exquisite
							relish for literature and Science— With such Powers, and such
							dispositions, he became the victim of sensuality and of superstition; he
							died in the arms of idolatresses, and left rebellion and dismemberment
							as the inheritance of his Son. He wrote this book in the decline of
							life; under the bitter disappointment of supreme felicity; yet full of
							the wisdom both of inspiration and of experience; and overflowing with
							the richest oriental poetic imagery. It is a peculiarity in the writings
							of Solomon, that they appear to be addressed to an individual; and from
							that practice he frequently resorts to the figure of apostrophe, when he
							means only to express a general maxim— In this text the young man whom
							he accosts is every young person who reads the book, and this
							interjective mode of writing adds great force, and animation to the
							precept— The monitions “walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight
							of thine eyes,[”] are all figurative to signify the indulgence of
							inclination and of passion; the ways of the heart are the propensities
							of animal nature— The sight of the eye, is the pursuit of sensual
							pleasure to which the principal attractions are by the eyes— In the
							German Bible of <persRef ref="luther-martin">Luther</persRef>, this
							verse begins the twelfth and last Chapter, as it seems to me evident
							that it ought— It is the commencement of the exhortation to youth which
							is continued into that chapter, and in which there is that incomparable
							allegorical description of old age and death— The heat of the weather
							was this day so great that I had not that command of attention to the
							preacher which his subject deserved— After returning home, I was unable
							to write, and had no other occupation than the perusal of the
							Newspapers— Towards evening there came up a light Thunder-shower, by
							which the atmosphere was much cooled and refreshed.</p>

						<p><date>26. IV:30.</date> A cool and pleasant day; but in attempting to
							write, I found in the language of the <persRef ref="mccormick-andrew"
								>Preacher</persRef>, brought yesterday to my attention; that “the
							keepers of the house trembled, more than ever[”]— It was with the utmost
							difficulty that I could write at-all. I find nothing so trying to my
							Constitution as the excessive heats of this climate. I bathed with
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> in the river, and
							found this morning on the right side of the Bridge a place better than
							any that I have yet used. <persRef ref="hickey-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hickey</persRef> came here this
							morning with a subscription book for Building a second Roman Catholic
							Church in this City. I went late to my Office, because the Morning bath
							taking nearly two hours of time, I am obliged to allow them after
							breakfast for the Diary— I was without interruption from visitors at the
							Office, with the exception of a <persRef ref="howell-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Howell</persRef> of Rhode-Island; a
							son of <persRef ref="howell-david">the District Judge</persRef> there,
							and a Candidate for employment as a Clerk in any of the public Offices.
							He was introduced to me by <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef>, who told me that
								<persRef ref="morton-marcus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Morton</persRef> left the City to return home this Morning. I was
							employed in drafting Instructions for <persRef ref="middleton-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton</persRef>, and upon
							the special object of his Mission; the question between the United
							States and Great-Britain, upon the Construction of the first Article of
							the Treaty of Ghent; concerning Slaves and other private property: as
							usual for the preparation of almost all instructions, there was a
							considerable number of papers, which I was obliged to look up, and
							peruse; so that I wrote very little of the draft— It is a singular, and
							I apprehend will prove a very difficult and delicate negotiation— During
							the late War, the British Naval Officers stationed in our waters, and
							who landed on our shores, received all the runaway Slaves who could
							escape to them, and issued proclamations inviting them to join them.
							They enlisted numbers of them among their troops, and formed one or two
							regiments of them— They also took numbers of them prisoners in their
							predatory excursions into the Country. At the conclusion of the Treaty
							of Peace, the British Plenipotentiaries agreed to the Article
							stipulating for the restoration of all places taken, without carrying
							away any of the artillery or other property originally taken in them and
							remaining in them at the time of the exchange of ratifications, or any
							slaves or other private property. Notwithstanding this they actually
							carried away many hundred Slaves; and great numbers of them within the
							whole description applied by the Article to public property—namely
							Slaves who had not been removed from the places where they were
							originally taken. When <persRef ref="cochrane-alexander">Sir Alexander
								Cochrane</persRef>, and <persRef ref="cockburn-george">Admiral
								Cockburn</persRef> were called upon after the Peace to carry this
							Article into effect, they found it obliged them to restore to their
							Masters, Slaves whom they had enticed away from them by promises <pb
								type="ms" n="379"/>of Freedom. They therefore set forth a violent
							and unnatural Construction of the Article to avoid compliance with it,
							refused to restore the Slaves, and with a very few exceptions carried
							them all away— Their pretence was that the clause, limiting the promise
							not to carry away <hi rend="italic">public</hi> property, to such as
							should have been in the places taken when captured, and remain there at
							the ratification of the Treaty, must be extended also to Slaves and
							other private property— They changed altogether the terms of the
							Article, to give it this Construction, and the British Government have
							persisted in it— After a thorough discussion of the subject; first
							between the Commissioners who were sent by the American Government to
							receive the Slaves, and the British Officers who refused to restore
							them; next between <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Monroe</persRef> when Secretary of State, and <persRef
								ref="baker-anthony">Anthony S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John
								Baker</persRef>, the British Chargé d’Affaires, and finally between
							me and the Lords <persRef ref="jenkinson-robert">Liverpool</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Bathurst</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Castlereagh</persRef> in England, each
							party adhering to its own Construction of the Article, a proposal was
							made on our part that the question should be submitted to the decision
							of some friendly Sovereign or State— To this the British Government
							after a delay of two years assented, and it was stipulated by the fifth
							Article of the Convention of 20. October 1818— It has since been agreed
							that the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef> should
							be the Umpire— This reference of a question upon the construction of an
							Article of a Treaty to a third party is unusual, but not unexampled;
							though there is something whimsical in the idea that the United-States
							and Great-Britain, both speaking English, should go to the Slavonian
							Czar of Muscovy, to find out their own meaning in a sentence written by
							themselves in the language common to them both— The question is one
							however, not of language, but of Grammar, or rather there is no question
							at-all: in strictness of grammar the sentence admits of no other
							construction than that for which we contend— In the looseness of common
							discourse the whole sentence might be carelessly spoken, with the
							meaning for which the British insist, but not without a solecism— The
							plain truth as I believe it is that the British Plenipotentiaries at
							Ghent, and their Government agreed to it without reflecting upon what
							they promised by it— The stipulation was perfectly just and proper, and
							their difficulty about carrying it into execution arose from the
							preceding wrong of their own Officers in enticing away the Slaves by
							promises of Freedom. This reference of the question, is a sort of
							drawing lots for the event— It gives us one more chance for Justice— I
							made an attempt this Evening to proceed in the projected sketch of a
							manual for the Department; but without success. I found writing too
							irksome— This day was the full Harvest Moon.</p>

						<p><date>28. V:</date> After a race of five Months, I have once more
							redeemed the arrears of this Diary, and am writing, the morning of the
							day here noted— I bathed with <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> before breakfast in the Potowmack; at the place
							last discovered; which is preferable to any of the others. <persRef
								ref="hickey-william">Hickey</persRef> called here for an Answer to
								<persRef ref="edwards-james">James L. Edwards’s</persRef> Letter— I
							desired him to tell Edwards that I thought he had not dealt fairly with

							the purchase of the house was concluded— That now, if he could make any
							arrangement to replace me in the situation I was in before the bargain
							was concluded I should prefer it to every thing else— And if he could
							not, I wished him to send me a draft of such a lease as he was willing
							to sign; and I would <pb type="ms" n="380"/>accept or decline it. Rode
							to the Office. <persRef ref="middleton-arthur">Arthur
								Middleton</persRef> came for a paper which I had promised him being
							a copy of the ordinance of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor of
								Russia</persRef> concerning the privileges of foreign Ministers at
							his Court, for the admission of articles free from duties. This paper
							had been transmitted to the Department by <persRef ref="pinkney-william"
								>William Pinkney</persRef> when he was at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Petersburg. Last week I had promised a copy of it to
							Middleton who wanted it for <persRef ref="middleton-henry">his
								father,</persRef> and desired <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> the chief Clerk to
							look it up— The next day when Middleton came for it, Brent told me that
							it could not be found— Certain as I was of the existence of the paper, I
							requested that a more earnest search should be made for it; but when
							Middleton came this Morning, it was still not to be found. I was then
							obliged to overhaul the whole of Pinkney’s Correspondence myself and
							after a search of an hour or more found the paper. This happens to me
							almost every week, and is among the strongest trials of my Patience— It
							results from the want of a regular method of keeping the Papers; or in
							other words from a defective organization of the Department. I was yet
							engaged the remnant of the Office hours in preparing the Instructions
							for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton, and particularly in
							reviewing our controversy with Great-Britain upon the Construction of
							the first Article of the Treaty of Ghent— I found upon re-examination of
							the British arguments that they had not been all replied to— Some of
							them are so weak and sophistical that one feels ashamed to answer them;
							others are plausible and insidious; and there is a tone of dogmatism in
							these, as in most others of the State Papers of the British Cabinet,
							which seems to say, if you will take this for reason, well and good—if
							not you must put up with it as you can—and take it for our will. Stat
							pro ratione voluntas. As I proceed with the draft of the Instructions I
							find much to say, and views of the question of a delicate nature, but
							which I believe must be presented to the Emperor— The Article as it
							stands is not susceptible of a question, and the British cannot make
							one, without a perversion of the plainest rules of Grammar— The real
							state of the case was that the British agreed to the Article, without
							considering what it bound them to— They had carried on a dishonourable
							war by stealing, and debauching Slaves, under promises of Freedom— They
							signed the Article promising to carry away no Slaves, without adverting
							to its operation upon their previous promises to the Slaves, and when
							summoned to perform their engagement they endeavoured to escape from it
							by prevarication— Now all this must be made manifest to the Emperor
							Alexander, and the unprincipled character of the war as carried on by
							the British must be thoroughly disclosed. How and at what time to do
							this will be a consideration requiring great discretion and
							dexterity—but the Instructions to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Middleton ought to lay open the subject to the bottom. I wrote till
							five, and suppose I have yet at least three days more of work upon this
							draft before it can be finished— We had visitors this evening, Mess<hi

								>Charles</persRef> having heated himself in a shooting chace, and
							declined going with me— It was seven O’Clock when I left home and I
							found the tide not more than half-risen— At the Office there came a
								<persRef ref="legris-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Le
								Gris</persRef> a Frenchman, from New-Orleans, not a Citizen of the
							United States, but having resided within them more than two years and
							therefore entitled to take out Patents. He had obtained a certificate
							from the Patent-Office, that he had deposited claims there to several
							inventions for which Patents would be issued on payment of 30. dollars
							for each of them into the Treasury—but he said they had given him this
							certificate only for about thirty inventions, and he had upwards of a
							hundred and fifty more, for which he wished to obtain the same document
							but it was refused him— He had not money to pay for these Patents at
							present, but he wished to secure the right to them, and then to
							advertise them, by which he hoped to raise the money necessary to pay
							the Treasury fees— I asked him if all these inventions were his
							own?—every one—was he prepared to affirm this upon Oath?—yes— Then he
							had only to deposit at the Patent Office a specification of each
							invention, and they would give him there a certificate for the 150 like
							that which they had given him for the thirty. He went off apparently
							quite satisfied— As I was short of time for the preparation of <persRef
								ref="middleton-henry">H. Middleton’s</persRef> Instructions, I could
							not indulge my curiosity by enquiries what the inventions of this Genius
							were who breeds new discoveries, by multitudes like the spawning of
							fish. I was much engaged upon Middleton’s Instructions, without being
							able to finish them— The day was intensely hot. <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> at 94. and I
							rode to and from the Office— The Sun blazed the whole day from a
							cloudless sky, and when evening came it was with a breathless calm,
							scarcely more supportable than the fervour of noon day. I could not
							write in the Evening.</p>

						<!-- This is a summary entry without a date.-->
						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> Resembles in its general character that of the last
							Month— The range of my rising hour has been from III:45 to VI:30— The
							average IV:53. Having very steadily begun the day by writing in this
							Journal, I have redeemed its arrears, and am now keeping with the
							current of the time— The <persRef ref="titus">Emperor Titus</persRef>
							after passing a day in which he recollected no good deed, said he had
							lost a day— Enquiring upon self-examination how many days of my life
							have passed which I could with a clear Conscience say I had not lost,
							another question occurs of what may properly be termed doing good. In
							the instance of the Emperor Titus, I suppose it meant acts of
							beneficence to individuals; the objects and the means for which could
							not fail to recur every day to a Roman Emperor. To a person in private
							life, the object must occasionally and the means often fail— In my
							station it is a constant source of mortification that the disproportion
							of the means is so great to that of the objects— But good offices, and
							kindness to individuals are but a single branch of the duties of doing
							good. In the relations of domestic life, and in those of neighbourhood
							there are continual occasions for doing good or evil— In public life it
							is doing good to serve one’s Country— And Genius has always the means of
							doing good to all mankind. I have always considered it my duty to do
							good to the utmost of my power; but in the selection and employment of
							the means of doing it, I have not been successful according to my
							wishes. It must be inspiration from above.</p>
