						<p><date>1. V:</date> Monday. There was a meeting this morning of the
							members of the Administration at the President’s—all present excepting
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef> who has not yet returned from Richmond. The substance
							of my conference with <persRef ref="vives-don">Vivés</persRef> on
							Saturday was reported, and the draft of my note was considered and
							approved— The general opinion was that the remaining, and the new
							obstacle to the conclusion of the Treaty were both insuperable, but
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> was
							apparently not pleased that the other difficulties were removed, and
							especially that relating to the grants— The <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> also inclined to discredit the declaration of
							Vives that the grants had never formed a serious obstacle to the
							ratification by Spain. The secret of which is this—Of the failure of the
							Spanish Ratification, from the operations of human nature, the President
							is willing to credit that as the main cause which is least imputable to
							himself; and Crawford that which is most imputable to me. The most
							insidious and laborious efforts have been made in the public newspapers
							to represent the question of the grants as the only one that had
							prevented the ratification, and to cast the whole blame of it upon me—
							To me perhaps, as far as a question could be made on that Article, it
							was chiefly imputable— No question could fairly be made upon it. The
							language of the Article will not bear a question; nor when made is it
							susceptible of a fair argument. <persRef ref="onis-luis">Onis</persRef>
							attempted none— None has been attempted in Spain; and Vives is ashamed
							to speak of it— Yet I cannot acquit myself in suffering the date of 24.
							January 1818 to pass, and not insisting upon having it put back some
							Months, sufficient to have prevented even the possibility of the
							question. It was an inadvertence; and although I am now satisfied that
							the Ratification would have been withheld for the other causes, and that
							this has had no operation upon the case, yet I cannot escape the
							consciousness of that inadvertence— Now neither the President nor
							Crawford can with a very good grace, lay the charge of this inadvertence
							upon me—for the Article in all its varieties was submitted to them time
							after time before it was signed. They knew of the grants all that I did—
							The mere question of the date was one which they were as much bound to
							perceive as I was. The inadvertence was theirs as much as mine; but in
							the eyes of the world the sole responsibility of it rests upon me— Now
							the other causes of the Spanish refusal to ratify are imputable entirely
							to the President— The proposal to Great-Britain, jointly to recognize
							Buenos-Ayres—the appointment of <persRef ref="bland-theoderick">Judge
								Bland</persRef>— The omission to issue a proclamation last Summer
							against <persRef ref="long-james">Long’s</persRef> expedition into
							Texas, and the strong leaning to South-American Independence in the
							messages to Congress, are the real Causes, and it is not surprizing that
							when they are alledged, the President should prefer looking to the
							question about the grants— Crawford wishes the whole Negotiation to
							fail, but as his State of Georgia, is among the most deeply interested
							in our obtaining possession of Florida, he disavows perhaps even to
							himself, and only betrays himself occasionally to others his feelings—
							As he wishes it to fail, so he most especially wishes its failure to be
							imputable solely to me, and he therefore sees with reluctance the
							abandonment by Spain of the question about the grants— He made so light
							this morning of this abandonment, that <persRef ref="thompson-smith"
								>Thompson</persRef> the Secretary of the Navy noticed it— He said he
							thought it was an important point gained— That many persons had supposed
							the grants formed the only difficulty—that many supposed the Article as
							it stands, confirmed the grants— To have the question upon the
							ratification placed on the single ground of our refusal to stipulate,
							that we would not recognize the South Americans, was the strongest case
							which could possibly be made on our side; because it was a point upon
							which we should have the popular feeling and opinion unanimously with
							us— Crawford did not press his observations in reply to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson. He presses nothing farther than
							it will bear— It was agreed that I should see Vivés again; shew him my
							Note unsigned, and offer to make any alteration or addition to it which
							he might desire, and to which I could with propriety accede— From the
							President’s I went to my Office and immediately sent for Vivés— I read
							to him the draft of a Letter as now prepared, with which he was not
							altogether satisfied— He suggested that there was one point upon which
							nothing was said in my note—which was the promise that if the Treaty
							should be ratified the Spanish territory on our borders should be
							respected— It was indeed substantially said, and the omission to say it
							explicitly had not been intentional— I readily agreed to add a paragraph
							such as he desired. He objected to a passage in which I had referred to
							his explicit admission that the grants to <persRef ref="alagon-unknown"
								>Alagon</persRef>, <persRef ref="punonrostro">Punon Rostro</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="vargas-pedro">Vargas</persRef> were null and void, at
							the signature of the Treaty— He said that he had then been speaking in
							his <pb type="ms" n="325"/>individual capacity and not as Minister of
							Spain— I observed that it had been made a question between the two
							Governments; that his admission if confined to his individual capacity
							was of no use to remove the difficulty, that it was no more than his
							predecessor Onis had admitted in an official Note; that it was a point
							merely of good faith which concerned the honour of Spain, and that as it
							was not intended by Spain to persist in making a point of it, I could
							see no reason, why it should not be abandoned at once— Why, said he—in a
							hesitating manner, apparently ashamed of himself for saying it—All
							grants after the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January 1818. are
							declared null and void—does it not follow that all grants of a prior
							date are confirmed?— I then shewed him an original copy of the
							Treaty—read over with him the eighth Article in Spanish; and compared
							with it Onis’s original Letter of 16. November 1818. from all which it
							is utterly impossible to mistake the meaning of the Article.— He had not
							a word of reply, on the argument, but appeared to be very uneasy that
							his admission of the nullity of the grants was to be made public by my
							note— He said he had told me the grants were null and void— As a man of
							honour he would not deny what he had said; but he was afraid he had been
							too quick in making the concession—that his Government might disapprove
							it, and he had not expected that I should refer to it in a Note— I had
							said some things myself in our Conference on Saturday, which he should
							never think of referring to, in a Note— I instantly assumed a tone as
							stern and peremptory as I could use and said—General! put into a Note if
							you please, every word that I said to you on Saturday—that I ever said,
							or ever shall say to you— What he alluded to was a stress that I had
							laid upon the system of neutrality between Spain and the
							South-Americans, which has been avowed and maintained by the Government
							of the United States— I told him that we considered neutrality as
							forbidding, any act which would be taking either side in the War— That
							when two years ago we had made the proposal to Great-Britain and France
							to recognize the Independence of Buenos-Ayres, it was at a time when
							Onis had declared he could not under his instructions comply with our
							proposals, and we had no prospect of concluding with him— That the
							Resolution then proposed in Congress tending to the recognition had been
							opposed by the friends of the Administration; and its renewal lately had
							met no countenance from them— The tendency of these remarks was to the
							inference that in case of the ratification of the Treaty, the Government
							of the United States probably would not precipitately recognize the
							Independence of the South-Americans; and Vives now supposed I should be
							unwilling to have these remarks publicly known. Finding however that I
							had no fears of that sort, he adverted to the revolution in the
							Government of Spain, confirmative information of which was received by
							yesterday’s mail— It comes from the Havanna, where the <persRef
								ref="cajigal-juan">Governor</persRef> had published the account of
							it, brought by a vessel from Corunna. He told me he had no doubt of its
							authenticity; and said that after such a change he could not until he
							should receive new Instructions promise any thing, but subject to the
							limitation of the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">king’s</persRef> power.—
							I finally told him that I would send him my note, unsigned, and would
							ask him to send me a draft of his answer, likewise unsigned, after which
							we could meet and mutually agree upon passages to be altered or omitted;
							so that both the note and the answer might be satisfactory to both sides
							as far as we could make it so—to which he agreed— The result of this
							conference was a conviction in my mind, that it would be necessary to
							strengthen my note a little. <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de Neuville</persRef> came to my
							house this Evening— I told him General Vives had been much less explicit
							and candid at the conference of this day, than at that of Saturday— He
							had shewn even an inclination to retract what he had then said— His
							declaration of his own personal satisfaction upon <hi rend="italic"
								>all</hi> the points of explanation, was much feebler, and catching
							at qualifications; the expression of his belief that his Government
							would be satisfied and would immediately ratify the Treaty, more dubious
							and hesitating; and his apparent apprehension of the effect of the
							Revolution in Spain much greater than it was then— My note would propose
							to him that he should give the positive promise of immediate
							ratification which by his note of 19. April, he had declared he was
							authorized to give, and would offer to accept it so far as the President
							could accept it: that is so far as to submit the question to the Senate,
							for their advice and consent, whether under these circumstances the
							ratification of Spain, should be accepted for that of the United States
							heretofore given— But it was now evident Vives would not give even that
							unconditional promise— We could not possibly go further, and the whole
							Correspondence must be communicated to Congress— I mentioned to him my
							agreement with Vives, to send him an unsigned Note, and receive from him
							an <pb type="ms" n="326"/>unsigned answer, to be altered or modified, as
							we could make them mutually most accommodating— This proposal to accept
							the unconditional promise of Vivés, had occurred to me as a last effort
							to close the Negotiation. The President hesitated, from an apprehension
							that the Senate would not give their advice upon such a promise, after
							having once given it for the ratification— They would not act again
							without the positive ratification of Spain, being first given— I urged
							however, first, that Vives would probably not accept the proposal, in
							which case we shall upon the rupture have all the advantage of having
							offered it—and secondly that if he should accept it the Senate should
							they decline acting upon it would make or give an occasion for
							postponement allowing time for the Spanish ratification to come. On
							these suggestions the President assented to my making this last offer.
							But I observed to de Neuville that it was very extraordinary that Vives
							should here deny his having power to give us possession of Florida,
							after having told <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef ref="pasquier-etienne"
								>Baron Pasquier</persRef> at Paris, that he had such a power. De
							Neuville hinted that Vives had passed through London as well as Paris,
							on his way here, and had seen <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef> as well as Baron Pasquier— This was mere
							conjecture, and it is part of de Neuville’s policy to stir up embers
							between us and England. He told me that Pasquier had written the same
							information to him. On the whole de Neuville said he hoped Vives would
							yet be able to make with us a satisfactory arrangement.</p>

						<p><date>2. V:15.</date><persRef ref="cook-daniel">D. P. Cook</persRef>, the
							Representative in Congress from the State of Illinois, and <persRef
								ref="fuller-timothy">T. Fuller</persRef> one of the members from
							Massachusetts successively called at my house this Morning. I returned
							to Cook a Letter from <persRef ref="pope-nathaniel">N. Pope</persRef>
							the District Judge of Illinois, which he had some days since sent me— At
							the first election for Congress after the admission of Illinois as a
							State, Cook was a Candidate and lost the election by a few votes; at the
							next election Cook carried it by a small majority— <persRef
								ref="mclean-john">M’Lean</persRef> was both times his competitor,
							and lost the election for the present Congress in consequence of voting
							on the Slavery side of the Missouri question at the last Session. The
							election for the next Congress comes on in August, and a person by the
							name of <persRef ref="kane-elias">Kane</persRef> is to be Cook’s
							competitor. Popes Letter speculates upon the Election, and seems
							distrustful of the result— It shews how industriously <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> is working there as
							well as in every other part of the Union, by the means of his
							appointments, to promote his own future views, and says explicitly that
							if I have any future expectations, I must interfere directly with the
							appointments— <persRef ref="pope-john">John Pope</persRef> wrote much
							the same thing two years ago from Kentucky. I have hitherto scarcely
							interfered with any appointments; and in no instance with a view to
							provide for a political partizan— At this game I have perfect
							demonstration that Crawford is an overmatch for me— Fuller gave me
							further confirmation of it, by assuring me that the State of Maine was
							sold to Crawford— Sold he said; not for money, but for objects quite as
							mercenary— He asked me whether as the Slave-holder was buying up
							auxiliaries in our camp, some assistance against him could not be drawn
							from his side— How <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> and
							South-Carolina were disposed? I told him, that of Calhoun’s dispositions
							I knew nothing— In South Carolina there would be a party opposed to
							Crawford, though both the Senators from that State will be in his
							favour— There is also in his own State of Georgia, a strong party
							against him, at the head of which is the present <persRef
								ref="clarke-john2">Governor</persRef>— And in Tennessee, all the
							friends of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>— I
							added that Crawford’s present reliance was chiefly upon Virginia, and
							New-York— Virginia will support him, because he is a native of the
							State; and he has hopes from New-York by means of some of the delegation
							from that State— I know not exactly whom— But he expects to rise there,
							by the fall of <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">Clinton</persRef>— Fuller
							said it was apparent that preparations were making for a violent canvass
							for the Presidential election of 1824— I said there had been scarcely
							any thing but such canvassing since 1816— He said he hoped I did not
							intend to withhold myself from the contest— I told him the principle of
							my life had been never to ask the suffrage of my Country, and never to
							shrink from its call— If life, and health, and private circumstances
							admitting of it, and a belief of competency to the Station, not inferior
							to others, who may be competitors for it should be mine, after the
							vicissitudes of the next four years, I shall adhere to the principle
							upon which I have always acted— Whether any portion of the Country will
							think of calling for my services, will certainly depend upon the series
							of future events— I know the disadvantages on which I now stand, and am
							conscious of my inability to make interest by caballing, bargaining,
							place-giving, or tampering with members of Congress— I have been here,
							three Sessions, with a Colleague in the Executive Administration, who at
							the <pb type="ms" n="327"/>Caucus preceding the last presidential
							election was a candidate against <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>, and came very near
							outvoting him— Who considers himself therefore as quite entitled to the
							succession; who as a Virginian-born is sure of the support of that State
							against any one, not of the same origin; as a Slave-holder has the first
							pledge of votes from the South and Southwest, and possesses an immense
							patronage throughout the Union, which he exercises to promote his
							purposes, without scruple, and without restraint— At the same time the
								<persRef key="clay-henry">Speaker of the House of
								Representatives</persRef>, a very popular man and Speaker, a
							disappointed rival, openly avowed as a political opponent to me, and
							exercising against me both publicly and insidiously all his influence;
							while I had scarcely a single friend personal or political, in the
							house, and at the first Session after I came here not ten members, with
							whom I had any acquaintance at all— Then it was contrived to raise a
							question of etiquette between the Senators and me, and between the wives
							of members of Congress and mine: a device despicable enough in itself,
							but which had produced its effect perhaps upon one third of the members
							of both houses— In the course of three Sessions, I have formed slight
							personal acquaintances, with most of the members, but have had neither
							time nor opportunity to become intimate with any of them. My means of
							acquiring personal adherents therefore are nothing. Upon the foundation
							of public service alone must I stand; and when the Nation shall be
							called to judge of that, by the result, whatever it may be, I must
							abide. Were it in my power I would sink in oblivion the very idea of a
							Presidential election in 1824—but forget it as I might, it would be ever
							present to the minds of my adversaries. The three Sessions of Congress
							have been three wrestling matches to bring me down by the ruin of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s administration— The first and
							second attempts failed— That of the present Session has been favoured by
							Circumstances— The Missouri question is indeed a flaming sword that
							waves round on all sides, and cuts in every direction; but the baseness
							of the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">King of Spain</persRef>, has played
							the game into the hands of Clay; and that which at the close of the last
							Session appeared to be the most fortunate of Events to me, is now the
							most powerful engine wielded against me. In Congress and in the Nation
							the most indefatigable efforts are made, to represent me as singly and
							exclusively responsible for every thing that can be exhibited as odious,
							unpopular or unsuccessful in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s
							Administration; and efforts not less laborious are made whenever any
							thing prosperous or popular occurs, to deprive me even of my portion of
							it— This cabalistic influence is of itself sufficient eventually to put
							me down— May the blessed Disposer of Events shield me from the calamity
							of contributing to the same event, by misconduct or incapacity of my
							own!— Fuller told me that he should wish to have another conversation
							with me before the close of the Session, to which I agreed— I called at
							the President’s and reported to him the substance of my conferences
							yesterday with <persRef ref="vives-don">Vives</persRef>, and with
								<persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Hyde de Neuville</persRef>—
							Told him it was now certain that we could conclude nothing with Vives,
							and shewed him an additional paragraph which I thought necessary to
							close my Note— He approved it, but requested me to shew it to the other
							members of the Administration. While I was at the President’s <persRef
								ref="lowndes-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowndes</persRef> and <persRef ref="holmes-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes</persRef> came there, and the
							President called them in, and conversed with them, in my persence
							concerning our relations with Spain. He told them the correspondence
							with Vives would be sent to Congress in a few days; probably next
							Saturday. He intimated the probability that he should recommend an Act
							to authorise the occupation of Florida— Holmes declared himself willing
							to support that measure, and Lowndes considered himself already pledged
							to the same course. He thought however that the Session being so near
							its close, it would be very difficult to get it through Congress. He was
							also of opinion that the late change in the Spanish Government would
							dispose many of the members to postpone every measure of hostility;
							though it might incline others to more decisive promptitude— Going from
							the Presidents I called at the Office of the <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>
							and shewed him the additional paragraph prepared for my note to Vives—
							He approved it, but expressed again his regret that so much of the
							difference between us and Spain had been removed by the personal
							conferences between me and Vives. He was apprehensive that seeing us so
							near agreed, Congress would be less disposed to adopt vigorous measures,
							and thought that if my Note as prepared before the conferences had been
							sent and the correspondence then communicated to Congress they would
							immediately have passed an act for the occupation of Florida— Whether
							they would now was more doubtful; and he took it for granted that unless
							the present <pb type="ms" n="328"/>moment should be seized we should
							never get Florida but by War— With this opinion I concur; but not in the
							theory that the more causes of rupture we should keep open the more
							ready would congress be for decision. If we had avoided the last attempt
							to come to an agreement, we should have been chargeable with
							precipitation, and with premeditated aggression. By reducing the
							subjects of difference to a single point; and that a point upon which we
							have the unanimous support of this Country; by proving upon all the rest
							that we go the utmost possible length consistent with principle, to
							avoid a rupture, seems to me the truest policy, and makes the best case
							for Congress to act upon with energy— After returning to my Office I
							sent to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun and <persRef
								ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> requesting them to call as they should be going
							home which they did— They approved the additional paragraph to my note—

							and dismissed for misconduct came again to my Office, attempted again to
							exculpate himself, and solicited to be restored to the appointment. The
							reasons which he assigned for his conduct were quite inadequate to his
							justification. He had been charged with extorting unlawful fees in his
							Consular capacity; for which he had nothing to alledge, but that he had
							followed the example of the Consuls at Gibraltar and Lisbon. He had sent
							blank Commissions for privateering from Buenos-Ayres to this Country;
							stipulating that the prizes should be sent to Buenos-Ayres, consigned to
							him, with a Commission for him of 5 per Cent upon the Sales. He had gone
							over to <persRef ref="artigas-jose">Artigas</persRef>; bought blank
							privateering Commissions of him, and sold them at Buenos-Ayres in
							violation of the Laws of the place— He had once been ordered to quit
							Buenos-Ayres within 24. hours by the <persRef ref="pueyrredon-juan"
								>Supreme Director Pueyrredon</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="deforest-david">De Forrest</persRef> came with a positive

							only to say that he thought it accorded with the views of this

							been suffered to build armed ships here, and send them to Buenos-Ayres;
							because there had been so many armaments from Baltimore, under the eye
							of the Government which had not been prevented; and because <persRef
								ref="carrera-j">Carrera</persRef> had been particularly assisted
							from this Country. I told him that nothing of this was justification for
							him— The Government had never in any of those cases either sanctioned or

							brought to me at the Office an unsigned note from <persRef
								ref="vives-don">General Vives</persRef> in answer to <pb type="ms"
								n="329"/>mine of yesterday; we read them over together, and then
							recurred to passages the omission of which might be desirable on one
							side or the other— It was immediately apparent that Vives had introduced
							several passages in his Note with the expectation that they would be
							obnoxious to me, and with the view to make the omission of them a
							condition, upon that of the passages in my note, which asserted his
							explicit admission that the grants to <persRef ref="alagon-unknown"
								>Alagon</persRef>, <persRef ref="punonrostro">Puñon Rostro</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="vargas-pedro">Vargas</persRef> were null and void at
							the time when the treaty was signed.— His solicitude for the
							disappearance of these passages, more strongly convinced me of the
							necessity of retaining them; for although his note, fell far short of
							his assurances in the first conference, of his personal satisfaction
							upon all the points of explanation, and of his entire belief that
								<persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">the king</persRef> would be satisfied
							upon the only one which had not entirely met his expectations, yet there
							was nothing in his draft which could produce any material ill-effect,
							and although it attempted to weaken the effect of his concession
							respecting the grants, it could not remove the impression which it must
							produce on the public mind— He admits having given it as his private
							opinion that the grants would be null and void from the inablility of
							the grantees to fulfil their conditions— The fact was in the conference
							that he said it was impossible the grants should be valid. That the
							conditions essential to them neither had been nor could be fulfilled by
							the grantees, nor did he give it as his private opinion, but as an
							absolute and indisputable fact—though in another part of the
							Conversation, and upon another subject he did say that he was willing to
							set aside his official character and speak with the freedom of private
							conversation— In the draft of his Note, he declines answering that part
							of mine which demonstrates the nullity of the grants upon the face of
							the Article as it stands, by observing that this has never been with
							Spain a <hi rend="italic">principal</hi> obstacle to the ratification,
							and that she would readily assent to the nullity of the grants, <hi
								rend="italic">if</hi>, the king should be satisfied with the
							explanations relating to the non-recognition of the South-American
							Independence. I told De Neuville, that if General Vives would in his
							Note explicitly and unconditionally abandon the question about the
							grants, I would omit from mine every allusion in mine to what he had
							said of them to me, in conference— De Neuville took great pains to
							convince me that the grants were unconditionally abandoned in the draft
							of Vives; and pointed to a particular passage where he says he hopes the
							king will be satisfied upon the <hi rend="italic">single</hi> point
							remaining unadjusted between us— I replied that in the second Conference
							Vives had told me that this single point left open, raised another;
							namely that about the grants, and that was the reason why he was so
							anxious to take back his concession concerning them— He was ashamed to
							discuss this point, and yet wanted to use it as a make-weight in
							negotiation— But the question upon the grants was merely a question of
							good or bad faith in Spain— The question about South-America was a
							distinct object of Negotiation for assent or denial— I would not permit
							one of these points to be made conditional upon the result of the
							others— Good faith was not to be made an affair of barter for an
							equivalent— De Neuville then proposed several turns of phrase for
							Vives’s Note, seeming to abandon the grants, and masking the idea of the
							condition; and asked me if I would be satisfied with it so— I told him
							at last, that General Vives might modify that part of his Note as he
							pleased; I should certainly see, whether his abandonment of the grants
							is explicit or conditional— If explicit, I will omit from my Note all
							reference to what passed between us in Conference; but if conditional,
							whatever effort he may make to veil the condition, I shall see through
							it, and shall leave the appeal to his own consciousness of what he said
							to me in Conference as it is in my unsigned draft— There was another
							insidious passage in the Note of Vives— After observing that the
							explanations on the South American point were not such as he had been
							authorised to accept as satisfactory, he says he shall nevertheless
							report to the king the verbal discussion which he had with me concerning
							it, and add suggestions of his own which he believed would induce his
							Government to accept them, and to ratify the Treaty— De Neuville said he
							had told Vives that he ought to omit that reference to our verbal
							discussions; but I expressed no particular desire that it should be
							omitted. I told him I had said nothing in Conference but what I was
							willing he should put into the Note, but this reference to it in general
							terms without specifying what I had said <pb type="ms" n="330"/>might
							excite suspicions that I had given him private promises different from
							the tenour of my public notes— I should prefer that he would
							particularly specify what I had said to him, as I had done with him in
							the reference to the concession about the grants. De Neuville then left
							me taking with him both the Notes, to ascertain what Vives would
							determine— The passages were marked in both Notes which I was willing to
							omit, and would if omitted shorten mine by more than one half.</p>

						<p><date>5. V:45.</date><persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de Neuville</persRef> called this
							morning at my house, with the two unsigned Notes; that of <persRef
								ref="vives-don">General Vives</persRef> in a new and fair copy,
							varied in one point materially from that of yesterday, by asserting that
							I had told him in Conference, that if necessary, new laws should be made
							to secure respect for the Spanish Territory— With respect to the
							passages which we had yesterday marked for omission, Vives consented to
							omit them all; but could not consent to abandon unconditionally the
							question about the grants— It must be subject to <persRef
								ref="ferdinand-vii">the King’s</persRef> accepting as satisfactory
							the explanations concerning South-America— I then said with more temper
							in the manner than I could justify to myself afterwards, that I should
							not omit the reference to what Vives had told me of the nullity of the
							Grants, for if Spain would make fair dealing an Article of Negotiation,
							her conduct must be exposed to the world in all its nakedness— I added
							that Vives could have no possible motive for this pertinacity, after his
							admissions, but positive instructions; and those instructions must have
							been given with the determination that he should conclude nothing. I was
							yet willing to omit the other passages in the two Notes which we had
							marked, but De Neuville said unless I would consent to leave out the
							reference to the acknowledgment of Vives that the grants were null and
							void, he would prefer leaving both Notes as they were— To this I
							assented; but observed that I had not promised General Vives that new
							Laws, should in any case be enacted— I had told him that whenever the
							existing laws had been found by experience inefficient for the
							preservation of our neutrality, new Laws <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been
							enacted— I could not promise that new Laws would be enacted, for that
							depended upon the Legislature— I then asked him what Vives said of his
							declarations to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef ref="pasquier-etienne"
								>Baron Pasquier</persRef> at Paris, that he was authorised to make
							an arrangement with us, to give us possession of Florida, without
							waiting for the ratification of the Treaty: “He says you may print
							whatever you please—that he never told either Baron Pasquier or M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin any such thing”— De Neuville then
							added that he was convinced Vives had not said so. That Pasquier in his
							despatch to him, had only said <hi rend="italic">he had reason to
								believe</hi> Vives possessed this power; not giving it as positive—
							And that Vives had shewn him the minutes of his own journal, taken down
							at the time, immediately after his conversations with Pasquier, and in
							which nothing like such an assertion of Vives appears— De Neuville
							farther said he supposed, it was all a misunderstanding which originated
							with the <persRef ref="delosrios-carlos">Duke of Fernan Nuñez,</persRef> the
							Spanish Ambassador at Paris— That he had upon mere conjecture intimated
							to Pasquier and Gallatin that probably Vives had such a power, and that
							Pasquier and Gallatin taking it for granted, had spoken of it in general
							terms to Vives, to which he also in general terms had assented— I
							observed that this was scarcely possible, and was quite irreconcileable
							with Gallatin’s Letter. The assertions of this are—first that
							Fernan-Nuñez, told him that Vives was authorised to give a satisfactory
							pledge for the ratification. Secondly that Vives afterwards confirmed
							this to Gallatin, and told him the security consisted in giving us
							possession of Florida without waiting for the ratification— Thirdly that
							Vives gave the same information to Baron Pasquier, at a separate
							interview, when Gallatin was not present— Fourthly that Gallatin had a
							subsequent interview with Pasquier, at which they both agreed in their
							understanding of what Vives had separately said to them; and in the
							importance of its being immediately made known to the Government of the
							United States— De Neuville said that notwithstanding all this he was
							convinced it had been a misunderstanding; and so it certainly may have
							been. De Neuville left my own note with me, and took back that of Vives
							to him, for his decision whether the marked passages, other than that
							upon the grants should be struck out or retained— I expected Vives
							himself all the morning at the Office but as he did not come; near four
							O’Clock I went over to the President’s, to report <persRef
								key="monroe-james">to him</persRef> what had passed between De
							Neuville and me; I met de Neuville, coming from Vives on the way, and he
							told me the General had concluded to pass the two Notes, as they were,
							without striking out any of the marked passages; as I adhered to that of
							his admission in the first conference that the grants were null and
							void— I made a full report to the President of the two interviews with
							De Neuville, and General Vives not appearing I signed, and sent him the
							note dated <pb type="ms" n="331"/>the third inst<hi rend="superscript"

							Madrid, by an American Consul who had embarked at Malaga, and sailed for
							the United States, in the brig “Edward Foster”—to which I gave no sort

							at Buenos-Ayres, as to his own— That I believed therefore it was quite
							out of the question that he should be sent there again— That my own
							opinion in the case was decisively made up; but that the decision would
							of course be made upon that of the President. They asked me, if I
							thought it probable the President would decide in favour of Halsey, if

							personally towards Halsey, I wished he might have the benefit of every

							that the President’s opinion would be changed in this case— They left

							not. Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs. </hi><persRef ref="dana-samuel"
								>Dana</persRef> and <persRef ref="otis-harrison">Otis</persRef>,
							Senators from Connecticut and Massachusetts, also called successively at
							the Office, upon private business of their own, and perhaps to ascertain
							the state of the Spanish Negotiation— Otis goes to-morrow or on Monday
							for Boston— I told him the Message would probably be sent in to Congress
							on Monday, and would recommend again the postponement of the subject
							until the next Session; upon the ground of the late change of Government
							in Spain— Otis intimated that the President had disclosed to individual
							members of Congress the actual state of the negotiation— This
							insinuation was perfectly characteristic in Otis. I told him that the
							President occasionally disclosed circumstances of negotiation to members
							of Congress, because he considered it safe and useful so to do, and
							sometimes to gratify their curiosity. I sometimes did the same thing,
							and perhaps with less discretion than the President; but many members of
							Congress had little scruple as to the time or character of their
							enquiries and it was better to tell them at once what could be told
							without material inconvenience, than to doubt the propriety of their
							enquiries, or to give them evasive answers. Otis himself has been as
							inquisitive as any one, and called two or three times within the week,
							at the Office, upon other affairs, to know exactly the phase of the
							political Planet— At one O’clock there was a meeting of the members of
							the Administration at the President’s— He had prepared the draft of a
							Message to Congress, to be sent with the Correspondence between me and
								<persRef ref="vives-don">Vives</persRef>; but he was undecided
							whether to conclude by recommending a law for the immediate occupation
							of Florida; or a Law giving a discretionary power for taking possession,
							in the event of the non-ratification by Spain—or a postponement of
							acting upon the subject until the next Session. He had drawn different
							concluding paragraphs corresponding to these different views— <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford’s</persRef> opinion was very decisive in favour of an
							immediate occupation; he said it was the last chance of obtaining the
							ratification of the Treaty—it would be completely justified by the
							conduct of Spain— If we should take possession now, the new Government
							of the Cortes finding us in possession, would consider it as an affair
							concluded before they came in to power, and would not object the Article
							of the Constitution against it— And if they should, we should have
							henceforth the advantage of negotiating with the object of negotiation
							in our own possession. But if we should not take possession now we
							should never hereafter obtain Florida, but by War— By an Article of the
							Spanish Constitution of 1812 to which <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">the
								King</persRef> has now sworn, he is expressly prohibited from
							alienating any <pb type="ms" n="332"/>portion of the Spanish territory
							however small, and by another Article the two Floridas are declared a
							part of the Spanish territory. There is no power given in the
							Constitution to the Cortes themselves to alienate the Spanish territory—
							They are to approve before ratification, Treaties offensive of alliance
							or subsidy, and special Treaties of Commerce, but the Constitution
							offers no lawful means of alienating Territory— If therefore when the
							Cortes assemble they find us already in possession, they will be glad to
							seize upon that incident to consider the whole affair as settled, and
							out of their competency, or if otherwise they will be too much engaged
							in affairs of more interest to themselves to go to War with us, at this
							moment, and we may indulge their scruples as to the right of negotiating
							as long as they please, holding in the meantime possession of the
							Country— In this opinion I concurred so far as to believe it
							indispensable that Congress should authorize the President to occupy the
							territory. Armed with this power, the President might give notice to the
							Spanish Government, that the ratification of the Treaty would yet be
							accepted, but that in any event the territory would be occupied. To the
							same opinion, <persRef ref="thompson-smith">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thompson</persRef> and <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> inclined. <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> was decidedly for recommending
							to Congress to postpone acting upon the subject till the next Session—
							His first argument was the want of time— Both houses have agreed to
							adjourn next Monday week, the 15<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>There is
							therefore only one week that they have to act; during which they will be
							excessively oppressed with other business— The members are all impatient
							to go home; many are already gone, and numbers will be falling off every
							day next week— Upon a measure so important as that of directing or
							authorizing an act of War, Congress will be extremely reluctant at
							acting at such a Stage of the Session; and even if there should be
							little debate a week is scarcely sufficient for a Bill to go through the
							ordinary forms in both houses— To this I replied that the mere
							convenience of the members of Congress ought to have no weight upon an
							occasion so important as this— It would be a public duty, which Congress
							must discharge, upon their own responsibility— If they have not time
							within the term upon which they have agreed for their adjournment, they
							can fix the close of the Session at a more distant day— Calhoun then
							said, that after the recent change in the Government of Spain, it would
							be impolitic, and quite contrary to the feelings of the People of this
							Country to begin by an act of hostility to them. It was very doubtful
							whether a majority in Congress would at any period of the Session, have
							authorized the occupation of Florida— He was convinced they would not
							take such a step now. The result of the recommendation would be
							therefore a disagreement between the Executive and the Legislature. The
							distressed situation of Spain had been suggested by the Message of 27
							March as a reason for postponing any decisive measure till the next
							Session—the same reason still continued, and the message might say
							something favourable of the recent revolution there, which would bespeak
							the good-will of those newly come into power— This became at once a
							leading idea— But it was observed that the distressed state of Spain was
							in mentioned in the Message of 27 March as a reason for delay, to wait
							for the arrival for the Minister who was to come for explanations—as it
							was supposed those circumstances might have delayed his departure; this
							could not now be assigned. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt recurred
							to the Message, and thought that the effect of the distress in delaying
							the departure of the Minister, was assigned distinctly as a separate
							reason from that of the distress itself. But I reminded him that when
							that Message was discussed, it was introduced as a modification which
							was thought necessary to warrant any reference to the State of Spain;
							and to avoid any appearance of disapproving the movement of the troops
							at the Island of Leon— The reason now to be assigned must obviously be
							altogether different, and I suggested that instead referring to the
							condition of Spain as distressed, it should rather be presented as one
							of relief from distress and of hope— A revolution favourable to the
							prospects of the people had been accomplished. An oppressive and
							detestable despotism had been destroyed— The inquisition had been
							abolished— The press made free—the Prisons opened and disgorged of all
							their political victims—and all this effected with unexampled
							moderation, with out any sacrifice of blood, except the massacre at
							Cadix of which the people were not the authors, but the sufferers. There
							had been no popular violence, no outrages upon humanity— The message
							might express the hope that the revolution would promote the happiness
							of the Spanish Nation, and derive a presage of that result from the
							moderation and humanity which have hitherto attended its progress— The
							President determined to take this into consideration. <pb type="ms"
								n="333"/>A question was made whether it might not be necessary to
							postpone sending the Message to Congress until Tuesday— It has been
							expected every day this week; and the impatience for its appearance is
							excessive both in and out of Congress.— But by a handbill from Boston,
							received by the mail of this day by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis,
							and which he sent me, it appears that the Brig Edward Foster arrived
							there from Malaga last Tuesday, and that <persRef ref="hackley-richard"
								>Richard S. Hackley</persRef> formerly Consul at Cadix came
							passenger in her, with despatches from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Forsyth— The rumour of his having brought with him the ratified Treaty
							proves as groundless as other rumours from the same source— As he is
							however said to have left Madrid the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi>
							of March it seems necessary to delay the Message until his despatches
							arrive. It was agreed on all sides that there was nothing in the Note of
							Vives which of itself could warrant a recommendation to Congress to
							postpone acting until the next Session. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thompson thought the tenour of his Note insulting, and all thought it
							quite unsatisfactory. I said perhaps it would be proper to reply to it
							before sending the papers to Congress— This was left undecided; but the
							President twice intimated to me, that for my own sake, I should write to
							ask Vives what he meant by the <hi rend="italic">verbal discussions</hi>
							with me, which he proposes reporting to his Government, and urging as
							motives for them to be satisfied with the explanations concerning the
							South American point— He thought that if left unexplained that passage
							might give rise to insinuations like those of <persRef
								ref="genet-edmund">Genet</persRef> against <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson,</persRef> that I had a language Official and a language
							confidential— On returning to my Office therefore, I immediately wrote
							Vives a Note asking him to specify what I had said in the verbal
							discussion to which he alluded, and which he proposed reporting to his
							Government— I left orders at the Office to have it open to-morrow after
							the arrival of the Mail, in expectation of receiving the despatches
							brought by Hackley— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi

						<p><date>7. V:</date> In reflecting upon the correspondence with <persRef
								ref="vives-don">General Vives</persRef>, I became more and more
							convinced that a reply to his last Note, and indeed to all the argument
							yet unanswered in all his Notes would be necessary, to go with the
							papers to Congress. The impression upon the whole would otherwise be,
							not only dissatisfaction with the result, but with the defective
							maintenance of our side of the question. A great part of the Note
							prepared before my conference with Vives of 29<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> April, which was omitted from my Note of 3. May, becomes
							again proper to be said, and a general review of the whole Negotiation
							will be useful to concentrate the opinions of Congress and of the
							Public— It was necessary to do all this, and to have three copies of the
							paper ready to-morrow; one for Vives, and two to be sent to Congress
							with the Message. While I was thinking how to accomplish this I received
							a note from the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>, whose
							slumbers last Night were I believe not more quiet than mine— He desired
							me to send him a copy of the translation of Vives’s last Note; and
							suggested to me the propriety of my seeing this day <persRef
								ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poletica,</persRef> the Russian Minister and informing him of the
							course of the Negotiation, and of the substance of the message about to
							be sent to Congress. I had given last Evening to <persRef
								ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef>
							the translation of the Note from Vives, requesting him to have two
							copies of it ready, in the course of this day. I now called on him at
							his lodgings, took a copy of the Note which he had ready, and desired
							him, to make immediately the other copy, and to call upon the Messenger,
							and have the office of the Department opened, and to attend there
							himself. I then went to the President’s and met at his door <persRef
								ref="smith-samuel2">General S. Smith,</persRef> Chairman of the
							Committee of Ways and Means, who seeing me, went away saying he would
							call again— I told the President I had received his note; and asked him
							whether in seeing M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Poletica, it was his
							intention that I should tell him what the purport of the Message to
							Congress would be— He said that had not been definitely his intention.
							But as we had communicated quite confidentially with the French Minister
							during the progress of the negotiation, he had thought it might be
							gratifying to Poletica, and to his Government, if we should manifest the
							same Confidence in him. I observed that the Confidence in <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">de Neuville</persRef> had been merely in
							continuation of the part which he had taken in the former Negotiation—
							That Vives came instructed to consult and had consulted him. That he had
							sought our Confidence and interposed under Instructions from his own
							Government— This was not the case with Poletica. His Instructions had
							been to plead the Cause of Peace and Concord at Washington till Vives
							should come, but not to use or attempt any influence upon the
							Negotiation— Accordingly, although always as inquisitive and eager for
								<pb type="ms" n="334"/>information upon the policy and intentions of
							this Government, he has been since the arrival of Vives invariably
							reserved; has never spoken to me of the Negotiation, and has rather
							avoided than sought any opportunity for private conversation with him; a
							course remarkably differing from his ordinary practice. Under these
							Circumstances, if I should now send for him merely to communicate that
							which in two or three days will be public by the Message to Congress, I
							apprehended it might have an appearance as if we were inviting his
							interference to exercise influence upon Vives, either by persuasion or
							intimidation— To this the President assented, and gave up the idea of my
							seeing Poletica— I found him yet undetermined how he should conclude the
							Message to Congress; but he had prepared a paragraph expressing the
							ideas yesterday suggested by <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
								>Calhoun</persRef> and me. A hope that the recent change of
							Government in Spain would promote the happiness of the Nation—a
							commendatory notice of the moderation with which it had been conducted;
							and a confidence of obtaining Justice from the new authorities.— I
							observed to him that the paragraph in Vives’s last note, concerning the
							change in Spain was equivalent to a declaration that he considered his
							powers suspended until he should receive further instructions.— He
							admitted it would bear that Construction; but advised me to ask further
							explanation from Vives of his meaning. I recurred again to the necessity
							of a final reply to Vives, including a review of the Negotiation, and he
							agreed that I should prepare one. I then went to my Office, and prepared
							the draft of this closing Note. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey
							was there and at my desire sent for <persRef ref="forrest-richard">R.
								Forrest</persRef> and <persRef ref="maury-richard">R. B.
								Maury,</persRef> who came to make the copies. I took the part of the
							draft which had been prepared before the first conference, and which is
							yet applicable; to which I prefixed a new introduction, and annexed a
							new conclusion; then took the whole over to the President who approved
							it without alteration— And I left it with Bailey, Forrest and Maury to
							have three copies of it ready to-morrow Morning— The Eastern Mail in the
							meantime had come in; but no appearance of <persRef
								ref="hackley-richard">R. S. Hackley</persRef> or of the despatches
							with which he was charged. The President concluded not to send the
							Message to Congress till Tuesday; and desired me to inform <persRef
								ref="lowndes-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowndes,</persRef> the Chairman of the Committee of foreign
							Relations; so that if necessary, notice should be given to the House of
							Representatives— Between 6 and 7 in the Evening I returned home to
							dinner, after calling upon Lowndes, and giving him the information as
							desired by the President.</p>

							had finished at four O’Clock this Morning— The copies of it to go to
							Congress had also been prepared. There was a Cabinet Meeting at the
							President’s at ten O’Clock, fully attended. My draft of a Note to Vives
							was there read and approved, and it was sent to him. I had yesterday
							received his answer to my short Note of Saturday, saying that the verbal
							discussions to which he had referred were contained in our respective
							Notes of the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> and 5<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> instant— The <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> read the draft of the Message, which he had
							prepared, closing with a recommendation that Congress should postpone
							acting upon the Treaty till the next Session, in consideration of the
							revolution in the Spanish Government. No objection to this course was
							now made; though <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> and myself
							concurred in the opinion, that it was substantially giving up the last
							chance to obtain the ratification of the Treaty— Crawford still thought
							the best measure to be taken would be the immediate occupation of
							Florida; my opinion still is that the best measure would be that
							Congress should authorize the occupation at the discretion of the
							President, leaving Spain still the alternative of ratifying the Treaty
							during the Summer. But as it is now apparent that Congress would neither
							pass a Law for the immediate occupation, nor authorize it at the
							President’s discretion, I am satisfied that the course upon which the
							President has fixed is the best now practicable— There was however an
							adjournment to wait for the arrival of the mail, and of the despatches
							from <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="hackley-richard">R. S. Hackley</persRef> arrived with them, and
							brought them to my Office— Hackley sailed from Malaga the 27<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March, and brought papers from Madrid
							of the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> but his despatches from
							Forsyth, were of a date no later than the 10<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of March. <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">The King</persRef>
							had taken the Oath to the Constitution of 1812. on the 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> but when Forsyth wrote there had been no
							change of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and no official communication
							of the kings acceptance of the Constitution to the foreign Ministers—
							Afterwards, and before Hackley left Spain the <persRef
								ref="melgarejo-joaquin">Duke of San Fernando</persRef> had resigned,
							and a M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi><pb type="ms" n="335"/><persRef

							appointed Minister of foreign Affairs in his place. But there is no
							communication of this event from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth;
							nor any thing in the despatches from him which would require any
							alteration in the Message to Congress— The Cabinet Meeting was resumed
							at two O’clock, and the despatches were then read and considered. They
							confirmed so fully the fact of the Revolution in Spain, as to leave no
							possible doubt of the propriety of referring to it as the motive for
							recommending to Congress a postponement of proceedings upon the
							subject.— The Message is to go to morrow. <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi

						<p><date>9. V:30.</date> The Message to Congress with copies of the

								Vives</persRef> was this morning sent in— The <persRef

							was sent in, I received from General Vives a short reply to my Note of
							yesterday’s date— We had this Evening our last weekly party for the
							Season: it was fully attended and there was dancing till between ten and
							eleven. In the midst of the party I received a note from the President,
							mentioning that he had just been informed by <persRef ref="lloyd-edward"
								>Governor Lloyd,</persRef> one of the Senators from Maryland, that
								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">A. Gallatin’s</persRef> Letter of 15.
							February had been communicated to Congress with the documents this
							Morning, and that as it makes a case bearing hard upon the individual,
							it may be so considered by our friends and others. It seemed also to
							intimate that he did not intend that this paper should have been sent in
							with the rest— He had however assented some days since that it should be
							sent, and never since expressed a change of opinion or hesitation
							concerning it. He desires me to see Vives, inform him that Gallatin’s
							Letter was sent to Congress, and offer him an opportunity to make any
							remark upon it that he shall think proper, with a promise of
							communicating it in like manner to Congress.— I told the Servant who
							brought the Note to tell the President I would pay immediate attention
							to it— Vives was here, and I immediately mentioned the subject to him—I
							told him the substance of Gallatin’s Letter, and explained to him the
							necessity there had been of communicating it to Congress: adding that
							any remarks upon it which he would address to me should also be
							communicated to that body— He thanked me for the offer, and said he
							would prefer waiting till the documents should be published before he
							would reply. That he never had said either to <persRef
								ref="pasquier-etienne">Baron Pasquier</persRef> or to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, that he was authorized in any
							event to give us possession of Florida, without waiting for the
							ratification of the Treaty. It appeared to him an absurdity to suppose,
							that even if he had possessed the power he should have disclosed it to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin, the only time that he had
							ever seen him which was at dinner, at Baron Pasquier’s. He then related
							the conversation which had passed between then, agreeing precisely with
							the statement of it by Gallatin, in every particular excepting that
							Vives manifested no dissatisfaction at the communication of the document
							to Congress; but the French Minister <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Hyde de Neuville,</persRef> shewed some
							uneasiness at it— I reminded him good humouredly, that the message he
							had brought me from Vivés, on his being informed of this Letter of
							Gallatin’s had been—“Print whatever you please.”— That he said was
							true—but then this paper implicated also the accuracy of Baron Pasquier;
							and he de Neuville was sure Vives never had said, what Pasquier and
							Gallatin had understood him to say. It had all been some officious and
							unfounded exposition of <persRef ref="delosrios-carlos"
								>Fernand-Nuñez.</persRef> But Pasquier did not like to have these
							extra official and in some sort confidential Letters or conversations
							brought before the Public— In one of his first Letters to him de
							Neuville, he had observed that such a practice precluded confidential
							intercourse— I replied that this sort of publicity arose <pb type="ms"
								n="336"/>from the nature of our Constitution, in which Negotiation
							with foreign Powers was entrusted to the Executive, but War could be
							declared only by the Legislature. Whenever the Relations with a foreign
							power, are in such a State that action must be substituted for
							Negotiation, the whole case must be laid before Congress. They must know
							everything, and nothing can be communicated to them without being made
							known to the Public. In the present case if M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin’s Letter had been withheld, and it should hereafter
							have been discovered that it existed, it would have recoiled upon the
							executive in charges of having suppressed material Evidence in its
							possession— I told Vives that the President had recommended to Congress
							to postpone acting till the next Session; with which he appeared to be
							satisfied.— <persRef ref="hackley-richard">R. S. Hackley</persRef> was
							also at our party, and gave me some further details of the Revolution in

							called this morning at my house, and had some further Conversation with
							me, upon political topics. He is to leave the City to-morrow upon his
							return home— He supposes that from the next Session of Congress will
							commence the close caballing and intriguing directed to the close of the
							next Presidential term. This is also generally understood— <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>
							called up this day his proposed Resolution that it will be proper to
							make an appropriation by Law for one or more Ministers who may be
							appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the
							Senate, to the Governments of South-America. He supported this
							Resolution by a Speech; and after a feeble opposition by <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lowndes-william">Lowndes</persRef> it was reported by the
							Committee of the whole to the house; and there adopted by yeas and nays
							80 to 75. much to his own surprize and to that of almost every body
							else. Various causes contributed to this result, among which the most
							powerful was the failure of the negotiation with Spain and the papers
							yesterday communicated— It is generally considered, and particularly by
							him as a victory obtained against the administration; or rather as it
							undoubtedly is, a party triumph over the Secretary of State; for the
							policy of the administration with regard to Spain and South America is
							now universally imputed to me alone, precisely because it has been
							unsuccessful— To me, its general character is perhaps justly ascribed,
							but its failure is owing, first to the treachery of Spain—secondly to
							the proposal made two years ago to Great-Britain for a joint
							acknowledgment of Buenos-Ayres—thirdly to the strong leaning in the
							President’s Messages to Congress in favour of the
							South-Americans—fourthly to the omission to issue a proclamation last
							Summer against <persRef ref="long-james">Long’s</persRef> expedition
							into Texas—fifthly to the appointment of <persRef ref="bland-theoderick"
								>Bland</persRef> as U.S. District Judge, in Maryland. None of these
							measures have been mine—nor have they been congenial to the rest of the
							system— They have been compliances with the popular sentiment in favour
							of the South-Americans— Compliances perhaps politic, to counteract the
							invidious misrepresentations of Clay and his partizans, of the
							President’s partiality against the Revolutionists; but suited to give
							Spain the pretext which she has seized, and having in fact given it—
							Whether the policy which I should have pursued, would have been more
							successful, I have not confidence enough either in myself or in Fortune
							to pronounce. “It is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.” I
							believe it would have secured the ratification of the Treaty; and that
							would have been a splendid success to the President and his
							Administration— I saw however enough of cabalistic operation at the time
							when the Treaty was signed, and see enough of it now to know that in
							that event two sets of arguments would have prevailed— One that the
							Treaty was a bad one; which is Clay’s—the other that the Treaty was
							good, and generally creditable to the Administration— My share in it
							would have been veiled. The run of luck is now in favour of Clay, but he
							yet dreads the ratification of the Treaty; and among his motives for
							bringing up his Resolution of this day, was that of renewing the alarm
							of Spain, and thereby preventing again its ratification by her— Clay
							treats me as <persRef ref="jones-john-paul">Paul Jones</persRef> charged
								<persRef ref="landais-pierre">Landais</persRef> with treating him—
							While the Bon-homme Richard and the Sérapis were grappled together yard
							arm and yard arm, in the deadly heat of the battle, Landais brought up
							the Alliance, to bear crosswise upon both, and pouring her broadsides in
							upon friend and foe in discriminately raked them both fore and aft at
							once, and did as much damage to his own associate as to the enemy.
							Military and political rivalry produce the same effects, and a General
							must win his battles, and a Statesman carry his Policy against the
							adversaries in their own quarters, no less than against those in the <pb
								type="ms" n="337"/>camp or cabinet of their opponents— Clay this day
							gave notice that it was his intention shortly to retire from public
							life, and he has publicly notified the people of his district that he
							shall not offer himself as a Candidate for Congress at the next election
							in August.— This is owing to the embarrassed state of his private
							affairs which makes it necessary for him to return to the practice of
							the Bar— I received this morning a Note from <persRef ref="brent-daniel"
								>D. Brent,</persRef> saying that the President wished to have
								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin’s</persRef> Letter of 15. February, <hi rend="italic"
								>withdrawn</hi> from the documents communicated to Congress with the
							Message— I called therefore at the President’s and informed him of what
							had passed between me and <persRef ref="vives-don">Vives</persRef> last
							Evening on the subject. It was apparent that someone besides <persRef
								ref="lloyd-edward">Governor Lloyd</persRef> bed been starting
							objections against the appearance of this paper— I presume it to be
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>— For the
							President knew that Vives had produced to <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">de Neuville</persRef> his minutes of the
							Conversation with Gallatin, containing no trace of the admission that he
							was authorized to give us possession of Florida without the
							ratification— If it is Crawford, he probably thinks that Gallatin will
							finally be found to have misunderstood Vives; and will lose character by
							it for accuracy— That he will then be offended at the publication of his
							Letter, and believe it was done purposely to expose him— That if his
							Letter could now be withdrawn, it would have the appearance, of having
							been sent in by me against the President’s intention; fix Gallatin’s
							resentment pointedly upon me, and impress him at once with an opinion of
							Crawford’s influence in obtaining the withdrawal of the paper, and of
							his personal friendliness to Gallatin in opposition to me— These are
							only suspicions; but they may be unfounded— The suspicion that I had a
							thought unfriendly to Gallatin, in sending his Letter with the other
							papers to Congress would be totally unfounded— I thought it
							indispensable to make the case for Congress to consider, and did not
							believe that Gallatin had misunderstood Vives.— Perhaps I ought to have
							thought of this possible effect upon Gallatin’s reputation, of the
							appearance of the document, and to have withheld it. Now however to
							withdraw it, would only be giving it more eclat, and could have no good
							effect whatever— The President was satisfied upon hearing that Vives had
							agreed to reply on the publication of the Papers— I received this day a
							note from Vivés, officially communicating the King’s having sworn to the
							Constitution of 1812. and enclosing a printed copy of his proclamation
							to the Nation of the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of March last—
							There was a <persRef ref="ratcliff-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript"

							was at the Office: going as Agent to the new Republic of Colombia. I
							have not yet time to prepare his Instructions— The <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> sent to Congress this day, a
							Message; with translations of the three Notes received from <persRef
								ref="vives-don">Vives</persRef>, since the Message of Tuesday— I
							received this afternoon a Note from <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> mentioning that a
								<persRef ref="deabbate-gaspare">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Deabbate</persRef> had called upon him with a Letter of
							Introduction, and having a Commission, as Consul General from the
								<persRef ref="victoremmanuel">King of Sardinia;</persRef> and that
							he wished to come and introduce him to me at 9 O’Clock to-morrow
							Morning, if I could then receive them; which I immediately sent him an
							answer that I would. <persRef ref="roberts-jonathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jonathan Roberts</persRef> one of the
							Senators from Pennsylvania, came and spent a couple of hours of this
							Evening with me— Roberts was bred to a mechanical profession, and is one
							of those men who by their talents, and by the prevalence of democracy in
							Pennsylvania, have risen to the high distinction of his present station.
							Roberts has been nine or ten years a Member of the Senate, and possessed
							a considerable share of influence in that body— Par negotiis nec supra—
							But no popularity lives long in a democracy. The affections of the
							multitude cloy upon satiety, and are ever bent upon change— Roberts’s
							Senatorial term of service expires with the next Session of Congress,
							and it is said there is no prospect of his being reelected. Pennsylvania
							has been for about twenty years governed by two Newspapers in
							succession, one the Aurora, edited by <persRef ref="duane-william2"
								>Duane</persRef> an Irishman, and the other the Democratic Press,
							edited by <persRef ref="binns-john">John Binns</persRef> an Englishman.
							Duane had been expelled from British India for Sedition and Binns had
							been tried in England for High Treason— They are both men of
							considerable talents and profligate principles—always for <pb type="ms"
								n="339"/>sale to the highest bidder, and always insupportable
							burdens, by their insatiable rapacity, to the parties they support. With
							the triumph of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef> in
							1801. Duane who had contributed to it, came in for his share and more
							than his share of emolument and patronage— With his printing
							establishment at Philadelphia, he connected one in this City; obtained
							by extortion almost the whole of the public printing, but being
							prodigal, and reckless never could emerge from poverty, and always
							wanting more soon encroached upon the powers of indulgence to his
							cravings which the heads of Departments possessed, and quarrelled both
							with <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Madison</persRef> and <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> for staying his
							hand from public plunder. In Pennsylvania too, he contributed to bring
							in <persRef ref="mckean-thomas">M’Kean</persRef>, and then laboured for
							years to run him down—contributed to bring in <persRef
								ref="snyder-simon">Snyder</persRef>, and soon turned against him—
							Binns in the mean time had come after his trial as a fugitive from
							England, and had commenced Editor of a Newspaper— Duane had been made by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison a Colonel in the army; and as
							Gibbon the Captain of Hampshire Militia, says he was useful to <persRef
								ref="gibbon-edward">Gibbon</persRef> the Historian of the Roman
							Empire, so Duane the Colonel, was an useful auxiliary to Duane the
							printer, for fleecing the public by palming upon the army at extravagant
							prices, a worthless compilation upon military discipline that he had
							published. But before the War with England was half over, Duane had so
							disgusted the army and disgraced himself that he was obliged to resign
							his commission, and has been these seven years a public defaulter in his
							accounts to the amount of between four and five thousand dollars, for
							which he is now under prosecution— Snyder, assailed by Duane, was
							defended by Binns, who turned the Battery against him, and finally ran
							down the Aurora, so that it lost all influence upon public affairs— In
							1817. Snyder’s Constitutional term of service expired. There was an
							election furiously contested for his successor— Binns supported <persRef
								ref="findlay-william">Findlay</persRef> who succeeded. Duane’s
							candidate was <persRef ref="hiester-joseph">Heister</persRef>, and the
							federal party generally united in his favour— For Binns had acquired and
							exercised an ascendency over Snyder, as obnoxious as that of Duane had
							been, and it was supposed he would have a controul equally odious over
							Findlay— This did not however so turn out; but for resisting Binns’s
							attempts to exercise it, Findlay soon lost his support, and for these
							two years Binns has been making the most violent exertions to overthrow
							him— The election is to come on next September— Binns’s project first
							was to bring in Snyder again; but that being disappointed by Snyder’s
							Death last November, he made a feeble attempt to bring forward the name
							of Roberts— Duane and his party however adhere to Heister, and Binns who
							overstrained his energies by an abortive attempt to get Findlay
							impeached at the last Session of the Pennsylvania Legislature, has lost
							himself, and all prospect of influence upon the election— Roberts who
							while the enquiry into Findlay’s conduct was before the Legislature
							spoke doubtfully of its result, and rather unfavourably of Findlay, now
							told me without hesitation that Binns had ruined himself, and that he
							Roberts had most earnestly dissuaded him from attempting the
							impeachment, from the full conviction that such would be the result.
							Roberts himself apparently feels the weakness of his hold upon public
							employment, and has expectancies from the Executive of the United
							States. The President has a great regard for him, and I have no doubt
							will remember him in due time— He spoke this Evening of Duane, as he had
							spoken in the Session of 1817–18. as of a worthless and profligate
							fellow, and now added that he had fallen into habit, of intemperance. He
							had heard of Duane’s Letters to <persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> R. M. Johnson,</persRef> negotiating
							for a South-American agency, for a Commission upon a fraudulent sale of
							arms, and for the spunging of the balance due by him upon his public
							accounts; with his crafty compound of threats and promises, and asked me
							if I had seen it, and whether it would not be practicable to make them
							publicly known. I told him they could not be made public by me, but I
							thought they were known to so many persons, that they probably would in
							some way or other become public. Duane had authorised Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson to shew the Letters to the
							President, but not (at least not upon the face of the Letters) to me.
							Johnson had nevertheless shewn them to me— It was therefore Johnson’s
							Confidence that I had in deposit and not Duane’s. I could not make them
							public therefore, because it was Johnson’s secret, and not mine. To
							Duane I owe nothing; he has always been an open <pb type="ms" n="340"
							/>mouthed and foul-mouthed railer against me; though during his late
							Negotiation he intermitted his attacks against me, and turned them
							chiefly against Crawford. Since he has found the South-American
							diplomacy, and the fraudulent commission, and the spunging of his debt,
							a desperate chance, he has opened again in full pack upon me, and upon
							the President, and has formally become the Champion of <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt Clinton</persRef> for the next election
							to the Presidency.— Roberts told me that <persRef ref="duane-william"
								>Duane’s son,</persRef> who is now a member of the Pennsylvania
							Legislature, from Philadelphia, was as bad as himself.</p>

						<p><date>13. VI:</date> At nine this morning, <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> came with <persRef
								ref="deabbate-gaspare">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gaspare
								Deabbate</persRef> who produced to me a Commission from the <persRef
								ref="victoremmanuel">King of Sardinia,</persRef> as his Consul
							General to reside at Philadelphia. He afterwards sent me a copy of it
							and I sent him an exequatur. <persRef ref="storrow-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Storrow</persRef> also came to my
							house to speak of a Bond which was to have been sent him to execute as
							surety for <persRef ref="hall-john2">J. M. Hall</persRef> Consul of the
							United States at Cadix. Storrow, who was a young man of talents and
							ambition, in search of prosperity, has fallen upon a fortune by marrying
							a Virginian heiress: but the sweetest cup must have drops of bitterness
							mingled with it. His wife is now just recovering from a distressing
							illness— I called upon the <persRef ref="meigs-return">Post-master
								General</persRef> by desire of the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> concerning the claim of <persRef
								ref="ross-unknown4">Ross</persRef> and the other captors of the
								<persRef ref="hull-morris;hutton-peregrine" type="multi">mail
								robbers,</persRef> to the whole sum offered as a reward by the
							Post-master at Baltimore. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meigs said that
								<persRef ref="skinner-john">Skinner</persRef> had been improperly
							prevailed upon by the persuasion of other persons in Baltimore to double
							the sum which he had intended to offer; that as long since as during the
							administration of <persRef ref="washington-george">General
								Washington,</persRef> it had been settled that the highest reward to
							be offered in such cases should be 300 dollars— And that in the present
							instance the conditions upon which the reward was offered had not been
							all filled— They had not been convicted—nor even tried for the robbery.
							They had been indicted in the State Court of Maryland for the murder of
							the driver, and had pleaded guilty. The State Jurisdiction had taken
							them away from the operation of the Laws and tribunals of the Union; if
							they are executed it will be for the murder, and the example of
							punishment for the robbery of the Mail would be entirely lost— There
							were efforts making in Maryland to obtain the pardon of one of the
							criminals, Hull for the murder, and if they should succeed he should be
							obliged to have the man indicted in the U.S. Circuit Court, for the
							robbery. The conviction therefore not having taken place, the reward was
							not claimable even upon the terms of the advertisement; but his main
							objection was that Skinner had offered too much. He said he would
							however see the President to day or to-morrow, having other occasion to
							call upon him, and would do in this case whatever he should direct. Ross
							came again to my Office, and I mentioned to him, what the Postmaster
							General had said; and advised him to come for a definitive answer in two
							or three days.— At the President’s I told him the substance of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Meigs’s observations; but he still thought
							the reward offered by Skinner ought to be paid— Literally to be sure it
							might be refused, but the men who took the robbers had done all on their
							part for which the reward was offered— The criminals had been convicted
							of the murder, and it was not by the act of the captors that they had
							been screened from trial for the robbery— If Skinner had offered too
							much he might perhaps be personally responsible for the excess; but it
							would be better to limit expressly for the future the sum which
							Postmasters might offer, than to look backwards in retrenchment. The sum
							which had been fixed under General Washington’s administration, might
							have been sufficient then, and yet inadequate now. The value of money
							having then been much higher, and the sums now transmitted by every
							mail, ten fold, and perhaps a hundred fold greater— He would wait
							however to see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meigs, before deciding
							finally. I had also this day a visit at my Office, from <persRef
								ref="torres-manuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Manuel
								Torres,</persRef> the Charge d’Affaires from the new Republic of
							Colombia. <persRef ref="zea-francisco">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Zea,</persRef> one of the Vice-Presidents of the Republic had been
							appointed on a Mission to the United States and to Europe. He had
							proceeded on his way as far as the Island of S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Thomas, where Torres said <persRef ref="morris-charles"
								>Commodore Morris</persRef> had seen him; and he expressed his
							surprize, that Morris had not brought him despatches from Zea. It was
							now reported in the Newspapers that Zea, instead of coming to the United
							States, had gone back to Angostura, which he could scarcely believe;
							because in that case Zea would certainly have written to him and given
							him notice of the change; for in the Event of Zea’s not coming here, he
							himself was instructed to make to the Government <pb type="ms" n="341"
							/>of the United States the proposals with which Zea was charged. If Zea
							had really returned, he was sure there had been some intriguing on the
							part of the English to prevent his having communication with Commodore
							Morris, and to avert Zea from coming here. He should wait therefore a
							reasonable time to ascertain whether Zea had gone back, and if so should
							address the proposals to me— The first of them would be the recognition
							of the Republic of Colombia— This he should not press unseasonably upon
							this Government— His own was perfectly satisfied with what has been done
							by us, and was willing, to wait our own time for the measure; but the
							object of his Government was the total emancipation of all
							South-America. There was a mutual understanding upon the subject between
							his Government, and those of Buenos-Ayres, and of Chili— The late
							revolution in Spain would produce no change in their determination to
							maintain their Independence. The Cortes might pursue what course they
							should think proper. But the only course in which South America would
							acquiesce, would be that of their complete independence; and this must
							include Mexico and Peru. The movements upon Peru of <persRef
								ref="bolivar-simon">Bolivar</persRef>, <persRef ref="sanmartin-jose"
								>San Martin</persRef> and <persRef ref="ohiggins-bernardo"
								>O’Higgins,</persRef> from New-Grenada, Buenos-Ayres and Chili were
							all concerted together, and they were agreed that no terms could be made
							with Spain till Peru and Mexico should be liberated. At Angostura, it
							had even been determined, since the Revolution in Spain has been known,
							that if he should ask for an armistice, as was expected, it would not be
							granted unless upon the express condition of his immediately evacuating
							the Country with his troops. It was impossible that they should agree to
							any terms of dependence upon Spain— The Spanish Constitution of 1812.
							had cut off from all the rights of Citizens every individual of African
							origin, however remote. This alone would make all compromise impossible
							with South America, where a very large proportion of those, who had
							fought the battles of Independence were of this description— He gave me
							a newspaper, the Correo del Orinoco, containing an Article, which he
							told me was official, written by <persRef ref="roscio-juan">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Roscio</persRef>, and expressing all
							these opinions as to the effect of the Revolution in Spain, upon South
							American Affairs— But he said the views of his Government extended
							further— They were jealous of the European Alliance; they were above all
							jealous and fearful of Great-Britain— They were desirous of combining an
							American system, to embrace this whole Hemisphere, in opposition to that
							of Europe, and especially in opposition to England. They were willing
							and desirous that the United States should take the lead in this system,
							and to be governed entirely by their advice; and as it would be an
							object with his Government to substitute the use of the Cotton
							manufactures of China and of India, for those of England, among the
							people, and as they had no shipping or Seamen, they were disposed to
							make a Treaty with us by which the Traffic between them and the Asiatic
							regions should be carried on exclusively in vessels of the United
							States— He had no doubt that this would be resented by Great Britain;
							probably by War; but they expected such a War, from other causes— Great
							Britain had designs upon them which must produce a War. The whole Holy
							Alliance had invariably been and would continue to be against them. They
							expected that England would take and destroy some of their Seaport
							Cities—for all this they were prepared; but nothing less than the
							Independence of all South-America would satisfy them; and in nothing
							less could they acquiesce. I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Torres to commit to writing the substance of what he had said to me, and
							promised him to lay it before the President for his consideration— I
							asked him also for a copy of the present Constitution of the Republic of
							Colombia; which he promised to send or bring me. He said he was
							instructed to renew the application to this Government for a supply of
							arms; but added that he was obliged to return immediately to
							Philadelphia, to despatch the Venezuelan public armed vessel which had
							lately arrived there— He asked me in various ways, whether he might say
							to his Government that the proposals which he had now disclosed had been
							favourably received by me— I told him I was upon such proposals only a
							subaltern; I could only report them to my principal which I should
							certainly do. But to be sure of accuracy, he must commit them to
							writing, and then I was sure the President would take them for serious
							deliberation. He said I had already written in my note to <persRef
								ref="vives-don">General Vives</persRef> of the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> as much as he wanted me to say— I had
							there avowed it as the opinion of this Government that Spain must
							shortly recognize the Independence of South-America— I replied that what
							I had said there was public; and he and his Government like all others
							might <pb type="ms" n="342"/>draw their own inferences from it— I would
							also give him a distinct and explicit answer to his proposals, when duly
							authorised by the President— I presume this visit and these proposals of
							Torres are now made in consequence of the vote of the House of
							Representatives upon Clay’s Resolution— I went with the family this
							Evening to the last of <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-ann">M<hi

								ref="abbot-joel">Joel Abbot</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="crawford-joel">Joel Crawford,</persRef> members of the House of
							Representatives; the two latter from Georgia. Sergeant is one of the
							ablest and most distinguished members of the House— There is a mild and
							placid character in his manners, and great simplicity without
							awkwardness in his deportment; exceedingly suited to acquire influence
							in a popular assembly. They are the manners of a Quaker without their
							baldness and the polish of a Courtier without its fawning— His eloquence
							partakes of his temper, which is always cool and self-possessed—
							Powerful in argument, persuasive in form, it wins its way to assent by
							the gentleness of its approaches; and as he never gives offence, he is
							treated with respect by all parties— But he came into Congress upon
							federal interest which has lately lost its ascendancy at Philadelphia,
							and he will probably not be elected to the next Congress— He talks even
							of resigning his Seat before the next Session; for being in full and
							lucrative practice at the Bar; he cannot give his attendance in Congress
							without considerable sacrifice of his private interest, and his
							attachment to public life is proportionably loose and feeble— In case of
								<persRef key="clay-henry">Clay’s</persRef> retirement, he would be
							one of the Candidates for the Office of Speaker; and the Federalists in
							Pennsylvania, have had thoughts of Proposing him for Governor of the
							State— His federalism would in both cases be a bar to his success; but
							he told me that he had positively refused to be run in opposition to
								<persRef ref="findlay-william">Findlay</persRef>, for which one
							motive would alone have been decisive— The opposition against Findlay in
							his own party had arisen from transactions in which <persRef
								ref="sergeant-thomas">Sergeant’s brother,</persRef> Secretary to the
							Commonwealth and appointed by Findlay had been concerned— The attack was
							first made by an attempt to impeach Sergeant, on which occasion Findlay
							had faithfully supported him and he, John Sergeant would not make so ill
							a requital to Findlay for his kindness to his brother, as to suffer
							himself to be set up in opposition to his reelection— Sergeant had also
							heard of <persRef ref="duane-william">Duane’s</persRef> Letters to
								<persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R.
								M. Johnson,</persRef> and enquired of me concerning them.— He was
							also anxious that they should be made public to discredit Duane— I told
							him as I had told <persRef ref="roberts-jonathan">Roberts</persRef> that
							I could not make them public— The <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> also, some time after the Letters had been
							returned to Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson told me that he
							wished copies of them had been taken.— But Duane has no character to
							lose— He is known to be unprincipled, poor, and for sale— He has now
							been many years in a minority, both as to the Administration of the
							General Government, and of the State of Pennsylvania— His only object is
							to sell himself for as much as he can get— If M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe had brought him he would have been good for nothing;
							and the purchase would have been so odious and disgusting to the public,
							that it would have injured the administration ten fold more than all the
							good he could ever have done— Rejected by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe, various causes have concurred to throw him into the ranks of
								<persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt Clinton</persRef>— As merely
							the Editor of a Newspaper, character is not necessary to support
							opposition— To prove him venal and profligate would only shew him fit
							for the trade which he pursues of disseminating Slander— He has talents;
							long and uninterrupted experience in public affairs; much knowledge
							crammed without order or method into his head, and indefatigable
							unremitting industry. His great faculty and power as a Slanderer
							consists in mixing truth with falsehood, in such proportions that with
							the ignorant, the malicious and the interested the compound is so like
							truth twill serve the turn as well. As a partizan he can be useful only
							to those whose cause depends upon the propagation of falsehood.— For the
							support of truth or correct principle he is impotent— To M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s Administration he is perhaps
							dangerous as an enemy; but would be fatal as a friend— Sergeant
							expressed some uneasiness at the success of Clay’s Resolution in the
							House of Representatives leading to the recognition of the
							South-Americans, and thought it would <pb type="ms" n="343"/>produce
							mischievous effects— It is no doubt an indication of Clay’s influence in
							the house, and of his increasing popularity in the Nation, as the great
							antagonist of the Administration. It shews also to the world the
							weakness of the Administration, at least in the House of
							Representatives; and will affect the policy of those whose propensities
							are to desert falling, and fly to rising fortunes.— But the effect of
							the Resolution as to the public interest will not be considerable,
							unless it should finally deter Spain from the Ratification of the
							Florida Treaty.— There had been an invitation to <persRef

						<p><date>15. V:30.</date> Close of the first Session of the Sixteenth
							Congress. I received this morning a note from the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> addressed to the heads of
							Departments, mentioning his intention to attend this day at the Capital
							according to the usual custom, for the convenience of signing the Bills,
							and inviting the heads of Departments to attend there with him— As at
							the close of the two Sessions of the last Congress, he only attended at
							the Evening Session, I supposed he intended to do the same now, and went
							at the usual hour to my Office— I found however on enquiry that there
							was to be no Evening Session and that the President had already gone to
							the Capitol where I joined him. There is at the new Capitol a Chamber
							assigned for the President of the United States and the President of the
							Senate. There I found the President, and there he remained till the
							Session closed. He signed thirty-four Acts which passed in the course of
							the day. All the members of the administration occasionally attended,
							and as usual read the Acts, to see that they were correctly enrolled
							before he signed them— The President had been a few minutes into the
							house; but did not remain long. Nothing in the Constitution precludes
							the personal appearance of the President of the United States, in either
							house while they are sitting; though it has very seldom, if ever
							happened. In the present instance, no particular notice was taken of it;
							and I heard it mentioned by no other person but the President himself. I
							was perhaps a couple of hours in the House, and called twice in at the
							Senate. The Session closed very quietly, and with more observance of
							decorum than I ever before witnessed— For of eight Sessions the
							termination of which I have attended this was the first that has closed
							before dinner. <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de Neuville</persRef> the French
							Minister was there; much fretted at the passage of a Bill for levying a
							tonnage duty of 18 dollars a ton, upon French Vessels, to commence the
							first of July next— It is merely a countervailing duty, to balance
							discriminating duties in France upon the same Articles as imported in
							French or American vessels.— It passes on the earnest recommendation of
								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin,</persRef> after a neglect of three years by the French
							Government of our repeated proposals to negotiate a commercial Treaty;
							and after full warning given by Gallatin that if they did not come to
							some arrangement with us, countervailing measures would be taken, at the
							present Session of Congress. This Bill has been before Congress half the
							Session, and de Neuville had never mentioned it to me— He probably had
							flattered himself that it would not pass— Now after it had passed both
							houses, he was in great agitation about it, and intreated me to ask the
							President to object to its passage; at least to postpone its
							commencement till the first of October.— He said the first of July was
							only six weeks off, and would not even give the French Merchants notice
							of what was awaiting them. He said several members of Congress to whom
							he had spoken of it, had told him they were sorry it was made to
							commence so soon, and would readily postpone the day— I told him it was
							now too late to make the amendment— I mentioned however his request to
							the President who said it could not be complied with— I had conversation
							in the House with several of the Members— The Senate passed upon <pb
								type="ms" n="344"/>several nominations, some of which, such as
								<persRef ref="lacock-abner">Lacock</persRef>, the late Senator from
							Pennsylvania, and Reporter against <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson;</persRef><persRef ref="johnson-james">James
								Johnson</persRef> a member of the House of Representatives from
							Virginia, one of the uniform growlers and voters against the

							protegé of the Senator <persRef ref="thomas-jesse">Jesse

							appointments to offices at the dispensation of the Treasury department.
							The device finally contrived to settle the difference between the
							Senators from Illinois, was to renew the nomination of <persRef
								ref="conner-henry">Henry Conner</persRef> as Marshal and to nominate
							Fowke, as register of a Land-Office— Fowke would thereby have obtained a
							much more profitable office than that of Marshal. <persRef
								ref="cook-daniel">D. P. Cook</persRef> told me that the Senate would
							reject the nomination of Fowke to the Land Office; his intemperate
							habits being attested by several members of Congress besides himself.
							But the Senate did not reject him— <persRef ref="edwards-ninian">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards</persRef> took advantage of
							the Rule of Order of the Senate which requires an interval of a day
							between the nomination, and the decision of the Senate upon it and had
							the nomination postponed. The whole of this Transaction has been of an
							unpleasant character.— Its sequel is to be observed— About four O’Clock
							P.M. the Committee of two members from each house, <persRef

							and <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">Smith</persRef> of Maryland and

							the House of Representatives came and announced to the President that
							they had finished their business and enquired if he had any further
							communication to make to them; to which he answered that he had none.

							departure to return home. He is under some irritation at the
							perseverance in nominating so worthless a character as <persRef
								ref="fowke-philip">Fowke</persRef>, whose only earthly use he says
							is that of an electioneering partizan— I told Cook what my situation had

							felt it always my duty to act towards <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>, and that I knew of
							nothing in Crawford’s conduct towards me, of which I could complain— He
							said he knew that Crawford had not shewn the same delicacy in regard to
							me, as I had used concerning him: but he did not explain what he meant,
							and I made no enquiry for particulars— At the Office, <persRef
								ref="newton-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newton</persRef>,
							the member from Virginia, and <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> successively called and
							took leave— I received a Letter from <persRef ref="torres-manuel">M.
								Torres</persRef>, containing a statement of the views of the
							South-Americans subsequent to the revolution in Spain. It asserts their
							determination to have no connection with Spain under whatever change of
							her Government upon any other basis than the entire Independence of all
							South-America, including Mexico and Peru; but says not a word of the
							proposals, which he had told me <persRef ref="zea-francisco">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Zea,</persRef> or he was to make to
							this Government— His communication therefore contains only half of
								<persRef ref="bolivar-simon">Bolivar’s</persRef> plan, which is
							something in the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Bonaparte</persRef>
							Style— Torres had told me on Saturday that probably the project of the
							Cortes Government would be to compromise with South-America— To
							recognize Colombia, Buenos-Ayres and Chili, but to retain Mexico and
							Peru. He also said there had been communications between Chili with
							Buenos Ayres, and the revolutionary party in the Spanish army; by the
							means of a Colonel of the Regiment of Cantabria, taken prisoner about
							two years since in a Spanish Frigate which was going with troops to
							Lima. This Officer was of the revolutionary party in the Spanish army,
							and had on being taken immediately offered to enter the South American
							service— His project like that of the <persRef ref="mina-martin"
								>younger Mina</persRef> had been to effect the Revolution in Spain,
							by means of the emancipation of South-America— His offers of service
							were declined, but he was set at Liberty and permitted to return to
							Spain; and was furnished with Letters from <persRef
								ref="ohiggins-bernardo">O’Higgins</persRef>, the Director of Chili
							to the revolutionary leaders in the army of Spain, which had opened a
							regular communication with them— The mass of the People in Spain, Torres
							observed had no interest in the subjugation of South-America, and would
							readily agree to its liberation— There were three Classes of people
							interested in the old system, and who would be averse to renouncing it.
							1. The City of Cadix, for the monopoly. 2. The Navy and naval Officers
							for the profits or superintending the monopoly and guarding the
							Coasts—and 3. The Office-hunters who were sent from Spain to fill all
							the Offices in the Colonies— The rest of the Nation had no interest in
							the system and felt none. In his note of this day he says nothing of the
							renewed application for a supply of arms. <pb type="ms" n="345"
								/><persRef ref="halsey-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. L.
								Halsey</persRef> came to the Office, and renewed all his
							applications— That upon his accounts had been referred to the fifth
							Auditor, <persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">Pleasonton</persRef>, upon
							the usual principles of settlement at the Treasury— That of his claim
							upon the Government of Buenos-Ayres, I told him would be countenanced as
							far as was consistent with propriety by instructing the agent to
							recommend it to the consideration of that Government— But as it was upon
							a contract made with them, as a merchant residing there, and if not
							absolutely improper, at least not altogether suitable to his character
							as Consul of a neutral State, the interference of this Government in
							support of such a claim could be only recommendatory, and in aid of his
							own agent or correspondent by whom it must be pursued— He said that the
							Commander of a British Frigate had peremptorily interfered in a similar
							case for a British subject, and with success— I replied that the
							circumstances of that case were not known to me, and I could not speak
							of them— The nature of the claim, or the character of the Officer might
							account for them. But the course of the Government of the United States
							was founded upon principle, and not upon the practice of any individual
							foreign Officer, or even of any other Government. As to his restoration
							to the Office of Consul, finding he had no prospect of success, he said
							that the fault of this Government was in its partiality— That <persRef
								ref="hill-henry">Hill</persRef>, the Consul at Valparaiso and
								<persRef ref="zimmerman-unknown2">Zimmermann</persRef> the present
							Consul at Buenos-Ayres had both been concerned in privateering— That a
							Citizen of the United States had been transported to the Island of
							Juan-Fernandez (I think) and there long confined without any
							interference in his favour, and that <persRef ref="meade-richard"
								>Meade</persRef> had been left years in prison in Spain, before this
							Government had done any thing for him— Here I could not command my
							temper, and I told him in anger that I would have no more conversation
							with him on the subject; that I was engaged, and wished him to close our
							interview— He said he had not intended to say any thing improper— I
							replied that I wished to have no more discussion with him and wished him
							good-morning— Upon which he left the Office.— I told the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> afterwards what had passed,
							and he said Halsey had also been with him, and spoken of an American who
							had been confined in the Island of Juan-Fernandez— But he knew nothing
							of the case and had heard nothing of it before— Halsey had left his
							Papers with the President, and requested that they might be sent to him
							at Baltimore. I had written him a Letter informing him that his claim
							would be recommended to the attention of the agent at Buenos-Ayres. The
							President gave me the papers desiring me to have them transmitted to
							Baltimore to him, which I did. The President told me that when he was
							Minister in England, he had at Halsey’s request presented him at Court,
							contrary as he had afterwards found, to the etiquette— As I was
							returning home to dinner, I met <persRef ref="lamb-unknown">Major

								>N. Edwards</persRef> the Senator from Illinois and <persRef
								ref="lowndes-william">W. Lowndes</persRef>, member of the House of
							Representatives from South Carolina called this morning at my house to
							take leave. Edwards spoke of the state of parties, and of public affairs
							at the next Session he says the great struggle will come on. Edwards is
							first Cousin to the Pope’s of Kentucky and Illinois; and therefore not
							in the Interest of <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>, of whom
								<persRef ref="pope-john">John Pope</persRef> is the unsuccessful
							rival in Kentucky— But as a Western man Edwards feels himself to be
							rowing against the general current of Western feeling, and is uneasy
							under it. He remarks with anxiety the ascendancy which Clay has been
							acquiring, during the latter part of the Session of Congress, and seems
							to dread that he will carry all before him. He supposes that he will
							resign his seat as Speaker, but not as member of the House. That he will
							immediately engage extensively in the practice of the Law, and will come
							next Winter and attend at the same time the Session of the Supreme Court
							and of Congress. He says however that in the midst of his late success
							he has raised new adversaries in a quarter which has hitherto supported
							him. His sudden aim at the Vice-Presidency has startled <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford’s</persRef> friends, who have hitherto moved in close
							harmony with him.— They are alarmed at the prospect of Clay’s stepping
							in between Crawford and his hopes, and all voted against his Resolution
							for the Appropriation. Edwards told me that he was personally under
							great obligations to the <persRef key="monroe-james"
							>President</persRef>, for befriending him during the late War in the
							Settlement of some Accounts with the War Department; in a case upon
							which <persRef ref="armstrong-john">Armstrong</persRef> was bent upon
								<pb type="ms" n="346"/>his ruin, and but for M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe might have accomplished it. But that he might be
							under a necessity of opposing some of his measures. He had been hurt at
							the nomination of <persRef ref="fowke-philip">Fowke</persRef>, a man of
							notorious unmoral habits, and had been compelled to use the privilege of
							insisting upon the postponement of his nomination— Between this and the
							next Session such testimony would be obtained, as he had no doubt would
							convince the Senate of the manifest impropriety of the appointment. This
							would not affect his attachment to the President, and he should continue
							to hold his Seat in the Senate with the view to support his
							administration, which will stand in need of friends— He had intended to
							have resigned and to have made way for one of his own friends to take
							his place. But as he now saw troublous times coming, he should hold on;
							and take his share in them— He should leave the City this day, and
							intended to be here for the first day of the next Session— Lowndes’s
							visit was short, and he said little upon political subjects. Like every
							one else he thought the next Session would be one of excitement and
							agitation, but that all party movements would be of a sectional
							character. The Tariff or properly the attempt of the manufacturing
							interest to lay the agricultural and commercial interests under
							contribution, will be one of the principal subjects of debate. This
							system was carried at the late Session in the House of Representatives,
							and failed only by a majority of one vote in the Senate— Lowndes said it
							would succeed at the next Session, unless there should be a union of the
							Northern and Southern Representations against it— At the Office I had a
							succession of visitors; who absorbed the day. <persRef ref="brush-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brush</persRef> a Representative
							from the State of Ohio came to take leave. <persRef ref="thompson-smith"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson,</persRef> the
							Secretary of the Navy called— He goes for New-York to-morrow— He came to
							consult me as to the mode of naming the line of Battle ship, now about
							to be launched at New-York— A Resolution of Congress, at last years
							Session prescribed that in future the public vessels of the union,
							should be named according to their Rates— The first from the States. The
							frigates from Cities, and the smaller vessels from rivers. The question
							is, in what order they should be named— Thompson said he thought the
							best way would be to begin as the old Confederation, always did
							reckoning from North to South—from New-Hampshire to Georgia; and then to
							take the additional States, in the order of their admission to the
							Union. An other way would be to begin by naming the Ships after the
							States in which they are respectively built; and the people at New-York
							and Boston where two ships were shortly to be launched, expected that
							they would bear the names of New-York and Massachusetts— This however
							might be liable to a charge of partiality— A third way was by lot, which
							he did not like, because the lot might cast the first names upon inland
							States, which would be an incongruity, as a preference to the maritime
							States. I told him I thought the only way of which none could complain
							would be to draw lots. In that there would be neither prejudice nor
							partiality. We should have all the Western Mountains upon our backs, if
							we should take the old thirteen States in precedence to them; and indeed
							it would take from them all prospect of floating in panoply upon the
							Ocean, perhaps for a century, which would hardly be just. If the first
							lots should fall upon Western States, so much the better— It would
							interest their pride in the support of the navy— The maritime States
							will always have interest enough in it— So it was concluded that the
							designation of the names should be by lot. <persRef ref="todd-charles"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todd</persRef> came to enquire
							concerning his instructions which I have not yet time to prepare.
								<persRef ref="delafield-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Delafield</persRef> to renew his offers of service for the
							Commission under the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Articles of the Ghent Treaty. I desired
							him to write me a Letter stating his proposals and promised to lay it
							before the President— <persRef key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> de Neuville</persRef> the French
							Minister came to speak of the time when it would suit the President to
							give him an Audience to take leave. He proposed Saturday or Monday next—
							He also told me that he should send me a Note upon the late Act of
							Congress laying a new tonnage duty upon French vessels. He thought
								<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> had been hasty in his recommendation to this
							Measure. The tonnage duty upon American vessels in France was rather
							lower than that of French Vessels in the United States. Their
							discriminating duties upon Articles imported in American Vessels, were
							barely sufficient to give France an equal portion of carriage of the
							trade between the two Countries— It had indeed not yet produced that
							effect. the number of American vessels which went to France last year
							was much greater than that of the French <pb type="ms" n="347"/>vessels
							which came in to the Ports of this Union. As to adopting the system of
							equalizing duties, according to the Convention between the United States
							and Great Britain, France could not do that because the result would be
							to throw the whole trade into our shipping— The French knew very well
							that we had the advantage of them as navigators.— It was therefore only
							a nominal reciprocity to place the duties upon an equal footing in the
							two Countries. We must look to results— Even with the difference of
							duties as they have been in France, their shipping could not stand the
							competition with ours— The loss of their Sailors to which they were
							constantly exposed was so great that many of their vessels were detained
							at heavy charges, for want of men to navigate them— When once the
							balance should be restored so that the number of French and American
							Vessels engaged in the trade should be merely equal. France would very
							readily enter into any commercial arrangement to keep them so. There was
							also the privilege which France claimed in the Ports of Louisiana by the
							eighth Article of that Treaty, upon which I had left his last note
							unanswered— I told him that the principle of reciprocity offered by our
							Act was evidently fair in itself; and Great-Britain, the most tenacious
							and selfish of commercial Nations had assented to it— That this was all
							that could be offered by the Law, but our object was amicable
							arrangement— If France would treat, we should readily consider any
							proposal which she might offer to secure a real reciprocity; but we
							could not wait for the full effect of unequal regulations of France, to
							take precautionary measures against them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin had powers to conclude a Treaty of Commerce; and I hoped the
							French Government would agree to treat with him— I called at the
							President’s and reported to him the substance of this Conversation—
							After dinner I called at <persRef ref="morton-marcus">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Morton’s</persRef> lodgings and found
							him very ill, in bed, but better than he had been last week— <persRef

							whom however I understood he had already received a refusal. He has
							therefore concluded if this last appeal should fail to form an

							principal Cities of the United States, and make sale of Casts from the
							Busts which he has taken and will continue to take. He wished to have

								>General Vives</persRef>, informing him of the result of the

							of this Government to be upon friendly terms with that of Spain;

							Countries. The <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef> approved
							this draft, advising the omission of one paragraph which he thought <pb
								type="ms" n="348"/>expressed in too strong terms approbation of the
							Revolution— He was apprehensive that in the event of a
							Counter-revolution, it might produce an unfavourable effect. The passage
							was accordingly omitted, and the Note sent to Vives, who returned an
							answer that he this day despatched a Messenger to Spain, and would
							inform me as soon as possible of the result— I had mentioned to the
							President that if he proposed to make any new demand upon Spain, it
							would be necessary to mention it in this Note; but he gave no direction
							that any such intimation should be given— Among the Acts passed at the
							late Session of Congress is one for taking the fourth Census, by
							instructions to the Marshals, and Regulations by the Secretary of State.
							After examination of the act, I compared it with those of the years
							1790. 1800. and 1810. for taking the three former enumerations.— The
							first was not taken by instructions from the Secretary of State— The

							appear, and <persRef ref="hay-eliza">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> de Neuville, it would be best to set

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Alleyne Otis’s</persRef> his

						<p><date>20. V:</date> I received this morning a Note from the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> addressed to the Heads of
							Departments, requesting them to meet at his house at twelve O’Clock. I
							had also a note from <persRef ref="king-charles2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> King</persRef> the Painter, asking for
							a sitting, for my Portrait which he left unfinished last Summer— I sat
							accordingly about an hour, and thence went immediately to the
							President’s. I was surprized to find that the meeting had been called to
							enquire whether, if the Florida Treaty should now be ratified by Spain,
							it ought to be accepted by us; or whether notice should not be given to
							Spain that we have further demands which must be satisfied. My note to
								<persRef ref="vives-don">General Vivés</persRef> written since the
							Session of Congress closed and the answer of Vivés were read, and
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> asked whether after them it was not
							too late to advance a new demand upon Spain— The President appeared to
							think it was not— There is certainly nothing in it to cramp the
							operations of the Senate, when it comes to be laid before them— But the
							impression of all was that we were pledged by what has past to accept
							the ratification if given immediately upon the arrival of the Messenger
							from Madrid, at least so far as to take the advice of the Senate upon
							it— I observed that there was no danger of the treaty’s being put upon
							us against our Will— The objection henceforth to be started instead of
							all those which have been advanced hitherto will be the want of power in
							the king to alienate the Spanish Territory— The Treaty therefore will
							not be ratified, and the only effect of advancing a new demand now would
							be to give a new pretext to Spain to refuse the ratification and to
							deprive us of the advantage ground upon which we now stand of claiming
							as of perfect right all that it stipulates in our favour— I further
							reminded the President that before sending the last note to Vivés, I had
							observed that if a new demand of indemnity was to be made of Spain, it
							must be announced in that Note, and there would certainly be some
							awkwardness now, after being informed by him that he had despatched his
							Messenger, immediately after he received that Note, in writing him
							another to say that even if Spain should now ratify the Treaty we shall
							not be satisfied with it; but shall bring forward further demands—
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef>, remarking that the Treaty when signed had been
							unanimously ratified by the Senate, and so far as the sanction of the
							House of Representatives could be taken or given, approved with equal
							unanimity by them— If the Treaty was then a good one last year, had any
							thing happened to make it a bad one now?— This brought the question upon
							the Treaty itself; and although it was well understood that if it should
							come again before the Senate there will be a strong opposition to it,
							the opinion was unanimous here, including the President that the
							Ratification of the Treaty, if given ought yet to be accepted. The
							President then made some question, concerning the state of our Legation
							in Spain— There has been a good deal of dissatisfaction in the public
							prints, expressed at the <hi rend="italic">tone</hi> of <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth’s</persRef> official notes in Spain; two
							or three passages of which were very exceptionable. The President
							himself was much displeased with them— Forsyth’s situation was rendered
							so uncomfortable to him before the change that he earnestly and
							repeatedly solicited leave to return to the United States; and I wrote
							to him on the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February giving him
							that permission. But after the Revolution in Spain most of the causes of
							Forsyth’s wishing to return were removed, and it has become very
							important that there should be a Minister there. We all thought it
							probable, that after the change Forsyth will have concluded to stay for
							further instructions, even though he should have received my Letter
							giving him leave to return. On that supposition I was directed to write
							to him, stating the disposition of the President still to receive the
							Treaty, if immediately ratified by Spain; but to discover no particular
							earnestness to obtain the ratification, and to give notice that if it be
							longer delayed, we shall recur to our former rights and insist upon
							further indemnities. The despatch in case of Forsyth’s absence on its
							arrival, is to be addressed to <persRef ref="brent-thomas">T. L. L.
								Brent</persRef> as Charge d’Affaires. The President gave us all
							invitations to the dinner next Wednesday; and the precedence question
							was arranged as I had proposed. But he inclined that no Ladies should be
							invited; but that <persRef ref="hay-eliza">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Hay</persRef> should invite <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-ann">Madame de Neuville</persRef> to a small
							Evening tea-party, and <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> to meet her. However
							on <pb type="ms" n="350"/>further reflection he left the matter
							undecided until the Evening, and then sent me word that the Ladies would
							also be invited to the Dinner.— I dined with all the family at <persRef
								ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye’s,</persRef> and walking home in the Evening, called at
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun’s,</persRef> where I found <persRef ref="baldwin-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin</persRef> the member of
							Congress from Pennsylvania. He promised me an answer for <persRef
								ref="antrobus-gibbs">Antrobus</persRef> the British Charge
							d’Affaires, to a claim first made by <persRef key="bagot-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef>, and renewed by him to
							have the duties upon rolled and hammered iron equalized, as a corollary
							from the Convention of 3. July 1815. The British Government insist that
							rolling and hammering are only two modes of bringing Iron into the same
							state of manufacture— One English and the other Swedish— Baldwin and the
							Committee of Manufactures maintain that the two processes do not produce
							the metal in the same state of manufacture: and that the equalization of
							duties stipulated by the Convention does not apply to the case.</p>

							impropriety Hails him as actually descended— By an accident almost
							ominous, the singing was so discordant and disjointed that in going
							through the Hymn which begins and closes with “Come Holy Spirit,
							Heavenly Dove, With all thy quickening powers”—they went on jarring like
							a Dutch concert to the verse “In vain we tune our lifeless songs, In

							house, and had to return from two or three Miles beyond it— We arrived
							there however about Noon, and found the agricultural Society of which he
							is President assembled— Law, is an Englishman of distinguished family;
								<persRef ref="law-edmund2">son</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="law-george">brother</persRef> of bishops, and <persRef
								ref="law-edward">half brother to the late Lord

							wasted a great Estate upon speculations to enlarge it, has <persRef
								ref="law-edmund;law-john" type="multi">two sons</persRef> without
							mothers, and a <persRef ref="custis-elizabeth">wife</persRef>,
							grand-daughter to the late <persRef ref="washington-martha">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Washington</persRef>, from whom he is
							divorced. He is a political economist of the paper money stamp, a Poet
							of scraps and patches, and a newspaper writer and pamphleteer upon all
							things— He now lives as a batchelor upon this farm, in a large but not
							comfortably looking house— His grounds are laid out without elegance or
							taste— His garden is small, but he has a good deal of the knick knack
							patent machinery, which the Gentlemen farmers of England, and this
							Country have brought into fashion. The address to the Society which he
							read and told us would be published in <persRef ref="skinner-john"
								>Skinner’s</persRef> American Farmer, was all in recommendation of
							the manufacturing interest, and well interlarded with quotations of
							poetry— There were perhaps thirty members of his Society present, and as
							many more invited visitors <pb type="ms" n="351"/>from Washington— His
							two sons were there; the youngest of whom was introduced to me by the
							other, he has just arrived here from S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Augustine in Florida, of which place and its present condition he gave
							me some account. After the reading the address a table was laid with a
							cold Collation, which I could not stay to partake of, but returned with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun home— Within half a mile of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Law’s house we met the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef> with <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> who were just then going there. I set M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun down at his house, and got home
							about four O’Clock. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and her party
							came home an hour later— Evening at home— On the ride with Calhoun we
							had much Conversation upon various topics— I asked him whether he knew
							what was the occasion of the President’s calling the Cabinet Meeting on
							Saturday— He said it was a Letter that he had received from <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef>, in which though mentioning in terms of high
							commendation the Florida Treaty, he yet advises that its ratification
							should not now be accepted, but that we should look to the occupation of
							Texas— This explains to me, what had been utterly unaccountable; in the
							call of that Meeting, three days after my last Note to <persRef
								ref="vives-don">Vives</persRef>, and after the receipt of his
							answer. It reminded me of <persRef ref="obrien-richard"
								>O’Brien’s</persRef> shrewd remark that an old Sea-Captain never
							likes that his Mate should make a better voyage than himself— We
							conversed upon politics past, present and future. Calhoun’s
							anticipations are gloomy— He says there has been within these two years
							an immense revolution of Fortunes in every part of the Union; enormous
							numbers of persons utterly ruined— Multitudes in deep distress; and a
							general mass of disaffection to the Government, not concentrated in any
							particular direction, but ready to seize upon any event, and looking out
							any where for a leader. The Missouri question and the debates on the
							Tariff were merely incidental to this state of things. It was a vague
							but wide-spread discontent caused by the diseased circumstances of
							individuals, but resulting in a general impression that there was
							something radically wrong in the Administration of the Government— These
							observations are undoubtedly well founded— The disease is apparent. The
							remedy not discernable. The primary cause is that which has been the
							scourge of this Country from its Colonial infancy, speculations in paper
							Currency— Now appearing in the shape of Banks— The great multiplication
							followed by the sudden and severe reduction of fictitious capital. Then
							the great falling off in the prices of all our principal articles of
							exportation; the competition of foreign manufactures carried on by
							starving workmen, with ours loaded with high wages; the diminution of
							Commerce and the carrying trade, and the accumulation of debt as long as
							credit could be strained, all this with ambitious and crafty, and
							disappointed men, on the watch for every misfortune, and welcoming every
							disaster, together with the elated hopes, the dazzling promise and the
							mortifying reverses of the Florida Treaty, account too well for the loss
							of popularity by the Administration within the last year— Yet the
							dissatisfaction is not general against the Government— The suffering
							interests have too much disposition to turn against each other— Their
							oppositions will terminate in struggles to place their respective
							champions in the next Congress. New-York the most deeply dissatisfied
							State is so nearly divided against itself that its opposite
							disaffections will destroy each other— So will the agricultural and
							manufacturing parties, and I do not expect that the votes in the next
							Congress upon any great point of internal or national policy will
							materially differ, from those of the present Congress on the same
							questions. But whatever the result of the present inauspicious
							circumstances may be, they must work out their own termination.
							Government can do nothing; at least nothing by any measure yet proposed
							but transfer discontents and propitiating one Class of people by
							disgusting another— Were it possible by wishes or exertions to devise an
							efficacious remedy they would not be wanting— As it is, the arbiters of
							Weal and Woe, the Healers and Destroyers Time and Chance, must bring the
							Catastrophe or the cure— As one of the Agents I have but one formula
							suited to all occasions— “Thy Will be done”— Calhoun asked me some
							questions about the transactions at Ghent, and the project said to have
							been formed there or immediately afterwards at Paris, for having M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford run in 1816. for the Presidency—
							I told him I had never heard any <pb type="ms" n="352"/>thing of this,
							either at Ghent or at Paris; and if any projects upon the Presidency had
							been there formed I had not been privy to them— He said that <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">Gallatin</persRef> had been here in the winter
							of 1815-16 and that from all his movements then he appeared to have two
							great objects of anxiety— One that M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>

							should be the Secretary of State.</p>

							The Census is one of the most urgent objects of attention. As two

							my great astonishment found that there was not a line to be found upon
							the subject on the Records of the Office. <persRef ref="colvin-john"
								>Colvin</persRef> had told me that the proceedings in this

							found that the instructions from both the Departments of State and of
							the Treasury, were printed in the National Intelligencer of 1810. On
							examining them, I saw that they would be of some but not much use to me,
							and that I must prepare a set of Instructions entirely new. As each
							census ought to be an improvement upon that last preceding it, every

						<p><date>25. IV:15.</date> At one O’Clock I presented to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef><persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef> at a private Audience to take leave. He has been
							so earnestly solicitous to go through this formality, that I prevailed
							upon the President to gratify him— The President told him that wishing
							him a prosperous voyage, and a happy meeting with his friends in his own
							Country, he should see with pleasure his return among us— That he had a
							great regard for France, and wished well to the <persRef
								ref="louis-xviii">King</persRef> and his royal family— That he
							recollected with grateful satisfaction the part which France had taken
							in aid of our Revolution, and the interest which the house of Bourbon
							had always taken in favour of the United States. In no instance before
							have I heard the President speak with so much feeling to a foreign
							minister, and de Neuville was proportionably affected by it— He said he
							should be peculiarly happy in reporting to the King his Master these
							Assurances, and well knew the high gratification they would afford him—
							The audience was not of more than five minutes, but it was full of good
							words; and will answer the principal purpose as I suppose of de
							Neuville, which is to repeat at his Audience of the king, what the
							President said of him and of the Bourbon’s— I agreed with de Neuville,
							that he should come and present <persRef ref="roth-unknown">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Roth</persRef> to-morrow as the Chargé
							d’Affaires in his absence— I had some conversation after he went away
							with the President; who had told me that <persRef key="rush-richard"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> had given him to
							understand in a private Letter, that he would be willing to exchange his
							present Mission to London for that of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Petersburg— The President said that he should be very willing to
							accommodate the wishes of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, but as it
							would have required the appropriation of a new outfit, in the present
							temper of Congress it would have been impracticable. He had been told
							that <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> had spoken in disparaging and sneering terms of the
							abilities of our Ministers abroad— Naming particularly Rush, <persRef
								ref="campbell-george">Campbell</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="middleton-henry">Middleton</persRef>, who he had said was not
							the author of the Report which as Chairman of a Committee of the House
							of Representatives, on the affair of Amelia-Island. Clay, he added was
							perhaps dissatisfied because <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jonathan Russell</persRef> had not
							been appointed to Russia— I said that might be, but Clay’s
							dissatisfaction had begun nearer home, and with the present
							Administration— Nothing under it could please him. But he had a special
							and personal grudge against Middleton. The pretence that Middleton did
							not write his Amelia-Island Report was one of the Slanders of <persRef
								ref="duane-william">Duane’s</persRef> Aurora, which had at the time
							asserted that the President’s Message, the Report from the Department of
							State, and this Report of Middleton’s came from the same Ink-stand— Now
							as to the Message, he knew that was written by himself— The Report from
							the Department of State was written by me; and as to Middleton’s Report,
							the facts were these— He had sent his first draft of it to me with a
							request that I would suggest any addition or alteration to it that I
							should think proper— I had suggested several additional paragraphs, but
							not the alteration of a word in his draft— He had taken my additions;
							adopted some of them and rejected others; making it his own as fully as
							any piece could be, written with consultation of a friend. <pb type="ms"
								n="354"/>This has been a common practice between the Chairmen of
							Committees and Heads of Departments ever since the existence of the
							Government; and to infer from it the incapacity of a Chairman of a
							Committee, is the very venom of political rancour— Clay well knows that
							however superior to Middleton he may be as a Speaker, on the floor of
							Congress, Middleton is quite his equal as a writer, and actually annoyed
							him at the time alluded to by publications in the Newspapers on the same
							topic of South-American Affairs, which Clay could no otherwise answer
							than by the most disgusting anonymous scurrility— The President further
							observed that both Rush and Gallatin were in positions of embarrassment
							from which he wished he could relieve them— They were in places where
							the compensation could not defray the expence. There was a prejudice
							against Rush, on the score of abilities, and he was not esteemed so
							highly as he deserved. His conduct in England had been quite
							satisfactory. His attention to his duties, unwearied, and his deportment
							acceptable to the Government there. All which is undeniable. But Rush
							has risen too rapidly— The mission to England should have been one of
							the last Stages of his elevation. But Rush has risen too rapidly. The
							mission to England should have been one of the last Stages of his
							elevation from ten to twenty years later— His proper descent would be to
							the Senate— There too, Gallatin might be useful though he would
							certainly not be contented— The Senate is the place, where all the
							overheated blood of restless, aspiring and disappointed ambition should
							be allowed to cool— After returning from the President’s to my Office, I
							was engaged in making drafts of Letters, and preparing despatches to go
							by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de Neuville— <persRef
								ref="forbes-john">Forbes</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hackley-richard">Hackley</persRef> were at the Office. I told
							Hackley that I could not admit the charges in his consular Accounts
							without establishing a new, and too comprehensive a precedent— That my
							present impression was that the Law passed in his favour at the late
							Session, and specifically applied to one vessel, rather proved than
							released the necessity of another Law to embrace the two other cases
							stated by him to rest upon the same principle. I had not however made up
							my mind definitively upon this point. He said he was going to spend some
							time in Virginia, and on his return would call upon me again— I had
							proposed to the President to make him an allowance as bearer of
							despatches from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth; which was
							recommended by Forsyth himself— The President assented, and this may
							finally serve as a substitute for his inadmissible Consular charges— I
							called this Evening to see <persRef ref="morton-marcus">M<hi

						<p><date>27. V:</date> The French Minister, <persRef

								ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thornton</persRef> were successively at the Office. Thornton whose
							passion for a Mission to South-America thrives upon disappointment,
							finding that Forbes is to go, and hearing that he would have preferred a
							comfortable office at home, has been besieging Forbes for an exchange;
							that Forbes should be superintendant of the Patent Office, and Thornton
							go in his stead to Buenos-Ayres or Chili— The Doctor had already made
							another arrangement, by which <persRef ref="allison-burgess">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Allison</persRef> the Chaplain of the
							House of Representatives was to have the Patent-Office, upon his

							ready to make this exchange with Forbes, and to tempt him offered to
							make up to him the Salary of Superintendant, which is 1500 dollars a
							year, to be equal to 2000—that is in substance to pay him an annuity of
							500 dollars a year for an exchange of places— The Doctor never seems to
							have imagined that here was a <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> point of
							view, from which this transaction would have an unfavourable aspect; for
							he brought me this day himself <pb type="ms" n="355"/>a Letter, urging
							it most earnestly, and requesting me to recommend it to the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">President</persRef>— I barely told the Doctor
							that I would submit his paper to the President, which I did; apologizing
							to him for renewing importunities which he has so often rejected— He
							disapproved of course any such arrangement, of which I informed D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Thornton— By the Mail, I received a
							Letter from <persRef ref="strobel-daniel">D. Strobel</persRef> Consul at
							Bordeaux of 21. April, mentioning that J. Forsyth had arrived there the
							day before from Madrid, and had delivered despatches to the Captain of a
							vessel bound to Philadelphia and ready to sail— I sent this Letter over
							to the President— Immediately afterwards <persRef ref="vives-don"
								>General Vivés</persRef> came to the Office, and informed me that he
							had just received a Messenger from Spain, who had brought a Letter from
							the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">King of Spain</persRef> to the United
							States of America, announcing that in conformity with the general wishes
							of his People, he had sworn to the Constitution of 1812. Vives had
							brought the Letter itself and also, a copy of it from the foreign
							department at Madrid— He said he had heard the President was going
							immediately to Virginia, and was unwilling to be the cause of detaining
							him. He would therefore either ask an Audience to deliver the King’s
							Letter to the President, or would leave it with me to be delivered, as
							would be most agreeable to him. He also read me parts of despatches
							which he had received from the acting Minister of foreign Affairs; and
							told me that he should make me within a day or two, three written
							communications. One to give information of the change in the Royal title
							of the King. A second to announce that an order had issued, of pardon,
							and liberation, to all the Citizens of the United States, confined
							within the Spanish dominions, for having taken part in the
							South-American revolts; excepting cases of assassination, robbery and
							debt— The third was to notify, that the King having sworn to the
							Constitution of 1812. so that he had no power to alienate any portion of
							the Spanish territory without the consent of the Cortes, would
							immediately upon the assembling of that body lay before them the Treaty
							of 22. February 1819. That it was the King’s most earnest desire to
							maintain the most friendly and harmonious relations with the U.S. and
							that he had no doubt, the disposition of the Cortes would be to make any
							sacrifice compatible with the honour of Spain to promote the good
							understanding with them— A sentiment confirmed by the sympathy resulting
							from congenial sentiments of Liberty— I went again to the President’s
							and made report of this Conference with Vivés. And I observe<unclear>d
								to</unclear> him, that although Vives had offered to leave the
							King’s Letter with me, I thought it would be better that it should
								<unclear>be d</unclear>elivered in a formal Audience; for the effect
							that it would produce at Madrid— To this he assented; and fixed the
								<unclear>. . .</unclear> for the Audience at Monday Noon—immediately

								<persRef ref="cutts-anna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Cutts</persRef>, whom I overtook, and with whom I walked to Church—
							They say that after having very cruelly scourged one of his Negro Slaves
							for going to a Methodist Church, he overheard the same Slave fervently
							praying for him, which so powerfully flashed upon his imagination that
							he soon became converted, and by choice adopted the Episcopalian form of
							worship— He has become very celebrated as a preacher, and discourses
							with all the ardour and vehemence of a methodist. His text this Morning
							was Matthew VII:21. “Not every one that saith unto me Lord, Lord, shall
							enter into the kingdom of Heaven; but he that doeth the will of my
							Father which is in Heaven”— The difference of merit between profession
							and practice; the meaning of the terms so constantly used by the
							Saviour, of the Kingdom of Heaven, and the transcendent power in the
							Gospel dispensation, of Obedience to the Will of God naturally formed
							the topics of this Sermon, which was skilfully divided and well
							reasoned, with a good share of unction. Yet my impression was that it
							was too long. The house was full but not crowded— I sat in <persRef

							mentioned yesterday— The <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">king’s</persRef>
							change of title, the liberation of American prisoners, and the necessity

							which I propose to adopt with perhaps some addition— I have had likewise
							Conversations with the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>
							and with <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> upon the subject;
							to collect and compare ideas; but neither of them was here when the last
							Census was taken, and the whole subject was more new to them than to me.
							It was fortunate that the Instructions for 1810. were printed in the
							National Intelligencer. <persRef ref="smith-robert">Robert
								Smith</persRef> was then Secretary of State, and Colvin says the
							Instructions were copied verbatim from those of 1800— Colvin himself
							copied them, and Smith signed them without alteration— The Volume of
							Archives of the Department for the year 1800. containing the Record of
							those Instructions was destroyed with the Office in 1814. by the
							British— They are therefore no longer to be found— The Census is an
							object of great importance to this Union, and as by the Constitution it
							is to be taken at intervals of ten years distance from each other, the
							system of taking it may be improved from term to term— The Present
							enumeration is to ascertain, beyond all those that have preceded, the
							numbers of free white Males between 16 and 18—the foreigners not
							naturalized, and the numbers of persons engaged in Agriculture, Commerce
							and Manufactures. It makes also several discriminations of age, to the
							Slaves and free persons of Colour, which had not been marked before; but
							there are discriminations of age much more important which have never
							been taken;—they include in the same column all persons of each sex over
							45 years— There should I think be columns from which the general and
							particular healthiness of the climate and longevity of the inhabitants
							might be demonstrated— Such as persons between 45. and 60. between 60
							and 80. between 80 and 90. between 90 and 100. all over 100. and a
							column for the age of the eldest person in the family— Other
							improvements will suggest themselves to other minds, though it is also
							necessary to beware of making it too complicated an operation. The
							additions even of the present Law will double the labour of the persons
							who are to take the enumeration; without making any allowance either of
							time or compensation. This will probably produce obstacles to the
							execution of the Law; and require additional appropriations and
							compensations hereafter— When I came home from my Office I found that
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2;hellen-mary" type="multi">the children</persRef>
							were gone upon a fishing party, so that I dined alone— They returned
							soon after with a basket of perch which M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Adams sent to <persRef ref="morton-marcus">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Morton</persRef>— I had heard him express a desire to

						<p><date>31. VI:</date> Sat an hour this morning to <persRef
								ref="king-charles2">King</persRef>, for my Portrait. While I was
							there, <persRef ref="brown-katherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Catherine Brown</persRef> of Georgetown, came in with her daughter,
							and her <persRef ref="brown-william10">Son’s</persRef><persRef

								<persRef ref="kurtz-catherine">her other daughter</persRef>, who was
							married to <persRef ref="kurtz-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kurtz</persRef> a merchant of Georgetown having died last week— Soon
							after they came in King released me. At the Office, <persRef
								ref="meigs-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Josiah
								Meigs</persRef> came to ask on the part of <persRef
								ref="forsyth-clara">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Forsyth</persRef>, advice, whether she should embark for Europe to
							join her husband in Spain, or wait for his return here. I told him I
							should advise her to wait till she should hear from <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>
							again. She had written to me, the day that Congress adjourned, asking
							for advice then— I answered her that on the 11<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of February a despatch had been written to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth giving him permission to return to
							the United States— That permission was given at his own earnest and
							reiterated intreaty; and at a time when the President thought the
							continuance of a Minister at Madrid would be useless— Since the
							Revolution in Spain, the <persRef key="monroe-james">President</persRef>
							wishes very much that a Minister should be there, and hopes that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth has anticipated that such would be
							the natural consequence of the change, and concluded not to use the
							permission to return— The last advices from M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Forsyth are of the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							April, when he was at Bordeaux, and had not received my Letter of 11.
							February— It had been sent in triplicates, and it is quite extraordinary
							that after so long a time he had not received either of them. He must in
							every probability have received one of them, within a few days after,
							and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Forsyth must very shortly know from
							himself what his determination was upon receiving the permission to come
							home— If it was to use it, he must be now on his passage, and will soon
							arrive— If, to wait for further Instructions, she must be very soon
							informed <pb type="ms" n="358"/>of it, and may then safely take her
							passage to go and join him; which she could not now do without the risk
							of crossing him on the Ocean— Meigs said he should so advise her. She is
							naturally the more anxious having since the beginning of this Month lost
							a fine child; a girl between three and four years old— <persRef
								ref="salmon-hilario">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Salmon</persRef> came to ask for an answer to a Note from <persRef
								ref="laserna-mateo">La Serna</persRef> of 1. April. requesting a
							remission of duties levied upon the Cargo, belonging as he alledges to
							the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">King of Spain</persRef>, of a Vessel
							taken by one of the piratical privateers; sent into Philadelphia, and
							restored to <persRef ref="ronquenet-donbartholome">the Spanish
								Consul</persRef>— The Cargo was bonded for re-exportation, by the
							Consul; but in granting the drawback, 2 1/2 per Cent on the duties with
							the additional 10 per Cent for the foreign bottom were retained— It is
							for the restoration of this that La Serna applies; on the ground that as
							the King’s proper, involuntarily brought in, and never intended to be
							sold or landed here, no duties upon it should have been levied— Upon
							this Affair I am to consult the <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"

						<!-- This is a summary entry without a date.-->
						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day. </hi></date>I have never been more overcrowded with business than
							through the course of this Month; nor have I ever more thoroughly felt
							the essential obstacle to a good Journal; namely the impossibility of
							transacting and recording much important business at the same time— I
							rise, between half past four and six: at a usual average of half-past
							five; and write in this Diary till 9. Give a cursory perusal to the
							newspapers; this and other casual avocations or visitors detain me till
							12 or 1. before I reach my Office— There I stay till 5 or 6. in
							continual tumult of visitors on business, reading the Letters by the two
							daily Mails, writing answers by snatches to some, and giving directions
							for the answers to others— While the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> was here, after reading the Letters by the
							Mails, I took the most important of them to the President, and received
							his directions concerning them— Occasional Cabinet Meetings have also
							been held at his house. I have made several attempts without success to
							go earlier in the Morning to the Office, and return earlier to my house
							before dinner— I can get earlier to the Office, but when there always
							get too much entangled in business to return home before five or six—
							About six I dine; and the weather having been great part of the Month
							cool, I have often been able to write an hour or two in the Evening— To
							increase activity, by voluntary aggravation of labour, I continue making
							the Index to my old Journals from 1795 to 1809. The general impression
							upon my mind in reviewing the Journal of that time is its extreme
							inanity. It contains scarcely ever, either observation or
							reflection—incident or character—grave remark, or sally of humour. It
							names the persons with whom I dined or played Cards; the walks that I
							took—the visits that I paid or received; the Books that I read; and
							sometimes the Letters that I wrote or received. It records no operation
							of the Mind and scarcely ever a Sentiment of the heart— Its interest to
							me consists in the recollections that it brings back; as the scattered
							single Letters remaining undefaced upon a decayed monument, may serve
							the practiced antiquary to trace the whole original inscription— I have
							spent too much of my life in plodding upon the thoughts of others, and
							too little in cultivating my own—too much in passive study, and too
							little in active energy— My life has therefore been laborious and
							unproductive— Until the year 1806. whatever of intellect I did exercise
							is contained in my Letter-Books; and nothing in my Journals.— The really
							important period of my life began with the British attack upon our
							Chesapeake Frigate in the Summer of 1807. Since then my Journal has been
							a record of events, opinions and important Conversations; but it is only
							more prolix without being more interesting, and will never be fit for
							exposure to any eye but my own. There are parts of it, which my
							Children, should it please Heaven to make any one of them worthy of his
							Grandsire, may take pleasure in consulting when I shall be in the dust.
							In coming to this passage, if he too should have spent a large portion
							of his days in studious idleness, let him solace himself with the
							conclusion which is my principal comfort, that he can be no other than
							what God and nature have made him; and that although not gifted with
							Genius, his mediocrity has not been without usefulness in the World— Not
							all can have the Wisdom of the Serpent— All can be harmless as the
							Dove.</p>
