						<p><date>1. VII:30. </date>Tuesday. <persRef ref="pinkney-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Pinkney</persRef> came for a
							Passport. He is going to embark in the Packet for Cuxhaven: to proceed
							from Hamburg to Elseneur; and there to take passage for S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg to join <persRef
								ref="pinkney-william">his father</persRef>. He was compelled by the
							state of his health to leave him at Vienna, and came to Paris and London
							for the Winter. <persRef ref="jouffroy-georg">Jouffroy</persRef> the
							Prussian Charge d’Affaires came, and told me he had made an excuse to
							Fernan Nuñez for to-morrow, and would come out and dine with us to
							morrow at Ealing. I had asked him on Sunday Evening, but he then pleaded
							an engagement to <persRef ref="delosrios-carlos">Fernan Nuñez</persRef>—
							I asked also <persRef ref="pfeffel-christian">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pfeffel</persRef>, the Bavarian Minister, and <persRef
								ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poletica</persRef>, both of whom had engagements. Jouffroy told me
							that his Government had appointed <persRef ref="greuhm-frederick">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Greuhm</persRef> who was sometime here
							as Chargé d’Affaires, to go as Prussian Minister to the United
							States—and that he expected him here on his way to America by the end of
							the Month. I spoke to Jouffroy about the misunderstanding between this
							and the Prussian Courts relative to the <persRef ref="frederica-sophia"
								>Duchess of Cumberland</persRef>. He gave me some particulars
							concerning it, but let them out with reserve and reluctance. He said
							that the <persRef ref="charlotte2">Queen’s</persRef> refusal to receive
							the Duchess had been much instigated by tittle tattle scandal, from the
								<persRef ref="catherinepavlovna">Queen of Wirtemberg</persRef>. That
							the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef> though he had not
							taken part against the Duchess, might however have prevented the
							extremities to which things have been pushed, and have reconciled all
							the parties, if he had chosen— That the <persRef ref="ernest-augustus"
								>Duke</persRef> himself by his violence had contributed to make the
							breach as it now is utterly and forever irreparable. That <persRef
								ref="vonjacobikloest-konstans">Baron Jacobi</persRef> had very
							injudiciously taken up the affair without Instructions, in a very high
							tone, and most absurdly by attacking <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert"
								>Lord Castlereagh</persRef> about it; who could have had no concern
							in the Queen’s animosities, and could have no influence in removing
							them. That the <persRef ref="frederick-william-iii">king of
								Prussia</persRef> had indeed approved of Jacobi’s proceedings after
							the fact; because he had been unwilling formally to disapprove the acts
							of an old and faithful Servant; but the approbation had been merely
							formal. Jacobi was now living in retirement, in the neighbourhood of
							Dresden; and without any public employment. He had made the situation of
							a Prussian Minister here extremely aukward; for he could not appear at
							the Queen’s Drawing-Rooms, and that excluded him from a very extensive
							circle of Society— But that was not all. The Minister was exposed to
							meet the Queen at the Prince Regent’s, and to have the Queen turn her
							back upon him, as she had turned her back upon Baron Jacobi— Et c’est
							que, quand La Reine tourne le dos, tout le monde tourna le dos— The
							matter had now become involved in such inextricable confusion; and the
							Queen had become so inveterate that it never could be reconciled during
							her life; and she might live these ten years. The Duke and Duchess would
							ultimately be obliged to go and live in Germany, for the manner of
							interdict under which they were living here, would in the end prove
							insupportable. Indeed they ought not to have come here, after they knew
							how the Queen was indisposed towards the Duchess— Jouffroy cautiously
							avoided mentioning if he knew the particular causes of the Queen’s
							displeasure, and they are not publicly known— I finished a Letter to
								<persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> that I have been these
							three days writing, and shortened my Morning walk to an hour. I dined at
							the <persRef ref="ryder-dudley">Earl of Harrowby’s</persRef>, 29.
							Grosvenor Square— <persRef ref="lieven-christopher;lieven-dorothea"
								>Count and Countess Lieven</persRef>, <persRef

									M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bourke</persRef>, Counts
								<persRef ref="delosrios-carlos">Fernan Nuñez</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="desousaholstein-pedro">Palmella</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="deriquet-georges">Caraman</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="neumann-philipp">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Neumann</persRef>, <persRef ref="bathurst-henry;bathurst-georgina"
								>Earl and Countess Bathurst</persRef>, and their eldest <pb n="164"
								type="ms"/><persRef ref="bathurst-louisa">daughter</persRef>, formed
							the Company, with the family; Earl and <persRef ref="ryder-susanna"
								>Countess of Harrowby</persRef>, and their eldest daughter <persRef
								ref="ryder-susan">Lady Susan Ryder</persRef>. There was one <persRef
								ref="ryder-louisa">other daughter</persRef> a child of four or five
							years, in the Drawing-Room before dinner; and <persRef
								ref="ryder-georgianna;ryder-harriet">two daughters</persRef> of
							perhaps twelve and fourteen after dinner— There was altogether a
							general, and a very pleasing appearance of domestic life about the house
							and family. I was seated at table between the Countess of Bathurst, and
							Lady Susan Ryder, whom I found very agreeable &amp; sensible. She is one
							of the most beautiful and fashionable young Ladies of the Court— Lady
							Bathurst told me that <persRef ref="herveybathurst-felton">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Harvey</persRef>, who is to marry
								<persRef ref="hervey-louisa">Miss Louisa Caton</persRef>, was a
							relation of Lord Bathurst’s— Fernan Nuñez before dinner, asked me if I
							had any late accounts from the United States— There was an Article in
							this Morning’s Newspapers, of 11. February from New-Orleans, stating
							that Spain had ceded the two Floridas to the United States. He asked me
							if I knew any thing of it. I said I knew it could not be true; because
							there were authentic Accounts from Washington, to the last days in
							February, when a voluminous Correspondence with the Spanish Government
							was communicated by the <persRef ref="madison-james">President</persRef>
							to Congress, from which it appeared that no arrangement with Spain had
							then been made— He then said etes vous maintenant content de <persRef
								ref="onis-luis">Monsieur Onis</persRef>— I answered laughing that I
							certainly could not be otherwise than content with him, not having the
							honour of any personal acquaintance, and never having been in any direct
							relation with him. But he said he meant to ask whether the Government
							were satisfied with him— I said that when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Onis had been first received it was not without reluctance on the part
							of the Government, because his previous conduct had given Offence; and
							about a year ago it had been mentioned to me in a despatch that there
							was some personal dissatisfaction, but since then I had not heard of any
							further cause of complaint. I added that I most earnestly hoped that
							Spain and the United States would not quarrel with each other— He said
							that he very cordially concurred in the same hope; and that the policy
							of his Government was entirely pacific; a very decided proof of which
							they had just given, by asking for the Mediation of the Allies in their
							dispute with Portugal— I told him I had seen it intimated, and had
							thought it probable, the invasion of Buenos Ayres had been by some
							understanding between the Governments of Spain, and Brazil— He said Oh
							No! none in the world. But Spain, instead of invading Portugal, as she
							might have done upon such provocation had preferred to ask the Mediation
							of the Allies; and he could tell me confidentially that was the business
							upon which he was going to Paris— He asked me who was our Minister at
							Paris, and when I told him, said he thought he had seen <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> here. I gave M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bourke the letter from <persRef ref="jaques-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jaques</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="rosenkrantz-niels">Baron Rosenkrantz</persRef>, which he
							promised to forward the next Post-day. After dinner Earl Bathurst asked
							me whether I was acquainted with <persRef ref="cobbett-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cobbett</persRef>, and whether I
							thought the American Government would give him any encouragement. I said
							I had never seen him; and did not suppose there would be any intercourse
							between him and the American Government— I knew not what his projects or
							intentions were in going to America; but if he should interest himself
							much in the Politics of that Country, I should, from the character of
							his mind expect very soon to see him writing against that Government—
							Lord Bathurst agreed in that opinion; and said Cobbett was a very vain
							man, though he certainly had the talent of writing with great effect to
							a certain Class of readers— He said Cobbett’s change of Politics had
							proceeded from two causes—first <persRef ref="windham-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Windham</persRef> had invited him to
							dine at his house with <persRef ref="pitt-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pitt</persRef>. He had there
							introduced him to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pitt, who had taken
							little or no notice of him beyond that of common civility— This gave him
							an immediate and decided turn against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Pitt: and he had afterwards quarreled with Windham; because being in
							power, Windham had declined appointing him Under Secretary of State— I
							think however there were other causes— Madame Bourke had a party made up
							to play whist with her; but I came home about ten, leaving all the rest
							of the company there.</p>

						<p><date>7. VI:15. </date>Easter-Monday. I wrote Letters of introduction for
								<persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, to <persRef
								ref="lafayette">General La Fayette</persRef>, and to <persRef
								ref="hottinguer-jean">Baron Hottinguer</persRef> at Paris—and after
							an early Breakfast went with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef> and him to London. I called at the <persRef
								ref="desousaholstein-pedro">Portuguese Minister’s</persRef>, to
							enquire whether it would be necessary to appear at the Te Deum in Court
							Dresses; and found it would not. We went to Craven-Street; and I
							returned at half past eleven to the Portuguese Chapel, next door to the
							Minister’s House in South-Audley Street— Count Palmella himself and the
							members of his Legation were in full Court-Uniforms— The tribune is a
							small apartment partitioned off from the body of the chapel and at the
							right hand of the Altar— The Corps Diplomatique were alone admitted to
							it by Cards. I was the first there, excepting Palmella and his Legation—
							The Mass began immediately afterwards— The other foreign Ministers
							dropped in successively— There were present the Austrian <persRef
								ref="esterhazy-paul">Ambassador Prince Esterhazy</persRef>, with one
							of his Secretaries, <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count
								Lieven</persRef> the Russian Ambassador, with the Counsellor of

							with the Secretary of Embassy, <persRef ref="deriquet-georges">Count

							Montellano, the <persRef ref="ruffo-fabrizio">Prince of

								<persRef ref="bourke-edmund">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bourke</persRef>, Danish, and <persRef ref="pfeffel-christian">M<hi

							&amp; <persRef ref="jouffroy-georg">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jouffroy</persRef> the Prussian Chargé d’Affaires— The members of
							the Corps not present, were <persRef ref="fagel-hendrik">Baron
								Fagel</persRef>, Ambassador of the Netherlands, and <persRef
								ref="fagel-robert">his brother</persRef>, Secretary to the Embassy,
								<persRef ref="u">Baron Just</persRef>, the Saxon, and <persRef
								ref="u">General Neuffer</persRef> the Wurtemberg &amp; <persRef
								ref="munster-ernst">Count Munster</persRef> the Hanoverian Minister;
							and the <persRef ref="u">Marquis de Grimaldi</persRef>, Sardinian Chargé
							d’Affaires— These with the Turkish Chargé d’Affaires, <persRef ref="u"
								>Ramadani</persRef> constitute all the foreign Missions now in
							England— The Mass took up at least two hours, and the Te Deum that
							succeeded about three quarters of an hour more— The Organ was good and
							the singing all excellent. Most of the vocal performers at the Opera,
							are attached to this or some other of the Roman Catholic Chapels,
							belonging to the Foreign Legations— It gives them the privileges allowed
							to the suite of Public Ministers, which is ample compensation to them
							for the occasional call to sing at the religious solemnities— The
							principal singularity that I remarked this day was the English
							pronunciation of the Latin, as chaunted by two of the Priests who were
							Englishmen— The third who was a Frenchman, made an attempt to pronounce
							like them, but could not support it and soon relapsed into his French
							Pronunciation— I remarked that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourke the
							Danish Minister joined in the devotional parts of the Ceremony, and
							found upon enquiry that he was a Roman Catholic. <persRef
								ref="bourke-theobald">His father</persRef>, he said was an Irishman
							who emigrated from Ireland on account of Religion— He was himself the
							first Roman Catholic that the King of Denmark had ever employed in
							Missions abroad—but since then there had been several others— He
							remarked as a curious circumstance indicating the increased religious
							liberality of the age, that the Danish Lutheran Church in London was
							under his protection, as Danish Minister, though a Roman Catholic; while
							the Bavarian Roman Catholic chapel, was under the protection of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pfeffel, a Protestant; and the
							Russian-Greek Chapel was under that of Count Lieven who is a Lutheran.—
							He explained to me several of the particularities of the ceremony, and
							the several occasions at which they kneel; as at the Gloria Patri— And
							he pointed out to me a lamp at the right of the Altar—with five knobs
							significant of Christ’s five wounds at the Crucifixion. Two in the feet,
							two in the hands and one in the side— This lamp is always hung up at
							Easter, and remains suspended forty days, the time from the Resurrection
							during which Christ continued to be seen upon Earth— And on Ascension
							day it is taken away— Towards the close of the ceremony this day, there
							was a Lady introduced into the Tribune, I believe at the desire of the
							Marquis d’Osmond— After it was over, we were invited into the house,
							where a very elegant cold collation was provided, and to which all the
							Portuguese Subjects now in London were invited. There were about 150
							persons. Among them was the <persRef ref="delima-lourenco">Count de
								Lima</persRef>, with whom I some time since dined at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourke’s—the same of whom the <persRef
								ref="depradt-dominique">Abbé de Pradt</persRef> tells the Story of
							his having pronounced a superb No! to the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef> at Bayonne.— It
							was about three O’Clock; when we came away— I asked Fernan Nuñez when he
							expected to go to Paris— He said immediately after the Celebration of
							the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent’s</persRef> Birth-day, which
							is to be the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of this Month. His Court,
							he said were very urgent for him to hasten his departure; but it would
							not be decent for him to go before then— I called at <persRef
								ref="king-eliza;king-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp;
									M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> King’s</persRef> for <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, but she was gone. On
							returning to Craven Street I answered a Letter from <persRef
								ref="green-jh">J. H. Green</persRef>; a person who has written to me
							to enquire if the American Consul at Bristol could furnish relief on
							public Account to an American woman in distress— And I wrote Letters of
							introduction for George to <persRef ref="meulemeester-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> J. Meulemeester</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="cornelissen-edige">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cornelissen</persRef> at Ghent. George himself had been out to
							Ealing for his Passport, which he had forgotten this Morning to take
							with him— He returned to dinner— We left his trunk at <persRef
								ref="boyd-john3">General Boyd’s</persRef> lodgings N. 15 Sackville
							Street; where he is to lodge this Night— And they are to go off in the
							Stage for Dover, at half past six, <pb n="167" type="ms"/>to-morrow
							Morning. I returned with my wife this Evening to Ealing; and we reached
							home between nine &amp; ten O’Clock. I find myself not altogether well,
							and for some days past depressed more in Spirits than in health— Every
							Man knows the Plague of his own Heart— Mine is the impossibility of
							remaining where I am; and the treacherous Prospect of the future— Let me
							hope.</p>

							four animals resembling the Elk Deer, brought from the upper Missouri

							two females; the eldest as they say but six years old, and only about
							half grown. The males have branched horns which they shed from time to
							time, and which grow again as fast as eighteen inches in a Month. Both
							the Males had cast their horns within the last Month; and the new horns
							were already considerably grown. The growing horns could scarcely be
							called so for they were not harder than a stuffed Cushion, and felt hot
							to the hand— The animals are tame and perfectly harmless— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson left us as we came out. We went
							to see Toby the Sapient pig; but it was not the time of exhibiting him.
							At half past four we went to N. 12. Paper Buildings in the Temple; the

								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>. They came home
							between nine and ten in the Evening. I walked along the Canal, and
							returned by the way of Hanwell. Dined alone, and in the Evening, I read
							two of <persRef ref="horsley-samuel">Bishop Horsley’s</persRef> Sermons
							upon the 45<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm. There are four; but I
							had already read the two former ones. They have a very high reputation
							in this Country, and are undoubtedly discourses of great learning and
							ingenuity— But they are dogmatical and bigoted; and their object is to
							inculcate doctrines so odious that I could not believe them if I would.
							Here are four Sermons to explain one Psalm; and if the Bishop’s
							exposition is correct, the Psalm has been waiting three thousand years
							to be made at last intelligible by him. <persRef ref="calvin-john"
								>Calvin</persRef>, and other expositors, and even the English
							translators of the Bible in <persRef ref="elizabeth-i"
								>Elizabeth’s</persRef> reign supposed this was a nuptial song on the
							marriage of <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>, with mystical
							allusions to the Messiah; but the Bishop charges Calvin with want of
							taste and with poverty of imagination; and insists that Solomon had
							nothing to do with the Psalm, which was all, about the Messiah— The
							exposition of Calvin appears to me, much better supported by the tenor
							of the Psalm than the Bishop’s— How far it was applicable to the
							Messiah, may be subject of doubt and controversy— The Hebrew seems to
							have been a language never completely formed; very indefinite in the
							force of its terms, and remarkably destitute of precision— The Psalm is
							Poetical, and Oriental Poetry; that is figurative to excess. It purports
							to be a marriage Song, for a King, a Conqueror, and his Bride— It could
							not apply to Solomon says Bishop Horsley, because he was not a Warrior.
							But how can it apply to Jesus who not only was no Warrior; but never was
							married. By the mystical exposition which out of any thing will make
							every thing. The Messiah is a Conqueror, and Christ is the husband of
							the Church. All this may or may not be true— I should be sorry to stake
							my faith in Christianity upon the mystical meaning of the forty-fifth
							Psalm; or on the question of Calvin’s taste or Bishop Horsley’s richness
							of imagination— But when the Bishop tells me that “It is the mere cant
							of puritanism to allege the precept of mutual forgiveness, the
							prohibitions of returning evil for evil, and of resisting persecution as
							reprobating religious Wars”—and at the same time contends that “the
							peaceable submission of the subject to the very worst of kings is one of
							the most peremptory precepts of Christianity,” I hold him to be
							preaching doctrines false, pernicious and damnable; for which if eternal
							punishment could be compatible with a merciful &amp; benevolent
							dispenser of it, the Bishop would be a promising Candidate for it— For
							if there be one species of perverseness more detestable than any other,
							it is that which inculcates vicious principle under the sanctified garb
							of religious instruction— But so it is and so it always will be with
							Priests, who are at the same time Lords— Horsley was not worse than
								<persRef ref="massillon-jean">Massillon</persRef>— In merely human
							enmities there is nothing so remorseless, as in the rancours of a
							Bishop.<space/>George<space/>John 4 f 8 1/2 i. Charles 4 f 2 3/4 i.</p>

							of which is to establish by an argument drawn from the context, the
							authenticity of 1. John V.7. and 8. a text of main reliance to the
							supporters of the Trinity, but which is stoutly disputed by the
							unitarians as spurious— The Bishop admits that the text has lately been
							given up by many sound trinitarians— He declines defending it directly;
							but he is unwilling to part with it, and endeavours to support it by an
							elaborate misconstruction of the verse immediately preceding— He
							considers the doctrines of the incarnation and atonement of Christ as
							indissolubly connected together, and marks it as the great distinction
							between this Christian dogma, and the incarnations (avatars) of <persRef
								ref="vishnu">Veeshnu</persRef> in the Hindu Mythology. It is an idle
							waste of subtlety to urge the incarnation or the atonement upon
							principles of human reason— The stumbling block is at the threshold.
							Atonement and Incarnation both transcend human reason.— If the Potter
							makes a vessel, with a flaw in it, either it is because he could not
							make it perfect, or he is himself responsible for the flaw. The vessel
							cannot be answerable for the frailty of its nature— It did not make
							itself. Had the Creator made Man perfect, he would not have fallen— The
							Creator is responsible for the consequences of the infirmity of his
							Creature— So says human reason— Existence was not the choice of <persRef
								ref="adam">Adam</persRef> or <persRef ref="eve">Eve</persRef>— But
							it was the will of the Creator to make them. He made them not for
							misery, but for enjoyment; and if he chose to make that enjoyment
							conditional, being omnipotent, he could have made them with firmness to
							resist temptation, and to fulfil the conditions imposed upon them—
							According to the Scriptures the woman was beguiled by a superior but
							fallen Spirit, and the man was led to ruin by the woman— They were
							punished in themselves and in all their posterity. They became beings
							degraded in the scale of Creations— Christ died to redeem them and their
							posterity. But how or why Christ’s death could redeem them, and how or
							why Almighty God, should himself become Man, to suffer and die for their
							redemption, is utterly inconceivable to human reason, and by human
							reason can never be explained— That the omnipotent God should have no
							better expedient for appeasing his own wrath at the transgression of a
							creature made by himself, but by becoming that creature and perishing
							upon the Cross is so little consonant to human reason, that it is hardly
							within the compass of pardonable human absurdities— Yet Bishop Horsley
							says that the incarnation of Christ was for a purpose which God only
							could accomplish, and God himself could accomplish in no other way—and
							that the same God who in one person exacts the punishment, in another
							himself sustains it; and thus makes his own mercy pay the satisfaction
							to his own justice— This is not Reason— It is Mystery.</p>

								Gilbert</persRef>, an Englishman who has resided many years in the

							receiving no answer to them, his wife became alarmed, and as they had
							then an invitation and a favourable opportunity to remove to Easton in
							the State of Pennsylvania, they suddenly went off leaving the farm at
							Acton to what might happen. He came now to enquire whether I thought he
							could recover it; and was encouraged by a Letter from Bond to some
							Relation of his in this Country, intimating that if he Gilbert were now

							Government, for his expences and trouble, and the delay of his ship
							occasioned by this occurrence— A <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tigere</persRef> a French Canadian
							came to enquire if he could obtain in the United States a Patent, or
							other encouragement from the Government for a species of writing paper
							of peculiar composition, and of his invention. He said it had been some
								<hi rend="strikethrough">months</hi> years since discovered in
							France that the oxy-muriatic acid, would take out completely every trace
							of the writing upon ordinary paper, without producing the slightest
							perceptible effect upon the Paper itself. As this afforded of course
							infinite facilities to forgery and fraud, he had invented a species of
							paper, in all other respects possessing the same qualities as ordinary
							Letter, or writing paper, but from which the writing could not be taken
							out. He was in the process of obtaining a patent for it here, and he
							wished also to have a Patent for it in the United States. I read to him
							the material part of the Laws of the United States relating to Patents.
							He said he was not yet a Citizen of the United States; though as a
							native of Canada, he very possibly might be hereafter. He was desirous
							of making in my presence experiments with his paper and its
							inaccessibility to the deleterious acid, which debauches all other
							paper, and I agreed to see him here next Tuesday at noon for the
							purpose— I paid visits to the Portuguese and Saxon Ministers, and left
							Cards withal, at <persRef ref="boddington-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Boddington’s</persRef> and the
								<persRef ref="delosrios-carlos">Spanish Ambassador’s</persRef>.
								<persRef ref="u">General Neuffer</persRef> the Wurtemberg Minister,
							who has been several weeks ill and confined to his house came in, while
							I was with <persRef ref="desousaholstein-pedro">Palmella</persRef>. I
							had received from him two days ago a Note, with a copy of the
							Constitution proposed by the king to the States of Wurtemberg, and three
							Memoranda, of enquiries concerning individuals in the United States. I
							thanked him for the copy of the Constitution, and made some remarks upon
							the enquiries, which at his request I promised to send him in writing. I
							had various desultory conversation with Count Palmella, and <persRef
								ref="u">Baron Just</persRef>, both of whom complained of the
							despotism exercised by the five great European Powers, over all the
							minor States. In speaking of their present Mediation between Spain and
							Portugal, he said Spain “a fait la sottise,” of aski.//— And those
							Gentlemen, who were always ready enough, “a se meler des affaires des
							autres,” had accepted the proposal of Spain; had agreed that the
							negotiation should be conducted by the Ministers of the several powers
							at Paris, and had addressed two Notes; one to the Spanish Government
							altogether complimentary; and the other to the Portuguese, also in very
							civil terms, but asking for explanations of the late movements of
							Brazilian troops into the Buenos Ayres territories, and intimating that
							unless these explanations should be given Spain would find “dans l’appui
							de ses hauts alliés,” a substitute for measures which would rekindle the
							flame of war in Europe. But he said there was not much meaning in that,
							for it did not appear that Spain had either the inclination or the power
							to commence a War against Portugal in Europe, nor could she be very
							formidable while her revenues should continue to fall short as they now
							do, of one quarter part of her expences— As to the invasion from Brazil
							of the Buenos Ayres territory, he said the justification of it was
							complicated, and arose from a multitude of circumstances in the peculiar
							situation of these Countries— He gave me some explanation of it, but was
							interrupted before he had finished, by the coming in of General Neuffer—
							I left them and called upon Baron Just, who with many enquiries about
							affairs in the United States, also complained of the great Powers. He
							said that Prussia, after having taken away from the <persRef
								ref="frederickaugustus-i">king of Saxony</persRef> one half of his
							territory was not content with that but was chicaning for twenty
							villages more. Austria had finally offered her mediation, and as it was
							accepted, Prussia would doubtless be obliged in the end to abide by the
							Treaty, and surely where the stipulation had the effect of taking away
							from a State its indisputable possessions, if there was any ambiguity in
							the expressions, the Construction must be in favour of the party which
							is already injured by the loss of its territories— But it was impossible
							to say what was to become of Germany— There was a mass of discontent
							among the People in all parts of it— The middle ranks of Society were in
							Germany <pb n="172" type="ms"/>more enlightened than in any other part
							of Europe, not excepting England; but they had not their due share of
							influence in the Governments, and were dissatisfied with their
							Condition. They felt as if they had escaped from one tyranny only to
							fall upon another— The situation of Germany was therefore, far more
							perilous than that of England. He was fully satisfied and had been so,
							from a very short time after he arrived in this Country that there was
							not the least danger of a Revolution here. One Ministry, and another
							might be overthrown— There might be “des Crises,” but no material change
							of the Government— When the debt comes to press too heavily, which it
							will before long they will tax the Stockholders, some how or other; no
							matter how; and they must put up with it, as well as they can.— It will
							produce no commotion in the state— I told him that was my own opinion;
							but I thought the obstinacy with which the Government now persisted in
							refusing to tax the Stockholders, would increase their difficulties, and
							ultimately weaken the Nation. He also thought that Great Britain had
							been at the Zenith of her power, and must henceforth decline— I wished
							to have seen Count Fernan-Nuñez, but he was not at home— Palmella asked
							me if the United States had been invited to accede to the Holy Alliance—
							I believed not, and supposed there might be two reasons for the
							omission. One that by the policy both of Europe and of the United States
							they were totally disconnected with the general politics and alliances
							of the European Powers— The other was that the Holy Alliance had been a
							personal League between the Sovereigns, signed by themselves. He said
							that by the general purport of the Holy League the United States had as
							much interest in its professed object as any European power— The other
							reason could not apply, because it went to exclude all Republics from
							the League. Yet the Swiss Cantons had been invited to join, and had
							acceded to it— He added that the real object and effect of the Holy
							League was not fully disclosed. It would be good or bad according to its
							application. The <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef>
							was ambitious; and if it should be made an instrument of his ambition it
							might effect bad purposes. He said Portugal had been invited to accede
							to it; but the answer from Rio Janeiro had not yet been received— While
							I was out this day <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife’s</persRef> old acquaintances <persRef ref="thorpe-samuel;u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tigere</persRef> came at Noon the time
							appointed, and shewed me his experiments upon paper. His oxy-muriatic
							acid, took out immediately the writing from several papers to which it
							was applied, some recently written, and some that had been seven years
							standing. It had scarcely any perceptible effect upon the paper. Among
							the rest I took out the work “Daschkoff” from the despatch I had written
							this Morning; at a place where I had written it by mistake; and as soon
							as the paper was dry, I wrote the name of “Hopkinson” in its stead; as
							it should in the first instance have been written. Tigere observed that
							the action of the acid was strongly counteracted by full day-light, and
							particularly Sunshine— He had several pieces of paper of various kinds
							prepared with his composition, upon which the effect of the acid was,
							not to take out the writing, but merely to turn it blue. He had also
							other acids, the vitriolic, tartaric, and oxalic, which took out the
							writing, but at the same time affected the paper, so that it could not
							be written upon again without discolouring and spreading of the ink. I
							told him I had no doubt he could obtain a Patent in the United States,
							for his Paper, and offered him any facility in my power for obtaining
							it. He wished to have some Paper-maker in America recommended to him, to
							whom he could propose a partnership with him for making the papers— All
							the ingredients for his composition, six in number were to be procured
							in the United States, and it would not increase the price of the paper
							more than a shilling Sterling a ream. He also wished that the Bank of
							the United States would determine to have their paper made with his
							preparation; for both which objects I told him I was not now enabled to
							assist him but might be hereafter. He is to call upon me again. <persRef

								Caldecott</persRef> a Surgeon and Accoucheur who has a project of
							going to settle in America, and has already written to me, and visited
							me on the subject, came now and told me he had made up his mind to go;
							but he should first go alone, and leave his family behind— I rather
							dissuaded this Gentleman from going when he called upon me before; and
							now again set before him the difficulties, and overstocked competition,
							which he must have to encounter in his profession in that Country; and
							the necessity he might be under of practising as a physician as well as
							a Surgeon, and perhaps of becoming also an Apothecary, as in many parts
							of the interior of America, where it would probably be more expedient
							for him to go, than to fix himself in any of the large Cities, all these
							professions were united in one. He appeared to be somewhat staggered in
							his resolution but said he would call upon me again before he should
							finally conclude to go. There came then a Man who has formed a scheme
							for supplying the City of New-York with Salmon. He wanted some promise
							of support or encouragement in the undertaking which I could not give
							him, though I thought it very likely to succeed. A woman named <persRef
								ref="mackey-margaret">Margaret Mackey</persRef> who came from
							America with <persRef ref="patterson-marianne">M<hi rend="superscript"

							inviting us to her wedding at the <persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Duke

								ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Aspinwall</persRef> came with the Account for the Cartel, Margaret

								<persRef ref="williams-samuel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S.
								Williams</persRef>, wishing to send her to Boston gave to Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Aspinwall for the purpose. The Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> himself therefore fits her out; and asked
							my advice as to the number of men that he should allow as composing the
							crew, and what he should charge for the passage of the others. I told
							him I was not authorized to contract in these cases, but merely to
							inspect the Consular Accounts, which after all must be settled at the
							Treasury. That he was in this instance in the delicate situation of
							contracting for the public as an Officer, with himself as a Merchant,
							and the general advice I should give him was to make the terms of the
							contract, at least as favourable to the public as they had been when the
							bargain was with others. He then put down the charge of 76 Men at ten
							pounds each man; allowing three men, besides the Captain and Mate, for
							the crew. I thought the allowance small; but the vessel he said was
							small—scarcely of a hundred tons burthen. He wished to have charged the
							passages at ten-guineas a man, but in compliance with my advice reduced
							it to ten pounds— He said however that it would not even defray the cost
							he had been at, if the vessel had not been given him— He thought that
							should fairly have been his profit, and not that of the public— That the
							price of provisions had nearly doubled, since he made his former
							contracts for Cartels; and that he should not be able to contract in
							future at so low a rate. I gave him an order, on the <persRef
								ref="baringbrothers">Brothers Baring and C<hi rend="superscript"

							I took before dinner, for the last time a short walk round by Ealing
							Dean Common; and all the remainder of the day was so constantly occupied
							with packing up books and papers, that I had no time left for writing
							any thing. The accumulation of Books, pamphlets and Papers in the course
							of eight years that I have been in Europe, becomes on occasion of such a
							removal, inconvenient, and troublesome— Among the arts which are very
							useful to a person in a diplomatic career, is that of avoiding all
							superfluous incumbrance of baggage— I have had all my life a passion for
							collecting Books, of which I now feel the vanity. I have not
							sufficiently considered that a great library requires a great house for
							keeping it; which it has always been probable and is now quite certain
							that I shall never possess. My library has scarcely ever been of much
							use to me, for I have no sooner made a valuable collection of Books than
							I have been separated from them— It is probable that this will be my
							last <pb n="176" type="ms"/>removal from Europe; at least it is my wish
							to pass the remainder of my days in my own Country; but I shall have at
							least one more great removal in prospect before the last. In the mean
							time I shall continue to be separated from almost all my books, and
							deprived of all time for seeking either instruction or entertainment
							from any books— We passed the Eve at Cards with the children.</p>

						<p><date>27. VII:15. </date>I attended Church alone. Prayers for the third
							Sunday after Easter were read by <persRef ref="carr-colston">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Carr</persRef> the vicar, with a
							prayer for Rain— The Sermon was by <persRef ref="milman-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Milman</persRef>, from 1. Corinthians
							XV:33. “Be not deceived: Evil Communications corrupt good manners.”
							There was a glance at politics; slight however, and timid, disclosing
							the preacher’s zeal for preferment, which is certainly not cold— After
							church, I called and took leave of <persRef ref="elmsley-mary">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Elmsley</persRef>, of <persRef
								ref="nicholas-george2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nicholas</persRef> and of <persRef ref="dumouriez-charles">General
								Dumouriez</persRef>. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas’s
								<persRef ref="nicholas-caroline;nicholas-ellen">two eldest
								daughters</persRef> are in London, on a visit to <persRef
								ref="salmon-eliza">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Salmon</persRef>.
							I told him I should leave our Sons <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							with him until the time and manner of our departure shall be fixed— He
							renewed the assurance he had given me at Christmas time when I first
							gave him notice of our probable departure; that he should charge me for
							them only until the day when they should leave the school. The D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> spoke very favourably of John’s
							proficiency, and said there was not a boy in the school who had made
							sounder and more rapid progress in his studies during the time he has
							been there than he had. Of Charles his report was also good, but being
							so much younger he is not yet so steady; nor is his mind yet susceptible
							of fixing itself so intently upon study. I had some conversation with
							Dumouriez, who is more cautious in talking about French Affairs than
							heretofore— He lamented the absence of his friend the <persRef
								ref="edward">Duke of Kent</persRef>, who he said would reside abroad
							at least two years longer. And now, his other friend the <persRef
								ref="louis-philippe">Duke of Orleans</persRef> was also gone; and he
							told me all the particulars of the Duke’s return. He was not to reside
							at the Palais Royal, because it would have too much the appearance of a
							rival Court to that of the Tuileries and because it was in the very
							centre of the mauvaises Moeurs—a sort of prison, where he had no Garden,
							and could not step out of the house, without being overlooked and
							surrounded with spies— He had therefore determined to purchase the
							Estate of Rosny which had belonged to the famous <persRef
								ref="bethune-maximilien">Duke of Sully</persRef>, about fifteen
							leagues from Paris, and to reside there; but the <persRef ref="henry-iv"
								>king</persRef> himself had given him Neuilly in exchange for his
							stables in Paris which he the king had taken; and the Duke is to live
							there— It is only one league out of Paris, but it parries the objection
							of the rival Court, and will enable the Duke to go to Paris every week,
							and to transact all his business at his convenience. As to general
							affairs Dumouriez says it is very desirable that the king should live
							two years longer, or until the foreign troops shall have been withdrawn
							from France; and in that time every thing will settle into quiet— He
							trusts treacherous appearances— He spoke of the S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Helena Manuscript, a copy of which he shewed me with his
							own marginal Notes upon every page. He thinks it was written by the
								<persRef ref="depradt-dominique">Abbé de Pradt</persRef>. I objected
							that it was in that case an imposture, which I was willing to believe
							the Abbe, who was an Archbishop too honest a man to practice, and too
							prudent a man to hazard— As to the prudence, said Dumouriez, “il ne s’en
							vantera pas,” that is of the imposture and as to the honesty “est ce que
							Talleyrand n’a pas aussi été Evèque.” He added that Benjamin Constant
							had also been suspected to be the author of the manuscript, but it was
							not his manner, and besides <persRef ref="constant-benjamin">Benjamin
								Constant</persRef>
							<hi rend="italic">was</hi> an honest man. Another conjecture was that it
							had been written by <persRef ref="lascases-emmanuel">Las
							Cases</persRef>, upon materials furnished by <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Buonaparte</persRef>, in which case he said
							it would be genuine. Las Cases he said was, he believed no longer with
							him, but was now at the Cape of Good Hope. And if he wrote it, his
							object was to prepare the way for obtaining leave to return to France
							himself— There was he added some truth in the Book; and de l’Esprit. It
							was characteristic of the man, of the age, and of the French Nation. It
							was a sort of imitation of <persRef ref="rousseau-jean"
								>Rousseau’s</persRef> Confessions; but there was a style of mauvaise
							plaisenterie, and of persiflage in it which was not natural to
							Buonaparte; and there were things in it which he would not have said of
							himself. It did not represent him favourably to the world. I thought it
							curious to hear this objection from Dumouriez, who has published three
							volumes of Memoirs of his own life, of which the general opinion has
							been that they by no means gave a favourable representation of him. He
							admitted that the Manuscript was in sentiment and character very much
							like the account in <persRef ref="warden-william">Warden’s</persRef>
							Letters from S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Helena— Changing the
							subject he said he had read with much pleasure the speech of <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>,
							at his inauguration; and that he had been slightly acquainted with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe when he was here as Minister from
							the United States; having dined in company with him twice— He spoke
							likewise of the contest between Spain and Portugal concerning the
							invasion of the Buenos Ayres territory. He said that it was on the part
							of the Government at Rio Janeiro the greatest folly that ever was
							committed. For they had three Provinces adjoining those they had
							invaded, which were in a state of the most perfect preparation for
							insurrection themselves. The insurgents of the Spanish Colonies had
							hitherto avoided giving them encouragement because they did not wish to
							quarrel with the Government of Brezil; but now they will let loose their
							missionaries, and the insurrection will spread like wild-fire through
							those Provinces There was a Capitainerie de Saint Paul, in which all the
							good-for-nothing outcasts of all the world, the very refuse of mankind
							were congregated together— Another of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Vincent, which was no better, and a third which would join them for
							any-thing mischievous and pernicious. I said I thought the allied powers
							by their mediation would very easily settle the question as between
							Spain and Portugal, but I believed they would not find it so easy to
							arrange matters between the insurgents and Spain— It would be no
							trifling task, for the allies, to mediate the South-Americans into
							submission. He said it would <pb n="177" type="ms"/>be impossible— But
							your Government, he added, will have great trouble to avoid getting
							embroiled in that affair— Vous aurez quelques pages à ecrire sur ce
							sujet là— I said that was very likely; but the course of the American
							Government in relation to it was very plain—absolute neutrality.— I
							mentioned the <persRef ref="eustache-rene">Marquis d’Osmond the French
								Ambassador</persRef> to him; but he had very evidently no
							acquaintance with him; and spoke of him with great reserve. He said
								<persRef ref="esterhazy-paul">Prince Esterhazy</persRef> was going
							to take the Duke of Orleans’s place at Richmond; and that like all the
							Austrian Ambassadors he had ever known, his hope of Paradise was to go
							as Ambassador to Paris— The <persRef ref="esterhazy-maria"
								>Princess</persRef>, wanted to go still more—c’est un enfant, and
							here she cries her eyes out with ennui— The old General came out with me
							to his gate, and bade me farewell with a compliment in the French style—
								<persRef ref="jouffroy-georg">Jouffroy</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="deriquet-georges">Count Caraman</persRef> came out from London
							and paid us a visit. All the remainder of the day we were busied in
							packing trunks of books, papers, and apparel. John and Charles returned
							after dinner to school.</p>

						<p><date>29. VII:30. </date>Visit this morning from <persRef
								ref="bentham-jeremy">Jeremy Bentham</persRef>, on occasion of some
							correspondence he has had with <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef>, the late President
							of the United States; to whom Bentham in the year 1811. made a proposal
							to prepare for the use of the United States, or of any one of them, a

							system of legislation. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison answered
							the Letter last Summer, of course, though with very obliging expressions
							of acknowledgment and regret, declining the proposal. Last Evening I
							found on the table a note from <persRef ref="koe-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Koe</persRef>, to <persRef
								ref="smith-john">Smith</persRef> mentioning that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bentham would call here this Morning, and
							there were copies of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison’s Letter to
							him, and of a message from <persRef ref="snyder-simon">Governor
								Snyder</persRef> to the Legislature of Pennsylvania, respecting M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bentham’s proposal. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bentham came this morning; but told me his
							only object now was to arrange a time for seeing me again: he engaged me
							to dine with him next Tuesday. He said he wished to have much
							conversation with me, and particularly concerning family Relations of my
							own. I did not understand what he meant by this. He left me the pamphlet
							containing his Letter of 1811 to President Madison; and promised me the
							second part of his Chrestomathia, which I have not been able to procure
							at the Bookseller’s— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bentham is a man of
							70. somewhat eccentric in his deportment, but of great ingenuity and
							benevolence. He told me that he was a radical reformist, and should in a
							few days publish a Book on the subject. <persRef ref="burdett-francis"
								>Sir Francis Burdett’s</persRef> motion for reform he said would not
							be brought forward until some days after the publication of his Book,
							which was written for Sir Francis, and at his request— He said also that
								<persRef ref="cartwright-john">Major Cartwright</persRef> wished to
							call upon me, and asked if I should be willing to see him. I said I
							should receive him with much pleasure— <persRef ref="coles-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Coles</persRef> came and took leave;
							going to-morrow to the North of England, Scotland and Ireland. I wrote a
							note to <persRef ref="u">General Neuffer</persRef> the Minister of
							Wurtemberg, and several Letters. <persRef ref="giusta-antoine"
								>Antoine</persRef> came to town with the remainder of our baggage
							and furniture from Little-Ealing. Some of the Trunks were left at
							Craven-Street and the rest sent to Bishopsgate Church-Yard, at the
							Consul’s Office. On my <pb n="178" type="ms"/>walk before dinner I
							procured at a shop in the Strand a couple of Box-Opera tickets. <persRef
								ref="grubb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb</persRef>
							dined with us; after dinner I went with <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> to the Opera, where
							we saw <persRef ref="mozart-wolfgang">Mozart’s</persRef> Il Don
							Giovanni, with the Ballet of L’Amour et La Folie. I had not been to the
							Italian Opera in London before since the year 1783—nor then I think more
							than once. It was then a heavy, dull kind of entertainment, and has
							acquired additional perfection in those qualities since. The Theatre is
							enormous, with six rows of boxes and a Gallery proportionably large— The
							greater part of the boxes belong to individual proprietors— The tickets
							for all the boxes and for the Pit, are at half a guinea; but the owners
							of the boxes let them often for a Night, and there are shopkeepers in
							various parts of the town who act as brokers for the disposal of such
							tickets. They are usually to be had below the regular theatre price; but
							this Opera of Don Juan has been just brought out and is in its run, so
							that the tickets sold at their full price— Each box is fitted up to
							contain only six persons; and the partitions between them are made so as
							to prevent the people in any box from seeing their neighbours. They look
							like so many pigeon holes— As this is an Entertainment which the people
							of Rank and Fashion affect to keep confined as much as possible
							exclusively to themselves, they have established it as a rule that every
							body must go dressed as for an Evening party; and gentlemen are not
							admitted in boots— But the Establishment has still more than the two
							National Theatres the marks of mingled extravagance and decay. The whole
							property has been lately sold twice over for insolvency by decrees of
							the Court of Chancery. The performers, both singers and dancers are not
							of the highest order. <persRef ref="fodor-josephine">Madame
								Fodor-Maïnvielle</persRef> is the Prima Donna, and <persRef
								ref="crivelli-gaetano">Crivelli</persRef>, whom I had also seen at
							the Odeon is the best male singer here. <persRef ref="angrisani-carlo"
								>Angrisani</persRef> who was scarcely suffered on that Theatre, now
							appears in considerable parts, and there is a <persRef ref="u">Signora
								Hughes</persRef>, absolutely not fit, either to be seen or heard—
							Don Juan is a sort of mongrel Tragi-Comedy, half seria, half buffa— The
							music partakes of this character— It is neither pathetic, nor gay, nor
							tender, with the exception of one song of Zerlina, which is a little of
							all this— There is, as in most of Mozart’s Music something delicious to
							my ear, while I hear it; but nothing that strikes at the time, and
							vibrates upon the memory afterwards.— With true genuine first rate
							Italian singers and performers there might be some comic humour in
								<persRef ref="leporello">Leporello</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="zerlina">Zerlina</persRef>; but <persRef ref="naldi-giuseppe"
								>Naldi</persRef> and <persRef ref="fodor-josephine">Madame
								Fodor</persRef> cannot move a risible muscle— Don Juan was tolerably
							performed by <persRef ref="ambrogetti-giuseppe">Ambrogetti</persRef>;
							but the music of his part is little, and as a singer he is not equal to
							Crivelli— The Ballet was miserable. <persRef ref="u'u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and Madame Batiste</persRef> are the
							principal dancers. No <persRef ref="vestris-auguste">Vestris</persRef>—
							No <persRef ref="duport-louis">Duport</persRef>— No <persRef
								ref="gardel-marie">Madame Gardel</persRef>— No <persRef

								Bigottini</persRef>—decayed french pirouette makers, and clumsy

								>his Son</persRef> still wished to go to America, and enter the

							Franklin is now preparing for publication an octavo Edition of <persRef
								ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Franklin’s</persRef> Correspondence—the Quarto Edition of the Volume
							published last December, being already exhausted. The first Volume
							containing the Memoirs of the Doctor’s life, written by himself lingers.
							The connected Memoirs written by the D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							himself come only to the year 1757. but there are two subsequent tracts
							one of which contains a full account of the publication of <persRef
								ref="hutchinson-thomas">Governor Huchinson’s</persRef> Letters—
							Franklin mentioned to me the publication in four Volumes by <persRef
								ref="duane-william2">Duane</persRef>, who he said had offered him
							500 copies of it, in exchange for a certain portion of the work
							published here. But <pb n="179" type="ms"/>by Duane’s having 500 copies
							of his book to dispose of, it probably did not meet with a ready sale.
							He had published a number of public Letters, to which it did not appear
							how he had obtained access; and some which ought not to have been
							published at-all. He, Franklin had not thought himself authorised to
							publish any of the joint-Letters of the <persRef
								ref="jay-john;adams-john">Plenipotentiaries at the Peace</persRef>
							of 1783. I observed that there were several Letters in his Volume, and
							particularly one, containing expressions concerning the <persRef
								ref="george-iii">king</persRef>, which I should have thought it
							dangerous to publish in this Country, even now. He said he had been
							accused of having sold the Doctor’s papers to the British Government— If
							he had suppressed any of the passages like that to which I alluded, it
							would have been attributed to the like unworthy motives— He had
							therefore resolved to publish the whole, be the consequences what they
							might. He did not suppose the Government would take notice of those
							passages, but he expected to be violently attacked for them in the
							Quarterly Review— He had first offered the work to <persRef
								ref="murray-john3">Murray</persRef>, the publisher of the Quarterly
							Review; but he after having the manuscript several days had returned it,
							and declined having any thing to do with the publication. He said the
							octavo Edition now publishing would contain considerable new Matter, and
							among the rest, shewed me the proof sheet upon which there were three
							Letters from the Doctor to <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>
							dated in October 1781. I asked Franklin if he knew any thing now of the
							Hartley Family, or of <persRef ref="whitefoord-caleb">Caleb
								Whitefoord</persRef>— They are all dead; and of the Hartley’s he
							knew nothing more. Whitefoord he says married and left two children.
							Franklin himself, whom I had not seen for more than twenty years, has
							grown fat, and his resemblance to his grandfather has greatly increased—
							I had received last Evening a Note from <persRef ref="hamilton-william"
								>W. Hamilton</persRef>, the Under Secretary of State, asking me to
							call and give him some explanations about the request for the free
							exportation of Hughes’s baggage. I went to the foreign Office this day,
							at four O’Clock, and waited after sending in my name, about an hour, in
							the anti-chamber. Three gentlemen were successively shewn into the same
							room and waited with me. One of them, who appeared to have been often in
							the room before said he called it the school of Patience— I became at
							last weary of the School, and spoke to one of the Messengers who told me
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton was very much engaged with
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>— I
							desired him then to go and tell M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton
							that having called there at his request and waited an hour, I would
							thank him to send me word when he could see me— This message immediately
							procured me an Audience from Hamilton, which was however short. I
							explained to him the circumstances relating to Hughes’s baggage, and he
							immediately wrote a Note to the Treasury, requesting the order for its
							exportation duty free. I then mentioned to him the two Notes I had
							lately sent to Lord Castlereagh. He said the answer to that upon the
							fisheries would be sent to me in two or three days— The other, relating
							to <persRef ref="crosby-william">Crosby</persRef> was referred to the
							Law-Officers of the Crown. I told him I had some other papers of the
							case which might perhaps be properly referred to the same Officers;
							particularly a legal Argument. He said there was a great difficulty in
							admitting a whole Nation; eight Millions of foreigners to all the

							allegiance. I said that so far as it might be prospective, and an affair
							of compact, the difficulty would be reciprocal, and not more arduous to
							be got over on one side than on the other— The practical inconvenience I
							believed would be very trifling on either side— The mere privilege of
							holding lands would never in the present condition of the world have
							consequences important to either government; and there was something
							very harsh in stripping individuals of their Estates on the mere ground
							of alienage. He said he thought the best principle would be that the two
							Nations should be placed on the same footing, in relation to each other,
							as any other Nations— But in Crosby’s case I said the question was, not
							how the Law ought to be; but how the Law is. <persRef ref="reeves-john"

								Emmett</persRef> in his argument consider the Law as decidedly on
							Crosby’s side— The highest Court of judicature in the Island of Jamaica
							had decided otherwise. The late war had prevented Crosby from
							prosecuting his appeal before the king in Council, and perhaps all that
							was necessary for him would be to restore him to his Law. Hamilton said
							he wished to have further Conversation with me on the subject; but he
							heard Lord Castlereagh’s Bell— He would come back to me in a minute— I
							told him I would not detain him longer now, but postpone the further
							Conversation to a future day. I followed him out of the Office, and
							found Lord Castlereagh had just stepped into his Carriage to go home. He
							apologized for not alighting, on account of his lameness, and asked me
							to call upon him at half past eleven on Saturday Morning, which I
							promised— I was obliged to come immediately home by the Rain— After
							dinner I went with Smith down to Westminster Hall with a view of hearing
							a debate in the House of Commons—but the house had already adjourned. On
							returning home I immediately retired to bed, finding <pb n="180"

							flying rhumatic pinches in my limbs. I have been for some days
							threatened with rhumatism, but it seized me suddenly this Evening in the
							breast.</p>
