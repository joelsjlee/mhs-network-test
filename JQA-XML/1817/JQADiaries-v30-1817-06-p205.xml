                        <p><date>1. VI:45.</date> Sunday. At half past eleven this Morning I called
                            upon <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, and
                            had an hour’s Conversation with him upon a variety of general topics. He
                            said he had desired to see me previous to my departure, to enquire if
                            there remained any thing upon which further arrangements would be
                            necessary, and to give me such a view of the sentiments of <pb n="206"
                                type="ms"/>this Government as might be useful upon my return to the
                            United States. I said I would make out a minute of the Notes which I had
                            addressed to him, and to which answers had not yet been definitively
                            given; and I should request to see him once more before I should sail—
                            He named next Thursday Morning for that purpose. He then enlarged upon
                            the general and earnest desire of the British Government, not only to
                            remain themselves at Peace with all the world; but for the preservation
                            of peace and tranquility among the other Nations— In these views I told
                            him they might be sure of the hearty and earnest concurrence of the
                            United States so far as it would depend upon them. He then said that
                            without wishing to penetrate into the political intentions of the
                            American Government, in regard to any thing upon which they were
                            desirous of keeping them secret; he would ask me what was the present
                            state of our relations with Spain. I said there was nothing in them,
                            upon which the American Government were desirous of observing secrecy—
                            That very serious Misunderstandings existed between the United States
                            and Spain— There were questions of territorial boundary, and questions
                            of indemnity for commercial depredations. Spain was so utterly
                            untractable upon both points, that there was no prospect of an early
                            accommodation upon them. Whether they would ultimately terminate in
                            hostilities would depend upon Spain herself. I thought there was less
                            prospect of that result now, than there had been some Months since. The
                            United States would not seek hostility; and as Congress would not meet
                            until December, there could be no declaration of War, on their part, at
                            least for the present year— He said an idea had occurred to him, upon
                            which he had not consulted his colleagues in Office, and therefore could
                            not offer it as having the sanction of the British Government, but
                            merely as his own individual sentiment. How did I think it would be
                            received by the <persRef ref="monroe-james">President</persRef> if
                            Great-Britain were to offer her good Offices to effect an amicable
                            arrangement, between the United States and Spain? I answered that with
                            every disposition to tell him in perfect candour, it was not in my
                            power— The Affairs of my Government with Spain had formed but a very
                            incidental part of their Correspondence with me; I knew not how the
                            President might be affected by such a proposal; but I had no reason to
                            doubt it would be taken as a kind and friendly measure, and it might if
                            he thought proper be immediately adopted through the medium of <persRef
                                ref="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef>.
                            There was so far as I could anticipate only one ground upon which any
                            hesitation could arise against the acceptance of the proposal.— It would
                            be within his Recollection, that in the course of the Negotiations at
                            Ghent, there was some reference to the controversies between the United
                            States and Spain. It then appeared that Great-Britain had formed an
                            opinion upon those questions, unfavourable to the United States, and as
                            I conceived quite erroneous. But as that opinion might naturally be
                            supposed to have been biassed by the state of War, in which it was
                            urged, I should suppose it could not operate as an objection against the
                            acceptance of a proffered mediation, if it should appear that the
                            Sentiments of Great-Britain had undergone such a change, as would give
                            the United States the assurance of that impartiality on her part which
                            is essential to the character of a mediator. Lord Castlereagh made no
                            very significant reply to these remarks; but asked if the United States
                            were not very desirous of obtaining a cession of the Florida’s? I told
                            him that we contended the cession of West-Florida, was included in that
                            of Louisiana, because it had formed a part of the original French
                            Colony; the whole of which had been retroceded by Spain to France; and
                            then by France to the United States— He asked whether there was not also
                            some question of boundary, to the west of the river Mississippi? I said
                            there was; but I did not know precisely where Spain pretended the line
                            was to be drawn in that quarter. He hinted that perhaps Spain might
                            perhaps consent to an accommodation upon the Florida side; if the United
                            States would concede on the side of the Mississippi— <persRef
                                ref="delosrios-carlos">Fernan Nuñez</persRef> had told me as much. I
                            spoke to Lord Castlereagh of the mediation of the allies between Spain
                            and Portugal, and of the affairs of the Insurgents in South-America— The
                            insurrection at Pernambuco, he said had not extended to Bahia, and he
                            thought would be subdued without much difficulty by the Brazilian
                            Government— He intimated that there would be a necessity for taking
                            measures to protect Commerce against the depredations of the privateers
                            under the insurgent colours, which he said were becoming as bold and as
                            terrible as the buccaneers of the former century. I asked him if there
                            was any prospect that the allies, or Great-Britain alone would
                            ultimately take a hostile part against the South Americans? He said
                            nothing of that sort was at present contemplated. It was impossible to
                            say what system of policy the general course of Events might bring
                            about; but no intention of a hostile interference between Spain and her
                            Colonies was now intended.— On leaving Lord Castlereagh I returned home
                            to receive <persRef ref="esterhazy-paul">Prince Esterhazy</persRef> who
                            came about three O’Clock. I had also an hour’s conversation with him, on
                            the general state of political affairs in Europe— He says that the
                            Cabinets were never so universally, and so sincerely pacific as at the
                            present time. That all the Governments want a period of long repose,
                            after the excessive exertions of the last twenty-five years— That all
                            have ravages to repair, and finances to redeem—that all have inquietudes
                            with regard to the <pb n="207" type="ms"/>dispositions of their people,
                            and a fear of the recurrence again of the dangers that are past. That
                            there is a community of interest among them, which will cement the
                            alliance formed in the first instance for defence against the
                            overwhelming power of France, and now perhaps equally necessary to
                            secure the general tranquility.— Esterhazy is quite a young man, of the
                            highest rank of the Hungarian nobility. <persRef ref="esterhazy-maria"

                            him what use he proposed to make of the Answers. They related to the
                            state of religious opinions in the United States, and particularly to
                            the effects which an avowal of infidelity may have upon a person’s
                            reputation, or his condition in life. I came home about 11. I wrote this

                            shewed me the draft of a Letter that he is writing to the <persRef

                            the Monument. I had advised him to write the Letter rather to the
                            President alone, than to the President and Congress, as he had proposed.
                            He says he has made enquiry about the Riding School of the Horse-guards
                            at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg, and finds it is but a
                            very partial imitation of the Parthenon. <persRef ref="u">M<hi

                            Gentlemen, visitors at the house, merely to see M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> West’s pictures. Talma and Miss George are occasional
                            visitors in this Country, probably with a view of ascertaining whether
                            they can succeed to introduce a regular French theatre for a Season in
                            London. But they decline performing at the Argyll Rooms. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> West introduced them to us. We had already
                            known Miss George at S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Petersburg. We all
                            went with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> West to the British Museum;
                            where we saw the whole collection of its curiosities; as well those that
                            have been there in former years, as the more recently acquired treasures
                            of the Townley and Elgin Marbles. It is rather to be regretted that they
                            have been all assembled together. The old collection of the British
                            Museum was amply sufficient to exhaust the time of one visit and even
                            more. The <persRef ref="townley-charles">Townley</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="bruce-thomas">Elgin</persRef> Marbles are curiosities of a
                            different description, and are each deserving of more than one day’s
                            examination— We were obliged to hurry over them all in one visit of two
                            or three hours. We had therefore no time for inspecting any of the
                            remarkable manuscripts; and could give but a cursory glance to the fine
                            antique Statues of the Townley Collection— M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> West’s enthusiasm is all concentrated upon the Elgin
                            Marbles, and he was impatient until we were among them. Since they were
                            brought into England, he has persuaded himself that the Laocoon, the
                            Apollo, and the Venus, are works of inferior merit; and he quotes a
                            passage from <persRef ref="plinytheelder">Pliny’s</persRef> natural
                            History, purporting that in the age of <persRef ref="alexanderthegreat"
                                >Alexander</persRef>, painting was in its most flourishing state;
                            but that Sculpture had <pb n="208" type="ms"/>then already begun to
                            decline; the Statuaries after <persRef ref="phidias">Phidias</persRef>
                            having substituted system instead of simplicity, in the imitation of the
                            forms of Nature. It is this perfect simplicity, which constitutes in
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> West’s opinion the supreme excellence
                            of the Elgin Marbles; all of which are mutilated, and some of them
                            crumbling away by the mere effect of time— There are two colossal
                            Statues, supposed to be of <persRef ref="theseus">Theseus</persRef>,
                            which are the least injured; that is to say having lost only their feet
                            and hands. There are in sitting, and reclining attitudes, entirely
                            naked— There is also a horse’s head, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> West
                            says the most perfect sample of Art that he ever saw, but the under lip
                            of which was broken off, by the carelessness of the carmen who brought
                            it to the Museum, and who tumbled it from the waggon, as if it had been
                            a pavement stone— The hour for closing the hall where these Statues are
                            yet being put up was four, when all visitors were warned to withdraw;
                            but an exception was made for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> West and
                            his Company, and we stayed an hour longer. Talma and Miss George left us
                            there. We took M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> West to his house; and
                            returned home. <persRef ref="joy-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            London Dock. <persRef ref="west-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            <persRef ref="west-raphael">Son</persRef> brought us from him two
                            tickets for <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and
                            me to attend the Gallery of Pictures of the British Institution, in
                            Pall-Mall, this Evening; for the candle-light exhibition— I called at
                            two O’Clock upon <persRef ref="desousaholstein-pedro">Count
                                Palmella</persRef>, the Portuguese Minister, according to our
                            appointment. He read to me copies of two Notes which he has lately sent
                            into <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>; one
                            concerning the occupation of Montevideo, by troops from Brezil, and the
                            other relating to the case of the American privateer, General Armstrong;
                            destroyed in the Harbour of Fayal, by a British Ship of the line, during
                            the late War. The first of these Notes, gives by order of the Court of
                            Rio Janeiro, explanations of the motives of the military movement by
                            which Montevideo was taken. Explanations, directed to be given before
                            the Portuguese Government knew of the offer of Mediation between them
                            and Spain, made by the allies; and which of course as Count Palmella
                            remarked could not be ascribed to intimidation resulting from that
                            event. The reasons assigned are the necessity of securing their own
                            territories against the incursion, or influence of the Insurgents; and
                            there is a formal disclaimer of any intention to keep the possession of
                            the places which they have occupied. The Note respecting the case of the
                            Privateer was a demand of satisfaction for the violation of the neutral
                            territorial jurisdiction, couched in language very courteous and
                            complimentary, which he told me was owing to the very conciliatory
                            manner in which Lord Castlereagh had received and answered a former Note
                            of his upon the subject. The Count spoke again about the late
                            insurrection at Pernambuco, which he still considers as neither
                            formidable nor extensive; and he said he was informed that there was a
                            naval armament now fitting out in this Country; of at least twelve sail
                            of the line. He said he had mentioned it yesterday to <persRef
                                ref="esterhazy-paul">Prince Esterhazy</persRef> who appeared to be
                            acquainted with the fact. I nevertheless think it not well founded; or
                            at least much exaggerated. After dinner, I attended a debate in the
                            House of Lords— It was upon a motion of <persRef ref="grey-charles">Earl
                                Grey’s</persRef>, for a copy of a Letter of <persRef
                                ref="addington-henry2">Lord Sidmouth’s</persRef> directing that
                            County Magistrates should not be admitted without special orders of the
                            Council to visit State prisoners in the County Goals. Lord Grey insisted
                            that these Directions from the Secretary of State, for the home
                            Department were not warranted by Law— The Chancellor, and <persRef ref="scott-john2">Lord

                                Liverpool</persRef> supported Lord Sidmouth, in defence of the
                            orders, while Lord Grey’s motion was supported by the <persRef
                                ref="stclairerskine-james;spencer-george">Earls of Rosslyn and

                                Holland</persRef>. There was a person who sat by me, apparently a
                            tipstaff of the Chancellor’s who was constantly commenting in soliloquy
                            upon the Peers as they were speaking. His opinions coincided much with
                            those of the Chancellor, and by no means with those of the opposition
                            peers. I came away about ten, before the debate was concluded, and went
                            with my wife to see the pictures at the Gallery of the British
                            Institution. The crowd of company there was so great that we were
                            obliged to go almost to the top of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
                            James’s Street to fall in to the file of Carriages that were drawing up

                            which is in the Borough, and quite in the neighbourhood of the School.
                            The Duke as one of the Governors of the Hospital was immediately

                            the respective Apartments in which the women and the men are confined—
                            The order and discipline of the house are very good. The cells, all
                            perfectly clean. The house throughout well aired; and among all the

                            seeing at such Establishments. There is a Class of these unhappy persons
                            whom they call <hi rend="italic">Criminal</hi> Patients— That is,
                            persons who have been tried for capital offences, and acquitted upon
                            verdicts of insanity, which by law subjects them to be confined during

                            yesterday while I was out, and left a Note requesting to see me. I
                            answered him yesterday Morning that I would call at two this day at his
                            lodgings, 8. Downing Street— I went at the time, but he had missed of
                            receiving my Note and was not at home.— <persRef

                            office— But when I went at the time he was not there— I went twice to
                            the House of Commons to see if I could find either of them there.— Lord
                            Castlereagh came at last, and with an apology for missing his
                            appointment asked me to call at his house to-morrow Morning— <persRef

                                Bentham</persRef> came to ask if I could walk with him this Morning,
                            but I was obliged to call upon <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
                                Castlereagh</persRef>, with whom I had a last interview which was
                            short. I left with him a minute of the Notes which I have addressed to
                            him, and to which answers are yet desirable. We had some further
                            Conversation upon the state of Relations between the United States and
                            Spain; and examined the ground upon a Map. He asked whether if the
                            Floridas were ceded to the United States, what objection they would have
                            to the Mississippi for a boundary. I shewed him the whole range of
                            Territory marked upon his own Map, “Louisiana”—and said that would be
                            the objection— But that if Spain would but for one moment be rational
                            with us we could easily come to an accommodation with her. He said
                            smiling that he must admit Spain was not the easiest of parties to
                            concede; and he might say the same of the United States— I answered in
                            the same tone, that there could be no better judge of stubbornness and
                            compliance than a party so very easy and accommodating as Great Britain.

                        <p><date>10. VI:</date> Tuesday. London. Farewell! <persRef
                                ref="bollmann-justus">Doctor Bollmann</persRef> called upon me this
                            Morning, and requested me to look in at his lodgings before leaving town
                            and see his two inventions. I went accordingly and saw his yellow colour
                            formed from the Chromate of Iron; the most beautiful and durable yellow
                            that exists, and making also when compounded with Prussian blue, a green
                            colour equally beautiful— It is now used for painting Carriages, and
                            gives them a more brilliant yellow colour than was ever before known.—
                            The Chromate of iron is produced in the neighbourhood of Baltimore, and
                            also in Norway, but is there very dear— Bollmann has about three Tons of
                            it with him, and from five pounds of the ore, produces by mixing it with
                            lead two pounds of the yellow pigment. He has a laboratory in which he
                            keeps only one man employed, and makes about sixteen pounds in a week—
                            It sells at twelve shillings a pound. His other discovery is a vinegar
                            distilled from burnt wood, which he calls the pyroligneous acid. It is
                            so sharp that mingled with seven parts of water it makes the purest and
                            most perfect vinegar for use at table or for pickling. He thinks it must
                            entirely supersede all vinegar made from Beer. He shewed me some of the
                            liquor which was as limpid as Spring water, and mixed with seven parts
                            water as sharp as the best table vinegar— He makes at another laboratory
                            twenty Gallons a day—a pound of wood makes a gallon of the vinegar, and
                            a pound and a half of the acid. Bollmann says he has taken out a patent

                            where we dined, and Alton where we arrived a quarter before nine in the

                            the town which consists of one long street; and then sat down to
                            writing. began the attempt to retrieve the arrears of this Diary which
                            have been accumulating from the 6<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of May—
                            At 11. we proceeded upon our journey to Alresford-Winchester where I
                            stopped to visit the Cathedral but had not time to visit the College,
                            and to Southampton where we arrived at half past four in the afternoon.

                        <p>We paid fifteen pence a mile for the Chaise and horses from London.
                                <persRef ref="u">Clarke</persRef> the man of whom I had hired my
                            Carriage horses in London, asked me no more; but at Kingston the man of
                            the house where we stopp’d claimed eighteen pence a mile, against which
                            I remonstrated; and he finally agreed with reluctance to take fifteen.
                            The Post-boy from Farnham to Alton again renewed the claim for 18 pence
                            a mile, and referred me to the Master of the house at Alton, who said he
                            must charge 18 pence, and that they could not afford the posting for
                            less. I told him that posting all over the kingdom at a shilling a Mile
                            was advertised in London which he <pb n="212" type="ms"/>admitted, but
                            said it was done only by a violent opposition, and the people could not
                            afford. That the price of Oats had doubled, from twenty to forty
                            shillings a Quarter within the last twelvemonth, and that his regular
                            charge for a chaise and pair had been eighteen pence a mile these six
                            Months. I spoke of going to another house, but he told me there was no
                            other in the place, so that I had no remedy, and from Alton to
                            Southampton was obliged to pay 18 pence a mile. I gave the drivers three
                            pence a mile, and none of them except the first from London asked for
                            more.— The charge for dinner at Farnham—a Beefsteak, and a Tankard of
                            Porter, was 8 Shillings &amp; two pence for three. The lodging at Alton
                            with Tea at Night for two and a Breakfast of Coffee for three, with
                            bread and butter and toast was twelve shillings &amp; nine pence. They
                            charged four shillings for our two beds— At every house there is three
                            pence to be paid to the Hostler for changing the baggage from one Chaise
                            to another— The waiter and the housemaid attend at every house where you
                            take refreshment or lodge, and all these demands are the more
                            troublesome, because they are never taxed, and always supposed to be
                            voluntary yet these waiting people are seldom satisfied with what they
                            receive and generally ask for more— I had been obliged to take three
                            Trunks, and a large travelling bag, for our luggage; notwithstanding all
                            the pains I had taken to send every thing on board the ship— Package
                            after Package of Books and papers to be forwarded had been sent to me by

                            and every day was adding something to our Stores— When the Chaise came
                            to the door, only two of the trunks could be lashed in front of it, and
                            I was obliged to leave the largest of the Trunks to be sent by the Stage
                            this morning to Southampton— It arrived soon after us, and was brought
                            to us at the Dolphin inn, where we stop to lodge— The two other Trunks
                            for want of an Oil-Cloth to cover them, and sufficient straps to lash
                            them on were both injured, and one of them had a hole stove through the
                            bottom in coming from Alton to Alresford, where it was repaired— These
                            are details which it might be useful to remember, for any person having
                            the prospect of travelling in England again— I was about two hours
                            looking over the Cathedral at Winchester, which is 554 feet in length,
                            shaped in the form of a Cross, and built at such different periods of
                            time that there in it specimens of Saxon, Gothic and Grecian modern
                            architecture— The principal curiosities of the Cathedral are the Chantry

                            one of the bishops of Winchester and founder of the New College here and
                            of the New College at Oxford. A number of mortuary chests containing the

                            communion table, the Resurrection of <persRef ref="lazarus"

                            took from the man who shewed me the Church a pamphlet containing a
                            description of them all— The Road from London to Southampton is all the
                            way good. The country generally pleasant well interspersed with a
                            variety of hill and dale— The cultivation consists chiefly of wheat,
                            barley, and hops— The soil for the most part chalky and not remarkably
                            rich; with occasional heaths covered with fern.— The horses on the whole
                            road are excellent and the public houses very good— <persRef

                            writing and resumed this Journal at the day of our leaving London,
                            hoping hereafter to redeem the arrears. At three this afternoon we left
                            the Dolphin Inn at Southampton, and came in the Packet to Cowes in the
                            Isle of Wight. The distance is twelve Miles 8 of which are down a bay
                            called the Southampton water, at the entrance of which is Calshot
                            castle, almost opposite to it on the Isle of Wight is a castle lately

                            West and East Cowes are separated from each other by a small river or
                            Creek. The principal town is at West Cowes and the best public houses
                            are there. But the landlord of the Hotel at East Cowes came to us in a

                        <p><date>13. VI:45.</date> A Stormy day, with heavy rain all the Morning,
                            and the weather so bad that it almost confined us to the house. Having
                            taken a severe Cold on the day of our leaving London, I indulged myself
                            this Morning by laying late in bed. About 9 O’Clock, the waiter of the
                            house where we lodge came in to the chamber where I was writing, and
                            told me, that the Washington was coming in Half an hour after, <persRef

                            the Treasury to permit the shipment freely of any thing that I might
                            have to send on board, under the privilege of a public Minister. He was
                            extremely civil and courteous in his demeanor and professions, and
                            afterwards sent me a copy of another order from the Treasury which he
                            had just received: dated the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> instant,

                            (the Corn Bill). This is a symptom of more than present scarcity— M<hi

                            without taking a copy. I was employed the greater part of the day upon
                            my Journal, but was much slackened in its progress by continual
                            interruptions. I walked with George to <persRef ref="seymour-henry2"
                                >Lord Henry Seymour’s</persRef> Castle, and crossed the river to
                            West Cowes, with John and Charles. Had some Conversation with Captain
                            Forman, upon the preparations for the voyage. He sent on board a
                            quantity of provisions and live Stock. When he first landed he had some
                            expectation of sailing again this day, but the wind towards evening
                            freshened to a gale, and came round due West, which for us is directly
                            ahead— The ship left Gravesend at two O’Clock Sunday Morning, and the
                            Downs at 3. on Tuesday afternoon.</p>

                        <p><date>14. IV:30.</date> It blew a heavy gale of wind all Night, and all
                            the former part of this day. Our ship lies at the distance of a mile out
                            in the Roads, and in the violence of the Storm last Night drifted with
                            two Anchors out, and had her windlass broken. After writing three hours
                            this Morning I walked round the vicinity of our lodgings with my Sons
                                <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> and <persRef

                            We made an excursion this day to Newport, the capital of this Island. At
                            one we crossed the ferry to West-Cowes where a Carriage was ready and
                            took up <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and

                            dined— The road is an excellent Turnpike; the distance five Miles. The
                            Country beautiful hill and dale, with a soil rather light but well
                            cultivated principally with wheat.— The river or creek which separates
                            West and East Cowes is navigable for small craft up to Newport where it
                            ends. A Regiment of Soldiers are quartered in barracks about a Mile
                            before coming to Newport. The town itself has a pleasant and thriving
                            aspect, and this being the weekly market day was busy and bustling with
                            activity— The house where we stopp’d was a neat and elegant Hotel, and
                            we were served with an excellent dinner— As we were walking round the
                            Town we met <persRef ref="auldjo-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
                                Auldjo</persRef>, with whom we walked through the provision Market;
                            which is on the ground floor of the Town-Hall, a new Stone building of
                            Ionic Architecture, very plain and neat. By his advice we also went to
                            Carisbrook Castle, which is upon a steep hill about a mile beyond the
                            town. It is now a Ruin, much resembling that of the Castle near Töplitz
                            in Bohemia. There is adjoining to the part of the Wall yet standing a
                            dwelling house for the Governor of the Island, who does not however
                            reside in it. The present Governor is <persRef ref="harris-james">Lord
                                Fitzharris</persRef>, son of the <persRef ref="harris-james2">Earl

                            the walls, shewed us the place where the apartments had been in which
                                <persRef ref="charles-i">Charles the first</persRef> was confined.
                            Two sides of the wall are yet standing, and the window through which he
                            attempted to make his escape— There is an old chapel, not used; and a
                            well under a close shed, two hundred feet deep, half of which dug
                            through the rock. The village of Carisbrook with an old Church and
                            Steeple Tower is in a valley at the bottom of the hill— The view from
                            the Summit of the ruined tower is extensive and agreeable, with a
                            prospect of Newport and Cowes, and a cheerful intervening Country, and
                            distant horizon. We returned to the Bugle Inn to dinner, and immediately
                            afterwards to our Hotel at East Cowes. The gale had subsided and the
                            weather become fine— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tillary, M<hi

                            About four in the afternoon we were <pb n="214" type="ms"/>obliged to

                            breeze, under which our Anchor was weighed about eleven O’Clock. It
                            continued fair through the day, but scarcely strong enough to stem the
                            tide when that was against us. We passed by the Needles at the western
                            extremity of the Isle of Wight about one, and were abreast of Portland
                            at Sunset. The boys had fishing lines out, one of which I accidentally
                            drew in with a very large mackerel, at the hook.— It brought them all to
                            the lines again but without further success.— After we came into the
                            open channel the tide made something of a swell; <persRef

                        <p><date>18. IV:45</date>. The Sun rose this morning clear, but very soon
                            afterwards went into a cloud; an earnest of foul weather, which soon
                            afterwards succeeded. We were still in sight of Land, and abreast of the
                            two Lizard Light-houses which I distinctly saw through the glass.
                            Clouds, fog and rain soon followed, with a flat calm, and a heavy swell
                            which made many of the passengers again Sea-sick. <persRef
                                ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> was so, severely, and
                            the whole day confined to her bed. After two or three hours of calm, and
                            rain, a light breeze sprung up, but nearly ahead— After some
                            unsteadiness it settled about N.N.W. so that the ship’s head could be
                            kept at West— Our Course would be W. and by N. The sky cleared off in
                            the course of the day, and the weather again became cool. <persRef
                                ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and all our Servants were
                            sick. The motion of the ship was so disagreeable to me, that I was or
                            fancied myself unable to write after breakfast. I played a couple of
                            games of Chess with <persRef ref="otis-george">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            pages of the Novum Organum— We had several vessels in sight the whole
                            day; among them a ship and two brigs steering the same course with
                            ourselves. It was not till near Night that we lost sight of the Land.
                            There was a frigate apparently stationed off the Lands end. <persRef

                            hymn; and entered into conversation with him. He told me he was born at
                            Wilmington North-Carolina, of French Parents who settled there about the

                            with being tried as a British subject. He made his escape from the
                            prison and got over to Brest. Since the Peace he has been employed as a

                            pick up an object which was seen floating near the ship, and it proved
                            to be a barrel of flour. It had no marks to shew whence it came, but had
                            evidently been several Months upon the water, as it was covered with
                            barnacles. The flour was found in excellent condition, very little
                            moisture having penetrated through the cask, and scarcely pervaded a
                            slight surface of the flour— It was almost all perfectly sweet and dry.
                            I was engaged all the Morning in writing and after dinner played a long
                            and obstinate game of chess with <persRef ref="otis-george">M<hi

                            theology. The Evening sky was clear, and we had some star-gazing upon
                            deck.— Jupiter shines very bright between the two first Stars in the
                            Scorpion, and Antares.</p>

                        <p><date>21. IV:45.</date> The wind freshened early in the Night, and being
                            at S.S.W. while our course was W.N.W. brought up a heavy swell and made
                            the vessel pitch most uncomfortably— I scarcely slept at all the whole
                            Night, and while rising from bed found myself so near being Seasick,
                            that I was obliged to quit the Cabin and go upon deck. It continued much
                            the same the whole day, with variable weather Clouds of Haze rising in
                            constant succession; passing over us, sometimes with a light drizzling
                            rain, and clearing away with the appearance of an almost cloudless sky.
                            The motion of the ship was so wearisome, that I had not resolution to
                            persevere in my writing, and nearly lost the day— I played chess both

                            this day blew a strong gale. There was a continual succession of flaws
                            rising and passing over us with a light sprinkling of rain. The pitching
                            of the ship was so laborious that I found it again utterly impossible
                            either to write or read after breakfast. Another day lost— We were
                            running eight and nine knots an hour the whole day. Soon after noon I
                            turned in, and lay in my birth till Evening— Then rose for half an hour
                            and went to bed again. Just then our wind finished in a shower of Rain.
                            The transition from a nine knot gale to a calm, was an affair of five
                            minutes— There was afterwards a light westerly wind.— We had the
                            dead-lights put up this afternoon in the Cabin windows. Passed rapidly
                            this afternoon a brig, sailing the same course with us.— Run in the 24

                            was rent almost in two as they were taking it in. The wind changed to
                            the W.N.W. as directly ahead for us as it can blow. It remained at that
                            point all this day; a very light breeze, and with the weather mild and
                            fair— No vessel was seen this day—one bird and a couple of porpoises.
                            the day before yesterday a scull of porpoises were playing round the
                            ship, for half an hour; and the spouting of a whale was seen. But in
                            general we have seen fewer birds and fish than usual within this
                            distance from the land. Our dead-lights were taken out this morning.

                            Much of the uncomfortable motion of the ship subsided and I wrote all
                            the morning with little trouble— Before Noon the wind had insensibly
                            worked round again to the point of S.S.W. where it had been so
                            boisterous last Sunday. From that time we could again hold our course at
                            W.N.W. which by the variation of the compass makes an actual course of
                            W. 1/2 S. and had a breeze of 4–5–6–7 knots as the Evening advanced.
                            Then came the taking in and reefing of Sail, the putting up, first of
                            our Starboard, then of the Larboard Dead-Lights and to conclude what

                            <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> was extremely
                            ill the whole day; continually Sea-sick with other distressing symptoms,
                            and some fever. This Evening just before dark she was bled by <persRef
                                ref="tillary-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Tillary</persRef>, at her own desire and with his approbation. The day
                            was the most uncomfortable one that we have yet had on board the ship;
                            all the morning steering her course but as close upon the wind as
                            possible: with a heavy swell and a breeze almost equivalent to a Gale of
                            Wind— Towards Evening the wind came directly ahead, blowing without
                            abatement of its force; squall rising after squall, passing over the
                            ship and dispersing itself in small rain, scarcely enough to wet the
                            deck. Three or four times in the course of the day The clouds were
                            scattered off as if a curtain were raised to shew a clear sky; half an
                            hour afterwards they would gather again and threaten a tempest— The
                            motion of the <pb n="217" type="ms"/>vessel was of the worst kind; many
                            of the passengers were Sea-sick; among them my Son <persRef
                                ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, severely. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams was so almost without intermission.
                            No vessel was seen. I was forced again in a great measure to suspend
                            both my reading and writing, though hitherto I have been able to
                            continue the current daily diary. The recovery of the arrears is however
                            slower and more precarious than I had hoped it would be— I played Chess
                            with <persRef ref="otis-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Otis</persRef> who beat me again. The third game was left
                            unfinished— This pastime is supportable when we can do nothing else— The
                            day’s run was of 120 miles.— Latitude by Observation 46:22. Longitude
                            20: I forgot to make the trial of temperature of the water and air by
                            the thermometer.— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams took at Night 25
                            drops of laudanum.</p>

                        <p><date>26. IV:</date> A boisterous Night, and cold comfortless morning,
                            which I was obliged to pass upon deck, the cabin being darkened and the
                            motion of the ship so great that I could not write. <persRef
                                ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> had a bad night and
                            continued confined to her bed all this day. <persRef
                                ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> also kept his bed. The
                            weather moderated, but the wind remained within two points of our proper
                            course. It varied little from the N.W. We made therefore very little
                            progress. The run of the day was but 40 Miles and the courses N.N.W. and
                            S.W Lat: by reckoning 46:<space/>Long: 21:30 I find as I have done for
                            many years that I can sleep little. Scarcely ever more than four hours
                            in the Night, and with frequent interruptions, a change of the ship’s
                            tack, or the noise upon deck of setting or taking in sail never fails of
                            waking me. This scantiness of sleep keeps me in a state of constant
                            weariness in the day-time, and disqualifies me for reading almost
                            entirely— My wife though not essentially better than yesterday, slept
                            the greatest part of this day. I played Chess with <persRef
                                ref="otis-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis</persRef>,
                            morning and Evening— He gains upon me in play, and now frequently beats
                            me. I have occasionally played Chess at various periods of my life; but
                            never acquired much skill at the game. Sometimes I have been many years
                            without playing, from having in my social circle no player to oppose me;
                            and soon after my last voyage to Russia I found myself obliged to
                            renounce it, because I perceived it became too interesting, and absorbed
                            too much of my time and attention. But as a resource at Sea, it
                            surpasses every thing that I have ever experienced— About an hour before
                            dinner, the swell had so much abated that I found an opportunity for
                            writing the journal of yesterday, but could add no more— One vessel
                            steering easterly passed at a distance in sight of us this Morning.

                            and W.N.W. Our Course was from S.W. to S.S.W. which with the variation

                            <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> had a quiet
                            Night’s rest, and was easy all the morning until past Noon when she was
                            again seized with great violence— I was called to her from dinner; she
                            thought herself dying. <persRef ref="tillary-james">D<hi

                            fortunate in having as a fellow-passenger in the Cabin attended her; she
                            was in very severe pain at intervals until near Sunset, when she found
                            herself relieved, and the remainder of the Evening was free from pain.
                            The weather, like that of the three last days has been changeful as a
                            child at play. Clear skies, and Overcast, Calms and Squalls of wind and
                            rain follow in constant succession, and rapid transition: but the wind
                            alone never varies enough to enable our ship to steer her course. This
                            day we headed for a few hours N.W. within two points of our course, but
                            the wind soon returned to its post and in the Evening the Polar Star was
                            directly over the ship’s Stern. Her course was therefore due South;
                            though by the compass she was steering S.S.W:— With this head wind the
                            swell is always heavy and the motion of the ship tormenting— Most of the
                            fresh water passengers, including <persRef

                                type="ms"/>The weather was so unpleasant and the Sea so convulsive
                            this morning that I could write nothing more than the journal of
                            yesterday. The passengers were all confined to the Cabin by the Rain. I
                            played Chess with <persRef ref="otis-george">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            Mate. With Otis I went over the moves of <persRef ref="cunningham-alexander">Cunningham’s</persRef> Gambit in a volume
                            of <persRef ref="hoyle-edmond">Hoyle’s</persRef> games, belonging to the

                            course of the day, Sheerwaters and porpoises in abundance. The Chair bed
                            in my wife’s State Room is so much more comfortable for sleeping than my

                            wind and weather continue their long first lesson of Patience. On rising
                            this Morning, and going upon deck, the first object that presented
                            itself to my eyes, was a bright and perfect Rainbow; a perfect Arch,
                            which looked like a bridge across the firmament— There is an old vulgar
                            adage among Mariners which I remember from the earliest of my voyages.
                            Rainbow in the Morning, Sailors take warning— Rainbow at Night, Sailors
                            delight. It may be doubted whether the whole antithesis be warranted by
                            experience, but as far as my experience has gone, a morning Rainbow, is
                            generally followed by a blustering day. It proved so now. The Cloud upon
                            which the Rainbow was painted came upon us within ten minutes afterwards
                            in a very heavy Squall—a tickler; one of the Sailor’s called it; and it
                            was followed by a succession of others; the whole day long, with a fresh
                            gale in the intervals, and a heavy Sea running, but with no greater
                            variation of the wind than from W.N.W. to W.S.W. The day closed with one
                            of these Squalls, and a copious shower of Rain. I wrote before Breakfast
                            in the front Cabin; but again surrendered to idleness the weary remnant
                            of the day; for as soon as I attempted to read a fit of drowsiness came
                            over me, till the book was ready to drop from my hands. We are now in
                            the desart and solitude of the western Ocean, and saw nothing animated
                            out of the ship but Sheerwaters and Porpoises. <persRef ref="coit-elias"
                                >Coit</persRef> the Mate, made several attempts to harpoon one of
                            them, but without success. I have often seen it attempted, but never saw
                            one Caught— Coit says he caught eight or ten his last voyage— Our
                            Latitude by Observation was 44:09—Long: 23. but I find the Mate does not
                            enter the Longitude upon the Log-book, but keeps a separate reckoning of
                            it— I imagine rather by estimate than by much traverse sailing
                            calculation. <persRef ref="lamb-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Lamb</persRef> has a Chronometer, which was set to the Greenwich
                            time before he left London, and by which the time gained this day was
                            one hour 25 minutes. That gives a Longitude of twenty one degrees
                            fifteen minutes, which is probably correct. <persRef ref="shiels-william">M<hi

                            the Thermometer.</p>

                        <p><date>30. V:45.</date> A tempestuous day, with the winds all round the
                            compass. In the Morning at West South West, blowing fresh, with squalls
                            and rain; as it had done all night. Starting thence to S.W. then to S.
                            and S.E, with a heavy fall of Rain. Then E. and N.E. blowing like a
                            hurricane, for about two hours then drawing to North. N.N.W. and N.W.
                            with much abatement of the gale, but a continued succession of Squalls—
                            Thus I left the deck at ten this evening, to turn in. <persRef ref="coit-elias"

                            struck a porpoise with the harpoon, but he was so heavy that he broke
                            from it, before they could haul him on board; but he bent the harpoon
                            almost to breaking.— There was no solar observation. Air 60. Water 58—
                            While we had the Gale at N.E. and were scudding more than ten knots an
                            hour under close-reefed topsails, we passed by a Schooner lying to, at
                            the distance of about half a Mile— Supposed a fishing vessel from the
                            Banks, bound with a fare to France.— <persRef

                            month was occupied like the whole of that which had preceded it, in
                            preparations for the voyage upon which we were to proceed— We have now
                            been half the Month upon this voyage, with the prospect of a passage
                            more tedious than we had anticipated.— I rise here generally between
                            half past four and six, and when the weather permits, journalize till
                            eight which is the breakfast hour. From thence I read, write again, and
                            pace the deck till 3. P.M. when we dine— The afternoon I abandon to
                            Chess and <persRef ref="otis-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            Cabin is usually occupied with Card-players till Midnight. Foul weather
                            and a rough Sea prevent me about half the time, from my writing between
                            breakfast and dinner—</p>
