							again as Agent at Port au Prince. He had no doubt M<hi

							in his power; but he was afraid Taylor was upon so bad terms with
								<persRef ref="petion-alexandre">Petion</persRef>, that he would
							rather injure than benefit his interest— That the general report at Port
							au Prince was that Taylor had been agent for some of the Privateers
							fitted out contrary to Law in the Ports of the United States, to cruize
							against Spanish vessels, with Commissions from the Insurgent South
							American Governments; and that this was the cause of his first quarrel
							with Petion— That at the time of the seizure and condemnation of
							Strong’s vessel and cargo, Taylor’s conduct had been harsh, and
							insulting to Petion and his Government, and when Taylor came away,
							Strong heard that Petion had said if he returned he should not be
							received. Strong mentioned several circumstances of rash and overbearing
							conduct on the part of Taylor, and said unless it should be absolutely
							necessary he wished M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor might not be

							England, and wished to know if we were ready with the promised proposal
							relative to the fisheries. I said we were not; and told him <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> had promised me
							that a particular statement should be communicated to this Government,
							shewing the great <pb type="ms" n="270"/>inconveniences suffered by the

							shewing proof that it is not from any disposition to cavil or make
							disputes for trifles that they persist in pressing this object— Bagot
							said he had got the paper to which Lord Castlereagh alluded, and half
							promised that he would send it to me— I asked him if he intended to send
							me the note of which he had spoken the last time I saw him, about the
							affair of <persRef ref="felix-unknown">Captain Felix</persRef> at
							New-Orleans; but he said he had been expecting to hear from me on the

							think of addressing me first concerning it— M<hi rend="superscript"

							man— The President this day proposed to me to call on him every Morning,
							as I got to the Office; but said he would receive me, at all other times
							of the day, whenever I should call— I told him I seldom went to the
							Office till between eleven and twelve O’Clock, finding it impossible to
							do any writing there— He said he was fully aware of that; and I should
							find it a thousand times worse, when Congress should come to be in
							session, as the members would be continually calling upon me.</p>

								Greuhm</persRef> the new Prussian Minister Resident and Consul
							General, and asked him, if he would now fix a time for receiving him, or

							his arrival, and <pb type="ms" n="271"/>said it was his desire to place
							the foreign Ministers here, much upon the same footing as the American
							Ministers were placed upon at the European Courts; upon a footing of
							form and ceremony. They had heretofore visited the President’s
							familiarly, and called to take tea at their houses as among individuals—
							He thought that improper. The intercourse between the Chief Magistrate
							and foreign Ministers should be reserved and formal. He had given them
							notice of this intention soon after he entered upon his Office. If they
							wished to ask for personal Audiences he would always grant them, and
							receive them in form— It was under Consideration whether he should have
							weekly Evening parties, as had been customary with the former
							President’s who had Ladies; if he did, the foreign Ministers as well as
							others might attend them: but otherwise, he did not expect a foreign
							Minister would come to his house without invitation— As soon as he
							should have a Secretary, he would also fix regular times for receiving
							visitors, for now he had not a moment of the day or the Night free from
							them— Even his dinner hours were molested. He had it also in
							contemplation that there should be a uniform dress adopted for the Heads
							of Department and Officers of Government; but that must be an affair of
							consultation— It was three O’Clock before I reached the Office, and of
							course I had very little time there— I came home just at the Dusk of
							Evening— My wife went with <persRef ref="miller-unknown3"
								>Miller</persRef> the Carpenter, and looked over the house for which

						<p><date>8. V:</date><persRef ref="greuhm-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Frederic Greuhm</persRef> arrived last Night with a
							Commission of Minster Resident and Consul General from the <persRef
								ref="frederick-william-iii">king of Prussia</persRef>, and called
							upon me this Morning. Precisely at the same time came <persRef
								ref="lallemand-charles">General Charles Lallemand</persRef> whom
								<persRef ref="lee-william">W. Lee</persRef> had yesterday asked to
							introduced to me; but which I had declined. He came this morning of his
							own accord; introduced himself, and asked to see me again to-morrow
							Morning to which I consented. I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Greuhm that I would inform the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> of his arrival, and take his orders for the
							time when he would give him an Audience to receive his credentials— I
							mentioned also to him two things which I requested him to make known to
							his Government, and which I had preferred speaking of to him informally,
							rather than to notice them by official Notes. His Credential Letter was
							addressed to the Congress of the United States. By our Constitution
							foreign Ministers were received by the President, and all Credential
							Letters from foreign Sovereigns should be addressed to him— He said this
							had occurred to himself, and he had made the remark when his Credential
							Letter was made out; but they told him they had only one record of a
							similar Letter from the King to this Government, and that was upon the
							occasion of my taking leave. They supposed that had been drawn up
							according to advice from me, and that was addressed to the Congress— I
							told him I remembered it well, but it had not been drawn up by my
							advice— I had received it as drawn up and delivered to me, without
							objection, because I was unwilling to make a difficulty at parting, and
							did not suppose it would operate as a precedent afterwards— He said he
							had no doubt his Government would readily conform to the regular mode of
							address when they should be acquainted with it. The other circumstance
							which I noticed was the union in his Commission of the characters of
							Consul General and of Minister Resident— A union so unusual in Europe
							that I had never known an example of it. There was this inconvenience in
							it, that as the Minister would be entitled to the privileges and
							immunities of the diplomatic character, and as the Consul General might
							be a merchant actually engaged in trade, there might arise very
							disagreeable questions of conflict between the claim of privilege and
							the rights of the tribunals of the Country; it was therefore the wish of
							the President that the Prussian Government should understand, that while
							we recognize in their full extent the privileges of public ministers we
							do not acknowledge them as in any manner belonging to Consuls— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Greuhm admitted the force of those
							observations; but said he thought there were examples of the union of
							the characters in Europe, though he did not personally know of any. He
							supposed however that his Commission had been adopted from the example
							of the Danish Minister and Consul <persRef ref="pederson-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pedersen</persRef>— I had precisely
							suspected this to be the case— Greuhm added that there was a <persRef
								ref="weiss-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Weiss</persRef>
							coming with an appointment from the Austrian Government, writing the
							same characters— I told him that if he should <pb type="ms" n="272"

								Lallemand</persRef> called again this morning, and entered into a
							long explanation of his views and intentions, with a strong denial of
							his having ever contemplated engaging in any project contrary to the
							Laws of the United States. He said he had been invited to join in
								<persRef ref="macgregor-gregor">M’Gregor’s</persRef> expedition to
							Amelia Island, but had declined— That he had refused to engage in some
							other projects of a similar nature; though he had an ardent love of
							Liberty, and a warm sympathy with the South-Americans whom he considers
							as struggling for that cause. He had never been the partizan of a man;
							but that of his Country. He had followed the Emperor (<persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef>) in his misfortunes, and
							of all his Counsellors, had alone advised him not to trust himself to
							the English— He added that if after these explanations he was still an
							object of uneasiness and suspicion to this Government, he would quit the
							Country and seek a refuge elsewhere, as he was determined at all Events
							to preserve his personal independence— I told him that he was in no wise
							an object of uneasiness to this Government— That they had received from
							various quarters information of a project for levying men, in the United
							states for an expedition to join the Mexican Insurgents; that <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-joseph">Joseph Buonaparte</persRef> was to be placed
							at the head of this movement, and that his Lallemand’s name had been
							implicated in it— That as this project was contrary to the Laws of the
							United States, which the Government were bound to see executed, its
							existence had given them uneasiness, particularly as its tendency was to
							force them to take a decisive part against the exiles from France who
							had sought and were enjoying an asylum in this Country— That the
							Government had now reason to believe this project was abandoned; there
							was no suspicion entertained against him and so long as he should
							conform his conduct to the Laws, the Government would neither have the
							power nor the inclination to molest him. He said he knew the <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">French</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="onis-luis">Spanish</persRef> Ministers were both much alarmed
							at the new projected French settlement on the Tombigbee, and the French
							Minister had sent to him Lallemand, a Garde du Corps of the king, to
							offer to enlist himself to go to Mexico— He said he had laughed in the
							Garde de Corp’s face; for it was really too absurd— I told him that his
							name had not been mentioned in any Communication from the French
							Minister to this Government— He said he had heard of some pretended
							Letters from <persRef ref="lakanal-joseph">Lakanol</persRef> to the
							Comte de Survillier (Joseph Buonaparte) but he lived in perfect
							retirement and had refused to receive those Letters, which had been the
							only cause of their being intercepted. He, Lallemand did not know
							Lakanol; had never seen him; knew nothing whether he had written the
							Letters, whether they were forgeries, or what they were. But it would be
							hard if the Comte de Survillier should be held responsible for Letters
							written to him, which he had refused to receive— I wrote to the <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">district Attorney at Philadelphia</persRef>
							concerning the British Officers lately taken up there; sent for <persRef
								ref="young-moses">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Young</persRef> who
							copied it and the paper to be enclosed with it, and they were despatched
							by the mail this day. I had visits from <persRef ref="blake-james">D<hi

								ref="blake-thomas">Son</persRef>, from <persRef

							had all become cultivators of the land, and had altogether abandoned the
							life of huntsmen. Wine was served round; which one of them supposing it

								>Rush</persRef> in July, the President desired me to send a copy of

							spoke about <persRef ref="ebeling-christoph">Ebeling’s</persRef>
							Library— and what I had done to purchase it, with a view to give

							as it was customary in Europe for books to be kept in which persons
							wrote their names. I told him a card would answer here for the present,
							and if a book should be kept hereafter the foreign Ministers would have
							notice of it— The Abbe said that all these things were Officially
							necessary and proper, but he was sure my opinion as to the substance of
							all these things were the same as his own. I told him, I had no doubt it
							was— He asked me whether setting the Secretary of State and the
							Portuguese Minister aside he could sometimes come and see me as an
							individual— I told him I was at home every evening, and should be happy
							to see him whenever it should suit his convenience to come. He said he
							thanked me for the privilege which he would enjoy without abusing it— He
							then told me; but said he aid not ask it as a question, and did not
							expect I would answer it, but he had concluded from the Style &amp;c.
							that I was the author of two pieces in the National Intelligencer,
							signed Phocion and a North American, in answer to Lautaro— These are all
							political speculations upon the question about acknowledging the

							sounding rather unseasonably the ground, I thought it best to leave him
							in his <pb type="ms" n="277"/>uncertainty, and simply said that when
							persons used fictitious signatures in the Newspapers, it was usually
							because they had motives for not signing their own. I took leave of the

							concerning which nothing was done at the last Session of Congress— Then
							of his Note about the Mutineers of the British Merchant Ship Sir Joseph
							Banks, brought to Boston in the Galen. Then of his Note, concerning the

							shortly send him an answer, upon this last case, with copy of the Report
							from the District Attorney, to whom the Memorial of the Officers had
							been referred— That the papers concerning the men brought to Boston,
							from the ship Sir Joseph Banks had been referred to the <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Attorney General</persRef> whose Report I
							expected would soon be made, and I should then immediately answer the
							Note; but I thought we could not deliver up the man, and that our Law
							would in this case be precisely the same as the English Law. I added
							that if the British Consuls in this Country would attend a little to the
							Laws of their own, they would forbear many of their complaints, as in
							this case it would have been necessary to recur only to Magna Charta,
							and to the Habeas Corpus Act— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot did
							not reply much to all this— He had in truth asked to see me for quite a
							different affair. Assuming suddenly a very grave air and tone, he said
							that the North west company had been informed, and he had been informed
							that the Corvette Ontario, had been despatched from New-York, on a
							Voyage round Cape Horn, for the purpose of disturbing <pb type="ms"
								n="278"/>the British Settlement at the North-West Coast of America;
							and he therefore came to me to enquire if it was so— I told him I could
							answer him immediately that neither the Ontario, nor any other vessel of
							the United States had any orders to disturb any British settlement
							whatever. But he knew we had before the War, a settlement at the mouth
							of Columbia river which might be renewed, and that we had discovered the
							river— Our settlement he knew had been broken up by force during the
							War; after the Peace, the restoration of it had been demanded by a Note
							from the <persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="baker-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker</persRef>, which he had answered by stating that no possession

							immediately withdrawn after destroying the American Settlement— Bagot
							said <persRef ref="cook-james">Captain Cook</persRef> had discovered the
							river, and that in 1787. Great Britain had spent upwards of three
							Millions Sterling upon a contest for that territory with Spain— for then
							they only had Spain to dispute with for it— And he thought G. Britain
							had some claim to the Country from the time of <persRef

						<p><date>26. VI:</date> The weather moderated— I called at <persRef
								ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Anderson</persRef> the Comptroller’s Office, and left with him my
							Observations, on my accounts that are to be settled. At Noon, attended
							at the Treasury for a Meeting of the Commissioners of the sinking fund;
							but <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef> the Attorney General did not attend, and the Meeting
							was postponed. While I was at the Treasury, <persRef key="clay-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> came in with
								<persRef ref="quarles-tunstall">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Quarles</persRef> and <persRef ref="robertson-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Robertson</persRef> two members of the
							new Congress from Kentucky. <persRef ref="swift-joseph">General
								Swift</persRef> afterwards came in with <persRef
								ref="vandeventer-christopher">Major Van der Venter</persRef> who
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> told me was a Candidate for the
							Office of Chief Clerk of the War Department which <persRef
								ref="graham-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G.
								Graham</persRef> is to leave— I had a visit at the Office from
								<persRef ref="crowninshield-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crowninshield</persRef>, who says we cannot send a Corvette to
							Copenhagen until the Spring. <persRef ref="mason-john">General
								Mason</persRef> likewise called at the Office to enquire from
								<persRef ref="aguirre-manuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Aguirre</persRef> whether a passage could be granted to a person, a
							friend of his, in the Congress frigate, to Buenos Ayres— A similar
							application had been made last Summer when the Commission was to have
							been despatched— It was then made through <persRef
								ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thornton</persRef>, by <persRef ref="gual-pedro">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gual</persRef>, the Agent from
							New-Grenada, and was then declined by <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>— I therefore declined
							allowing it, on the ground of the precedent and that the Congress is not
							going directly to Buenos Ayres— General Mason said also that Aguirre had
							complained to him of having written to me, to ascertain whether I was of
							the same opinion as my predecessor; and not having received any answer.
							I told the General the reasons why I had not answered it, and probably
							should not; at least for the present. The <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> believed that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Aguirre’s statement of his conversation with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rush was not perfectly correct, and I had sent a copy of it
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, requesting a statement of the
							conversation according to his view of it. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rush must have received my Letter after he had embarked, and I had not
							received his answer— This Evening I received <persRef
								key="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot’s</persRef>
							Letter; concerning the Settlement at Columbia river.</p>
