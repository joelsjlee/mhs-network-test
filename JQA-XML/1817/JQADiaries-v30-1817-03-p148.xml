								ref="adams-george;adams-charles2;adams-john2">boys</persRef> came
							home from school at eleven O’Clock, and I took them with me to London to
							see the Mint— We stopp’d at Craven Street and took up <persRef
								ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef>— The
							Mint is upon Tower Hill. They made some difficulty at letting us in.—
							They said <persRef ref="wellesleypole-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Wellesley Pole</persRef> gave Cards only for Thursday’s.
							I mentioned that <persRef ref="lawson-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lawson</persRef> had advised me to come this day. They
							said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawson had nothing to do with it. At
							last however a man was called and directed to shew us the works. He
							hurried us along through the different apartments, without absolute
							incivility, and with very little civility— There is only one Steam
							engine, with a thirty horse power. We saw the various operations of
							rolling the bars of cutting, heating, weighing, washing cleaning, and
							coining the blanks of half crowns and shillings— I had twice seen all
							the same works at the Mint at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Petersburg. The workmen here were more numerous. The washing of the
							Blanks in vitriolic acid I had not seen in Russia. Our conductor told
							me, that they struck four hundred thousand pieces in a day— We walked
							back to Craven Street. <persRef ref="coles-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Coles</persRef> called there He has
							lately arrived from France. Smith went with John and Charles to the Sans
							Pareil Theatre in the Strand. George went to Drury Lane— I dined with
								<persRef ref="desousaholstein-pedro">Count Palmella</persRef> the
							Portuguese Ambassador 74. South Audley Street. <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> was to have
							dined there, but is confined to his house with a Cold and sore throat—
							The <persRef ref="ryder-dudley">Earl of Harrowby</persRef>, <persRef

								ref="berkeley-george2">Admiral Berkley</persRef> were there.

								ref="deriquet-georges">Count Caraman</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="planta-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Planta</persRef>,
							and some others, persons attached to the Portuguese Embassy— At table I
							sat next to Lord Harrowby, and had much conversation with him; chiefly
							on the subject of Government. Whigs and Tories. The rights of the People
							and the rights of Kings— He appeared disposed to appretiate highly the
							free and liberal parts of the British Constitution; but he spoke with
							the contempt of derision, about radical reform, annual parliaments and
							universal suffrage. Sneered at <persRef ref="paine-thomas">Tom
								Paine</persRef>—spoke slightingly of <persRef ref="locke-john"
								>Locke</persRef>, and censured the phraseology of the Act of
							Parliament by which <persRef ref="james-ii">James the second</persRef>
							was declared to have broken the compact between the king and People— He
							attempted an argument about the duty and obligation of obedience,
							binding upon the people— I asked him if he admitted Government to be an
							affair of compact, and told him I would not ask any other concession. He
							was not willing to admit it; nor prepared to deny it; and I forebore to
							press him. He finally said the People had a right to be well governed,
							and when they were not, it was not of much consequence what the rights
							of Government to their obedience might be. After dinner I returned to
							Craven Street. John &amp; Charles soon after came in with Smith from the
							Play— I did not wait for George, but came home with them at One.</p>

						<p><date>4. IV:15. </date>Wrote despatch 73 to the <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef>, breakfasted early
							and went into London. Walked to Turnham Green where I was overtaken by
							the Carriage. At Craven Street I found there was a Letter from <persRef
								ref="clarkson-william">W. S. Clarkson</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="smith-john">J. A. Smith</persRef>, giving notice that he had
							remitted to <persRef ref="maury-james">James Maury</persRef> at
							Liverpool, by direction of <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my
								brother</persRef>, a Bill of Exchange payable to me. I went and
							looked at several houses in Holles Street, and at one in Cavendish
							Square, to be let— The Rents are ten and twelve guineas a week, and the
							house in Cavendish Square 500 guineas a year; and a barely decent house
							for a small family. I called at the <persRef ref="u">House Agent
								Robins’s</persRef> to enquire if it was to be let for a shorter
							term, but he asked four <pb n="149" type="ms"/>hundred guineas for it
							for four Months, or what they call the Season. It is usually from the
							first of April to the last of July, that being the period when the town
							is most frequented. On returning to Craven Street, I looked over the
							house where my Office is kept, which is also now to be let and is
							offered to me at ten Guineas a week. I shall most probably take it,
							having determined to return home next Summer.— There was a Note from
								<persRef ref="deriquet-georges">Count G. Caraman</persRef> enclosing
							a Letter to be forwarded to Philadelphia— I called at <persRef
								ref="silvester-richard">Silvester’s</persRef> and took the Seal for
								<persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>— Went to the foreign
							Office in Downing Street, and enquired if he could inform me, what was
							the object of a Bill now pending in Parliament, respecting the number of
							Passengers in foreign Vessels. He did not know. I told him there had
							been so many obstacles thrown in the way of American Vessels about their
							passengers, and I had been so unsuccessful in my applications to remove
							them, that on seeing in the Newspapers a Notice of this Bill, I was
							apprehensive it would raise new embarrassments, and wished to know its
							purport, and to enquire if some clause could not be introduced into it,
							at least to facilitate the means for the <persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas"
								>American Consul</persRef> to send home destitute American Seamen.
							He sent to <persRef ref="robinson-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Robinson</persRef> to enquire what the intention of the
							Bill now before the house of Commons was; but Robinson was gone to the
							house, and <persRef ref="hamilton-william">Hamilton</persRef> promised
							to write me the purport of the Bill. I pressed upon him the singularity
							of my position receiving from this Government one day the most urgent
							requisitions to send home to the United States all the Americans found
							here in distress, and the next day refusals of every accommodation to
							enable the American Consul to send them home. He said the requisitions
							to send them away were mere circular Letters sent to all the foreign
							Ministers, in the same words, adopted no doubt from a Letter from
								<persRef ref="addington-henry2">Lord Sidmouth’s</persRef> Office,
							and founded altogether upon representations from the <persRef
								ref="wood-matthew">Lord Mayor</persRef>. It was merely an
							invitation, of which the foreign Ministers were not obliged to take any
							notice at-all. Or they might say if they pleased that their Governments
							would not charge themselves with providing for their Countrymen who came
							here. I told him I had viewed the application in a very different, and
							more serious light, and had taken every possible means of complying with
							the requisition— I mentioned the delays which had interposed before the
							Consul could obtain the permission for the last transport to be
							dispatched; and the restrictions which finally limited the number of her
							Passengers, so that finally ten men who were sent on board, and ready to
							go with her, were turned back upon the Consul’s hands. The refusal to
							allow the Masters of American Vessels to take each five or six of these
							destitute Seamen, without reckoning five tons of the ship’s burthen, and
							abridging proportionably the number of profitable passengers, they may
							take. I complained of the inequality which this occasioned between
							British and American Vessels. The British not being bound to take any
							destitute American Seamen— He said British Vessels were obliged in like
							manner to take destitute British Seamen in our Ports— But I observed
							they were not subject to any limitation of the number of their
							Passengers. He said our Masters of Vessels were required to take our
							Seamen, by our own Laws, which the British Government could not
							controul. That we were not obliged to send our Seamen to America; we
							might send them any where else; where we pleased— That returns had been
							made to <persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Lord Bathurst’s</persRef> Office
							of all the Passengers that had gone from England in American Vessels in
							the course of the last year, and the number was very small. I said that
							was a proof how unnecessary all these restrictions were— He thought it
							was a proof that the regulations could not affect any considerable
							American interest, and therefore there could be no cogent motive for
							altering the Law— It is curious to observe to what shifts of argument
							these people resort, rather than candidly to come out with their real
							reasons and motives. Hamilton asked me, if British Seamen did not apply
							to be sent to the United States upon pretence of being Americans— I told
							him there were such cases, but the Consul always rejected them when he
							could ascertain the attempt at fraud— That I had suggested this
							difficulty in a Note to <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef>, when he sent me the first requisition to send
							home all the destitute American Seamen; and had desired that this
							Government, should take upon itself the scrutiny, and specifically point
							out who were the Americans. But to this proposal I had received no
							answer— It was evident from the tenour of Hamilton’s Conversation, that
							the restrictions upon the carrying of Passengers will be increased, and
							in no respect relaxed. I left him, and returned to Craven-Street, and
							thence home. I found a Letter from Ja<hi rend="superscript">s.</hi>
							Maury, enclosing a second Bill of Exchange for £877:10. Sterling, at
							sixty days sight, drawn at New-York 27. January, by <persRef

							Addresses were presented; some for retrenchment and reform, and the
							others to congratulate the Prince upon his escape, from the barbarous
							and traitorous, bullet and potatoe-plot and outrage. The presenters of
							many of the Addresses of this last description were knighted— I had
							short Conversations with many of the persons attending the Levee— The
								<persRef ref="delosrios-carlos">Spanish Ambassador, Fernan
								Nuñez</persRef>, asked me if Congress had passed the Bill to
							prohibit the sale of armed Vessels by the Citizens of the United States,
							to the South American Insurgents— I had not heard. He said it was of
							great importance that it should pass— <persRef ref="fox-henry">Lord
								Holland</persRef> told me they considered their division in the
							House of Lords, against the Bill for suspending the Habeas Corpus Act,
							as a remarkably strong one. They mustered with their proxies 35 votes,
							against about 156—not one to four. <persRef ref="erskine-thomas">Lord
								Erskine</persRef> asked me, if I had seen his late publication; a
							sort of political Romance, entitled “Armata”—in form, an imitation of
							Gulliver’s Voyage to Lilliput, but in fact a review of the History of
							England, during the last half Century— I had bespoken the Book, but had
							not yet received it— He said he had given very freely his opinion there,
							both of the American revolutionary War, and of the French War. He was
							determined that his opinion upon both those subjects should go recorded
							to posterity— People might say it was damn’d Nonsense, but when, by
							whatever course of Events it happened that a man had sat upon the
							woolsack his opinions would have some weight with posterity.— I told him
							it needed not his seat upon the woolsack to give weight to his opinions.
							He said <persRef ref="addington-henry2">Sidmouth</persRef> had told him
							he had read his Armata, and although there were many things in which
							they had differed, he admired many things in this book— It was a curious
							observation to me, to see a man of Erskine’s Powers, taking pride in the
							Admiration of Lord Sidmouth— Erskine said he had given <hi rend="italic"
								>them</hi> a trimming for the American and French Wars. <hi
								rend="italic">Now</hi> there was not much diversity of Opinion about
							the first; but he had not the least doubt that if this Country had not
							gone to War with France, <persRef ref="louis-xvi">Louis the 16<hi
									rend="superscript">th.</hi></persRef> would have been at this
							day living; and King. He said that he himself had drawn up the French
							judicial Code— He had been five Months a member of the Committee for the
							Administration of Justice, and had worked for them the whole time,
							almost night and day. He had drawn up the whole system in English—and
							the simple translation from his work had been adopted— I took it that he
							spoke of the period under what was called the Constituent Assembly— I
							spoke to <persRef ref="dundas-robert">Lord Melville</persRef>, and
							mentioned to him the terms of our new arrangement with Algiers; with
							which he expressed himself to be very well satisfied. The <persRef
								ref="ryder-dudley">Earl of Harrowby</persRef>, in a good humoured
							manner told me that he thought our Conversation at <persRef
								ref="desousaholstein-pedro">Count Palmella’s</persRef> the other
							day, would make a figure in print, as a political dialogue; though his
							part of it, would shew to very little advantage. I told him, I was
							afraid if it should be printed, it would be thought to have an
							inflammatory tendency.— He said No—and that if due allowance was made
							for the situations of the respective Speakers, very little difference of
							principle would be found between us. He then recurred to France again;
							and said that Monsieur, <persRef ref="gallatin-albert"
								>Gallatin</persRef>, he begged his pardon, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin, had spoken to him last Summer, with great contempt
							of the French Notions of Liberty— I said it seemed to me that the French
							were unable to combine all the simple ideas that were essential to
							constitute the complex idea of Liberty. They had for instance never been
							able to realize the principle of the Habeas Corpus Act— I considered
							this principle, as completely carried into effect by practice to be the
							only distinguishing feature of Liberty possessed by the British, over
							the other Nations of Europe; because in it was included the Liberty of
							the Press; which could not co-exist, with a power of arbitrary
							imprisonment. He said he thought it not the <hi rend="italic">only</hi>
							distinct feature of British Liberty; because there was the immense, the
							overbearing power of Public Opinion; which was such that a British
							Government, even possessing the power of arresting individuals, must
							exercise it with such extreme caution and reserve, that it was scarcely
							any power at-all.— I admitted the force of public opinion, but said it
							was not peculiar, to this Country.— It was as great in France, and
							indeed all over Europe. And <pb n="151" type="ms"/>indeed on the
							Continent was the only controul against the abuse of power, by the
							Governments. He said it was true: within the last forty years Public
							Opinion had risen up, and become the Queen of the World— It was the
							Dominion of the Newspapers. He agreed with me, as to the great value of
							the principle of the Habeas Corpus Act; but he also believed that its
							efficacy and its value depended entirely upon its being occasionally,
							and upon particular emergencies suspended. He did not know whether this
							would apply to America, But here, he was convinced it would unless
							occasionally suspended, operate not to the preservation, but to the
							destruction of public Liberty— I told him I had once as a Senator of the
							United States, voted for the suspension there, in the case of Burr’s
							conspiracy— The Senate had unanimously passed the Bill; but it was
							thrown out by the House of Representatives, and we had got along without
							it— He asked me what had been the object of <persRef ref="burr-aaron"
								>Burr’s</persRef> Conspiracy. I said it had been twofold— One a
							military project against Mexico. The other a plan to break up the Union
							of the States, and set up a Government of his own at New-Orleans;
							drawing as many of the Western States into it as he could— He enquired
							what had become of Burr, and whether he was not a man of considerable
							talents. I said he certainly possessed talents; and was now living in
							New-York, in obscurity. Recurring again to France he said he had been at
							Paris at the time of the first restoration of <persRef ref="louis-xviii"
								>Louis 18</persRef>. and again last year, in the midst of the party
							struggles between the Ultra-royalists and the ministerialists. And it
							was strange to observe the ultra’s, at the last period contending
							against a mere remnant proposed by the ministers of a restrictive law,
							which but the year before had been enacted by the ultra’s themselves.
							The king had granted him a private Audience; and the first question he
							had asked him was, whether he had read <persRef
								ref="chateaubriand-francois">Chateaubriand’s</persRef> new pamphlet?
							It was only two days after it had been suppressed by the King’s
							Authority. He therefore had answered the king that he had paid too much
							respect to his Majesty’s laws to have read the Book yet; but that he had
							it, and should soon read it. The king told him that Chateaubriand might
							have attacked his ministers and their measures, if he thought proper—
							They were fair subjects of discussion— But when he insinuated the
							personal duplicity of the king himself it was impossible for him to
							overlook it; or to avoid manifesting his displeasure— Lord Harrowby
							added that the conduct of the ultra-royalists, was indeed very
							extraordinary, but it was an exact counterpart of the latter portion of
								<persRef ref="walpole-robert">Sir Robert Walpole’s</persRef>
							Administration in this Country, when all the motions in Parliament in
							favour of Liberty were made by the Jacobites and the Tories.— I spoke to
								<persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Earl Bathurst</persRef> of the state
							of things in South America; and of a petition presented a few days since
							by <persRef ref="sharp-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sharp</persRef>, to the House of Commons, from one Englishman named
								<persRef ref="u">Davison</persRef>, complaining of having suffered
							torture by the thumb-screw, under the tyranny of the <persRef
								ref="christophe-henri">Haytian black King Henry</persRef>: I said it
							gave a very different impression of that person’s government, from that
							which I had received from <persRef ref="saunders-prince">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Prince Saunders</persRef>. Lord
							Bathurst said Davison had been to him, and shewn him his thumbs— They
							were indeed somewhat flattened, but did not appear to have suffered
							essential injury. The charge against him was that he had written
							politics in a professedly commercial Letter; and he certainly had
							mentioned the failure of an expedition of Christophe’s, without any
							comment indeed, but in such a manner as to shew that he was pleased with
							the failure— As to the South-American Affairs, he said the wars there
							appeared interminable. Neither party could obtain any permanent
							advantage over the other. It was very clear that <persRef
								ref="morillo-pablo">Morillos</persRef> would not even be able to
							maintain his own advantages without further reinforcements. While the
							Prince Regent was going round the Levee-room, <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> came up to me,
							and told me that he should soon wish to have some Conversation with me—
							I said I should be at his service at any hour that he would appoint. He
							replied that he would give me notice; he hoped in a few days; and that
							he should be authorized to discuss with me, at least the commercial part
							of the subjects I had proposed. But now he was incessantly harrassed
							with business, more than at any other period of his life— As to the
							afternoon and evening, he had been accustomed to be then occupied; but
							now the mornings were also absorbed, and he could only step from one
							Committee-Room to another— I introduced General Boyd to him. The
								<persRef ref="fane-john">Earl of Westmorland</persRef>, also spoke
							to me, and as he usually does was entering into the most prominent
							topics of the day, but some person came and called him away. He was
							making enquiries of me about our methods of conducting Elections in
							America, and asked if we allowed universal suffrage. I told him not
							altogether— In some of the States the right of voting was <pb n="152"
								type="ms"/>confined to freeholders, but in most of them it was
							universal, or extended to all who paid direct taxes, which was nearly
							the same thing. But even where the right of suffrage was universal, the
							elections were in general orderly. Riots seldom happened, and those only
							in the large Cities, such as New-York. We found nothing impracticable in
							universal suffrage, though I had observed it was considered here that it
							would be so in this Country— He said he did not know that it would be
							impracticable—but it would be a Revolution. England would be no longer
							England with it; for with a House of Commons so constituted, no other
							branch of the Government could subsist— I said I believed with him that
							it would be a Revolution; but how far it would extend I was not
							intimately enough acquainted with the practical construction of the
							Government to foresee— He said the Revolution would be total; and as it
							is, said he, it is doubtful whether we shall be able to save it. The
							popular power in this Country has increased and the power of the Crown
							has diminished within the last forty years enormously. This is the
							Ministerial doctrine of the day— I intimated a doubt of its
							correctness—remarked the power of the Crown over the house of Peers,
							three fourths of which have been created in the present reign— The
							influence of Official Patronage in the House of Commons, and in the Army
							and Navy— He said the Army and Navy were nothing, or next to nothing to
							the Crown— The Patronage was that of the Ministries, as they came on in
							succession. The influence of Offices, in the House of Commons, was much
							less than it had formerly been. In the house of Lords it was scarcely
							any thing; for the few Offices held by Peers were so small either in
							power or emolument to be no object at all of pursuit or desire to a
							Peer— The House of Peers had now become so numerous that they were much
							less under the influence of the Crown than formerly; they were created
							in fact not by the crown, but by the Ministers; and when once created
							were altogether independent of the Crown, which could not take the
							Peerage away: I thought still there was a sense of personal obligation,
							to the king, weighing more or less upon all the Peers created by him;
							but he said no—nothing at all. I said there was at least a sense of
							Common interest—a conviction that the dignity of the Peerage could not
							exist without that of the crown. That he said was some thing: And then I
							noticed the great influence of the Peers, in the House of Commons— Oh!
							yes! that very fortunately was great; and that was the only thing that
							could maintain the Constitution— For if once the house of Lords should
							take a wrong turn there would be no remedy. The partizans of Revolution
							had changed their point of attack— Formerly, it was against the Crown;
							but now they had turned against the House of Commons; but their object
							remained the same— Here, much to my regret our Conversation was
							interrupted— Between four and five O’Clock we left the Levee-Room,
							before the General Levee was over— On returning to Craven-Street I found
								<persRef ref="u">Captain Upton</persRef> of the British Navy; who
							wished to have a deed proved before me; of an Estate in the State of
							New-York— I appointed next Tuesday, between two and four O’Clock for
							that purpose. I sent several packages to <persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Aspinwall’s</persRef> Office
							to go, by the Galen, <persRef ref="tracy-charles">Captain
								Tracy</persRef> to Boston; with a Note to the Consul— Returning home
							a Gentleman riding on horseback, knocked at the glass of my
							Carriage-door, and on my stopping, complained that my <persRef
								ref="jobbern-benjamin">Coachman</persRef> had startled his horse,
							and exposed him to danger, and then laughed at him— I assured him it
							must have been unintentional, as my Coachman was a quiet, sober man,
							incapable of insulting or willingly injuring any one— He strenuously
							insisted it was so— I said I would then make enquiry as soon as I should
							get home, into the Circumstances— He said there was no occasion for
							enquiry as he assured me it was so— I asked the favour of his name— He
							said <persRef ref="u">Ponsonby</persRef>; and he hoped I would at least
							reprimand the man. I promised him I certainly should if he deserved it.
							As soon as I got home I made enquiry how the accident had happened— It
							was at the short turning of a Street— The Gentleman’s horse had started
							on suddenly meeting those of my Carriage. But he suffered no injury, and
							the insult was imaginary. Robert says it was M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Ponsonby, the Opposition Leader in the House of Commons, and
							Ex-Chancellor of Ireland— As I was coming home I read <persRef

							the Navy, who proved according to a Law, of the State of New-York,
							before me, a conveyance by Lease and Release, of certain real Estate

							Captain Shannon had witnessed the Execution by them all— The forms of
							the Certificates to be given by me had been drawn up, by <persRef
								ref="jay-peter">Peter A. Jay</persRef>. They declared that the
							witness was duly sworn, and deposed to the facts. I administered the
							Oath to Captain Shannon, considering that the authority for that purpose
							was given by implication in the New-York Statute; though I doubted
							whether by the general powers of my Office, I had the authority to
							administer an Oath to a British Subject— After they were gone, <persRef
								ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Platt</persRef> came in; and
							after him, <persRef ref="rotch-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							return to Dunkirk, where many years ago, he was for some time settled.
							And he is desirous of obtaining the Appointment of American Consul
							there. I promised him any assistance that I can give, to assist him in
							the attainment of his object. He went with me to the Corner of Bouverie
							Street where I left him; and went and dined with the <persRef
								ref="wood-matthew">Lord Mayor</persRef> at the Mansion House. I was
							punctual at the appointed hour, half past five; and was the first there.
							It was a dinner to the Aldermen and their Ladies: and the <persRef
								ref="augustusfrederick">Duke of Sussex</persRef>, the <persRef
								ref="bligh-john;bligh-elizabeth">Earl and Countess of
								Darnley</persRef>, <persRef ref="erskine-thomas">Lord

							Darnley came only at the Dessert, having been engaged at a debate in the
							house of Lords, upon a question moved by the <persRef
								ref="grosvenor-robert">Earl of Grosvenor</persRef> for abolishing
							Sinecures. The Lord Mayor had proposed to omit giving the usual Easter
							Monday dinner the present year, in Consideration of the Distresses of
							the Country, and to distribute among the charitable Institutions of the
							City, the sum of £1000 usually expended upon this Entertainment. He
							wrote a Note to each of the Aldermen, requesting his opinion upon this
							proposal, and then submitted it to them at a Court of Aldermen— But they
							unanimously declined giving any opinion, upon the question, as involving
							the antient usage and the dignity of the City, which as <persRef ref="u"
								>Miss Wood</persRef> observed to me was giving an opinion in the
							very act of declining to give one. She said it was a subject upon which
							they were very sore— The Lord Mayor told the Duke of Sussex that he had
							had a list made out of all the members of both Houses of Parliament, who
							had voted against the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, and had sent
							them all Cards for the dinner, and to no others. So that if they would
							come, it would serve as a Memento to the Ministers. The Duke said they
							would come— He would take care they should come. I led Miss Wood down to
							dinner, and sat next to her at Table; by which means I was seated lower
							down than my place should have been, but for my own satisfaction, I
							could not have been more agreeably seated. After the Ladies retired, the
								<pb n="154" type="ms"/>Lord Mayor called me up next to him— The
							party was less numerous than, any that I had met before at that place:
							not more than forty persons, and with less formality than usual. It was
							however impossible to escape the tax of toasting the healths of persons
							present, and the speeches to return thanks—but they were short and
							unpretending; in the mere style of conviviality— I went through this
							ceremony like the rest— The Lord Mayor, in naming me, alluded to the
							expectation of my early departure; and the Duke of Sussex, spoke of me
							in a very flattering and complimentary manner; which I answered with as
							little confusion and as few words as I could— There was an Evening party
							after dinner, and dancing. There I met <persRef ref="beechey-william"
								>Sir William Beechey</persRef> and <persRef ref="reeves-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Reeves</persRef>— I told Reeves I

							Canada, with <persRef ref="mcgillivray-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> M’Gillivray</persRef>, a Gentleman, at the head of the
							North-West Company— He also gave some hint as if he had thoughts of
							settling himself in America; being here he said in a very different rank
							of life from that in which he might be expected to move; and having all
							his prospects in life already blasted.— I encouraged him to hope for
							better times— Between eleven and twelve, I returned to Craven-Street,
							where we are to lodge until next Sunday.</p>

						<p><date>12: VI:30.</date> The Morning was much unoccupied, as a removal
							usually breaks up the habitual course of my employments. There was a
							curious meeting at my Office, of <persRef ref="reeves-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Reeves</persRef>, and of <persRef
								ref="cooke-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cooke</persRef> the
							chaplain in our Navy, at my Office. Reeves came to look at the papers in
								<persRef ref="crosby-william">Crosby’s</persRef> case; of which I
							had here only a general Statement— Cooke came to tell me that he had
							engaged his passage, and should sail in a few days for New York— About
							the year 1793. Cooke had been prosecuted at Cambridge, and convicted of
							seditious words, and Reeves about the same time, was the founder of the
							loyal associations all over the kingdom, against Republicans and
							Levellers. He was shortly after employed and very active in the
							prosecutions of persons charged with seditious practices— Cooke began by
							saying (not knowing Reeves) that since the suspension of the Habeas
							Corpus Act, and the revival of all the measures of rigour and
							restriction of the period when he had suffered; he was extremely anxious
							to get away from this Country, and safely landed in America— For there
							were so many rascally Spies about, there was no knowing what they would
							swear against a Man, and he could not feel himself secure of not being
							from one hour to another thrown into prison.— This immediately roused
							Reeves’s curiosity; who asked Cooke, if he was an American born— No,
							Sir, said Cooke I am an Englishman born; but have resided upwards of
							twenty years in America— I came over here some Months since, to see once
							more the friends yet surviving of those I had left behind, and am now
							returning to America; for a burnt Child dreads the fire— Then you have
							been a burnt Child, said Reeves— That I have, replied Cooke— Two
							rascally Spies, swore that I had said I meant to keep the 30<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January not by going to Church; but
							by dining upon a Calve’s head. That I thought the English Nation had
							done right in cutting off <persRef ref="charles-i">Charles the
								first’s</persRef> head, because he was a tyrant: that if other kings
							and emperor’s of our own times acted as tyrants, he thought their heads
							should be cut off; and if <persRef ref="george-iii">George the
								third</persRef> should ever become such a tyrant as Charles the
							first had been, he would deserve to lose his head in the same manner.—
							But you was acquitted? said Reeves— No Sir— I went to Jail, and lay
							there three Months: and but for the intervention of a friend, I should
							have lain there two years. At the end of three Months however I was
							discharged, and that score being settled, I came and took a house in
							London. Why, said Reeves, I must have you upon my black Book— Cooke
							looked up, and I said to him, this is M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Reeves— I dare say you have Sir, said Cooke; and I am pretty sure it was
							you, who drew up the Indictment against me— Reeves asked him if he had
							been tried at the Assizes, or at the Quarter Sessions. He answered at
							the Assizes and asked Reeves if he did not remember a man by the name of
								<persRef ref="u">Portlock</persRef>; he said he did not— Cooke then
							said he was by no means ashamed of having undergone that trial, and
							related an occurrence which had happened a few Months afterwards at a
							trial before <persRef ref="kenyon-lloyd">Lord Kenyon</persRef> at the
							Old Bailey; it was a civil Action between two parties, in which he Cooke
							was subpoena’d as a witness, and his evidence was so material that it
							decided the cause— When he had given his testimony <persRef
								ref="mingay-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mingay</persRef>
							who was counsel for the party against whom it operated, began to cross
							question him; and with a view to discredit his evidence asked him if he
							had not lately been in trouble? Cooke answered that his troubles or his
							pleasures were nothing to him: but he was perfectly ready to give the
							Court an exact account of the troubles to which he knew that Mingay
							alluded; and he then told Lord Kenyon, of the prosecution that he had
							suffered at Cambridge on the Report of the rascally spies. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Mingay called upon him to say what the
							words were for which he had been prosecuted— Cooke said to him—it was
							something very much like what you have got under your wig— It was about
							a Calve’s head—upon which Lord Kenyon, and the whole Court burst into a
							laugh at Mingay’s expense— Some time afterwards Mingay met him walking
							in the Strand; stopped and spoke to him; and told him he had never in
							his life been put to such confusion, as by his joke about the Calve’s
							head.— Reeves seemed to be afraid that if he stayed longer Cooke would
							begin to crack his jokes upon him, <pb n="155" type="ms"/>and went away.
							Cooke soon followed him, after taking a Passport. I went into the City,
							to the Counting house of the <persRef ref="baringbrothers">Brothers
								Baring</persRef>, but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							<persRef ref="baring-alexander">Alexander Baring</persRef> was not
							there— They told me he would be going for Paris again next Monday. On my
							return I went into S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul’s Church, where
							they were performing the service of the day. The singing was excellent.
							The last time I had been in the Cathedral, which was in 1797. there was
							only one monument there, which was that of <persRef ref="johnson-samuel"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Johnson</persRef>— There are
							now more than twenty. Executed chiefly by <persRef ref="flaxman-john"
								>Flaxman</persRef>, <persRef ref="bacon-john">Bacon</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="banks-thomas">Banks</persRef>. They are for the
							greatest part in honour of Officers who have fallen in Battle, and there
							is neither Genius nor variety in the designs— The inscriptions are all
							in English, and all marvelously insipid, generally a bare recital that
							they were erected at the public expence, by a Resolution of Parliament.
							The monument to Howard has an inscription upon the Pedestal; not in
							front, but at the left side of the Statue— It begins “this extraordinary
							Man[”] &amp;c, but does not give his name. It appears like the last part
							of an inscription, of which the first part should be on the other side—
							Johnson’s inscription is in Latin—well enough, excepting the notice that
							it was erected by a subscription of his friends, “pecunia conlata.” They
							might as well have inscribed the Sculptor’s Bill— I spent the Evening at
							home. <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife’s</persRef> health

						<p><date>13. VI:30. </date>There was a Meeting of the Inhabitants of
							Westminster, held this Morning in Palace-Yard, to Petition the <persRef
								ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef> for the removal of his
							present Ministers— Having occasion to walk that way, I had the curiosity
							to attend the Meeting for about half an hour—long enough to have my
							Pocket picked of my Handkerchief, and to hear detached parts of a Speech
							of <persRef ref="cochrane-thomas">Lord Cochrane</persRef>, who repeated
							a joke, already many times given out at the Public Meetings—a
							calculation of the number of farthings given by subscription, in
							charity, by the principal Sinecurists and Placemen, upon the amount of
							the sums which they receive of the public money. There was a general
							laugh from the Meeting at most of the names when he announced one with
							twelve farthings and 56 hundredth, and so down to two farthings and a
							half: but the moment he named <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef>, and before he mentioned his quota of
							farthings, there was an almost unanimous groan uttered, such as I never
							before heard; and when he had got through the whole list, there was an
							exclamation of “Knaves, Knaves, Knaves”—from thousands of voices at
							once— After Lord Cochrane, a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Walker</persRef> spoke; but in so low a tone of voice
							that I could not hear a word he said. Some of the people round me, said
							he was mad. A vote of thanks to the high Bailiff, <persRef
								ref="morris-arthur">Arthur Morris</persRef> was passed, for which he
							returned thanks and the meeting was dissolved. The assembly was very
							numerous, but they dispersed in perfect order. A Petition to the Prince
							was voted. I walked round and visited several second-hand Booksellers
							shops in search of Books for <persRef ref="boyd-george">M<hi

							observation: but all in the most perfect good humour.— Lord Holland’s
							wit principally consisted in “taking off,” ridiculous persons, and M<hi

							repeating puns— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brougham is not a man of

							occupied all the Morning with my Journal which I brought up to this day.
							We dined at five O’Clock, and after dinner came in to London. I walked
							to and beyond the Kensington Turnpike, before I was overtaken by the
							Carriage. We reached Craven-Street about half-past eight— I read in a
							Volume of <persRef ref="woodfall-william">Woodfall’s</persRef> Debates
							for 1795. two or three hours. Chiefly the Debates on the Treason and
							Sedition Bills of that time—the Precedents of those now in the process
							of re-enactment. <persRef ref="ryder-dudley">Lord Harrowby</persRef>
							alluded in his Conversation with me the other day at <persRef

								<persRef ref="abbott-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Abbott</persRef>, now the Speaker of the House of Commons, whether
							the Bill when passed into a Law would be obeyed, or whether the standard

							greatly annoyed Fox. I went over the whole debate this Evening, and
							specially marked these Speeches of Fox and Abbott— A comparison between
							the debates then and those at the present time strikingly illustrates
							the remark how tamely a Nation will bear the refixing of a yoke against
							which they most convulsively struggled, when first fastened upon them.
							There is now scarcely a voice raised against those Laws in a time of
							profound Peace, which Fox then pronounced so odious and oppressive that
							resistance against them by the People would be justifiable.</p>

						<p><date>18. VI: </date>A totally sleepless Night again. We resorted to
							several expedients to obtain sleep; and removed the bed to the adjoining
							drawing-room; but without success for myself. The principal cause of
							this I believe to be the smalness of the Bed-chamber and the want of a
							circulation of air, much aggravated by the form of the bed-curtains.

								<persRef ref="tallmadge-frederick">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Talmadge</persRef> respecting <persRef ref="crosby-william">William

								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh’s</persRef>—
							After repeating apologies for having delayed so long an official
							communication in answer to my note of the<space/>September last, which
							he attributed to the excessive pressure of business upon himself and
							upon the whole Government arising from the State of their internal
							affairs, he said he was at length authorized to make certain
							propositions to me relative to the commercial part of my proposals: the
							other or political part, involving so many and so extensive and
							complicated considerations, that the Government had not been able to
							come to any conclusion upon it— With regard to the intercourse between
							the United States and the British West-India Islands, this Government
							still adhered to the policy which had long been established, and were
							not prepared for any departure from their antient colonial policy; nor
							had they any complaint to make with respect to the act of Congress
							lately past prohibiting British Vessels from clearing out from the Ports
							of the United States for those Islands— They considered it merely as the
							exercise of a fair reciprocal right on the part of the United States, to
							which they could have no objection, and at which they entertained no
							dissatisfaction. I told him I had no information that the act had
							passed, but he said they had received the information— But he added that
							they were willing to extend the privileges of the Free-Port Act, which I
							had stated to be, and which really were now confined to the vessels of
							European Nations, to those of the United States; and also to admit them
							to the Island of Bermuda— And with respect to the intercourse between
							the United States and the British Provinces in North-America, they were
							willing to agree to an Article like one formerly proposed, which he read
							from a paper in his hand, and which seemed to me a transcript from the
							Treaty of 1794— He said he was not yet quite prepared, but he hoped to
							send me to-morrow, or perhaps in the course of this day, a Note
							containing all these propositions, which they would agree to, upon
							conditions of reciprocity, and with a view to manifest their
							dispositions to promote the harmony between the two Countries— I said
							that immediately upon receiving his Note, I should recur to my
							Instructions from my Government, and would submit to him the result of
							my observations upon his proposals— He said that if I should find it
							came within the extent of the Powers from my Government; so that it
							would not be necessary for me to refer the subject to them, he should
							propose to conclude the Articles as supplementary to the Convention of
							3. July 1815 and to be of the same duration— I said that so far as
							related to the principle of reciprocity, there would <pb n="158"
								type="ms"/>be nothing incompatible with it in the prohibitory Act of
							Congress, which applied only to Ports from which the vessels of the
							United States are excluded; and of course would immediately cease to
							apply to any Port that should be opened— I mentioned to him the
							accidents that had happened to some of the Letters and despatches
							addressed to me from America, by the operation of the Act of Parliament
							which requires that Letters brought in merchant vessels should be
							delivered up to be sent by the Post-Office— Lord Castlereagh did not
							know how the Law was, in this respect; nor did he suggest any means of
							removing the inconvenience. I also spoke to him concerning the case of
							W. B. Crosby, all the particulars of which I stated to him— I mentioned
							the Laws of the State of New-York confirming the claims of British
							Subjects to Estates liable to escheat—and told him I understood <persRef
								ref="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef>
							had promised Crosby any assistance that he could give him to obtain
							restitution of the property— Lord Castlereagh said he did not know that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot had written any thing upon the
							subject. That the Laws of the State of New-York were he supposed founded
							on the policy of the United States to encourage foreigners to speculate
							in our Lands, but very naturally the policy of this Country was to give
							no such encouragement— I spoke to him of Reeves’s pamphlets and of his
							doctrine that the disabilities of alienage could not apply to Citizens
							of the United States, and observed that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Crosby might perhaps want nothing more than the power to prosecute his
							appeal before the king in Council, which the late War only had prevented
							him from prosecuting— He said nothing to encourage the expectation that
							any thing in favour of Crosby would be done— My interview with him was
							of not more than half an hour; and he repeated that heretofore he had
							been used to devoting his Evenings to the House of Commons, and the
							Mornings to Foreign Affairs, but now he was obliged to employ his
							Mornings also to the internal affairs of the Country; being in constant
							and daily attendance upon two Committees— One of finance, embracing the
							whole system of public expenditure of the Country; and the other upon
							the Poor Laws— After leaving him I walked a couple of hours and visited
							several Booksellers shops. On returning home I found <persRef

							was by <persRef ref="foote-maria">Miss Foote</persRef>; who has all the

							last year performing the most insignificant parts, at a Salary of two
							Pounds a week. This year he was brought forward not two Months since in
							the part of <persRef ref="richardthe3rd">Richard the third</persRef>
							which he performed with great success; but was announced as a mere
							imitator of Kean— Then the Muses of the rival Theatres pulled caps for
							him; and Covent-Garden obtained final possession of him— In Cymbeline he
							plays a part that Kean has not attempted; but is still charged as being
							an imitator of him— He did not strike me as such; but as an actor far
							inferior to Kean. He got through the part of Posthumus very well; but
							with faint, and not undisputed applause. The House was however full. The
							play itself is deficient of interest— Bombastes Furioso is a farce
							excessively ridiculous and laughable. Midas is a Burletta, entirely
							musical, and humorous enough. It was past twelve O’Clock when the Play
							finished— <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, who had seen

							But since then he has been constantly losing; and the Poor Rates and

							quit; and they could not agree upon the terms of a new lease. The Land
							lord was willing to reduce the rent considerably, but not to the extent
							that he demanded— So he sold his Stock, and quitted the farm, and had
							determined to go and try his fortune in America. He came to ask for a
							Passport, which he being an Englishman I could not give him; but which I
							told him he would not want. He said they did throw obstacles in the way
							of people who wanted to go out of the Country— But he was not an
							artificer, but a farmer and no person could have any right to stop him.
							He had not finally determined whether to go from London, or from
							Liverpool. He had been to look at one vessel here, which he liked very
							well, but was afraid she would sail before he could be ready. He had

						<p><date>30. VII:30. </date>The languor and relaxation of the Spring are

						<p><date>31. VII:30. </date>A succession of visitors employed almost the

							East-India Company, in remuneration for his services to them as a
							partizan Chief, to export 300 Tons of Saltpetre, from Calcutta to the
							United States— This Cargo was nevertheless seized at the Cape of Good
							Hope, and condemned by the Vice-Admiralty Court.— The Court of Appeals
							in England reversed this Sentence, and decreed the restoration of the
							property to Boyd— But a sale had been forced at the Cape, the proceeds
							of which left a heavy loss upon him; instead of a very large profit
							which he would have realized in the United States, had his Saltpetre
							duly arrived there. He is now therefore renewing an application to the
							East-India Company for a new grant of the like privilege, and with some
							promise of success has received an intimation advising him to apply for
							the sanction of the Government— He left the paper with me, not expressly
							asking for my interposition in his favour, but doubtless with a view of
							obtaining it— <persRef ref="buchanan-wb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Buchanan</persRef> came for a Passport and is now going to Edinburgh
							for a Month, intending then to embark at Liverpool, without returning to

								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> on the case—
							Told him of the Conversations I had had with <persRef ref="reeves-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Reeves</persRef> relating to it,
							and advised him to take the opinion of some lawyer of eminence upon it—
							This measure he preferred however to postpone, until Lord Castlereagh
							shall have answered my Note— <persRef ref="thorpe-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Thorpe</persRef>, the youngest
								<persRef ref="thorpe-samuel">Son of the old Gentleman</persRef> whom
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> went to see
							last week at Walthamstow, but whom she did not find at home, came to

							visitor was <persRef ref="tillary-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tillary</persRef>, a Scotchman, who after a residence of forty years
							in the United States came over last Summer to pay a visit to his native
							Country. He was an acquaintance of <persRef ref="smith-john"
								>Smith’s</persRef> and a physician of eminence and great practice at
							New-York. But his present tour has not yielded him the gratification he
							had expected. During his absence he has had the misfortune of losing
								<persRef ref="tillary-brachy">his wife</persRef> with whom he had
							lived happily, thirty-five years, and of whose death he has but very
							recently heard. And in Scotland he has been disappointed in his
							expectations— The University of Edinburgh where he was educated has lost
							all its eminent professors and is in a decayed and declining state—
								<persRef ref="u">Munro</persRef> is much degenerated from the
							abilities and merit of his father and Grandfather— <persRef
								ref="gregory-james">Gregory</persRef> is a man of talents, but a
							perfect bashaw— The professors of Theology have become frequenters of
							dancing assemblies, and card-players, and the only good instruction to
							be acquired at Edinburgh, is from the private Lecturers who are
							discouraged by the Magistrates.— The Doctor spoke with so much feeling
							upon all these Subjects that he was quite affecting— In my Morning walk
							I met and walked with <persRef ref="joy-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> G. Joy</persRef>, in the Temple-Garden. He is now at his
							nephew <persRef ref="joy-hh">H. H. Joy’s</persRef> rooms in the Paper
							Buildings. In passing through the Courts and Yards of the Temple I
							looked up at the windows of the chambers occupied by my friend <persRef
								ref="murray-william2">W. V. Murray</persRef>, with a melancholy
							recollection of the Scenes I had witnessed there at my first
							acquaintance with him in 1784. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joy spoke
							to me of a rumour now revived by Articles in the Newspapers last
							received from New-York; one of which is copied into the Morning
							Chronicle of this day; purporting that I am to be recalled, with the
							offer of the Department of State; to which is added that <persRef
								ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> is to
							be appointed to the Mission at this Court. It is however a merely
							unauthenticated rumour, though I have more <pb n="163" type="ms"/>reason
							to fear than to hope it may prove well founded. Joy kept me in
							conversation and walking until the time came for returning home to
							dinner— I went with my wife and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith to
							an Evening party at <persRef ref="u">Miss Bond’s</persRef>— Her Drawing
							Rooms are small, and were excessively crowded, with Company. <persRef
								ref="desousaholstein-pedro">Count Palmella</persRef> and the
								<persRef ref="freire-cipriano">Chevalier de Freire</persRef> were

								&amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Clymer</persRef> of
