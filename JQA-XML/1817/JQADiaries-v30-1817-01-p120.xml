						<p><date>1. VI: </date>Wednesday. The Morning was employed in closing the
							Journal of the departed year; and with the Sentiments befitting the
							Commencement of the new one— Of the last year, my Journal has absorbed
							an undue proportion, and led to arrears of Correspondence which are yet
							to be retrieved.— A sense of public duty induced me to begin the year
							with some official act; I made a draft of a Note to <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, on the case of
							the Ship Hope, concerning which I had spoken to him at our last
							Interview; and enclosed it to <persRef ref="smith-john">J. A.
								Smith</persRef> requesting him to copy and send it immediately— I
							answered also the Note yesterday received from <persRef ref="fox-henry"
								>Lord Holland</persRef>. Received a Note from Lord Castlereagh,
							dated yesterday, and informing me that the Lords of the Treasury had
							directed the Commissioners of the Customs to grant the permission
							requested for the Samoset. The Evening’s Post brought an enclosed Packet
							for <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">C. Hughes</persRef>, and a Letter
							to <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> from <persRef

						<p><date>2. V: </date>After commencing the diary of the year, I determined
							to turn my immediate attention to the arrears of my correspondence, and
							wrote an answer to <persRef ref="visger-herman">H. Visger</persRef>,
							Consul at Bristol— Began also a Letter to <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>. But from Breakfast time I met with some
							interruption— Received a Letter from <persRef ref="clitherow-mary">Miss
								Mary Clitherow</persRef>, informing me that she does not expect to
							have occasion to remove soon to this house; that she will be glad to
							have us remain in it as tenants, and will give us ample notice if she
							should have hereafter a necessity for our removal.— I answered her
							Letter by a Note enclosing the amount of the Rent due till next Monday,
							and assuring her that I will give her as early notice as possible, if I
							should be under the necessity of removing myself. She replied by a short
							note in the Evening. Walked with <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef> to Brentford and through Sion House Park. On
							returning home, I took up the Papers of the case of the Mary, with the
							intention of addressing a Note concerning it to <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>— The perusal of
							the Papers however occupied me till dinner time, and I found there were
							documents for which I must write to <persRef ref="glennie-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Glennie</persRef>, before preparing my
							Note— Evening Cards with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my

								J. T. Kirkland</persRef> of Harvard University; both introducing a
								<persRef ref="boyle-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Isaac
								Boyle</persRef>, who left them at the Office— Boyle comes to bespeak
							instruments for the Observatory.— The President mentions that they had

							from Hamburg; and mentions that <persRef ref="bourne-sylvanus">S.

								ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Aspinwall</persRef>, and to <persRef ref="vaughan-william">W.
								Vaughan</persRef>; and made out my quarterly Account. Went into
							London with <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, who left me at
							Hyde Park corner. I called upon <persRef ref="u">General von
								Neuffer</persRef> the Wurtemberg Minister, with three Notes which I
							have received from him containing enquiries concerning Wurtembergers
							deceased at New-York, and Philadelphia— The first was of 16 July last,
							concerning <persRef ref="bach-anton">Anton Henry Bach</persRef>, who
							died at New-York in 1798. I had requested <persRef ref="smith-john">J.
								A. Smith</persRef> to write to some friend at New-York to make the
							enquiries. He wrote to <persRef ref="smith-james9">James
							Smith</persRef>, and a few days since received his answer which I took
							with me to General Neuffer. He desired me to leave it with him as he was
							desirous of sending it to his Government, and said he would retain a
							copy of it here— The second was of 4. December, a certificate of the
							Minister of the <persRef ref="helmuth-justus">German Lutheran Church at
								Philadelphia</persRef>, authenticated by the <persRef
								ref="wharton-robert">Mayor of Philadelphia</persRef>, but of which
							further authentication was requested. I asked the General if mine would
							answer— I knew that R. Wharton was Mayor of Philadelphia, and had no
							doubt it was his signature, and the Seal of the City that were upon the
							paper. He said my certificate to that effect to which he would then add
							his own, would suffice.— I retained the paper to make out my Certificate
							upon it. The third was of the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of
							December, asking me to obtain a certificate of the decease of a man
							named <persRef ref="u">Schwarz</persRef> at New-York and information
							concerning the Estate left by him— I observed that this could be
							obtained only in the same manner as I had got that relative to Bach, and
							enquired whether that would be satisfactory. He said it would, and that
							he would pay every expence that <pb n="121" type="ms"/>might be
							occasioned by it. He apologized to me for giving me so much trouble
							about these concerns of individuals. He said that the Governments in
							Germany were so organized that all such business was transacted through
							the medium of ministerial departments. A note to the Minister of foreign
							Affairs, produced a reference to the Minister of the Interior, and there
							all information upon such Subjects was to be obtained; but it was not so
							in this Country, nor, he supposed in America; and here when he had
							enquiries of this kind to make he was obliged to make them not in his
							Official character; but in his private capacity. He had written so to
							his Government; but they continued to send him instructions of that
							sort, and he was obliged to execute them. He thanked me for the
							attention I had paid to the cases concerning which he had written to me,
							and offered any services that might be in his power in return— I asked
							him if there was any Agent or Minister of the <persRef
								ref="charlesofbaden">Grand Duke of Baden</persRef> now here. He said
							none. I said I had a Letter from the <persRef ref="madison-james"
								>President of the United States</persRef> to the Grand-Duke, which
							had been sent to me, on the supposition that he had a Minister here, and
							with Instructions to deliver it to him. I asked him if he could put me
							in the way of having it transmitted. He said Baden was their next door
							Neighbour— Not 15 Miles, German, from Stutgard. If I would send him the
							Letter, he would forward it to his Government, and thence it would be
							safely transmitted to the Grand Duke. The General then, after noticing
							the newspaper paragraphs about my being recalled, launched out into
							general politics, and said he thought the Government here were very much
							embarrassed; and that they would have a stormy Session of Parliament— I
							was not of that opinion. Warm debates their probably will be; but a
							heavy majority of Parliament are pledged body and soul to the Ministers,
							upon every object they may choose to carry; and all Parliament are so
							pledged, upon every public subject now at issue, that it is not at all
							from Parliament that the Ministers have any serious difficulty to
							expect— He then spoke of Spain, and said he strongly suspected <persRef
								ref="cevallos-pedro">Cevallos</persRef> would be taken again by the
								<persRef ref="ferdinand-iii">king</persRef>, for the seventh time,
							to be his prime Minister. That he personally knew <persRef
								ref="pizarro-joseph">Pizarro</persRef>, who upon this last
							dismission of Cevallos had taken his place. He was certainly a man of
							Talents; but a very violent Man. As to the Spanish affairs in
							South-America, he could make nothing of them; but he believed Spain
							would never recover her authority over the Colonies— As for us in
							Germany said he “je crois que nous nous tirerons d’Affaire—” On the
							sixteenth of this Month we shall have in Wurtemberg a new Constitution,
							“et une très belle Constitution,” proclaimed. And when we have once
							begun, Baden must follow the example— Bavaria perhaps will be reluctant,
							but must at last prendre son parti, and that will give an irresistible
							impulse to the South of Germany—and when that is accomplished the North
							of Germany cannot linger long to come into the change. So according to
							the General, every thing is to be done by the example of Wurtemberg— I
							observed that there appeared to be much difficulty to the introduction
							of a Constitution in Prussia— He said there was; but Prussia would get
							along. The great misfortune was that the <persRef ref="francis-i"
								>Emperor of Austria</persRef>, who was one of the best and worthiest
							and most honourable men in the world, could not however endure to hear
							the very word Constitution mentioned. He had a horror even of the word—
							I said I supposed that was the result of the French Revolution— And
							besides, that no absolute Prince, such as all the Sovereigns of Germany
							were, could be expected to relish a word, the only meaning of which must
							operate as a limitation of their own authority— He said that his
							Country, Wurtemberg was an exception to my remark that all the German
							Governments were absolute (I had myself excepted the imperial free
							cities.) But Wurtemberg had had a Constitution, under which the People
							had lived, free and contented more than two Centuries— I spoke of the
							contests which I had heard mentioned as prevailing between the <persRef
								ref="frederick-i-wurttemburg">late king</persRef>, and the States,
							both at the beginning and the close of his reign. He said he might now
							say it without hesitation, and it was too notorious to be denied; that
							the late king was a violent despot. But that he had never been able to
							overcome the resistance of the States, until he made his league with
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef>, who said to
							him in no other than these words “chassez ces bougres.”—and who
							supported him in it.— But I observed, that in the last days of the late
							king, and even since the accession of <persRef
								ref="frederickwilhelmkarl">his Son</persRef>, I had heard the States
							were insisting on the antient Constitution of the Country. It was
							impossible he said that that should be allowed. The great point for
							which they contended was not only that all public monies should be
							levied by them, which was perfectly <pb n="122" type="ms"/>proper, but
							that they should also have the management of its expenditure by a secret
							Committee of their own which was incompatible with any rational theory,
							and had been found excessively pernicious by experience. I asked him if
							there had not been some controversy on the part of certain mediatised
							Princes. He said yes— They would be very glad to resume the exercise of
							their Sovereign Authorities; but it was obviously impossible to indulge
							them in that humour.— I asked him if he thought the new Constitution
							would give general satisfaction. He had no doubt it would: And the
							States would have the power of levying all imposts and taxes; and all
							the accounts of the expenditures of public money would be laid before
							them— I enquired of the General after my former diplomatic acquaintance—
								<persRef ref="schenck-hans">Schenk</persRef> who is one of the
							mediatised Counts, is in no public employment— Neuffer spoke of him with
							great contempt— <persRef ref="u">Frohberg</persRef> on the contrary he
							said was a very good man— He has some Commandery of the Teutonic Order;
							but had declined a diplomatic Mission. <persRef
								ref="vonberoldingen-joseph">Count Beroldingen</persRef> is now the
							Minister at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg— On leaving the
							General I called at the <persRef ref="eustache-rene">French
								Ambassador’s</persRef> and left a Card for <persRef
								ref="deriquet-georges">Count George de Caraman</persRef>, the
							Secretary of the Embassy, who brought me a Letter from <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>— He was gone to Brighton— Thence I stopped at
								<persRef ref="richardson-d">Richardson’s</persRef> in Pall Mall, and
							then proceeded to Craven Street— There found Letters from my <persRef
								ref="adams-john">father</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-thomas"
								>brother</persRef>, from <persRef ref="auldjo-thomas">T.
								Auldjo</persRef> and <persRef ref="couling-william">W.
								Couling</persRef>. My father is anxious and urgent in his advice to
							me to return to America. My brother’s Letter relates to my affairs in
							his hands. Auldjo writes about his consular Bonds, and expenditures, and
							Couling about his losses and misfortunes, including <persRef ref="u">his
								wife</persRef> the greatest of them all— I went with J. A. Smith to
							N. 4. Sackville Street Piccadilly, to see <persRef ref="jouffroy-georg"
								>Jouffroy</persRef> the Prussian Chargé d’Affaires, but he was not
							at home. I stopp’d at <persRef ref="u">Williams</persRef> the
							Stationers, on returning to Craven Street. There came visitors to the
							Office. <persRef ref="thompson-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thompson</persRef> the publisher of the Translation of <persRef
								ref="alcedo-antonio">Alcedo’s</persRef> Dictionary concerning
							America, for which I subscribed last Summer— He said his Subscription
							had gone on very rapidly since then; and that he was desirous of
							collecting materials for a second Edition— Afterwards he said he wished
							to collect documents of all the changes that had occurred in America
							since the Period to which his work referred, and to publish it in the
							form of a Supplement— I advised him to form a correspondence with some
							of the British Consuls or persons connected with the British Legation in
							America, and get them to send him the public documents as they are from
							time to time published, and I recommended to him to take the National
							Intelligencer— He asked me if I was acquainted with <persRef
								ref="bouchette-joseph">Bouchette’s</persRef> Maps of Canada— I had
							seen them, and spoke of them with approbation— I also promised to lend
							him <persRef ref="pitkin-timothy">Pitkin’s</persRef> Statistical View of
							the commerce of the United States— He was followed by a <persRef
								ref="munro-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Munro</persRef>, a
							Mathematical instrument maker, who said he was born at Boston though he
							had been brought to England in his infancy, and had never since been in
							America. He came to enquire if I wanted any thing done, in his business,
							and shewed me a Letter which he had received from <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>
							when he was Minister here in 1804. dated 61. Wimpole-Street, and in
							answer to one which Munro had written to him, apparently making
							enquiries with a view to trace a kindred between them from the
							similarity of their names. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe says
							his family went to Virginia about a century ago, and have since
							constantly remained there. Munro had brought a small brass Bucket which
							he said was of his own invention, for weighing grain; but I have seen
							the same before. I took his address and told him if I should have
							occasion for any thing in his way I would send for him— <persRef
								ref="hughes-christopher">Hughes</persRef> came in next, and sat with
							us till near six O’Clock. He has been to Brighton, and returned in great
							admiration at the great attentions, paid by the <persRef ref="george-iv"
								>Prince Regent</persRef>, and all the Nobility there to <persRef
								ref="patterson-robert;patterson-marianne">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Patterson</persRef>
							and the <persRef ref="caton-elizabeth;hervey-louisa">Miss
								Caton’s</persRef>. Hughes says that he saw <persRef
								ref="warren-john2">Sir John</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="warren-caroline">Lady Warren</persRef> there; and that <persRef
								ref="cockburn-george">Admiral Cockburn</persRef> had been to see the
							Patterson’s— That he told them the Government here had blamed him for
							having left a house standing at Washington— That his instructions were
							at the attack upon Baltimore, to burn the town; and that the only thing
							that could have saved it would have been a contribution large enough to
							have justified him in breaking his instructions. Hughes talked over a
							multitude of other subjects; and among the rest gave an account of his
							reconciliation with <persRef ref="mansfield-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mansfield</persRef> who married his
							wife’s <persRef ref="mansfield-mary">Sister</persRef>— Hughes made a
							runaway match with <persRef ref="hughes-laura">Laura Smith</persRef>,
							daughter of <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">General Samuel Smith</persRef>
							of Baltimore. Mansfield, who is a natural son of <persRef
								ref="mansfield-james">Sir James Mansfield</persRef> late Chief
							Justice of the Court of Common-Pleas here, went to America, as a
							supernumerary Secretary to <persRef ref="rose-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rose’s</persRef> Mission; he did not
							return with Rose, but remained there some time longer, and married
							General Smith’s eldest daughter Mary. Smith the father was reconciled to
							Hughes, when he was appointed the Secretary to the Ghent Mission. At
							that time Hughes came here; but Mansfield and his wife refused to see
							him— But being now here with his wife, they have made it up; Mansfield
							made him a formal apology for what had past, which Hughes, accepted, and
							they are now upon a friendly footing— Hughes had written me, that they
								<pb n="123" type="ms"/>intended to leave London next Friday the
							tenth, and in the Note that I sent him this Morning I had invited him to
							come out and dine with us on Thursday. He had not received my Note; but
							said they had now agreed to leave London on Thursday. And the
							Patterson’s were to leave Brighton the same day. They were to meet at
							Dover, and proceed to France together. I then asked him to come and dine
							with us on Wednesday which he promised he would; though he said perhaps
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Mansfield would insist upon having
							her Sister with her, the last day of her being in town— Smith had made
							out several Cards of invitation for Thursday which he now altered to
							Wednesday— There was a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Atkins</persRef> came in, with a proposal from a man who had
							invented a new kind of a ship, with three bottoms (which Hughes said
							should be called La Santissima Trinidad.) and was inclined to dispose of
							the Invention to the Government of the United States, if I would
							purchase it for them— He had drawings on paper, shewing the construction
							of the various part of this vessel, and offered to shew me the model of
							it. But having no authority to make the purchase on account of the
							United States, I declined going to see the Model— Smith wrote a Note for
							me to <persRef ref="hamilton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hamilton</persRef> the Under Secretary in the Department of foreign
							Affairs; and I wrote a Note to General Neuffer, to enclose the
							President’s Letter to the Grand Duke of Baden— We got home at half past
							seven— I found a Letter from <persRef ref="bainbridge-john">John
								Bainbridge</persRef> asking to see me; and a card of invitation from
								<persRef ref="vaughan-william">W. Vaughan</persRef>.</p>

							to bed, and lay awake till past six. Then wrote until Breakfast time.
							Last Saturday <persRef ref="smith-john">J. A. Smith</persRef> had
							written a Note for me to <persRef ref="hamilton-william"
								>Hamilton</persRef> of the foreign Department, asking for an order
							from the Treasury to the Custom-House for the delivery to me, free of
							duty, of one Pipe of Madeira, and one Hogshead of Teneriffe wine which I
							have purchased, and which are lying in the Docks— This Morning I
							received a Note from <persRef ref="planta-joseph">Planta</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh’s</persRef>
							private Secretary, answering in the absence of Hamilton, that he has
							made private enquiry at the Treasury, and finds, that although foreign
							Ministers may <hi rend="italic">import</hi>, Articles for their own use,
							duty free, that the exemption is not allowed upon Articles which they
							purchase in this Country. He is apprehensive that this rule, will render
							ineffectual the application to the Treasury requested by me, and
							therefore communicates the Circumstance to me— I went to London with
								<persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="bainbridge-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Bainbridge</persRef> whom I had promised to see at Craven Street
							came at three O’Clock. He said that an export duty of one per Cent had
							continued to be levied upon all Articles exported to the United States,
							notwithstanding the Commercial Convention of 3. July 1815, which was one
							half per Cent more than the duty levied upon Articles exported to
							foreign Ports in Europe. As this had appeared to him contrary to the
							stipulation in the Convention, he had applied to the Board of Trade
							about it, and they had agreed to return the extra 1/2 per Cent, but a
							difficulty had arisen as to the time from which the return should
							commence. They were willing immediately to return, from the time of the
							ratification of the Convention in America. That was the period from
							which by the Law of Congress, the extra duties upon British vessels and
							merchandize had ceased to be levied in the United States. But here there
							had been some extra-duties, which had ceased immediately after the
							Convention was concluded; others had ceased from the 17<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August 1815. The date of the Orders
							in Council: and now <persRef ref="robinson-frederick">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson</persRef> proposes to return
							these from the<space/>of December 1815 the time of the Ratification in
							America. <pb n="124" type="ms"/>The object, Bainbridge said was of
							considerable importance to the merchants of the United States; probably
							upon the whole exportations since the Convention was concluded, not less
							than £500,000. Sterling. I told him that I had given my opinion both to
							the Government here, and to that of the United States that the cessation
							of all the extra-duties on both sides ought to be, from the date of the
							Convention. It was so expressly stipulated, in the Convention itself by
							a clause substituted at the instance of the British Government, instead
							of one proposed by the <persRef ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert"
								>American Plenipotentiaries</persRef> that the Convention should
							take effect from the exchange of the ratifications. The order in Council
							of 17. August 1815 had been issued upon a representation from me,
							founded upon this principle, although it had not been fully acted upon,
							for the order was not made retrospective back to the date of the Treaty.
							The Law of Congress of the last Session, had fixed upon the date of the
							ratification. But since then <persRef ref="bagot-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef> had addressed to the
							American Government a demand that the extra duties levied on British
							vessels and goods in the United States in the interval between the order
							in Council here, and the exchange of the Ratifications at Washington
							should be returned— The <persRef ref="monroe-james">Secretary of
								State</persRef> had answered that this would require the exercise of
							powers for which the Executive was not competent; but that the subject
							would be recommended to the attention of Congress at their Session which
							has now commenced. I had no doubt they would soon act upon it, and hoped
							they would adopt the date of the convention, as the period from which to
							commence the return of extra duties— If they did so, I trusted this
							Government would do the same; and if necessary would make an official
							application to that effect. I asked Bainbridge to send me a written
							minute of the nature of this duty which he promised me he would do.
								<persRef ref="everett-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> A.
								H. Everett</persRef> also called at the Office, to advise with me,
							about the transmission to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg of
							the despatches committed by the Government to his charge— I told him
							that having advised him after perusal of the Papers to proceed, I had
							concluded he would go, and had mentioned in a despatch to the Secretary
							of State the advice that I had given him. He was still very averse to
							going, on account of <persRef ref="everett-lucretia">his wife</persRef>,
							who cannot go with him, and of whom he knows not how to dispose during
							his absence— But he said he would reflect upon it and make up his mind
							to-morrow— He told me that he had returned last Summer to Boston with
							permission from <persRef ref="eustis-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Eustis</persRef> the Minister to whose Legation he is
							the Secretary— That on his arrival at Boston he had given notice of it
							to the Government, who without disapproving it, informed him that his
							Salary would be stopped from the time of his having left the Hague. When
							he was charged with the despatches, he was allowed 1000 dollars for his
							expences and compensation for carrying them, and informed that his
							Salary would recommence from the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							November. He sailed from Boston the 27<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of
							that Month— His wife, to marry whom he had gone home is in a situation
							not well suited to the Journey to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Petersburg— I was a couple of hours alone at the Office, and amused them
							with reading some of <persRef ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi

							home with my wife and children about seven. <persRef

							not authorised to tell.— After the rain held up, I walked to Brentford
							and through the Sion-House Park; continued the Letter to <persRef

							Secretary of the French Embassy; son of the <persRef
								ref="deriquet-victor">Count Caraman</persRef> whom I knew formerly

							thinks they will subdue the Independent party there. The same man who
							came some days ago to offer the invention of the three bottomed ship,
							now came about another invention. A Gentleman has discovered a mode of
							extracting from corn, double the quantity of Saccharine matter that can
							be obtained by the process of malting. He wants to get a Patent for this

							wine free of duties; on the ground that I had not imported it myself,

							Winthrop and <persRef ref="cooke-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>25. VII: </date>Finished the examination of the Bills of <persRef
								ref="cresswell-richard">Cresswell</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="addams-richard">Addams</persRef>. There are six Cases of
							Appeals from <persRef ref="scott-william">Sir William Scott’s</persRef>
							decisions to the Lords Commissioners of Appeal; all cases in which the
							decrees of the judge, condemning the property were confirmed, and all
							cases of mere robbery of the property of American Citizens— The Bills of
							Costs of these Proctors amount to an average of two hundred pounds
							Sterling in each case I am instructed by the <persRef ref="monroe-james"
								>Secretary of State</persRef> to settle these Accounts if I find
							them reasonable, and so far as they were authorized by the then American
							Consul, <persRef ref="lyman-william2">General Lyman</persRef>. The
							authorization of the Consul appears to be sufficiently proved, but the
							reasonableness of the charges depends upon the question whether they are
							customary. I took one of the Bills to London, and left it with <persRef
								ref="smith-john">Smith</persRef>, to shew to some of his
							acquaintance among the lawyers, to ascertain if the charges are such as
							are usually made and allowed— <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef> went with me to town, but I walked almost to the
							Kensington Turnpike. Just as I reached the Office in Craven-Street,
								<persRef ref="page-w">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Page</persRef>
							was going into it. I sent <persRef ref="martin-robert2"
							>Robert</persRef>, with the Note for <persRef ref="hamilton-william">W.
								Hamilton</persRef> at the foreign Office, and with the Packet of
							Books from <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">Josiah Quincy</persRef>, to
								<persRef ref="hobhouse-benjamin">Sir Benjamin Hobhouse</persRef>.
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> had sent some Articles for <persRef
								ref="micklam-james">Micklam</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Page gave me an account of the <pb n="130" type="ms"
							/>proceedings in the Court of King’s Bench upon the case which he is
							managing of the American <persRef ref="cooke-george">George
								Cook</persRef>, against <persRef ref="maxwell-charles"
								>Maxwell</persRef>, as Governor of Sierra Leone— He says he followed
							my advice in the Summer, and presented himself to the Court as ready for
							trial; but the Government retreated. The <persRef ref="u">Attorney
								General</persRef> after some manoeuvering obtained a continuance of
							the Cause to obtain copies of the indictment against Cook, at the Court
							of Sierra Leone. The Government wish to procrastinate, merely to get the
							benefit of the chapter of Accidents; and may perhaps succeed; for Cook
							has been at the point of death with a fever, and is yet not out of
							danger. Page also told me of some new discoveries, much to the discredit
							of <persRef ref="macaulay-zachary">Zachary Macaulay</persRef>, and the
							Directors of the African Institution, which he says is one of the
							greatest bubbles, that ever duped or disgraced this Nation— There were a
							succession of visitors at the Office until five O’Clock when I had
							ordered the Carriage— A <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hobson</persRef> from Liverpool who had brought me a Letter of
							introduction from <persRef ref="maury-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Maury</persRef>— Intends to leave town for Liverpool on
							Monday and offered to take charge of any thing I might have to send. A
								<persRef ref="jennings-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Thomas Jennings</persRef>, son as he told me of a very eminent
								<persRef ref="u">Lawyer</persRef> in the State of Maryland came with
							a complaint, and a long Story, of his having taken passage in an English
							vessel at Antwerp, to come to England; of the Captain’s having sailed
							without him, and brought away all his baggage; of his having left it
							here in London in custody of two Jews named <persRef ref="u"
								>Cohen</persRef>, who refuse to deliver it up, unless he, Jennings
							will pay for his passage. He applied to the <persRef ref="wood-matthew"
								>Lord Mayor</persRef>, for redress; but the Lord Mayor told him the
							case was not within his Jurisdiction. He offered indeed on Jenning’s
							telling him that he was an American Gentleman, to send the City Marshal
							with him to the two Jews; which Jennings declined. Jennings stated
							himself to be in great distress for want of his baggage, and also for
							want of money. I told him it was not in my power to help him. His remedy
							must be in a Court of Law. He said the expences of the suit would cost
							him more than to submit to the imposition and redeem his baggage, by
							paying the Captain’s demand. He went away dissatisfied. <persRef
								ref="boyd-john3">General Boyd</persRef> who came in shortly
							afterwards came in, and told me that Jennings had imposed upon him and
							borrowed money of him under another pretence of having come from the
							United States as Secretary to a <persRef ref="delacroix-irenee">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> La Croix</persRef> whom General Boyd
							said he knew to be himself an impostor. Next came <persRef
								ref="ward-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Ward</persRef>
							of the house of <persRef ref="ward-samuel">Samuel Ward</persRef>, with a
							long story and many papers, concerning <persRef ref="ellis-john">John
								Ellis</persRef>, the young Man who wrote to me for money to get him
							released from Prison. The Ward’s he said while doing business as
							merchants, from which he said they had now both retired, had been in
							some relations of business with <persRef ref="u">Ellis’s
								father</persRef>. Business which Ward assured me had been of no
							profit to them; but on the contrary had occasioned some loss to them. On
							Ellis’s Death however they had remitted to his Executors a balance due
							to him of more than £8000 Sterling, to the great satisfaction of the
							Executors who had entertained no expectation that the balance would have
							been within £1500 so high as it proved. He shewed me a Letter of very
							warm thanks, and acknowledgments from the Executors on the closing of
							the accounts. Last year this young John Ellis, with his elder brother
								<persRef ref="ellis-henry">Henry Ellis</persRef> came to England
							with Letters of Recommendation but not of credit from their <persRef
								ref="u">Mother</persRef> to the Ward’s. These Letters they did not
							deliver, until they had got into difficulty about money. Then Henry
							Ellis applied to them for £50 Sterling which they supplied him on the
							assurance that it was all he wanted, taking his Bill upon his Mother.—
							This Bill was paid; but the Mother at the same wrote to the Ward’s that
							if they furnished him any more Money, not to take his Bills upon her,
							but upon the Executors of the fathers Will, of which she was one, and
							not upon them to the amount of more than one thousand dollars a year,
							which was the allowance to him by the Will until he should come of age—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward shewed me this Letter, and said
							that the provisions of the Will, were the same, for both the brothers—
							But immediately after they had supplied the £50, and before the Mother’s
							answer was received both the brothers were imprisoned for debts, and the
							Ward’s advanced £210 more, to obtain the release of Henry the elder
							brother, and pay half the cost of his passage home, the other half being
							to be paid on his arrival in America— John had also added to his own
							embarrassments, by assisting his brother also with money. Henry arrived
							at New-York early in the autumn; by him John and the Ward’s wrote to the
							Mother and to the Executors, but no answer has been received from
							either; no payment, nor even promise of payment of the Bills for the
							advances made by the Ward’s— John is nearly two years under age, and
							there is no legal means of recovering any money that might be advanced
							for him— I had begun by asking M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward, if
							he and his brother would make themselves responsible for the repayment
							of the money, if I should advance it to obtain the young Man’s release.
							He said no— That if there had been any security for the repayment, they
							themselves would have advanced the money, and there would have been no
							occasion for the application to me. That they had from time to time
							advanced him to the amount of thirty <pb n="131" type="ms"/>Pounds for
							his subsistence in prison. He shewed me duplicates of John’s Letters,
							written in December, to his brother Henry, to his Mother, and to two of
							the Executors of the Will; and he left them with me, with a request that
							I would forward them which I promised. I told him that under these
							circumstances it was impossible for me to advance the money, but I would
							answer the young Man’s Letter— His Letter to his brother is in a tone of
							affecting and mild reproach— He says he had made application to <persRef
								ref="king-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								King</persRef>, at Paris, for assistance, and receiving no answer
							had obtained of some person to ask of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							King whether he had received the Letter. He said he had, but had nothing
							to do about it— <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> John Sergeant</persRef> of Philadelphia, came with a
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whatmore</persRef>.
							He arrived in town last Evening, and brought me Letters of introduction
							from <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail">mother</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-thomas"
								>brother</persRef>, from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe,
								<persRef ref="ewing-samuel">S. Ewing</persRef> &amp; <persRef
								ref="miller-samuel2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S.
								Miller</persRef> formerly of New-York, but now of Princeton College.
							He had also despatches for Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							<persRef ref="gallatin-albert">Gallatin</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="eustis-william">Eustis</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="pinkney-william">Pinkney</persRef> &amp; <persRef
								ref="hughes-christopher">Hughes</persRef>, which he left with me. He
							said that a despatch for me had been taken from him on board ship before
							he arrived at Liverpool— It was the one I received the day before
							yesterday, and came charged with eleven shillings and ten pence Postage.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sergeant is one of the members of
							Congress from the City of Philadelphia, and a Director of the Bank of
							the United States. He comes upon a Mission from that Institution, to
							borrow ten Millions of Dollars in specie, upon a deposit of United
							States Stock— I suppose upon the proposal made from <persRef
								ref="reidirvingandco">Reid, Irving &amp; C<hi rend="superscript"
									>o.</hi></persRef> by <persRef ref="u">Renwick</persRef>. While
							Sergeant was with me, there came in a man named <persRef ref="u"
								>Suter</persRef>, who after waiting in the Office above an hour,
							asked me if I would let him have some money and take a Bill upon
								<persRef ref="sutter-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel
								Suter</persRef> of Philadelphia— I declined. He said he had come
							here to obtain £23:10 of prize-money, due to him for service, in the
							British Navy, into which he had been impressed; and that he was well
							acquainted with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sergeant, who was to have
							come in the same vessel from Philadelphia that he did— He had spoken
							quite familiarly to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sergeant while he had
							been in the office, but Sergeant had not much noticed him— This man had
							been at the office some days ago, and then pretended to be a relation of
							mine; but said nothing of that, this day. I referred him to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sergeant. <persRef ref="everett-alexander"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> A. H. Everett</persRef> came in
							and occupied the rest of the time till five. He enquired if he could go
							with me next Tuesday to attend the opening of the Session of Parliament
							in the House of Lords. I thought he could not; but desired M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith to see <persRef ref="chester-robert"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester</persRef>, between this
							and Tuesday, and enquire. Everett asked also about obtaining admission
							under the gallery of the House of Commons, and Smith engaged to take him
							with him. General Boyd’s visit also had been to ask to be presented to
							the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef> at the Levee— But
							there being so many people at the Office he mentioned his wish only to
							Smith— We reached home about seven O’Clock, and amused the Evening with
							Cards.</p>

						<p><date>26. V:15. </date>I attended with <persRef
								ref="adams-george;adams-john2;adams-charles2">my three

							The Services were performed there by a young man named <persRef ref="u"
								>Geary</persRef>— The auditory did not exceed seventy persons
							including ourselves— The service was precisely, in the same form as that
							of our congregational Churches. A short introductory prayer— A chapter
							in the Bible read. A Hymn Sung. Long prayer. Second Hymn. Sermon. Third
							Hymn, and concluding prayer. The whole Service took about an hour and a
							quarter. The Sermon, half an hour. The text was Isaiah I. V:6–11.6.
							“Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call ye upon him, while he is
							near: 7. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
							thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon
							him; and to our God for he will abundantly pardon. 8. For my thoughts,
							are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. 9.
							For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than
							your ways, and my thoughts, than your thoughts. 10. For as the rain
							cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but
							watereth the Earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give
							seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: 11. So shall my word be, that
							goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it
							shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing
							whereunto I sent it.” The Hymns and Psalms, were a collection, published

								>Jervis</persRef>, <persRef ref="morgan-thomas">Morgan</persRef> and

							Sermon was written in a very good plain Style, and the delivery was

							Carriages was so excessive, and the passage was so much obstructed, that
							the Clock at the Horse-Guards as we passed it was within three minutes
							of two, and it was near half an hour later before we reached the door of
							the Parliament-House— The Prince had nearly finished his Speech, and the
							doors of the House of Lords were closed so that it was impossible to
							obtain admission. My error had been in not ordering my Carriage at one,
							instead of half-past one— We turned round and moved slowly up Parliament
							Street, till the Prince passed by us on his return. As we turned round
							we saw <persRef ref="hampdentrevor-thomas">Viscount Hampden</persRef>,
							in his Robes as a Peer, in his Carriage next behind ours, and in like
							manner belated— The Prince passed us within ten minutes after we
							returned. A mixture of low but very audible hissing; of faint groaning,
							and still fainter attempts to raise a shout among the populace,
							contrasted with the heavy magnificence of the gilded, but tasteless and
							clumsy State Coach, the gorgeous splendor of the golden harnesses, and
							the sky-blue silk ribbons, with which the eight cream coloured royal
							horses were bedizened. The populace manifested no symptoms of riot, but
							a troop of horsemen preceded the Carriage, with drawn swords pressing
							back the crowd, preventing their approach to the Carriage, and urged by
							a leader constantly repeating in a tone of extreme earnestness “keep
							them back! keep them back!” There were among the crowd, great numbers of
							very wretched and ill looking persons— They talked with more or less
							freedom— We heard one man say “he is gone into a strong
							hysteric[”]—another said “throw mud at him”— He has been so long
							accustomed to this sort of treatment from the populace, that he may
							perhaps have grown callous to it; but I did not envy him his feelings—
							We returned to Craven <pb n="133" type="ms"/>Street exactly at three. I

								>t.</hi> James’s Park at the Horse-Guards. He returned to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> James’s Palace, and on his way thither
							after passing by Carlton House, the window at the left hand was broken
							by bullets shot from an air-gun, or stones thrown by the rabble. The
								<persRef ref="graham-james3">Duke of Montrose</persRef>, Master of
							the Horse, and <persRef ref="murray-james2">Lord James Murray</persRef>, a Lord of the Bedchamber were in the
							Carriage with the Prince. Lord James Murray was examined before both
							houses of Parliament, and declared that he had not the least doubt that
							the first fractures were made by two bullets, shot from above, it might
							be from a tree: but no report was heard, no bullets found in the
							carriage; and the opposite window, though up, was not broken, and
							immediately after, a large stone was thrown, which shattered the glass
							to pieces— The two Houses voted a dutiful address to the Prince,
							expressing their horror at this outrage, and requesting him to take
							measures to discover the perpetrator. The debate in the House of Commons
							upon the Address in answer to the Speech, was interrupted by this
							episode, and adjourned to this day.— We came through S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> James’s Park on our return home last
							Evening, about five. The crowd were then entirely dispersed. We stopped
							at Cumberland-House in S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> James’s Palace,
							to enquire how the <persRef ref="frederica-sophia">Duchess of
								Cumberland</persRef> was. She had been delivered the day before of a
							still-born daughter, and was doing well— This Morning I received a
							Letter from <persRef ref="boyd-george">G. Boyd</persRef> dated
							yesterday, enclosing a blank order on a stamp, addressed to the <persRef
								ref="graham-george">Secretary at War</persRef>, for £180 Sterling,
							but not signed. The object of it is to purchase Books for the War
							Department. At the same time my wife received a Letter from him last
							Evening 1/2 past 7. At the Cannon Coffee-House, just ready to start for
							Brighton. I received also a Letter from the <persRef
								ref="baringbrothers">Brothers Baring &amp; C<hi rend="superscript"
									>o.</hi></persRef> enclosing two Orders drawn by me upon them,
							for payments to <persRef ref="maury-james">J. Maury</persRef>, Consul at
							Liverpool on account of Seamen, with triplicate receipts for the money
							which they request me to sign— I suppose they are sent to me by mistake—
							I wrote despatch 69 to the <persRef ref="monroe-james">Secretary of
								State</persRef>, walked to Gunnersbury and Brentford, and after
							dinner, read with difficulty several Chapters of <persRef
								ref="pillet-rene">Pillet</persRef>— The weather has been for
							several days remarkably warm, and the Crocuses under my windows are
							opening. I first observed them the day before yesterday. The birds about
							the house are singing as in April, and the buds of the hedges are ready
							to open.</p>

								ref="lloyd-edward2">Lloyd’s</persRef> Coffee whence he came out and
							spoke to me. The mistake in the order from the Treasury to the
							Commissioners of the Customs and Excise for the delivery of the Madeira
							Wine to me, free of duty was that it was for a Hogshead, instead of a
							Pipe— It made an application for a new Order necessary. I went to the
							Counting-House of the <persRef ref="baringbrothers">Baring’s</persRef>—
							Returned the two orders upon which they had paid money for <persRef
