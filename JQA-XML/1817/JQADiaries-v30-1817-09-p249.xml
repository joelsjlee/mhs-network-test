								<persRef ref="adams-thomas">brother’s</persRef> accounts, what

							Payne and C<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi> to purchase for me any
							Middlesex Canal shares that may be in the market at 250 dollars a share,
							besides the last Assessment of 80 dollars now payable— I executed the

							Hall and went with him to the Athenaeum after stopping to view <persRef
								ref="sargent-henry">H. Sargent’s</persRef> picture of Christ

							my orders. I answered desiring them to close the bargain for the bridge
							shares. Bainbridge’s Letter was to invite me to go on board the
							Independence 74 to-morrow Morning; I answered him that I would be ready
							at ten O’Clock. We dined at <persRef ref="otis-harrison">H. G.

								ref="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef><persRef

							Called at <persRef ref="gray-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W.
								Gray’s</persRef>, and left an Answer for <persRef ref="gray-francis"
								>his Son Francis</persRef>— Neither of them was at home. Stopp’d at
								<persRef ref="foster-james">James H. Foster’s</persRef> shop. I had
							authorised him to sell my Neponset Bridge Shares at 530 dollars a share,
							but now withdrew the authority— I found on examining my brother’s
							accounts that my West-Boston Shares had yielded on the average an income
							of 20 dollars yearly, and that they were worth one third more than what
							they sold for. This was a lesson for my carelessness and precipitation.
							I called at the Athenaeum, but <persRef ref="shaw-william"
								>Shaw</persRef> was not there— I left for <persRef
								ref="bulfinch-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								Bulfinch</persRef> some papers which he had put into my hands, the

							they have received enquiries from the Department of State. Went to
								<persRef ref="welsh-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							and a parcel of pamphlets from <persRef ref="morse-jedidiah">D<hi

								<persRef ref="welsh-abigail">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Welsh</persRef> agreed to take my Sons John and Charles to board and
							lodge, and they are to attend the Town Grammar School— Going from D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Welsh’s into State Street I met <persRef
								ref="dawes-thomas">Judge Dawes</persRef> who invited me to dine with
							him. I called at <persRef ref="payne-william">Payne</persRef> and C<hi
								rend="superscript">o.’s</hi>— The day before yesterday just before
							leaving town I had received a Note from them, saying they believed they
							could dispose of from 50 to 100 shares more of my U.S. Bank Shares at
							$151. a share and they would charge me 1/4 per Cent brokerage. I
							answered their Note, authorising them to make the sale and agreeing to
							pay the brokerage. This Morning the Newspapers quote the same Bank
							Shares both at Philadelphia and New-York at 156. and when I entered
							their office they put into my hand a Letter from themselves, of this
							morning stating that they had disposed of all my remaining Shares, 250
							at $151 a share— I observed to them that their Note of Thursday, and my
							answer to it had reference only to, from 50 to 100 Shares. That I could
							not now wish to dispose of more at that rate, when the price both at
							New-York and Philadelphia was so much higher— I would certainly not
							retract from the authority of my own Note, but should expect the money
							to be deposited in Bank this day or before I leave town for Washington,
							and did not wish to sell any more shares than I had expressly authorised
							them to sell. Payne said that perhaps the Gentleman who had agreed to
							take them would release the bargain for all the shares, excepting those
							of which the transfer was executed. I said I should be much obliged to
							him if he would. Half an hour after they informed me that he had agreed
							to release the whole; and that they had deposited in the Branch Bank the
							Money for the hundred shares sold, deducting the amount paid for the
							five Middlesex Canal Shares— I went to <persRef ref="ward-a">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> A. Ward’s</persRef> Office. He sent
							for the <persRef ref="richardson-asa">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Pritchard, and he paid me the money due on <persRef ref="osgood-peter"
