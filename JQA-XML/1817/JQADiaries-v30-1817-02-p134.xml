						<p><date>1. V: </date>Saturday. Received this Morning a Letter from <persRef
								ref="aspland-robert">R. Aspland</persRef>, in answer to the
							invitation I had sent him for the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of
							last Month. He was absent from home, and did not receive it, till his
							return— I went into London, walked about four miles of the way, till
							overtaken by the Carriage. I called at <persRef ref="thomas-tycho"
								>Thomas’s</persRef> Hotel, Berkeley Square, to see <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sergeant</persRef>. I found <persRef ref="shaw-gabriel">Gabriel
								Shaw</persRef> with him— A proposition was made nearly a year ago,
							by the House of <persRef ref="reidirvingandco">Reid Irving and C<hi
									rend="superscript">o.</hi></persRef> through <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Renwick</persRef> to furnish ten
							Millions of specie Dollars to the Bank of the United States upon a
							deposit of United States six per Cent Stocks at par, and the Dollars to
							be delivered at four shillings and eight pence Sterling apiece. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sergeant who is one of the Directors of
							the Bank, comes here deputed from that Institution to transact the
							business— He said he was waiting for the return of <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander
								Baring</persRef> from Paris; and it was intended if he could agree
							with him that the whole business should be done by that house. I
							mentioned to him various considerations, upon which I thought it would
							be both just and politic to offer that the house of Reid, Irving and
								C<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi> should have a share in it.— First
							because the original proposition came from them; at a time when M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baring not only had no inclination to make
							any such proposition, but entertained opinions unfavourable to the
							establishment of the Bank, and avoided taking any interest in it— And
							very shortly after he had declined undertaking a loan for the Government
							of the United States upon terms far less advantageous to them— Secondly
							because the House of Reid, Irving and Company being in the Ministerial
							interest, and closely connected with the British Government, it would be
							useful to have them engaged by a strong interest to the preservation of
							Harmony, or at least of Peace, between <pb n="135" type="ms"/>the two
							Countries.— He said that the Government of the United States were
							extremely satisfied with the manner in which the house of <persRef
								ref="baringbrothers">Baring</persRef> had transacted their business—
							That there was a very strong feeling in America, in their favour. That
							the Bank had already been censured in the Newspapers, for passing by
							this old and tried friend and agent of the Government, to take up the
							proposals of an obscure and unknown house. That the object of Reid,
							Irving and C<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi> in making the proposal must
							have been to establish a strong American connection; probably to
							transact all the business of the Bank here in future; particularly to
							pay its dividends— That the Baring’s would naturally expect this
							themselves, and might think it hardly fair to them, if these advantages
							were transferred to another house— I said I was fully sensible of the
							merits of the house of Baring towards the United States, and should be
							anxiously desirous to do full and ample justice to them— I should by all
							means wish that they should have the offer of a share in this business—
							I had no personal acquaintance with any one individual of the House of
							Reid, Irving and C<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi> but the house was
							neither obscure, nor unknown. I had been informed upon making enquiries,
							that it was a house in great business and of the first respectability—
							The house of Baring had not been passed by. They had made no proposal—
							They might have made one as well as the other house— And as Reid, Irving
							and C<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi> did make the proposal, and the Bank
							were now acting upon it, I thought something was also due in justice to
							them— He said he would give due consideration to my advice. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander Baring was the only member of
							the house with whom the business could be transacted. He could have the
							business now done upon terms more favourable to the Bank, than the
							original proposal of Reid, Irving and Co. owing to the change of
							circumstances since that time. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baring’s
							return from Paris was not expected for several weeks; but it was now
							said that loan would fall through (which I doubt) and that Baring will
							be back in the course of a week— Sergeant was moving his lodgings from
							Thomas’s to N. 60 Conduit Street where the King’s lodged last Winter, I
							next went to my Office at Craven-Street where I found Letters, left
							there by <persRef ref="hollins-john2">John Smith Hollins</persRef> of
							Baltimore, from <persRef ref="smith-john2">John Spear Smith</persRef>,
							and from <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">C. Hughes</persRef> at Paris.
							With them there was a French Book just published by <persRef
								ref="barbemarbois-francois">Count Barbé Marbois</persRef>, entitled
								“<persRef ref="arnold-benedict">Complot d’Arnold</persRef> et de
								<persRef ref="clinton-henry2">Sir Henry Clinton</persRef>, contre
							Les Etats-Unis d’Amérique, et contre Le <persRef ref="washington-george"
								>Général Washington</persRef>. September 1780[”]—which Hughes sent
							me. And there were copies for <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef>— <persRef ref="joy-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joy</persRef> came and sat with us
							half an hour— I sat him down at the Corner of S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> James’s Street, and Piccadilly, and reached home at seven.
							After dinner I read <persRef ref="cobbett-william">Cobbett’s</persRef>

						<p><date>2. IV:15. </date><persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My
								wife</persRef> was unwell the whole day and kept her bed— <persRef
								ref="adams-george;adams-john2;adams-charles2">The boys</persRef>
							went to Meeting, and I to Church. Prayers were read for Septuagesima
							Sunday, with the addition only of the Collect, for the festival of the
							Purification of the Virgin Mary— This is one of the festivals, retained
							by the Church of England, and celebrated by all the Christian Churches,
							which keep any religious holidays— It is denominated in the Book of
							Common Prayer “The Presentation of Christ in the Temple; commonly
							called, the Purification of Saint Mary the Virgin[”]— Instead of the
							Epistle of the Communion Service the portion of Scripture appointed to
							be read is the first five verses of the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							chapter of the prophet <persRef ref="malachi">Malachi</persRef>— The
							Gospel of the day is Luke II.22–40. where the account of this
							presentation of Christ in the Temple was contained. It was in conformity
							to the Law of <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>, as prescribed in the
								12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of Leviticus, one verse of
							which is quoted in the narrative of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Luke, who refers also to Exodus XIII:2. and XXII:29.— As the Birth day
							of Jesus is kept on the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of December,
							that of his circumcision is of course fixed on the first day of January,
							being the eighth day after; and that of the presentation in the Temple,
							for the same reason is on the second of February, being the fortieth day
							from Christmas. <persRef ref="carr-colston">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Carr</persRef> read however the Epistle, and <persRef
								ref="milman-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Milman</persRef>
							the Gospel, not of the festival, but of the regular Septuagesima Sunday.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Milman preached the Sermon, from
							Romans XII:16. the latter part of the verse. “Be not wise in your own
							conceits.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Milman who is young, and wise
							enough to understand the road to preferment, is a fiery champion for the
							Church of England; but his wisdom has not taught him to make the
							application of his text to himself. His discourse was pointed against
							Unitarians and Methodists, but his only argument was that the Trinity,
							and the mysteries of the Christian Religion must be believed, exactly as
							they are prescribed by the Church of <pb n="136" type="ms"/>England,
							because they are above the comprehension of uneducated persons— To prove
							which he quoted the passage in <persRef ref="milton-john"
								>Milton</persRef> which represents the Devils in Pandemonium,
							debating upon Fate, Freewill &amp; Predestination without being able to
							come to a conclusion— But Milton’s devils, are represented by him as
							possessing intellectual faculties incomparably superior to those of the
							human species; and the Articles of the Church of England were framed by
							mere uninspired men. Now the Church of England have undertaken to draw
							conclusions, about Fate, Free Will and Predestination, which according
							to Milman’s Argument were as much above their comprehension, as above
							that of the most uneducated simpleton. They have been wise in their own
							conceits— He said that the Trinity was three modes of existence which
							from the poverty of language were called persons—and that eternity was
							an idea as incomprehensible as Trinity in Unity.— Upon which he quoted
							the text I am Alpha and Omega &amp;c which no doubt are figurative
							expressions of eternity, but which if literally understood would prove
							that the first and last Letters of the Greek Alphabet, are God— It was
							amusing to hear Milton quoted in support of the Church of England; and a
							poetical fiction to confirm a religious dogma— After Church I wrote to
								<persRef ref="boyd-george">G. Boyd</persRef>, and to <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and <persRef ref="seaton-william"
								>Seaton</persRef>, and read the Introduction to <persRef

						<p><date>3. IV:45. </date>Note to <persRef ref="clitherow-mary">Miss

							necessity of removing to London, in the course of a few weeks; probably
							by the beginning of March, and giving her notice according to our
							agreement, that after this day four weeks, Little Boston-House, where we
							reside, will be at her disposal. Also a Note of excuse to <persRef

							wife, for not attending at her Evening party, last Evening, to which we
							were invited. <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> is
							yet unwell, and confined to her bed chamber.— Wrote despatch 70 to the
								<persRef ref="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef>. The
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2;adams-john2;adams-george"
								>boys</persRef> had petitioned me to treat them with the sight of a
							Play at the close of their Holidays. We therefore took a cold Collation
							at two O’clock, and immediately afterwards went into London— I took with
							me the despatches to be forwarded to-morrow, and a Letter to the
							Proctors <persRef ref="cresswell-richard">Cresswell</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="addams-richard">Addams</persRef> with their Bills,
							which I send back to them to have regularly taxed— I had written to them
							last Saturday morning, that I thought this would be necessary, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Addams called that day at the Office, and
							spoke with me about it— He was somewhat reluctant at suffering the Bills
							to go through this scrutiny, and said he was very sure the taxer of the
							Bills who must of course be the registrar of the Court, would reduce
							none of the charges, unless here and there one where thirteen shillings
							and four pence was charged, and where he might think the charge should
							have been six shillings and eight pence; and the whole reduction would
							not exceed, and perhaps not equal the addition, for the taxing fees. He
							also said it was not usual for Bills like these of the Proctors with
							their own Parties to be taxed; but only the Bills of Costs which are to
							be paid by an adverse party— And that they had sent me the printed
							Statements of the cases, shewing that <persRef ref="lyman-william2"
								>General Lyman</persRef> had defended the Causes in his official
							capacity, and that the Counsel and Advocates had been employed, for
							whose fees there were charges in the Bills— I preferred having the bills
							taxed, and was rather confirmed in that opinion by the unwillingness
							which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Addams, manifested to go through
							the operation— He said however it should be done by one of the deputy
							registrar’s of the Court, and suggested a wish that in sending back the
							Bills, I would write a note stating that it was to make merely the
							voucher regular— It struck <persRef ref="smith-john">Smith</persRef>
							more than it did me, that the object of asking for this Note was to shew
							it to the taxing Officer, as a hint that he might relax from legal
							rigour in taxing the Bill, as the object in taxing the Bill was merely
							to comply with a formality. I took care in writing the Letter this day,
							to shew that it was a real and responsible taxing that I required.—
							Addams admitted that when they had been formerly employed by <persRef
								ref="bayard-samuel">S. Bayard</persRef> for the United States, he
							had always required that the bills should be taxed— But he said General
							Lyman did not. I left my Letter, and the bills with J. A. Smith, to be
							sent to the Proctors to-morrow— I found at the Office in Craven-Street,
							Letters from <persRef ref="maury-james">J. Maury</persRef>, which I
							immediately answered—from <persRef ref="deriquet-georges">Count
								Caraman</persRef>, Secretary to the French Embassy, enclosing two
							Letters, which he has received from the <persRef
								ref="patterson-robert;patterson-marianne">Patterson’s</persRef> at
							Paris, to be forwarded to the United States—and, from James Monroe a
							Letter of introduction to young <persRef ref="astor-william"
								>Astor</persRef>, which he has just left at the Office, but which is
							dated in November 1815.— We went to Drury-Lane, and saw Richard the
							third, with the Pantomime of Harlequin Horner, with a clown issuing from
							the Christmas pye— <persRef ref="kean-edmund">Kean</persRef> performed
								<persRef ref="richardthe3rd">Richard</persRef>— The play is not
							exactly <persRef ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear’s</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="cibber-colley">Colley Cibber</persRef>, brought it out
							improved, and amended, and <persRef ref="kemble-john">John
								Kemble</persRef> has improved upon it again.— More than half the
							original Tragedy, including many of the finest Scenes is discarded— Two
							or three Scenes from the third part of Henry the sixth are transferred
							to this Play, there are modern Additions, not well adapted to
							Shakespear’s Style, and his language itself is often altered; and seldom
							for the better— As it is however, it has constantly been from Cibber’s
							time one of the standing favourites of the Public on <pb n="137"
								type="ms"/>the English Stage, and the character of Richard is one of
							the trying tests of their greatest tragic actors. I never saw it
							performed but once before, and that was at Boston in 1794— It is by many
							of Kean’s admirers considered as his greatest part, but his performance
							this Night, in some degree disappointed me— There is too much of Rant,
							in his violence, and not smoothness enough in his hypocrisy. He has a
							uniform fashion of traversing the stage from one side to the other when
							he has said a good thing, and then looks as if he was walking for a
							wager. At other times he runs off from the Stage with the gait of a
							running footman— In the passages of high passion he loses all distinct
							articulation, and it is impossible to understand what he says— But he
							has much very good subsidiary pantomime, which is perhaps the first
							talent of a first rate actor. He has a most keen and piercing eye, a
							great command and expression of countenance, and some transitions of
							voice of very striking effect— All the other male performers were
							indifferent, and the women below mediocrity— The two children, girls,
							were very good— The Harlequinade has some good Scenery. There was a man
							introduced who performed a concert of six instruments at once— Bells in
							his cap—a range of pipes into which he blew; a guitar in his hands.
							Cymbals and Triangles fastened to his knees, and a drum slung at his
							back, with an elastic, drumstick fastened to his left elbow, bearing
							occasionally upon the drum’s head, as the elbow moved in playing upon
							the Guitar— The house was crowded, and the applause of Kean, incessant,
							during the Tragedy. The fight between Richard and <persRef
								ref="henry-vii">Richmond</persRef>, was skilful and vigorous— Kean
							always contrives to make a clap-trap of his dying scenes. The clapping
							at his death continued five minutes long. The <persRef
								ref="williamfrederick;mary2">Duke and Duchess</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="sophiamatilda">Princess Sophia of Gloucester</persRef>
							were present, and received with great applause. At their entrance God
							Save the King was performed by the Orchestra, and sung by part of the
							players, the Audience all standing. The entertainment finished just at
							Midnight, and it was near two in the morning when we reached home— I
							found an Answer from Miss Clitherow, and a Letter from <persRef
								ref="couling-william">W. Couling</persRef>.</p>

								Fagel</persRef>, said if I did not return this Evening to the
							Country, he should invite me to an Evening party at his house. He gives
							a dinner to the Prince Regent, and the Grand Duke Nicholas, and the
							Evening party afterwards. I asked the <persRef
								ref="desousaholstein-pedro">Portuguese Ambassador Count
								Palmella</persRef>, if the late Newspaper reports that the <persRef
								ref="john-vi">King of Portugal</persRef> intended to return next
							Summer to Lisbon were true— He said he believed there was no foundation
							for them whatever— That the king was to be crowned next April, in
							Brazil. That the <persRef ref="marialeopoldine">Austrian Archduchess
								Leopoldine</persRef> was going there; and that it would not even be
							prudent for the king to return to Europe while the Spanish Provinces all
							around him were in a state of revolt against Spain— The Count spoke to
							me in very respectful terms of <persRef ref="correa-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Correa de Serra</persRef>, now the
							Portuguese Minister in the United States— <persRef ref="jouffroy-georg"
								>Jouffroy the Prussian Chargé d’Affaires</persRef> told me that he
							had lately heard from S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg. That
								<persRef ref="bode-clementine">Clementine Bode</persRef>, was
							married to young <persRef ref="u">Livio</persRef>. Jouffroy has been in
							ill health, and has much fallen away since I left him in Russia. Count
							Caraman, thanked me for the Note which I sent him this morning, and
							which he had received. The <persRef ref="williamfrederick">Duke of
								Gloucester</persRef> asked me, if I had heard from the <persRef
								ref="patterson-robert;patterson-marianne">Patterson’s</persRef> at
							Paris. The <persRef ref="fane-john">Earl of Westmorland</persRef>
							enquired also about them, and told me they had spent considerable time
							with him at Althorp his Country-Seat—that they had made themselves
							universally beloved by every one, who had become acquainted with them.
							That while they were with him, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson
							had gone for a few days into Leicestershire to a fox-hunting party,
							which was quite a new and extraordinary Scene to Patterson— And he gave
							me a ludicrous account of his having supplied Patterson an old, broken
							down hunter to mount, and of Patterson’s inability to manage him. He
							asked whether they intended to return soon from Paris; and how they were
							pleased there— I told him I heard they were to return very soon; but
							they were very well pleased with Paris; as the <persRef
								ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of Wellington</persRef>, who was King
							of Kings there, had taken much notice of them and thus introduced them
							to all the good Company. The Earl then commenced upon Politics, and
							asked me about the harvest in America— I told him that it had been
							indifferent, and that my Letters complained that the great exportations
							of flour from the United States to this Country, were increasing the
							prices there to an alarming degree. He said it was so much the better
							for America. That the first and greatest policy for a Country should be
							to encourage the cultivation of grain so as to raise a sufficiency for
							their own consumption. That he was thoroughly convinced almost the whole
							distress of which the people in this Country were complaining had arisen
							from the importation of Corn, as I expressed some little surprize at
							this opinion; he repeated it; adding that he did not mean to deny that
							there were other Causes, contributing to the effect, particularly the
							sudden transition from War to Peace and the great numbers of People,
							thereby thrown out of employment (not a word about the debt and taxes)
							but the great and effectual cause was the importation of foreign corn,
							which by reducing the price below what the farmer could afford to sell
							for, disabled him from employing workmen, and from applying his capital
							to the improvement of cultivation. I observed to him that the price of
							corn had now risen again sufficiently sure to encourage cultivation and
							the employment of workmen. He replied that it was too late, the mischief
							was done— The farmer had lost his capital, which had been wholly sunk.
							He possessed no longer the means of paying labourers; the rise in the
							prices therefore had increased instead of diminishing the evil— The
							prices now were too high; and the poor were suffering, in both ways; on
							one side by the want of employment, &amp; on the other by the dearness
							of the necessaries of life— The commerce of the Country had suffered
							comparatively speaking nothing. Their commerce of exportation had
							actually suffered very little— Just as he was upon these remarks some
							person came and called him away— I soon after left the Levee -Room and
							retired.— <persRef ref="liston-robert">Sir Robert Liston</persRef> was
							waiting to receive immediately after the Levee, the investiture of
							Grand-Cross of the Order of the Bath, together with Sir <persRef
								ref="drummond-gordon">Gordon Drummond</persRef>. As I passed through
							the first Anti-room I spoke to the <persRef ref="wood-matthew">Lord
								Mayor</persRef>, who had presented an Address from the Common
							Council <pb n="139" type="ms"/>of London, to the Prince Regent, on his
							providential escape, from the bullets, stones and potatoes, discharged
							by the mob at the State Carriage, on his return from the House of Lords,
							after opening the Session of Parliament— On returning to Craven Street,
							I found a Note from the <persRef ref="baringbrothers">House of
								Baring’s</persRef> mentioning that the Articles to be shipped for
								<persRef ref="boyd-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Boyd</persRef>, are to be sent by the Electra, for Philadelphia, to
							sail about the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month.— A
							person from <persRef ref="cresswell-richard">Cresswell</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="addams-richard">Addams</persRef>, Proctors of Doctors Commons, brought me a
							Letter from them, with the Bills, that I had returned to them, now sent
							back taxed by a Deputy Registrar of the Court. He has deducted about
							five Pounds Sterling from each of the Bills; but they have now advanced
							another, and a new demand of £170 Sterling, of which I had never before
							heard— I took it for consideration— <persRef ref="u">Suter</persRef> the
							man who first came with a pretence of relationship, and next for a loan
							of money, offering his bill upon Philadelphia, came again this day, as a
							plain beggar, with a petition drawn-up for him by <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Sergeant</persRef>. I left the Office a quarter before five, and
							walked until overtaken by the Carriage in Hyde-Park— I reached home

								<persRef ref="storer-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							called to ask me to pay an engraver’s Bill of £36:16. for engraving two

								<persRef ref="u">Kent</persRef>, belonging to the Society of
							Friends, a workman in ornamental architecture, came to make enquiries
							whether he could obtain employment in his occupation in America. I told
							him I had no doubt he could. He said his business like all others was
							here so dead, with a prospect that things were only going from bad to
							worse, that he had a strong inclination of removing to America probably
							to Philadelphia, where there are many Quakers, and where the climate
							would suit his Constitution better than more to the Northward— He asked
							me if I had seen a Letter from America, printed in a Newspaper at
							Stamford, saying that whatever might be the distress in this Country, it
							was twenty times greater in the United States. I had seen many such
							paragraphs &amp; Letters published in the Newspapers, but I told him
							they were misrepresentations, published for the purpose of checking the
							emigration to America— A man named <persRef ref="u">Levi</persRef> came
							to enquire if we had received a Commission for two Merchants to
							ascertain the real value of certain merchandize sent by him to New-York,
							and there seized at the Custom-House on the allegation that the value of
							the Articles was underrated in the invoices— The Commission he said he
							supposed would be transmitted through my hands, but I have not received
							it— He complained that the charge upon which the Articles were seized,
							had been brought by merchants who had imported similar articles
							themselves, and that their object was merely to monopolize the market—
							The articles in question were of jewelry— Messer the Coachmaker came to
							tell me of sundry repairs necessary for the Carriage; and <persRef
								ref="joy-george">G. Joy</persRef> called for the sake of
							Conversation— There was a Spa-fields Meeting of the people in distress,
							which had greatly alarmed the Government, but it passed off without any

								>Coachman</persRef> came with a Carriage from Messer and Page’s—
							Antoine had been too late for the Office of the Commissioners of Customs
							and Excise, and returned without accomplishing the business upon which I

							intended for <persRef ref="boyd-george">G. Boyd</persRef>, and <persRef ref="fenwick-joseph">Col<hi

								ref="hobhouse-benjamin">Sir Benjamin Hobhouse</persRef>, requesting
							me to forward to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, some volumes
							published by the Bath agricultural Society—this Note was immediately
							answered. <persRef ref="frend-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frend</persRef> called and brought two tickets for a dinner of the
							religious Tract Society, at the London Tavern next Monday. He said the

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Aspland</persRef> &amp; <persRef
								ref="burdett-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones
								Burdett</persRef> would be there. I declined however accepting for
							myself; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frend left two Tickets with
							Smith. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frend disclosed some of his
							peculiar opinions, which are very decisive against all religious
							establishments, and even against any existence of the clergy as a
							distinct profession. He has an abhorrence of Priests of every
							description, and earnestly recommended that we should never suffer any
							of them to be Presidents or Professors at any of our Universities or
							Colleges. He said that the dissenters were so constantly, and so rapidly
							increasing in numbers in this Country, that in the course of a few years
							they would form a majority of the People— That the establishment would
							then fall, and was indeed already crumbling in to ruin. And when once
							abolished that which <pb n="142" type="ms"/>now forms the revenues of
							the Church will constitute a fund to relieve the Country from a large
							part of the taxes which now bear upon it. All this he said was implied
							in two Greek words introduced into a Note of his pamphlet lately
							published, and he asked me if I had understood them— I called at the
							Engraver <persRef ref="silvester-richard">Silvester’s</persRef> with a
							Seal. We came home, about seven— The new silver coinage was issued this
							day; and is very indifferently executed— After dinner I read the two
							Numbers of <persRef ref="hone-william">Hone’s</persRef> Reformists
							Register; a publication in close imitation of <persRef
								ref="cobbett-william">Cobbett’s</persRef>, and written altogether in
							the same Spirit. John and Charles returned this Evening to School.</p>

							from <persRef ref="freeling-francis">F. Freeling</persRef>. He says My

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Storer shortly after came and

							of North America, from Latitude 23 to 50 North, and as far as the 36<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> degree of West Longitude—and thirty days
							after the ratification, in the Gulph of Mexico and all parts of the

							New-York to the Havanna, taken about twelve minutes North of Latitude
							23, and in sight of the Havanna, after the expiration of the twelve days
							from the Ratification but within the thirty. She was carried into
							Nassau, and was there ordered to be restored, with the Cargo, as having
							been taken after the stipulated cessation of hostilities— The captors
							appealed, and <persRef ref="adams-william">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> William Adams</persRef> is engaged as Counsel for them
							on the appeal. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Babcock said he called

									rend="superscript">r</hi> S. Williams</persRef>; and that his
							advocate <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							attendance for destitute American Seamen during the year 1816. and a
							large bundle of vouchers amounting to more than two thousand pounds
							Sterling. Grubb said that there had been in the course of the year not
							less than 1400 applications of Seamen for relief. More than had been
							made in seven years before the late War. I asked him if they could
							ascertain the causes of this extraordinary increase. He said they were
							various; there had been an unusual number of shipwrecks the last year.
							Besides which many of the vessels fitted out as privateers during the
							late war had been sent to the Havanna, and there sold, to be employed in
							the Slave trade— The American Crews were discharged when the vessels
							were sold, and then found their way to this Country in English vessels—
							I desired Grubb to ask Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> Aspinwall to
							send me a statement of the numbers of applications for relief during the

							Cartels, and how many by merchant vessels: with a statement of the
							relative numbers of white and of persons of colour; and the principal
							causes of their having been brought to this Country, and in the
							condition to need relief. I left George in London; walked to Kensington

							about <persRef ref="croker-john">Croker</persRef> the Secretary of the

							political theatre at this time; they were both vigorously attacked last
							Night, upon points affecting their personal reputation; and both made
							most lame and impotent defences. Croker is one of the Scavengers of the
							Ministry—a Quarterly Reviewer, a Courier Scribbler, and above all an
							inveterate and rancorous enemy to <pb n="144" type="ms"/>America. He is
							Secretary to the Admiralty, and obtained from the Lords an increase of
							his Salary for a whole quarter on the pretext of the two days of
							Algerine War— <persRef ref="wentworthfitzwilliam-charles">Lord
								Milton’s</persRef> motion in the house of Commons last Night was for
							a vote of censure upon the Lords of the Admiralty for having allowed
							this increase— The motion was lost by 169. to 114. votes which is

							minority. <persRef ref="grey-charles">Lord Grey</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="fox-henry">Lord Holland</persRef> and <persRef

							Planta said it was a very large minority; and that there ought never to
							have been any occasion for the Motion— Holland said that it was a bad
							minority; and a worse majority; because it shewed there were many of the
							ministerial members who would not vote on this question. Brougham is a
							violent opposition member, who has gone out of his way this Session to
							attack the Reformers who petition for Annual Parliaments and universal
							suffrage— He said last week, that they might be divided into two
							Classes—the deceivers and the deceived. The reformers have retorted upon
							him, by publishing a speech made by him in 1814. at a London Tavern
							dinner; in which he declares himself in favour of annual Parliaments and
							Representation, co-extensive with taxation— <persRef
								ref="cochrane-thomas">Lord Cochrane</persRef> read last Night in the
							house of Commons an extract from this speech— Brougham’s only defence
							was that he had meant <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> taxation. The whole

							half past four. It was far less numerously attended than either of those
							of the last year— The Dresses of the Ladies were principally of British
							Manufacture; heavy and inelegant. The <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef>, the Dukes of
								<persRef ref="frederickaugustus">York</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="augustusfrederick">Sussex</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="williamfrederick">Gloucester</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="leopold2">Prince Leopold</persRef> were present—the Princesses
								<persRef ref="augustasophia">Augusta</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef>, <persRef ref="mary2">Duchess of
								Gloucester</persRef>, <persRef ref="sophiamatilda">Sophia of
								Gloucester</persRef>, and <persRef ref="charlotte">Charlotte of
								Wales</persRef>. She has grown very thin since her marriage; and had
							the appearance of being out of health and out of humour. The Duke of
							Sussex appeared in a magnificently gold embroidered Court dress and in
							Stockings with gold clocks. The <persRef ref="eustache-rene">Marquis
								d’Osmond</persRef>, French Ambassador told him, as if intending to
							pay him a compliment that that was the fashion at least a century ago.
							The Duke said that when he assumed the Gala-Court Dress, which he hated
							he was however determined to have it complete. His Dress was made here,
							and was a proof that good embroidery could be worked in this Country.
							The Officers of the Household appeared in new Court Uniforms, of
							splendid embroidery said to be from Designs by the Prince Regent
							himself. The principal Conversation at the Drawing Room was about these
							Dresses. The Duke of Sussex told me that he had of late been very busy,
							and that these were busy times. <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert;stewart-amelia">Lord and Lady
								Castlereagh</persRef> were not there, being in deep mourning for the
							death of <persRef ref="hobart-caroline">her Mother</persRef>. After the

							to drive up to the door— I returned to Craven Street and read the
							despatches from W. Shaler, and <pb n="145" type="ms"/>Commodore
							Chauncey; containing the account of their Negotiation with Algiers; and
							the reconclusion of the Treaty of Peace, of June 1815 with such a
							Modification of the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article, as leaves
							it compatible with the prior Treaties of Algiers with other powers. At
							seven O’Clock I went to Lord Castlereagh’s where we had a merely
							Diplomatic Dinner— All the foreign Ambassadors, Ministers, Chargés
							d’Affaires and Secretaries of Embassy were there; and also <persRef

							Lord Clancarty, who is the Ambassador to the <persRef ref="william-i"
								>King of the Netherlands</persRef>, but now here on a short leave of
							absence— <persRef ref="vonrehausen-gotthard">Baron Rehausen</persRef>
							the Swedish Minister told me he was going to Sweden upon a leave of
							absence in May; and doubted whether he should ever return— That <persRef ref="kantzow-johan">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Kantzow</persRef> the Swedish Minister in the United
							States, was also going to Sweden on a leave of absence. That Kantzow had
							written to him that I was to return to America next Spring— He asked me,
							if I had news of the Ratification of <persRef ref="russell-jonathan"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell’s</persRef> Treaty— I
							had not. He said Kantzow wrote him that some Indian Treaties had been
							ratified, but the Swedish one had not been acted upon— At table I sat
							between the Marquis d’Osmond and <persRef ref="poletica-pierre"
								>Poletica</persRef>; who again told me that he did not believe
								<persRef ref="dashkov-andrei">Daschkoff</persRef> had been
							recalled.— that <persRef ref="kosloff-nicholas">Kosloff</persRef>
							certainly had been. That <persRef ref="harris-levett">Harris</persRef>
							had un peu envenimé that affair, by a Note which he had presented to the
							Russian Government; and which <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl"
								>Nesselrode</persRef> had told him he had better not present. He
							also said he understood I should return home in the Spring. The Marquis
							d’Osmond spoke to me about <persRef ref="barbemarbois-francois">Count
								Barbe Marbois</persRef>, who he said was a very honest Man, un peu
							sec; and about <persRef ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript"

								>Chevalier d’Araujo</persRef>, who he told me was now Minister of
							the Marine and acting Minister of Foreign Affairs; and whom <persRef
								ref="john-vi">the king</persRef> had made Count Da Barca— The dinner
							was short. At ten O’Clock I went again to Craven Street: changed dress,
							and went with Smith to the <persRef ref="esterhazy-paul">Austrian
								Ambassador Prince Esterhazy’s</persRef> Ball— The Grand Duke
							Nicholas, the Dukes of York and Gloucester were there, and about five
							hundred other persons— The crowd and heat were excessive. <persRef
								ref="bourke-edmund">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourke</persRef>,
							the Danish Minister, introduced me to <persRef ref="bury-charles">Lord
								Charlevill</persRef>— There was some dancing of Quadrilles and

							Street and got home at half past two in the Morning.</p>

								Ewart</persRef> who was M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Porter’s
							brother. It is dated Turin 26. October 1782. Ewart was then at Berlin
							private Secretary as appears from the Letter, to <persRef
								ref="stepney-john">Sir John Stepney</persRef> then British Minister
							at the Court of Prussia— He had written to Liston, who was Secretary to
							the British Legation at Turin, for advice, and instructions, for his
							conduct; Liston having previously been Secretary of Legation at Berlin,
							while <persRef ref="elliot-hugh">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hugh
								Elliot</persRef> was the Minister. The Letter is full of the most
							excellent advice, given in an easy, familiar style, and with a
							sportiveness of manner to disguise the gravity of instruction, and it
							contains notices of many persons at the Court of Berlin whom I
							afterwards knew there; with observations, not unimportant to the History
							of the Time, upon the state of the political Relations between
							Great-Britain and Prussia. He says they were upon a very bad footing,
							and that it was altogether the fault of the British Ministry— There are
							several good remarks upon the British diplomatic characters of that day,
							and upon the manner of doing business in the foreign Department. The
							advice to Ewart is all prudential and wise; though by no means profound.
							It is a summary of the Art de parvenir, and appears to have been
							successfully practised, both by the writer of the Letter, and by his
							Correspondent. Ewart afterwards became Chargé d’Affaires, and then
							Minister Plenipotentiary at Berlin; where M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Porter says he resided, twelve years. He married there, a
								<persRef ref="u">Countess Wartensleben</persRef>, and has now been
							some years dead— Liston began life as private tutor to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> H. Elliot, on his travels—then became his
							private Secretary, when Elliot, barely after coming of age was <pb
								n="147" type="ms"/>appointed British Minister at Munich, to the
							Elector of Bavaria— When Elliot was transferred to Berlin, Liston went
							with him, and soon after became his Secretary of Legation. Since then he
							has constantly been in the Diplomatic Career. Was sometime Minister in
							the United States, and is now Ambassador at Constantinople, whither at
							the age of 76 he is to return, next May— His Letter to Ewart gave me
							occasion for reflection. He blames the British Ministry for the bad
							footing upon which they were with Prussia. It is well known that one of
							the causes of that misunderstanding was the outrage by which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Elliot became possessed of <persRef
								ref="lee-arthur">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Arthur
								Lee’s</persRef> papers— Elliot himself told me that it had not been
							done by his orders. That the Papers were brought to him, and he read
							them; but had no agency in obtaining them. <persRef ref="u"
								>Richards</persRef> the Swiss, who had been a sort of appendage to
							the British Missions at Berlin for many years, told me that Liston was
							the man who had contrived to get the papers; and if so, he was one great
							cause of the disgust that <persRef ref="frederick-ii">Frederic</persRef>
							had taken against the British; all which though not absolutely
							incompatible with the contents of this Letter, does not exactly tally
							with them.</p>
