							A Roman Catholic Clergyman, a Jesuit, named <persRef

							and another came and left a Letter and a small parcel to be forwarded to

								<persRef ref="brzozowksi-tadeusz">Brzozowski</persRef> was at
							Polotzk—not permitted either to return to S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Petersburg or to go out of Russia— But he hoped soon to
							obtain leave to go to Italy. Having less interruption this day than
							usual I employed much of the morning in reading despatches from <persRef

							and after dinner I took a walk to look at it. In the Evening I began to
							draw up the Instructions for <persRef key="rush-richard">R.

							Instructions to Ministers going abroad— First idea; reference to the

							did when he was sent to England by <persRef ref="henry-iv">Henry the

							wished for Instructions, which he promised. The Accounts of Salaries for
							the Department, for the quarter just expired were made up, and approved
							by me. Rush refuses to receive the Salary of Secretary of State, from

								ref="harris-john">nephew</persRef> in bringing my despatches
							containing the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander’s</persRef>
							offer of Mediation. I told Harris there had never been any idea that

							charged. His nephew was shipwrecked on the Coast of Finland; then was
							obliged to go to Gothenburg by Land, and to England in the Packet.
							Thence to Bermuda likewise in a Packet, and thence at equal expence to
							this Country. He had therefore made the charge, but would leave it
							entirely to my determination. His account was approved with the
							exception of that charge which is <pb type="ms" n="261"/>left for the
							President’s determination— I wrote to the President, and to <persRef
								ref="holmes-david">David Holmes</persRef>, Governor of the State of
							Mississippi, in answer to a letter from him enclosing the Constitution
							of the State. Soon after I came from the Office, a Frenchman came to me
							in great distress. Said he belonged to the Island of Martinique, where
							he has a wife and three children. He was going there from Carthagena as
							supercargo of a vessel under danish colours—was taken by an insurgent
							privateer from Margenta, stripp’d of every thing, even his clothes and
							landed in utter destitution at Norfolk. The french Consul there could
							not relieve him because he was not in the king’s service. He travelled
							here to ask Justice and assistance from the President or the <persRef
								key="hyde-de-neuville-jean">french Minister</persRef>, neither of
							whom being here he had been referred to me. I advised him to proceed and
							reach Philadelphia, where the French Consul might find him the means of
							returning to his home— It was past five O’Clock, when my <persRef

							and at Galveztown. This day <persRef ref="graham-george">M<hi

							assisting any longer at the Meetings. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rush observed that he was under a similar embarrassment, considering his
							Office of Attorney General as vacated by his new Appointment of Minister
							to Great-Britain. The President said he had offered the Office of
							Secretary of War to <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> of South Carolina, and was daily
							expecting his answer— <persRef ref="crowninshield-benjamin">M<hi

							morning to <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef> of Richmond Virginia, offering him the Office of
							Attorney General, but it was very doubtful whether he would accept it.
							The President said that he should have been very desirous of having a
							Western Gentleman in the Cabinet; but he could not see his way clear— He
							had taken great pains to inform himself, but he could not learn that
							there was any one lawyer in the Western Country, suitably qualified for
							the Office. He had particularly enquired of <persRef ref="todd-thomas"
								>Judge Todd</persRef>, who had assured him there was no such
							suitably qualified person— This he said was perfectly confidential—
							Graham said that he had enquired this Morning of <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>; who
							had told him, also confidentially, the same thing—that there was no
							lawyer in that Country, fit for the Office of Attorney General— The
							questions were again discussed, and as it appeared to me that all the
							gentlemen were backward in giving their opinions, upon almost every one
							of them I finally gave mine explicitly that the marauding parties at
							Amelia-Island and Galveztown ought to be broken up immediately. This was
							at once determined upon, and it was considered as a decisive Reason, for
							despatching the Commissioners, and the frigate Congress to Buenos Ayres.
							I also suggested the expediency of waiting for the next despatch from
								<persRef ref="erving-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Erving</persRef>, before assuming any new attitude with Spain,
							which, was agreed to; and I also explicitly avowed my opinion that it is

						<p><date>31. V:</date> I had promised to call with <persRef
								ref="pleasonton-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pleasonton</persRef> at the Comptroller, <persRef
								ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Anderson’s</persRef> at half past ten O’Clock, but it was near
							twelve when I got to Pleasonton’s, and I found with him a <persRef
								ref="taylor-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor</persRef>
							who has been agent of the United States to <persRef
								ref="petion-alexandre">Petion’s</persRef> Government in S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Domingo, and who wants to go there again
							or to have some equivalent appointment. He struck his flag and came away
							on account of the seizure and confiscation of <persRef ref="strong-john"
								>Strong’s</persRef> Schooner Mary and her Cargo. Strong made a long
							Statement of the case to which he made Oath before <persRef
								ref="brent-robert">Robert Brent</persRef>, for the justification of
							his character. He brought it to me, and has been very importunate for a
							declaration from me that I am convinced of his integrity. I detected
							this Morning a gross misrepresentation in this statement, and on telling
							Strong of it, he made a lame and ineffectual attempt to explain it. I
							called at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Andersons with Pleasonton and
							gave him some explanation of my Accounts. But I must give it to him in
							writing— Taylor and Strong kept me at the Office till past four. There
							was a storm of Rain with little intermission the whole day— I was
							engaged all the Evening in reading over the letters and papers received
							by the mail— I had appointed this day twelve o’clock to see <persRef
								ref="aguirre-manuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Aguirra</persRef>, but forgot the appointment. He left a note for me
							saying that he was going to Baltimore, and would call upon me on his
							return. He is going on account of a British vessel which has come to him
							from Buenos Ayres laden with hydes, and which has been seized at
							Baltimore, according to the Navigation act, passed at the lest Session
							of Congress.</p>

						<!-- This is a summary entry without a date.-->
						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> Since the twelfth of this Month we have been settled in
							the house of <persRef ref="brent-daniel">Daniel Brent</persRef>, at the
							Corner of North C Street, and four and a half Street. I rise usually
							from five to six, having already much relaxed from the industry with
							which I began. I write Letters, or my Journal, or at the Draft of a
							Report upon Weights and measures until ten—Breakfast and go to my Office
							at eleven or twelve— I find there visitors or papers to sign or Letters
							to frank which employ me till two, when the Mail brings Letters, packets
							and Newspapers which absorb one or two hours. Then I go to take the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">Presidents</persRef> Instructions upon
							them. I seldom get home to dinner till past five— After dinner, I read
							or write from seven till nine or ten in the Evening, when I retire to
							bed— I always walk to and from my Office— The distance is a few yards
							more than a mile and a quarter—a 22 minutes walk.</p>
