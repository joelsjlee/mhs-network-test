						<p><date>1. V:30. </date>Friday. The breeze continued through the Night, and
							with some diminution all this day. Before Midnight last Evening the
							Captain perceived by a peculiar smell which was also perceptible to the
							passengers who went upon the deck that the ship had come upon soundings.
							I found upon going on deck this Morning a striking change in the feeling
							of the Atmosphere, and in the temperature of the Water since yesterday
							Morning. Air 58. Water 59. undoubted proof that we are no longer in the
							meshes of the gulph stream. The colour of the Water had also changed
							from a deep and limpid blue to a yellowish and turbid green. Latitude at
							Noon 41:51. Reckoning Longitude 72:25. but as that would put us high and
							dry upon the land, we are compelled to take a step backwards, and the
								<persRef ref="forman-jacob">Captain</persRef> now estimates the real
							Longitude at 68. But as he was unwilling to lose the benefit of the
							breeze by laying to, he postponed sounding until the Night. The weather
							was cool and pleasant, with so little motion of the ship, that I
							employed all the morning in writing and reading— By which means however
							I missed seeing a Shark, several dog-fish, a turtle and a sword fish,
							all of which were seen by the passengers upon deck— I was busied, making
							out an account of Books, purchased for the War Department, and reading
							de Augmentis Scientiarum. The Cabin loo-table was at work, morning,
							afternoon and Evening. After dinner I played three games of Chess,
							successfully with <persRef ref="otis-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Otis</persRef>. I give him a Castle and beat him, when I
							can command my attention, but that is not always in my power. The
							Evening till ten I passed upon deck Star-gazing. The sky was perfectly
							clear, and I recognized all the principal Constellations that were above
							the horizon. The whole Scorpion was in full sight, with Jupiter who has
							been our steady companion upon the larboard Quarter, the voyage through.
							There was one Star which rose between eight and nine in Aquarius, and
							which after some doubt I ascertained to be the planet Saturn.</p>

							were the Pleiades, Aldebaran, and the Bulls horns.— <persRef

							and a half in an hour. After noon it freshened to a four and five knot

							ones; all the lights were still burning. The morning was fine, and
							almost all the passengers soon came upon deck. The Sun rose clear, and

							light breeze, which took us up to the wharf at New-York, where we landed
							at one in the afternoon immediately from the Ship. Several persons from
							the Custom-House came on board just before we reached the City; but they
							had been preceded by persons from the Newspaper Printing-Offices, who
							came for news. I gave <persRef ref="u">Lang</persRef> the Copy of the
							British Treasury Order which I had received from the <persRef
								ref="ward-john4">Collector at Cowes</persRef>. The approach to
							New-York, was slow, and the termination of the Voyage as agreeable as
							could be wished— The Sentiments with which after an absence of eight
							full and eventful years I touched once more, my native Land were of a
							mingled nature— Of the deepest gratitude to the Supreme disposer, for
							all the enjoyments and preservations of that long period, and
							particularly for the safe and happy close of the voyage just completed;
							together with an anxious forecast of the cares and perils of the new
							Scene upon which I am about to enter. The latter of these feelings was
							greater and more oppressive than it had ever been on returning to my
							Country heretofore. So keen indeed was the emotion of contemplating the

							Russell are to sail to-morrow for Amsterdam, and E. Wyer is to go in the

							other and are by no means reconciled. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Russell returns to his Mission at Stockholm, to make some arrangement
							with regard to the Treaty which he negotiated there. It was ratified by
							the Senate with the exception of three Articles, which Russell shewed
							me. He says the objection to them was taken by <persRef ref="king-rufus"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King</persRef> in Senate from
							personal motives of animosity against him; because he had officially
							reported some observations made by <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert"
								>Lord Castlereagh</persRef> to him, in which he said M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> King had been mistaken, in supposing that
							the British Government had ever intended to give up the practice of
							impressing Seamen from American vessels.— He has not received his
							instructions, and knows not precisely what to say, to justify the
							exclusion of the excepted Articles. He thinks <persRef
								ref="charles-xivjohn">Bernadotte</persRef> will be irritable about
							it; and he has concluded to go back to Stockholm which he detested, to
							shew that he has not lost the confidence of the American Government.—
							But he said he had told <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>, that if he was to
							continue in the Public Service at all he thought himself entitled to a
							better Mission than that of Sweden. He suggested that he should like
							that of Russia. He also shewed me his Letter of credit upon the <persRef
								ref="willinkfirm">Willink’s</persRef> at Amsterdam and thought it
							objectionable because it was limited; but I informed him it was the
							usual practice. He had written to ask leave to go and wait for his
							Instructions at Paris. He shewed me M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rush’s answer; which was that he would write him again on the subject
							shortly.— Having engaged his passage and being bound to sail to-morrow,
							he cannot wait for this promised Letter, and asked me, if I saw any
							objection to his going to Paris— Under all the circumstances, I had none
							to make.— He begged of me to acknowledge the receipt of his Letters,
							which I promised to endeavour to do. He is disgusted with Wyer’s
							appointment, and vexed that he is going out in the same Ship with him—
							Wyer himself made me excuses and apologies, and professions of
							repentance for his Letters from Gothenburg. I told him I had long since
							given over all resentment for every thing personally offensive to myself
							in them; but recommended to him to provide for the payment of his debts
							in England. He promised he would, and said he had made money in Russia,
							and should have made his fortune there; but for the villainy of <persRef
								ref="venning-john">Venning</persRef> with whom he had been in
							partnership.— I see no essential change in his character.</p>

							at public dinners for a person in the Station that I am to assume. Hall
							was fully satisfied with the reasons I gave, and promised to take care

								ref="bancroft-aaron">Son of the Clergyman</persRef> at Worcester was
