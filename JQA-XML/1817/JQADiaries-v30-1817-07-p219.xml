						<p><date>1. VI: </date>Tuesday. At Sea. Latitude 43:16 Longitude 25:05.
							There were a number of heavy Squalls throughout the Night, and the swell
							was so great and the motion of the ship so convulsive, that I scarcely
							slept at-all, and not till after day-light. The cabin Passengers were at
							vingt-un till one. This Morning the sky was fair, but the wind at W.N.W.
							where it continued all day, moderate, and with fair weather, excepting a
							sudden squall of rain which passed over us while we were at dinner.
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> was so much
							recovered as to go upon deck for a couple of hours, but so weak that she
							fainted on returning to her State-Room. <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> was up the whole day, and none of the passengers
							Sea-sick. <persRef ref="coit-elias">Coit</persRef> told me they had split the
							fore top-gallant sail, and the gib to pieces yesterday, in carrying sail
							upon her to make her go ten knots; but he said the Sails were now
							repaired— I was able to write this Morning after Breakfast, but not so
							much as I ought. Played Chess after dinner with <persRef
								ref="otis-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis</persRef>— The
							evening was moderate and fine; with the breaming or flashing of the
							water along-side of the ship, which portends Northerly winds. Air 61.

						<p><date>2. V:45. </date>The Night was tolerably tranquil, and the motion of

							Morning was mild and beautiful. The temperature of the Water and Air
							both 60. Before Noon it clouded up, and blew hard from N.W. with Squalls
							of Rain. The strong breeze continued the greater part of the day, but
							moderated as the Sun went down. The Evening was again moderate and
							pleasant, with breaming waters and a spangled sky, and frequent falling
							of atmospheric meteors. I regretted the want of <persRef
								ref="bode-johann">Bode’s</persRef> Uranographia to trace many of the
							minor Constellations. Jupiter has drawn into close conjunction with the
							first star of the Scorpion. They are all apparently higher above the
							horizon than when I observed them the first Night we came on board, by
							just as much as we have made of Southing; that is eight or nine degrees—
							And this Evening I saw most of the remarkable Stars in the tail of the
							Scorpion, which I had certainly not seen while I was in Europe, and had
							never before observed. They were still too low towards the horizon, and
							too much bedimmed by the haze of the atmosphere to be all distinctly
							seen— There was this day no Solar Observation The Longitude, reckoned by
							the Captain about 26. <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My
								wife</persRef> was twice upon deck; once being obliged by the rain
							to return to the Cabin— She is yet extremely weak, and this afternoon
							and Evening was quite indisposed— We have frequent discussions at table
							after breakfast and dinner, upon various topics of Literature, Politics,
							Morals, Religion, and miscellaneous as they arise. In these
							Conversations, I am sometimes led perhaps to take too great a share.

							The breeze was mild and pleasant; Water and Air both at 62: the motion

							little of it: none of the Passengers were sick; but the fractiousness of
							temper which a long continuance of adverse winds is apt to provoke upon
							a Sea-voyage begins to manifest itself; and I feel too much of it

								>John</persRef> 14. In the Night there sprung up a stiff breeze: the
							top gallant-sails were taken in: we have had so much boisterous weather
							that the topsails are kept constantly reefed.— This Morning the sky was
							cloudless, but with a wind due West, blowing a Gale, and that haziness
							in the atmosphere, which generally accompany the strong west and
							Southwest winds.— The Air was at 64. Water at 62. A heavy head-sea, and
							the ship pitching so much that I wrote with great difficulty till

							of <persRef ref="sinbad">Sinbad</persRef> in <persRef
								ref="scott-jonathan">Scott’s</persRef> Translation of the Arabian
							Nights. No book that I read with great delight in my childhood has so

							afforded me some of the happiest hours of my life. I now find them
							inexpressibly dull— Much of the Story of Sinbad is evidently stolen from
							the Odyssey, and it surprizes me that writers to whom <persRef
								ref="homer">Homer</persRef> was accessible and familiar, could not
							fill the seven voyages of Sinbad with a more variety of adventure, more
							diversity and individuality of characters, and more spirited Sentiment.
							Take away from Sinbad’s adventures the marvellous and impossible; and
							there is nothing left. What a difference, from the Odyssey!— We had our
							ship’s colours flying all day; and notwithstanding the Storm of wind,
							rain and thunder which came on about dinner time, we celebrated the day
							with such festivities, as our condition would admit. We kept at table
							from our dinner hour between 2 and 3 until dark—drank toasts and sung
							songs; and made passing merry— After a copious rain, the weather
							moderated; and the wind drew two or three points to the Northward.— The
							Head-Sea partly abated, &amp; left us the prospect of a less unquiet
							Night than the last. Lat: 41:56. Long: 29:10.</p>

						<p><date>5. VI: </date>The wind died away in the Night nearly to a calm,
							which continued all this day; and although we made scarcely any progress
							with it upon our Voyage, yet after the wearying and boisterous winds we
							have been buffeting it was a real relief. <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> was yet so weak and
							exhausted that she could not go upon deck till towards Evening.— There
							was a very large scull of Porpoises, wallowing unwieldy round the ship
							about Noon; and innumerable multitudes of what the Seamen call
							Portuguese Man of War, floating along-side the whole day and Evening.
							One of them was hooked up by <persRef ref="shiels-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Shield</persRef>. There appeared to be
							a small cockle shell at the centre with a long sack of a white thin
							jellyish substance issuing from the hole of the shell, and a very minute
							animalcule, of the size, and nearly the form of a flea, alive, but
							implicated in the slime of the jelly, and unable to extricate itself
							from it. I thought it a sort of marine spider, that the white jelly is a
							web or net which the animal within the shell spins from its own
							substance, and puts forth for the double purpose of enabling it to
							float, near or upon the surface of the water, and of catching its prey.
							We also saw a tropic bird, &amp; one of those they call mother Cary’s
							chickens. These, as well as porpoises, are always considered as
							prognostications of foul weather, but there is upon the Ocean so great a
							proportion of foul weather, that every natural object that presents
							itself may justly be considered as announcing it— Fishes, Birds, Clouds,
							vapours, and nothing more certainly than fair weather itself.— I wrote
							the greater part of the Morning, yet not so industriously as I ought to
							have done. Spent most of the afternoon at Chess with <persRef

								Davis</persRef>, one of the Steerage Passengers, a Musician, and

							violin.— Lat 41:43. Long: 30:36. Air and Water 63. It was rumoured that
							a vessel was seen from the Mast-head this morning; but nothing further
							of her appeared. We have seen no other vessel since this Month came

						<p><date>6. IV:30. </date>Just before midnight last Evening there sprung up
							a light breeze at North-East which continued all Night and all the
							former part of this day; it was part of the time fresh enough to carry
							the ship six knots an hour, but was without steadiness or consistency of
							any kind. It was shifting from point to point all the morning and soon
							after died away to a calm— The Ship was as quiet as she ever can be upon
							the Ocean, and there was no Sea-sickness on board; I wrote part of the
							morning, and read some pages of <persRef ref="bacon-francis"
								>Bacon</persRef>; of <persRef ref="stewart-dugald"
								>Stewart’s</persRef> Philosophy of the Human Mind, and of <persRef
								ref="hewlett-john">Hewlett’s</persRef> Commentary on the Bible. But
							of all occupations on board ship, I find reading the most irksome. In
							the course of the day we saw two ships, one of which stood for us until
							she came within about four miles distance of us; and fired a gun of
							which we saw the smoke, but did not hear the report, to bring us too.
							She had a pendant flying at her Main-mast head, and appeared to be a
							Sloop of War, but shewed no flag. Our Colours were hoisted, and some
							Sails taken in, to lay to; when she immediately stood upon the other
							tack and went off. The other ship was standing to the Southward across
							our course. She was not within five Miles of us at the nearest.
							Multitudes of porpoises were seen; and <persRef ref="coit-elias">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Coit</persRef> was alert as usual with
							his harpoon, but without success. Several of the Portuguese Men of War
							were hooked up— They were in a great variety of forms, many of them
							curious to the eye and variegated with colours, purple, green and
							yellow— The lobster formed live insect implicated in the white jelly is
							common to them all, and when disengaged from it swims in the water with
							extreme rapidity. But what I took yesterday for a cockle shell at the
							centre is a soft and apparently excrementitious substance, not more
							consistent than the jelly that surrounds it. Some of them are in shape
							resembling the tapeworm, beautifully spotted, and coil themselves round
							in the water like a sleeping snake— I now think that the insect instead
							of being their prey, preys upon them. There are sometimes several of the
							insects in one of the jellies; they are <pb n="221" type="ms"/>of
							various sizes, but all of the same form and species— <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> spent all the latter
							part of the day upon deck. Our Latitude was 41:20. Long: 31:40. Air 60.

						<p><date>7. V:30. </date>A strong breeze at W.S.W. sprung up at about 3.
							O’Clock this morning; so fresh that the top-gallant sails were taken in,
							and the topsails reefed. When I rose it was blowing hard, but the Sun
							was shining, and forming continual beautiful rainbows upon the spray
							that dashed up from the waves— The ship laboured excessively; I was just
							able to write before breakfast the journal of yesterday, but from that
							time could write no more. After breakfast, most of the passengers turned
							into their births; after a fruitless attempt to read Bacon, I betook
							myself to my bed for a couple of hours; the wind increased to a heavy
							gale, until Noon, and then dissolved itself in a copious shower of rain.
							It fell suddenly calm; and in a few minutes a new breeze started at
							N.N.W. which continued fresh but moderate, the remainder of the day— The
							Southerly wind had left us however the legacy of a head-sea, which kept
							the ship tossing and pitching almost as much as she did during the gale.
							We shipped water in at the Cabin windows, and were obliged to put in the

							3 degrees in the temperature of the water since yesterday, and by the

							for the Ladies on board our ship a few Oranges and limes; and Shiel and
							Cutting bought of the Sailors some Cocoa Nuts, Shadduck’s and
							Pine-Apples. She has been twenty-seven days out, and has had strong
							westerly breezes. Last Night while our wind was fresh at N.E. she was
							running with close-reefed top sails and a gale at N.W. which explains
							the heavy head sea with which we were buffeted. By her <pb n="223"
								type="ms"/>Captain’s reckoning, the Longitude where we met was
							42:16. Our Captain makes it 42:10. We had not lost sight of this vessel
							before we spied another, which we met and spoke with just before sunset.
							This was an American, the Susanna of (name of place in blank) <persRef

							The Evening was as fine as the day. The Sun sat in a perfectly clear

							65. Water 67— The loss of sleep last Night, and the time absorbed during
							the day in our intercourse with the other vessels, abridged my writing
							so that the day, was to that purpose nearly lost. I played chess after
							dinner with <persRef ref="otis-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>13. VII:15. </date>The Night was fine, and the ship unusually

							read upon deck, in <persRef ref="hewlett-john">Hewlett’s</persRef>

								Fearon</persRef> who is himself a believer; but who seems inclined
							to explain from natural causes and the ordinary course of Nature

							other. A Miracle is a preternatural exertion of divine power, beyond the
							comprehension of human reason; and when once the mind has admitted its
							existence, and acknowledged its own incompetency to judge of it, there
							is both presumption and inconsistency, in its undertaking again to make
							its own powers the standard of those of the Deity, and saying thus far
							shall my acknowledgment of miraculous power go, and no farther. I had
							also a subsequent conversation with <persRef ref="shiels-william">M<hi

							sculpture— <persRef ref="sanzio-raffaello">Raphael</persRef> and

							at N.W. &amp; by W. from Noon to Noon; he had made only four miles of
							Northing. He concludes there must be a strong current here, bearing us
							to the Southward. We have had quantities of gulph-weed passing by us for
							several days, and have picked up several bunches of it, in which were
							small crabs variously coloured and nearly of the same size.— About an

							several of the Passengers saw from the Tops an Island of Ice which was

							brought back some ginger; but they had no other fruit and could supply

							Lord Wellington, <persRef ref="u">Captain Roberts</persRef>, 28 days
							from Jamaica, (Kingston) bound to London. Her reckoning of Longitude was
							48. They had seen no Ice. Sounded on Sunday for the Bank but found no

							Longitude 50:17 but <persRef ref="lamb-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lamb’s</persRef> Chronometer made it just three hours
							and eleven minutes, which with five minutes for the equation of time,

							Sun sat clear, and the moon about an hour after— No person on board the
							ship had ever seen the Moon before, on the first day after that of her
							change— It was about forty hours— I wrote little besides the Letter to
							J. A. Smith— Read the Tales of My Landlord— Played Chess with <persRef

						<p><date>17. VI: </date>On going upon deck this Morning after a very quiet
							Night, I found the vessel under the foresail only, with all the other
							sails furled, or aback upon the Mast. There was a moderate breeze
							blowing at S.W. but a black threatening Cloud at N.W. with thunder and
							lightening. Soon after came a fog so thick that we could not see twice
							the length of the ship; and then a heavy fall of Rain for two hours,
							with distant thunder— The weather cleared up and the Sun appeared
							shortly before Noon, from which time the day was fair with a very small
							breeze, varying from W. and by S. <pb n="225" type="ms"/>to N.N.W— After
							the fog and showers of the Morning, the brig which had been in sight all
							day yesterday again appeared, and at less distance The disposition to
							communicate together being mutual, our Colours were soon hoisted, upon
							which she immediately displayed the same Stripes and Stars. We met
							within speaking distance between two and three O’Clock, and spoke her.
							Proved to be the Alexander, of Hallowell, <persRef ref="u">Captain
								Winslow</persRef>, from Cork, out thirty-six days, and bound to
							New-York. She has thirty five Irish passengers on board. Saw several
							very large Islands of ice the day before yesterday. Had no soundings
							upon the Bank, but four days ago spoke with a vessel, which two days
							before had sounded and found bottom. Her reckoning makes the Longitude
							54:30. which favours <persRef ref="forman-jacob">Captain
								Forman’s</persRef> conjecture that our ship is about a degree ahead
							of her reckoning which was this day Latitude 42:09. Longitude 53:36. He
							thinks we passed the tail of the Bank, between Midnight and the Morning
							of the 15<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> when he first sounded— There
							can however be no question but that we are Westward of the Bank— The air
							was this Morning at 60. Water 57. Captain Forman invited Captain Winslow
							to come and dine with us upon green Turtle; but he had dined. He also
							objected to the proposal of keeping company together that he had been
							long out and expected to outsail us; which Forman admitted he probably
							would with a light breeze.— But as we had this day a fresh breeze, and
							were close upon the wind, we gained perhaps half a mile upon her before
							dark. <persRef ref="coit-elias">Coit</persRef> the Mate, a thorough Yankey Jack
							Tar, was stung to the quick by the boast of Winslow that he should
							outsail us, so that he took the helm himself and steered at least an
							hour to gain upon her, in which he fully succeeded— I played Chess as
							usual with <persRef ref="otis-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Otis</persRef>, after dinner, and there was an Evening party of
							vingt-un in the Cabin— I was most of the Evening upon deck. The morning
							I had employed in writing, and this day brought up the arrears into
							which this journal had run before our departure from London. The
							incessant occupation of time the last five weeks had made it utterly
							impossible to keep pace with it in my journal. I therefore kept short
							daily minutes, from which I expected to have leisure on board ship to
							make out the journal at large. So that when we left London, on the tenth
							of June my regular Journal stood at the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.
							</hi>of May.— But as I wished to have no arrears on the Voyage, I left a
							space of 26 pages from p 184. to 211. to be filled up from the minutes
							during the arrears, and from the time of leaving London have regularly
							recorded every morn the incidents of the preceding day. I also began at
							Alton, the first morning after we left London, to redeem the arrears,
							and with as much perseverance and Industry as belongs to my Nature,
							sluggish and idle as it is, have continued with intermissions of every
							boisterous and every indolent or dissipated day, until this morning when
							the space allotted to the vacancy was ultimately filled up. But the 26
							pages which I had allowed for the 35 days was not sufficient— I was
							obliged to abridge the narrative of the whole last week that I was in
							London, and for the last two days had not even space for the short
							minutes, which I had taken from day to day.— I propose during the
							remainder of this Voyage, which I still hope may be terminated by the
							close of the present Month, to add from day to day some notice of
							incidents which occurred during the last fortnight of my residence at
							London, and which the narrowness of the space that I had left to fill up
							the record prevented me from mentioning— Thus I should have noted on the
								24<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>of May, that as I was going out
							for one of the morning walks with <persRef ref="bentham-jeremy">J.
								Bentham</persRef>, I met in Craven Street <persRef
								ref="chester-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chester</persRef> the assistant Master of the Ceremonies, who told
							me that the <persRef ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef> was much pleased
							with the footing upon which I had placed the subject of the private
							Audience to take leave of her—and that she would not wish me to take any
							further trouble: she wished me a prosperous voyage home, and all health
							and happiness to myself and my family— I desired M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Chester to reply to Her Majesty by the assurance how much I
							regretted the cause which had deprived me of the honour of taking leave
							of her in person, and of my earnest wishes for the speedy and entire
							restoration of her health. It was the last time I saw M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester, and closed my relations with the
							ministerial branches of the Royal Family— Of the Duke’s of <persRef
								ref="edward">Kent</persRef> and <persRef ref="augustusfrederick"
								>Sussex</persRef>— I was to see and hear something more— <persRef
								ref="wilson-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rae
								Wilson</persRef>, the Gentleman who introduced me to the Lancaster
							School in the Borough of Southwark, is in close and frequent
							correspondence with the Duke of Kent who is now residing at Bruxelles.
							The Duke in one of his Letters had mentioned me, which I believe was the
							occasion of his first calling upon me. He sent me a copy of the passage
							in the Duke’s Letter, <pb n="226" type="ms"/>which spoke of me, to which
							I requested him to return in his answer to the Duke’s Letter something
							from me, in a like complimentary Style from me; the Duke replied much in
							the same manner, but more at large and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wilson sent me also the extract of this second Letter. The Duke of
							Sussex’s polite attentions to me were still more unreserved. It was by
							his own proposal that he went with me and shewed me the new Bedlam
							Hospital, and by an odd coincidence it was on the <persRef
								ref="george-iii">king’s</persRef> birth-day. He promised then to
							call upon me and <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> the next day; but he
							was accidentally prevented; and came the day after— M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and I were both out but <persRef
								ref="smith-john">Smith</persRef> received him. He left a copy of his
							printed Speech in 1812. upon the Catholic Question, as presented to me
							by himself— His kindness and civility to me have been signal and
							uniform, from the time of our first acquaintance at Berlin. But he is
							now in so strong opposition that his friendship itself was the reverse
							of a recommendation at Court.</p>

						<p><date>19. IV:45. </date>Fresh blow the whole Night, with a most uneasy
							motion of the ship; and from the time of rising I perceived this was one
							of the days when I should be able to write only a few lines for the
							occurrences of yesterday; and having slept little in the Night, I was
							equally disqualified for reading. I passed therefore almost the whole
							day at the Chess Board— Before and after breakfast with <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>, and after dinner with <persRef
								ref="otis-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis</persRef>, who
							has so much improved in his skill that he now again contends with me
							upon equal terms.— The <persRef ref="adams-charles2;adams-george"
								>boys</persRef> bathed this Morning in a large hogshead of Sea Water
							which had been prepared for me.— The wind which varied no more than from
							W. to W.N.W. &amp; W.S.W. kept us under reefed topsails all the Morning,
							and moderated in the afternoon without much abatement of the swell— A
							brig Eastward bound passed us very rapidly this Morning, and another
							within an hour after dinner— Our companion the Alexander was in sight
							the greatest part of the day. In the Evening there was thunder and
							lightening. Then a North East gale for half and hour and just before
							midnight a flat and sudden calm, leaving the ship to pitch, and roll as
							if her Masts would go over.— The Dead-Lights were at my request put in—
							The air this morning was at 67. Water 61. Latitude at Noon 42:57. Long
							56:24. Our course had been about N.W. and we had got out of the range of
							the gulph stream early this Morning, as appeared by the coldness of the
							Water.— The wind itself was cold all this day.— Among the omissions of
							my journal on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of June, were some of
							the observations which I made at the Borough Lancaster school, and at
							Bedlam Hospital. The system of the school appears to me excellent as a
							saving both of time and expence. It rivets constantly and necessarily
							the attention of pupils, and teaches in two years as much as is usually
							learnt in five. It teaches them also to read and write; all very nearly
							equally well; it multiplies and extends the means of obtaining
							elementary education, in a surprizing manner and I have no doubt it
							communicates any given portion of Instruction, at less than one tenth
							part of the former cost. There are two candidates for the honour of this
							invention. <persRef ref="lancaster-joseph">Joseph Lancaster</persRef>, a
							Quaker, and <persRef ref="bell-andrew">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bell</persRef> a Clergyman of the Church of England, who first
							introduced it in a public school at Madras in India. The two systems
							without being precisely the same are so nearly alike, that there has
							been a sharp controversy; on the question which took the idea from the
							other. It would seem that it occurred to them both without communication
							with each other— But in England the Churchmen took the alarm, because
							the English Church service was not taught, together with reading and
							writing. They sat up therefore, a number of Schools on the system of
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell, in which they teach the liturgy
							with the alphabet, and put down Church and King, in company with joint
							hand-writing, into the minds of the pupils. These Schools are patronised
							with profuse liberality by the noble and the wealthy, while the
							Quaker-Schools are left to struggle along with very little assistance,
							and upon their own Merits— The <pb n="227" type="ms"/><persRef
								ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef> and <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince
								Regent</persRef> however have made small subscriptions to them; and
							nominally to patronize them and the <persRef ref="edward">Duke of
								Kent</persRef> has promised them a thousand Pounds, when he has them
							to give. Lancaster himself has become bankrupt and forfeited his
							character by dishonesty, so that the school has been taken from him, and
							he is now a sort of vagabond. It is the fashion in England to say that
							the management of the Bell or as they call it the National school is
							better than that of the School <hi rend="italic">for all</hi>; as the
							Quakers call their’s because they receive pupils of all religious
							denominations, while the National school teaches only children of the
							established Church. I have not seen the National school, and therefore
							am not competent to compare them together. The difference between them
							is however admitted to be of little importance. The system I was
							informed has been introduced at New-York; and it appears to be so well
							adapted to the management of the town Schools in Boston, that I should
							wish to see it introduced there.— On my visit to Bedlam Hospital, I was
							gratified to find more cleanliness and order, and fewer violent patients
							than in any similar institution that I had ever seen before. There was a
							great and manifest improvement in the Hospital upon what I had seen
							there in 1783. There are now no raging Patients— The <persRef
								ref="augustusfrederick">Duke of Sussex</persRef> however remarked at
							one place that the construction of the door to some of the cells, that
							they might be used for suicide— Upon which <persRef ref="monro-edward"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Munro</persRef> spoke of the
							constant, unremitting attention they were obliged to pay, in order to
							prevent that act, by many of the patients.— The Duke called for some of
							the bread and cheese and Beer like that in common use for the house;
							which we tasted, and found very good. One of the Patients however
							complained of the fare; and said it was not so good as in Newgate.—
								<persRef ref="mckenrot-anthony">Mackenroth</persRef> who is a
							German, had books and materials for writing in his apartment; and
							appeared tranquil, and conversed rationally with the Duke, <persRef
								ref="nicholson-margaret">Margaret Nicholson</persRef>, who is now 80
							years old had no appearance of madness, but did not
								<unclear>utter</unclear> a word— But there was with her an old Negro
							woman whose tongue ran without ceasing. She told the Duke she knew him
							very well; he was the Lord Mayor— There was one general circumstance
							which I thought yet left room for improvement. Not one of all these
							wretched persons was occupied— On one table we saw an old pack of Cards
							with which some of them appeared to have been playing: but most of them
							were walking to and fro in the long Entries, each in solitude, without
							any thing to excite his interest or attention— Whether it would be
							possible to employ them I cannot say, but in the state of total
							idleness, with confinement for life in which they are kept, it is not
							surprizing that they should need so many precautions to preserve them,
							from the violence of their own hands.</p>

						<p><date>20: VI:30.</date> The Calm, and the swell and the rolling of the
							ship continued through the Night; and my bed had been so made that every
							time the ship rolled it shifted sides under me, between the partition of
							the State-Room and <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife’s</persRef> birth.— Just at Day-light there was some abatement
							of the rolling, and I obtained a couple of hours of sleep. The Morning
							was so totally calm that the ship would not obey the helm. The weather
							sultry— The Sun potent.— Occasional very light breezes in the course of
							the day, tempered the heat of the Sun, and it became cloudy early in the
							afternoon. It was American dog day weather, and I had a dull head-ache,
							and a difficulty of breathing which ceased only when a shower of Rain
							came up in the Evening. The Morning air was at 72. Water 67. Longitude
							at Noon 57. Latitude 42:35. A turtle was seen on the surface of the
							Water near the ship this Morning—great quantities of gulph-weed floated
							by.— A fry of very small fish, and Mother Cary’s Chickens almost in
							flocks.— Every one found it necessary to resort to thin Cloathing.— I
							passed the Morning at writing, and after dinner read in <persRef
								ref="hewlett-john">Hewlett’s</persRef> Commentary on the Bible. The
							Evening rain excluded me from the deck, and the heat of the front Cabin,
							where many of the passengers were crowded, induced me to retire to bed
							about nine O’Clock— All was then quiet; but just at Midnight there came
							on the most sudden and most violent Squall of rain and wind that we have
							yet had upon this passage. All the Sails were as speedily as possible
							taken in; not without damage to them and to the rigging, and for half an
							hour she was scudding under bare poles. The sky soon cleared away and a
							bright Northern light was seen. Many of the Passengers during the Squall
							were much alarmed. All the waking were affected with some degree of
							agitation. <persRef ref="forman-jacob">Captain Forman</persRef> who was
							upon deck had <persRef ref="coit-elias">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Coit</persRef> immediately called up; and the bustle and turmoil,

							orders to hand the sails, were as appaling as I have usually known them
							on similar occasions. I had for my own part all day expected such a
							termination of it, with the addition <pb n="228" type="ms"/>of thunder
							and lightening— No change of wind followed this bourasque. It stuck
							about W.S.W— Our progress the last two days has been scarcely anything.

							Foreign Office in Downing Street— I had at a former Meeting enquired of

							there was one for me, before the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince
								Regent</persRef> for his signature, and which as soon as it should

							and desired that if it should not be ready until after my departure it
							might then be sent to <persRef ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Smith</persRef> who would forward it to me. Lord

						<p><date>21. IV:15. </date>After the furious Midnight Squall, the wind

							Midnight came to the North and sunk to a light breeze the sky clearing
							away, when I retired to bed— Additions to my Journal of 6. June, the day
							of my Conversation with <persRef ref="wilberforce-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilberforce</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="babbington-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Babbington</persRef> in Downing-Street. There had been published in
							the London papers of 4. June a Resolution of the Congress of the United
							States, passed at their last Session requesting the <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">President</persRef> to enter into Negotiation
							with Great-Britain and other European Powers, for completing if possible
							the suppression of the Slave-trade, and for sending certain free people
							of Colour from the United States to Sierra Leone or some such Settlement
							on the Coast of Africa. Wilberforce, intimated to me, but did not
							expressly assert that he had not seen this Resolution till after he had
							written me the Note in Craven Street, requesting to see me; and he said
							he had been gratified at the coincidence— But the great object of his
							wish to see me was evidently to start the proposition that the British
							Cruizers against the slave trade should be authorized to overhaul and
							search and even capture American Vessels, suspected to be engaged in
							that trade. Probably this project originated in the brain of <persRef
								ref="stephen-james">Master Stephen</persRef>, the Author of War in
							disguise and brother in Law to Wilberforce. One of the party called in
							derision, the Saints, and who under sanctified visors, pursue worldly
							objects with the ardour and perseverance of Saints. Wilberforce is at
							the head of these Saints in Parliament, and is said to possess more
							personal influence in the House of Commons than any other individual.
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> has
							more than once thrown out this idea of a mutual stipulation that the
							cruizers of every Nation which has passed laws for abolishing the
							Slave-trade should be authorized to search and capture the Slave trading
							vessels of the other Nations by whose Laws the trade is prohibited. In
							substance it is an impudent and barefaced attempt of the British to
							obtain in time of Peace that right of searching and seizing the ships of
							other Nations, which they have so outrageously abused during War. I
							never discussed the subject with Castlereagh, because he never brought
							the point to an explicit proposal, and it was not necessary to sift the
							proposition to the bottom, but Wilberforce after much lamentation at the
							inefficacy of the existing laws and measures for suppressing the trade,
							and <pb n="229" type="ms"/>asserting that it was now carried on with as
							much activity and inhumanity as ever; professed to be unable to devise
							any thing that should effectually suppress it. And yet he said there was
							one thing that would accomplish the end; if the Nations would agree to
							it—and then came out with the proposal, and enquired whether the United
							States would agree to it. That all vessels, whatever Nation’s flag they
							should bear, but which might be suspected of being engaged in the slave
							trade, should be liable to search and capture by the Cruizers of any
							other Nation. I told him I thought there would be some objection to
							this. In the first place, No American vessel engaged in the Slave-trade,
							could use the American flag; for the trade was prohibited by Law; and a
							vessel which should be captured while engaged in it Could not obtain any
							interfence of the American Government to rescue her. The flag could be
							no protection to her. The Commander of the capturing vessel would only
							act <hi rend="italic">at his peril</hi>: and if he seized a vessel, not
							really concerned in the trade, he must be responsible to indemnify the
							sufferer. Again, a stipulation of this nature though nominally
							reciprocal would be really one-sided— Cruizers against the Slave-trade
							are in fact kept only by Great-Britain— British vessels therefore would
							be liable to no search or capture, but by Officers under the authority
							of their own Government; while the vessels of other Nations would be
							subject to seizure by foreigners not amenable or accountable to their
							own Sovereigns. Some degree of prejudice must also be supposed to exist
							against the naval Power of Great-Britain, and particularly some jealousy
							of the exercise of an arbitrary power by her Naval Officers. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Babbington appeared to admit there was
							more foundation in these objections than Wilberforce was ready to allow.
							He suggested that in each Cruizer there should be an Officer of each
							Power agreeing to the principle, and that he should be present at every
							search, and no capture to be made without his consent. I objected to
							this that it would lead to conflicts of opinion and perhaps even of
							authority between the Officers of the different Governments, and
							Wilberforce did not like this expedient any better than I did. I also
							alluded to the misconduct of many naval British Officers; to the manner
							in which they had taken Slaves from the United States, and had probably
							sold many of them; and I explained the manner in which the judge of the
							Vice-Admiralty Court had evaded the British Statute and Order in
							Council, by which captured slaves were to be liberated or rather made
							the King’s Slaves for life— Wilberforce was much struck by this
							information, of which I authorized him to make such use as he thought
							proper.— He somewhat equivocally expressed his disapprobation of
								<persRef ref="cochrane-thomas">Admiral Cochrane’s</persRef>
							Proclamation, inviting the Slaves to run away from their Masters and
							join him; and said he knew too much of what had been the lot of those
							Slaves. He added that there were very few of them in Halifax,— I believe
							that Wilberforce was on the whole disappointed in the result of this
							interview, though we parted in perfect good humour and civility.— I
							mentioned that <persRef ref="west-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> West</persRef>, with <persRef ref="colburn-zerah">Zerah
								Colburn</persRef> and <persRef ref="colburn-abia">his
								father</persRef> spent the Evening of 6. June with us. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> West then told me that he had in the year
							1783 made a sketch for a Picture of the Peace which terminated the War
							of the American Revolution, which he would send me to look at the next
							Morning, as he accordingly did. I then recollected having seen it
							before, at the time when <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>
							was sitting to him for his likeness in it. The most striking likeness in
							the picture, is that of <persRef ref="jay-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Jay</persRef>— Those of <persRef ref="franklin-benjamin"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Franklin</persRef> and his
								<persRef ref="franklin-william">Grandson W. T.</persRef> who was
							Secretary to the American Commission, are also excellent— <persRef
								ref="laurens-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laurens</persRef>
							and my father though less perfect resemblances are yet very good.
								<persRef ref="oswald-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Oswald</persRef> the British Plenipotentiary was an ugly looking
							man, blind of one eye, and he died without leaving any picture of him
							extant. This M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> West alledged as the cause
							which prevented him from finishing the picture many years ago. <persRef
								ref="whitefoord-caleb">Caleb Whitefoord</persRef> the Secretary of
							the British Commission is also dead; but his Portrait exists from which
							a likeness may be taken. As I very strongly expressed my regret that
							this Picture should be left unfinished M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							West said he thought he could finish it; and I must not be surprized, if
							some day or other it should be received at Washington. I understand his
							intention to be to make a present of it to Congress. Zerah Colburn’s
							father urged me to let him communicate to me the secret of his
							instinctive arithmetic. I consented, and he made the attempt but without
							success. I might perhaps have understood him; but for the continual
							interposition of the father himself who without understanding it, by his
							frequent explanatory interruptions disconcerted both Zerah and me— I was
							however satisfied that the secret is only a rapidity of intellect with
							which the boy performs the process of multiplication and division, and
							that it is communicable only to minds equally quick in their
							operations.</p>

						<p><date>22. VI: </date>The Night was nearly calm, and when upon rising this
							morning I went upon deck, I found the ship was heading South,
							uncontroulable by the rudder. Immediately after came a breath of a head
							breeze, and <persRef ref="coit-elias">Coit</persRef> the Mate was deliberating
							whether he should have the Steering sail taken in or not. He had laid a
							wager with <persRef ref="tillary-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tillary</persRef>, last Night that there would be two hours of
							Easterly wind in the Night; and the Steering-Sail was his proof that he
							had won the wager. At last he took in the Sail, but left the boom out,
							till the Doctor came upon deck. The day was fair, &amp; the Evening the
							most beautiful we have had upon the passage— The Moon which quartered
							yesterday, shone, almost in conjunction with Jupiter, but with a faint
							and distant Halo, portending foul weather— Her beams playing with
							picturesque beauty on the Waters which were barely ruffled to a three
							knot breeze. I remained until ten upon deck, and then retired to my
							Chair Bed. I had devoted the Morning to writing, and the Novum Organum;
							and from dinner till dusk to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tillary,
								<persRef ref="otis-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Otis</persRef> and the Chess-Board. A Brig Eastward bound passed us
							in the Morning, and a ship towards Evening. But we have entirely lost
							sight of the Alexander.— Air 65. Water 67. Latitude 42:53. Longitude
							58:47.—Additions to my Journal of 7. June.— <persRef
								ref="bentham-jeremy">J. Bentham</persRef> walked with me to the
							corner of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> James’s Square, where <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh’s</persRef> house stands,
							and when I went in agreed to wait for me, walking up and down the
							Street, ten minutes: if I should be detained longer than that he was to
							go home, and if on coming out from Lord Castlereagh’s I had still time
							for a walk, I was to call for him at his house. I was with Lord
							Castlereagh about half an hour. His project of offering the Mediation of
							Great-Britain, to settle the differences between the United States and
							Spain, surprized me much; after what had passed at Ghent. But his plan
							of bounding us by the Mississippi, was exactly what I should have
							expected from a British Mediator— Castlereagh had in the first instance
							very cautiously spoken of the scheme of Mediation, as being merely an
							extra-official idea of his own, and now he did not seem to expect much
							from it. As to the Mediation of the allies between Spain and Portugal he
							told me the substance of the latest communication from the Court of Rio
							Janeiro which had already been told me by <persRef
								ref="desousaholstein-pedro">Count Palmella</persRef>— The only
							difference that I perceive between the two Statements is that Palmella
							told me the explanations given by his Government of the occupation of
							Montivideo, were communicated before they had received the offer of
							Mediation, and therefore was altogether uninfluenced by any impressions
							from Europe— Castlereagh said the explanations were given before the
							offer of Mediation was received; but after the Court of Brazil was
							informed of the first impressions in Europe, (meaning England) by the
							movement against Montevideo. Intimating that England had taken some step
							to call for explanation, before that general one of the allies. With
							respect to the Spanish South American Insurgents Castlereagh was not
							altogether explicit, but rather evasive in regard to the probable future
							policy of England— All that could with certainty be collected was that
							she will intermeddle as much as possible— That she will side to the
							utmost extent she dares against the Insurgents, but without proceeding
							to direct hostilities against them, and serving herself by urging Spain
							to allow them a free trade, at least with the English. In all her
							Mediations or offers of Mediation her justice and policy will be merely
							to serve herself. <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count
								Lieven</persRef> was waiting in the Antichamber to speak with
							Castlereagh while I was with him; and when we went into the antichamber
							to look at the map, Castlereagh asked Lieven to go into the Room from
							which we had come— Lieven <hi rend="italic">looked</hi> anxious of
							knowing what we were about. He afterwards called at Craven Street, but I
							had not returned home, and did not see him. Both he and <persRef
								ref="poletica-pierre">Poletica</persRef> several times hinted to me,
							a desire to know how we stood with Great-Britain, and a suspicion that
							there was a prospect of early hostilities between them. They have some
							indistinct idea of the question and discussion concerning the fisheries,
							and have the expectation that it will terminate in a War— When I left
							Castlereagh’s it was too late for the walk with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bentham; and instead of going to his house I called upon his
							friend Place the Taylor, and Republican. He keeps a shop in Charing
							Cross, and is quite prosperous in his trade, notwithstanding his
							dabbling with politics. <persRef ref="place-francis">Place</persRef> who
							was unwell received me in his library two pair of Stairs up from his
							shop. He had a very considerable library, all the shelves of which that
							I noticed were full of Books of History and Political Economy. He told
							me he was very glad, I had rejected that ridiculous proposal of <persRef
								ref="phillips-richard">Sir Richard Phillips’s</persRef> to set up
							and pay for an American Newspaper in London.— Place asked me where he
							could procure a volume of the Constitutions of the United States; and I
							promised to send him one. I had given mine to Bentham— Place was much
							interested about a man named <persRef ref="wooler-thomas"
								>Wooler</persRef> a printer who had just been tried for a libel upon
							Lord Castlereagh and <persRef ref="canning-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning</persRef> in a weekly
							periodical publication called the Black Dwarf. Wooler was tried at the
							Old Bailey, before <persRef ref="abbott-charles">judge Abbott</persRef>
							of the King’s Bench. He pleaded his own cause, and astonished a crowded
							auditory by his Eloquence— He was tried upon two informations upon both
							of which the Judge strongly charged the Jury against him— One of the
							Jurymen of the first jury asked the judge what <pb n="231" type="ms"
							/>they must do if they found the matter charged as libellous, true. He
							said that by the Law, truth was no justification of a libel. The jury
							were out several hours without being able to agree— There were three
							Talesmen who stood out for the defendant against nine special jurors,
							still more stiff for the Crown. At last the Talesmen agreed to a verdict
							in this form “As truth has been declared to us to be by Law a libel, we
							of the Jury are compelled to find the Defendant guilty.” but they
							stipulated that if the Court refused to receive the verdict in that form
							the jury should go out again.— Instead of this verdict Abbott the judge,
							ordered a general verdict of Guilty to be recorded, and refused to
							receive the affidavit of the Talesmen, as to the agreement about the
							terms in which the verdict was to be delivered. The next day upon a
							statement of the facts by Abbott himself in the Court of King’s Bench,
								<persRef ref="law-edward">Lord Ellenborough</persRef> in a manner
							compelled Chitty whom Wooler had in the meantime employed as his
							Counsel, to say that he asked for a new trial, and immediately granted
							it. Subsequently however <persRef ref="chitty-joseph">Chitty</persRef>
							moved that the Defendant should be discharged, which motion still
							remained to be argued when we left London. Bentham told me that it was a
							general opinion among the lawyers that Abbott had lost his reputation by
							his conduct on this occasion. He also told me that if a vacancy should
							occur in the Election for Westminster, it was intended to set up Wooler
							as a Candidate— Place told me that if Wooler had not argued his own
							cause he would certainly have been convicted. That no lawyer would have
							dared, or been suffered to put the cause upon its real and strong point
							of defence. That Lord Ellenborough, by his overbearing and brow-beating
							controul over the bar, had annihilated the Spirit of all the lawyers.
							That if any lawyer had a pretension to Independence, Ellenborough would
							harrass and persecute him, till the suitors found out he was not well
							with the Court; and then, no soul would give him a brief. He had in this
							manner ruined the practice of Brougham and many others. Place said he
							had often served as a jury man in Courts where Ellenborough presided,
							and had seen much of him; but never without having his most vehement
							indignation excited by his despotic and insolent controul over the
							lawyers. In all causes of mere property between man and man he was an
							able and upright judge; but in every case where the Court had an
							interest, he was an unprincipled and unblushing despot and oppressor;
							and they had rewarded him for it by making him a privy Counsellor— It
							was somewhat curious that after receiving this character of
							Ellenborough, Smith and I were on the same day received by him, when we
							went our round of official visits.— We were also received by <persRef
								ref="banks-joseph">Sir Joseph Banks</persRef>, whom I saw for the
							first and last time— I mentioned to him <persRef ref="percival-john"
								>Lieutenant Percival’s</persRef> new invented pump box for ships at
							sea, and recommended it to his attention, if there should be an
							application concerning it to the Board of Longitude of which he is
							President. He said he thought it would probably not be within the
							Province of the board of Longitude; although they readily examined many
							objects relating generally to Navigation: but he promised every
							assistance in his power to Lieutenant Percival if he should apply to him
							concerning his invention, whether as President of the Board of Longitude
							or in any other capacity. I mentioned to Sir Joseph how shamefully
								<persRef ref="pursh-frederick">F. Pursh</persRef> had abused his
							confidence and mine by drawing bills for money upon <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef> on the pretence that I had
							funds of his in my hands— He said Pursh had treated him in the same
							manner— On calling at <persRef ref="wellesleypole-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> W. W. Pole’s</persRef>, as neither he
							nor <persRef ref="wellesleypole-katherine">his Lady</persRef> were at
							home, I left a message, that <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef> was so unwell we should not be able to go there this
							Evening according to the invitation we had received, but that we would
							call again if possible before leaving town. After finishing the visits
							with <persRef ref="smith-john">Smith</persRef>, I called at Bentham’s
							merely to tell him I would walk with him to morrow Morning. He already
							knew that I had been with Place— After dinner I called at <persRef
								ref="bollmann-justus">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bollmann’s</persRef> lodgings to see him, but he was not at home.
							There was a civil Engineer named <persRef ref="u">Upton</persRef> who
							called upon me, and was very desirous of going to the United States— The
							Letters which he shewed me from <persRef ref="latrobe-benjamin"
								>Latrobe</persRef> and <persRef ref="smith-john2">John Spear
								Smith</persRef> were of encouragement and invitation founded upon
							the appropriation by the Legislature of Virginia, for making new Roads
							and Canals.— The same object upon which Governor <persRef
								ref="nicholas-wilson">W. C. Nicholas</persRef> wrote to me, and upon
							which I had recommended <persRef ref="couling-william">W.
								Couling</persRef>. Upton had received his Letters only a few days
							since though they were dated I think a year ago or more. I have never
							received from Governor Nicholas any reply to the proposals of Couling,
							which I sent him by duplicates more than a year since— I told Upton that
							I had recommended another person to the Governor of Virginia for this
								<pb n="232" type="ms"/>employment, upon which he said he could not
							go to the United States upon an uncertainty, and would wait until he
							should hear something further— Received a Letter from <persRef

								<persRef ref="monroe-james">President of the United
							States</persRef>, and a present to my wife of his portrait, on the medal
							struck in honour of him. We sent back his sketch of the Picture of the
							Peace of 1782.— A note from Lord Castlereagh with a Passport for myself
							and my family, and Letters from Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Aspinwall, mentioning that he had effected the Insurance upon all my

								<persRef ref="thompson-w">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Nicholas’s</persRef> school to <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef>, asking him for two books which he had lent him,

						<p><date>23. V: </date>I was waked soon after daylight, by a very heavy
							shower of Rain, and when it was over found the weather almost calm with
							a thick fog. The ship however kept upon the whole her course from Noon
							to Noon. Latitude 42:44 Long: 60:56. Air 67. Water 63— But the wind
							never deviates long or far from W.S.W— It was there by Noon, and soon
							freshened, till it became necessary to reef the topsails. The Head-Sea,
							very soon succeeded, and before I had finished my writing for the day,
							the pitching of the ship made it so uncomfortable, that after finishing
							two pages I was obliged to leave my task for the Morning unfinished. I
							attempted to read in the Novum Organum but after a few pages found the
							book dropping from my hands by drowsiness— The hour for dinner was at
							hand; and from dinner till dusk I was at Chess with <persRef
								ref="otis-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis</persRef>.
							This pastime is a trial of temper to which mine is not always adequate—
							I this day gave Otis a Castle and he beat me two games out of three.
							When I lose the game it is generally from some neglect or oversight of
							mine so gross and glaring that it mortifies my pride beyond endurance— I
							sometimes lose the calmness of my disposition, to a degree bordering
							upon rudeness; a single blunder throws me so completely off my centre
							that I scarcely ever can redeem the game, after it— I also find myself
							committing the same oversights time after time, and one defeat proves no
							lesson to guard against another. There is a capacity of combinations in
							Chess which is a painful test of intellect.— It occupies the
							understanding and works upon the feelings too powerfully for sport.— The
							Evening was fine, and before ten I left them at Cards in the Cabin—
							Additions to my Journal of 8. June— It was the last Morning walk that I
							took with <persRef ref="bentham-jeremy">J. Bentham</persRef>, and we
							went as usual through Hyde Park, and Kensington Garden. The written
							questions upon the state of religious opinions in America, and
							particularly upon the effect of avowed deism or atheism upon a man’s
							reputation and influence in Society, with the answers I had given to
							them formed the principal subject of our Conversation. I perceived that
							my answers were not exactly such as he would have desired. He spoke with
							more reserve than usual, as if unwilling to shock prejudices which he
							had found rooted in my mind. The general tenor of his observations
							however was to discredit all religion, and he intimated doubts of the
							existence of a God. His position was that all human knowledge was either
							positive or inferential— That all inferential knowledge was imperfect,
							and uncertain; depending upon a process of the human mind which could
							not in its Nature be conclusive— That our knowledge of the physical
							world was positive; while that of a Creator of it was inferential— That
							God was neither seen, nor felt, nor in any manner manifested to our
							senses but was the deduction from a syllogism, a mere probability from
							the combinations of human reason.— That of the present existence of
							matter we have positive knowledge— That there was a time when it did not
							exist we assume without proof, for the purpose of assuming equally
							without proof an eternal creator of it— I observed in answer to it that
							inferential knowledge was in numberless cases more to be relied upon
							than what he called positive knowledge; meaning the mere testimony of
							the senses. That our knowledge of physical nature such as it is,
							consists entirely of inferential corrections of the testimony of the
							senses.— While we trust the positive knowledge of the senses, we must
							believe that the Sun, and the whole firmament of Heaven move daily round
							the Earth; and so stubborn are these cheating senses that after they
							have been convicted of imposture, and when we know it is the revolution
							of the Earth round its axis, that produces all these phenomena, we
							persist in saying that the Sun, Moon and Stars daily rise and set, and
							it is only when we sit down to astronomical calculations, that we
							discover the truth—the triumph of inference over the senses. <pb n="233"
								type="ms"/>I said that the proofs of intellect in the operations of
							the material world, were as decisive to my mind, as those of the
							existence of matter itself. Intellect not residing in matter, but
							moulding and controuling it. What is that intellect, and where is it?
							Every where in its effects— No where perceptible to the sense.— That
							this intellect is competent to the creation of Matter, I know, not from
							reason but from Revelation—but that it modifies and governs the physical
							world is apparent both to my senses and my reason. He replied little to
							this argument, apparently because he saw that my opinions were decided,
							and he did not wish for controversy. He said however that <persRef
								ref="place-francis">Place</persRef> was a professed atheist— From
							the general tenor of his part in this Conversation, and from several
							incidental remarks of his upon other occasions, I consider him as
							entertaining inveterate prejudices against all Religions, and that he is
							probably preparing a book against religious establishments. If he had
							found my sentiments congenial with his own, I have no doubt he would
							have disclosed his sentiments more fully— He spoke to me this day of an
							Estate in Pennsylvania, in the inheritance of which <persRef
								ref="koe-john;koe-anne">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Koe</persRef>, are interested
							indirectly. There is a nearer relation who wished to employ an Attorney
							in the business and he asked me to recommend one— I mentioned <persRef
								ref="ewing-samuel">S. Ewing</persRef>— I agreed, if <persRef
								ref="jump-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jump</persRef> the
							person interested would come to me to-morrow, to authenticate a power of
							Attorney, to Ewing, and another with the name in blank, in case Ewing
							should decline to accept the trust— After returning from the walk,
							several visitors came to Craven Street, among whom was <persRef
								ref="dacosta-hippolyte">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Da
								Costa</persRef> with his documents from Brezil— One was a copy,
							together with a translation, of a Letter to the <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">President of the United States</persRef>, from
								<persRef ref="pepoa-jono">Jonõ Ribeiro Pepoa</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="martino-domingo">Domingo Jose Martino</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="dearanja-manuel">Manuel Correa de Aranja</persRef> styling
							themselves the Patriots Provisional Governors of the Province of
							Pernambuco— It is an appeal to the sympathy of the United States, and a
							call for assistance from them— It charges the House of Breganza with the
							design of assassinating more than 600 respectable heads of families, on
							the suspicion that some of them were free-masons.— Mentions their
							Manifesto, of which there is however no accompanying copy, and declares
							that the Revolution was accomplished in 14 hours with the unanimous
							concurrence of Brazilians and Europeans, and with no bloodshed, except
							of 16 unfortunate satellites of despotism. The Letter is dated 12. March
							last, and purports to be sent by <persRef ref="bryan-joseph">Joseph
								Bryan</persRef>, a Citizen of the United States— The other document
							was copy of an Ordinance issued by the same provisional Government of
							Pernambuco declaring the Ports open to the Merchant vessels of all
							Nations, and permitting the importation of provisions and warlike
							stores, free of duty for one year. I took these papers; but <persRef
								ref="bollmann-justus">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bollmann</persRef> and <persRef ref="poletica-pierre"
								>Poletica</persRef>, were present, all the time that Da Costa was
							with me, and I was not desirous of having any particular conversation
							with him— He had no material information other than that which is
							public. Poletica was inquisitive about the state of affairs between the
							United States and England, about which he said the British Government
							were affectedly close and reserved. I told him there was nothing to be
							reserved about. He muttered something about the fishery— I told him
							there was a question between us about fisheries; as I heard there was
							between Russia and Sweden, about a fishery on the Coast of Norway. This
							diverted the Conversation into another channel. D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bollmann said something to me again of himself; and
							suggested the usefulness that it would be of to the United States to
							keep in Europe constantly a scientific agent, who might collect and
							transmit the earliest information of all discoveries in Science;
							improvements in the Arts, and useful inventions. He said the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef>, had constantly two
							such persons in London. Bollmann is a man of strong genius with weak
							judgment; an ardent imagination, and an unsteady character. He might be
							exceedingly useful if he could be safely trusted.</p>

						<p><date>26: V:</date> About eleven last Evening I threw myself half
							undressed upon my bed, and lay till between one and two this morning
							quite sleepless, when the heat became insufferable, and I rose and went
							upon deck. I found <persRef ref="shiels-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Shiel</persRef> there with the <persRef
								ref="forman-jacob">Captain</persRef>— The gale had not abated but
							continued blowing in squalls of increasing fury. The moon was still
							shining, and the part of the horizon from which the wind blew, scarcely
							looked cloudy. But heavy scuds of clouds were flitting constantly over
							the face of the Moon and Stars, and deep flashes of forked lightening,
							were ranging round from N.E. to Southwest.— I remained upon deck till
							near three, when the Captain ordered the Spanker and mizen topsail to be
							taken in; when a Sea broke on the windward Quarter, and dashed over me
							such a sprinkling of the Spray as drove me down again to the State-Room.
							The Main Sail and fore topsail were then taken in and the Main-topsail
							close reefed.— Our deadlights had been put in just before bed time last
							Evening.— At five O’Clock I rose again, and upon deck found the ship
							under the Fore-Sail, close-reefed Maintopsail, and Main and Mizen
							Stay-Sail with no others— <persRef ref="coit-elias">Coit</persRef> the Mate was
							stretched out dozing on the hen-coop; and <persRef ref="williams-john10"
								>Jack Williams</persRef> the Seaman at the helm told him there was a
							black squall to windward that looked very dangerous— Let it come, said
							Coit; the sooner the better. We are ready for it. This formidable cloud
							however parted into two, and went off in heavy showers one on our
							Starboard, and the other over Larboard Quarter— We had nothing of it—
							The Sun soon afterwards came out, and exhibited a glowing Morning
							Rainbow; about seven in the Morning a Cloud passed over from which fell
							a little rain— It was followed by a succession of others moving more and
							more copiously for three or four hours— From the first fall of Rain the
							violence of the wind began to subside, and it gradually abated after
							every shower; before Noon there was barely wind left to fill the sails.
							The air and water had both been up last evening to 78. this Morning they
							were at 73— There was no Observation at Noon— Longitude by the reckoning
							64:07. The middle dead lights were taken out again this Morning. The
							swell of the Sea, was less than might have been expected from the force
							of the wind; which the Captain ascribes to the current of the gulph
							stream in which we are, flowing in the same course with the wind. While
							we were at dinner the wind came North of West, and before dusk it was at
							East, and our Steering sails were rigged out— Showers of Rain still
							pouring down— A flying fish fell upon deck, at the dusk of the Evening.—
							It was the twentieth Anniversary of my Marriage day; noticed by a toast
							given by <persRef ref="tillary-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tillary</persRef> after dinner.— The Brig Alexander was in sight
							until the change of the wind in our favour, where she kept her course W.
							and by N. while we kept ours at W— Another brig steering also westward
							was seen in the course of the day. The extreme weariness, which followed
							a Night like the last disabled me from writing more than the yesterday’s
							Journal. I put up my Books immediately after breakfast, and could barely
							get along with the Tales of My Landlord. From dinner till dusk I played
							at Chess with <persRef ref="otis-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Otis</persRef>.— Additions to my Journal of 9 June— I have mentioned
							that the Ship Washington left the London Dock on the 5<hi

							her chambermaid, at London; having agreed to join the ship at Cowes.
							Captain Forman had promised to write me from the Downs, to give me

							go and solicit them in the United States himself; leaving Zerah here, at

							commenced this day at Westminster Hall; before the Court of King’s

							much occupied with my own affairs to attend at the Court. N.B. I have
							now completely brought up the arrears of this Journal, which during my
							last residence in Europe, and most especially from the time when I left
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg to attend at the
							Negotiation of the Peace of Ghent, has occupied so large a portion of my
							time that I can henceforth no longer continue it with the same
							minuteness— On my return to my native Country, a new, and for some time
							at least a busy and laborious scene threatens to open before me— A Scene
							so laborious, and so full of perils and perplexities, that a stouter
							heart than mine would be appall’d at the prospect of it— From the time
							of my arrival in the United States, my Journal must be a mere abstract
							of loose Memoranda— My whole time must be devoted to the performance of
							duties, and may the Mercy of Heaven assist me duly to discharge
							them!</p>

						<p><date>29. VI: </date>After a quiet Night this morning commenced with

							which there was afterwards little variation— Air at 72. Water 66. Having
							before breakfast written my journal of yesterday, and finished reading
							the Novum Organum, I wasted all the remainder of the day—the Morning in

									>r</hi> Otis</persRef>.— The Brig Alexander was in sight the
							greater part of the day. The children hooked up quantities of gulph weed
							loaded with barnacles, and one parcel with a small crab— After dinner
							the <persRef ref="forman-jacob">Captain</persRef> sounded, but found no
							bottom. At the same time two experiments were made with an empty bottle—
							The first time it was corked with a long and very large cork, the neck
							then dipped in tar, and then a piece of thick canvass tied closely over
							and round it. the bottle was tied to the lead used for sounding, and
							sunk, between sixty and seventy fathom deep in the water. When brought
							up, the cork was found forced through the neck into the belly of the
							bottle; the canvass cap distended, and forming a small tunnel depressed
							half an inch into the neck of the bottle, which was full of water that
							had strained itself through the Canvass. The second experiment was of
							corking up the same bottle, empty, placing over the cork and the neck of
							the bottle an English half-penny which was sealed upon it with sealing
							wax— It was sunk again with the lead, and when brought up, the cork was
							again found forced into the bottle; but the half penny remained in its
							place sealed over the neck of the bottle which was nevertheless full of
							water— These experiments were made at the suggestion of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutting who said he had seen them made
							before with the same results. The water brought up in the bottle was by
							the thermometer about five degrees colder than that of the surface
							along-side of the ship. The Evening was serene and beautiful, but calm—
							They had Cards in the Cabin. Latitude by reckoning 41:09. Long:

						<p><date>31. IV:30. </date>It was the most tempestuous Night we have had
							upon the passage; of which I had some expectation from the dark clouds
							flashing with lightening to the leeward of the ship, the brightness of
							the Stars above the horizon, and the shooting of several of those
							atmospheric meteors commonly called falling Stars. Great part of the
							Night the ship was scudding under close reefed top-sails with the wind
							baffling between S.W. and W— By the tossing and pitching of the vessel,
							my bed was sliding under me, so that I scarcely slept an hour the whole
							Night. When I rose I found the weather had moderated. The air was at 64.
							but feeling very cool. Water at 70. importing that we are yet within the
							verge of the gulph-stream— A brig Eastward bound passed within sight of
							us before Noon. Our Latitude was 41:36. Reckoning Longitude 69:40. but
							really about 64. The day was moderate and cool, but a heavy swell all
							the Morning, and the weariness which always succeeds a sleepless night
							prevented me from writing more than the journal of yesterday. I passed
								<pb n="237" type="ms"/>the afternoon from dinner till dusk as usual
							at Chess with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis, and had various
							success. Read the Preliminaries of the Treatise De Augmentis
							Scientiarum— As the tediousness of our voyage increases with its length
							the recourse of the other passengers to card playing becomes more
							frequent. Yesterday they had loo all the afternoon; and this day, they
							had it morning afternoon and Evening— I find my passion for Chess
							encroaching upon me in the same manner— Towards Evening the wind, came
							round, a very light breeze at N.E. and our Steering Sails were set. It
							soon became too cool for the deck, and I turned in, shortly after nine—
							Inner Deadlights were taken out this morning.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> I Rise on the average between
							five and six, and immediately go upon deck where I ascertain with my
							thermometer the temperature of the air and of the Water drawn from the
							side of the ship. Then return to our after cabin, and write my journal
							until the time for breakfast; about nine. From ten till half-past two I
							write again, when the weather permits; or read; with occasional
							intervals of going upon deck to look at a sail in sight or at porpoises
							or whales or any other of the few objects from abroad which excite a
							momentary notice— The dinner table is cleared off about four, from which

							admits I remain upon deck, walking, or star-gazing, or conversing with
							one or another of the passengers until ten or eleven when I retire for
							the Night. This is the regular course, subject to many exceptions— A
							Stormy Night which to me is always a sleepless one, is always followed
							by a languid and idle day. A heavy swell seems to throw a sort of
							confusion upon the faculties of the mind and disqualifies me for writing
							or reading. The heat of some of the late days has produced a similar
							effect, and made me waste even the Mornings in idleness.— When we
							embarked at Cowes, this was the term at which I had hoped our voyage
							would close— We have now a prospect of being from five to ten days more
							at sea. The number of passengers that we have on board gives a certain
							liveliness and variety to the scene; but the longing for land is
							universal, and the calls for Patience grow daily more urgent and more
							irksome. We have yet abundant cause to be thankful.</p>
