						<p><date>1. VI:</date> Monday. The first Session of the fifteenth Congress
							commenced this day; a Quorum of both Houses was formed, and <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> was
							chosen Speaker of the House of Representatives. When I called at the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">President’s</persRef> with my papers I

								Lomax</persRef> with him— <persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> G. Hay jun<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi></persRef> afterwards came in. The President had removed
							into his cabinet, which is new papered. He appointed Wednesday at One
							O’Clock for an Audience to <persRef ref="onis-luis">Don Luis de
								Onis</persRef>, the Spanish Minister to deliver a Letter from the
								<persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">king of Spain</persRef>— I found M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis himself at the Office of the
							Department, and had a Conference with him of two hours. His propositions
							for a Treaty were the same as those made by <persRef
								ref="pizarro-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pizarro</persRef> to <persRef ref="erving-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Erving</persRef>, which I told him
							were so inadmissible that it would be useless to enter upon the
							discussion of them— He nevertheless referred to many documents to prove
							that Louisiana never extended westward of the Mississippi; and enlarged
							upon the interest of the United States and Spain to harmonize together,
							with other Powers against the commercial domination of Great Britain—
							Onis had also an inofficial proposal to make to me; which was that I
							inofficially should authorize any Agent of the United States going to
							Buenos Ayres, to ransom for 15 per Cent or more two ships belonging to
							the Spanish Philippine Company taken by a privateer under the Buenos
							Ayres flag, but fitted out from Baltimore, and manned by Citizens of the
							United States— This I also declined— I was employed all the Evening, in
							examining papers referred by the House of Representatives to the
							Secretary of State at the last Session of Congress; and I made the draft
							of a Report on the Petition of <persRef ref="lewis-winslow"

								<persRef ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="pleasonton-stephen">Pleasonton</persRef> with him. There came

							the vacant Clerkship in my Office to his son <persRef
								ref="anderson-alexander">Alexander</persRef>, who had declined it;
							at which I had been somewhat surprized; as he the father had applied to
							me for it— He said he thought it was best to be candid with me on the

							dollars Salary instead of the one with 1350 dollars. Young Anderson is
							about 22 years of age, and has a place in his father’s Office of 12 or
							1300 dollars. At Quincy I received a Letter from his father, telling me
							he had a <hi rend="italic">friend</hi> to recommend to me, for Chief
							Clerk in my Office— This Son Alexander was that friend. The application
							from <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Brent</persRef> in the Office
							of Chief Clerk. which he had ever since the Resignation of <persRef
								ref="graham-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Graham</persRef>, on the fourth of March last. He was strongly
							recommended by <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Monroe</persRef> and <persRef ref="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>, had many years
							experience of the business of the Office, was a man of forty years of
							age, or upwards and of the most respectable character. I could on no
							consideration remove such a man to make way for any other— Then came the
							1500 dollar Clerkship— Anderson himself told me that the President
							wished that might be offered to his brother <persRef ref="monroe-joseph"
								>Joseph</persRef>— I therefore offered it to him— The next, the 1350
							dollar office, Anderson at first said would not suit his son; but
								<persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">William S. Smith</persRef> had
							got a temporary Office of 1000 dollars a year Salary, under Anderson;
							which Clerkship Anderson wanted to suppress, to encrease with it the
							Salary of his Son, and so he proposed to me to give W. S. Smith my 1350
							dollar Clerkship, so that he Anderson might get rid of him— I told him I
							should appoint no Relation of my own to any Office under me— The next
							step was a communication from Anderson to me through <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>; that W. S. Smith should <pb type="ms" n="283"
							/>be retained in the Office under Anderson if I would give Anderson’s
							son the 1350 dollar Clerkship, in the Department, which in the
							particular circumstances of the case he would consent to accept— I told
							Crawford that I could make no such bargain, and would neither directly
							nor indirectly contribute to place any relation of mine in any office—
							Crawford then intimated that W. S. Smith must consequently be dismissed
							from the place under Anderson, upon which I observed that I had nothing
							to say. Smith was accordingly dismissed, and <persRef ref="lee-william"
								>W. Lee</persRef> gave him a place of the same Salary in his Office,
							without any knowledge of mine. Smith and his <persRef
								key="smith-catherine-johnson">wife</persRef>, and all the family
							were up in arms against me about it, but I thought my Resolution right
							and adhered to it— I offered the 1350 dollar Clerkship to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey, who had been several years a tutor
							at Providence College, was a member of the Legislature of Massachusetts,
							and had a multitude of the strongest Recommendations. He accepted it,
							though his application too had been for the Office of Chief Clerk, and
							he was something reluctant at taking a fourth place, instead— When M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe declined the 1500 dollar place, I
							assigned it of course to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey— Anderson
							instantly got wind that Monroe had declined, and spoke to me about it—
							He asked me to whom I intended to give the vacant Clerkship— I said I
							proposed offering it to his Son— He said he would mention it to him— But
							he was thinking of the 1500 dollar Office, and I of the 1350 dollar one.
							When I wrote the Note offering the place to young Anderson, it first
							occurred to me to express explicitly which place I meant to offer him;
							but it seems his expectations had been of the other. I told his father I
							was sorry there had been any misunderstanding in the case, but M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey’s age and standing in Society, and
							respectability of character forbade me to put another person over his
							head— I called next at <persRef ref="nourse-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nourse</persRef> the Register’s Office
							and conversed with him on the Affairs of the Indians— Thence I went to
							the President’s— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Calhoun</persRef> was there, and the President
							introduced him to me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford came in—
							There was conversation upon various subjects. <persRef ref="clay-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> has already

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robertson</persRef> of Louisiana

							the Government of Buenos-Ayres, and perhaps Chili, and M<hi

							(and he had no commission as public agent from any other Government) as

							Cargoes seized in British Ports at the commencement of the late War—and
							finally concerning the state of the Negotiation relating to the

							French Minister— I sent an excuse being still unwell with a severe Cold;

							The weather has again become very moderate— Last Sunday is noticed in
							the Newspapers from the Northward as having been severely cold— At

								<persRef ref="tencate-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ten

								>Lewis Morris</persRef>, one of the singers of the Declaration of

								<persRef ref="livingston-henry">Judge B. Livingston</persRef> to the
							President. He also brought me a letter from <persRef ref="knox-henry">H.

							Henry, Hayti— <persRef ref="middleton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Middleton</persRef>, chairman of the Amelia Island
							Committee was also with me, and I gave him all the additional
							information that I possessed concerning it— I shewed him the <hi
								rend="italic">secret</hi> Laws, those singular anomalies of our
							system, which have grown out of that error in our Constitution, which
							confers upon the Legislative Assemblies the power of declaring War;
							which in the theory of Government, according to <persRef
								ref="montesquieu-charles">Montesquieu</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="rousseau-jean">Rousseau</persRef><pb type="ms" n="290"/>is
							strictly an Executive Act. But as we have made it Legislative, whenever
							secrecy is necessary for an operation of the Executive involving the
							Question of Peace and War, Congress must pass a secret Law to give the
							President the power— Now secrecy is contrary to one of the first
							principles of Legislation; but this absurdity flows unavoidably from
							that of having given to Congress instead of the Executive the power of
							declaring War. Of these secret Laws there are four, and one Resolution;
							and one of the Laws that of 25. June 1812 is so secret that this day it
							could not be found among the Rolls at the Department— Another
							consequence has also followed from this clumsy political machinery— The
							injunction of secrecy was removed on the 6<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of July 1812 from the Laws previously passed, by a vote of
							the House of Representatives, and yet the Laws have never been
							published— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Middleton said he would see me
							again, before he should make his Report, to the House. I was engaged all
							the Evening in writing an answer to <persRef ref="collins-charles">C.
								Collins</persRef>— The thermometer <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit’s</persRef> was at 5 below 0 at
							Salem, and 5 above 0 at Baltimore.</p>

						<p><date>31. VI:30.</date><persRef ref="swan-hepzibah">M<hi

							this Morning according to appointment— <persRef ref="coles-edward">E.
								Coles</persRef> was here at the same time. She gave a hint that she
							had business with me, and Coles immediately withdrew— She came to
							solicit the interference of this Government to obtain the release of her
							husband <persRef ref="swan-james">James Swan</persRef>, from the prison
							of la Force at Paris where he has been ten years confined— He was there
							upon a sentence obtained in the Courts of France after three trials— A
							very unjust sentence for they were debtors to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Swan for 150,000 dollars, instead of being his Creditors—
							All M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Swan wanted was to get released and
							come to this Country for a fair trial. But he would never pay the money
							of the Sentence decreed against him there. A great deal of money had
							been sent to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Swan by her; but it had all
							been absorbed in the expences of the trials. <persRef

								rend="superscript">r</hi> de Neuville upon the subject, and if any
							thing could be done for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Swan, very
							readily to do it— <persRef ref="plantou-julia">Madame Plantou</persRef>
							came with a Print of her allegorical picture of the Peace of Ghent; for
							which she laid me under a contribution. It is a bombastic and foolish
							thing, but Madame Plantou gives herself out for a native of
							Philadelphia, and is a Painter. This is one of her works— There is an
							America, in a triumphal Car, and a Britannia, upon her knees, submitting
							to terms of Peace dictated by Minerva, and Hercules— Oh! the voracious
							maw, and the bloated visage of National vanity— If it were true that we
							had vanquished or humbled Britannia it would be base to exult over her,
							but when it is so notorious that the issue of our late War with her was
							at best a drawn game there is nothing but the most egregious National
							vanity that can turn it to a triumph— I received this morning Notes from
								<persRef key="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bagot</persRef> and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyde de Neuville,
							to ask if <persRef ref="bagot-mary;hyde-de-neuville-ann" type="multi"

								<persRef ref="crowninshield-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crowninshield</persRef>, there was again a consultation; and my
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">wife</persRef> called one the
							Ladies and informed them that they would also be received at half past
							eleven to-morrow— At the Office I had another long Conference with the
							Agent from Buenos Ayres, <persRef ref="aguirre-manuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Aguirre</persRef>—Urging still for the
							acknowledgment of his Government. He came to enquire whether it was of
							any importance that he should remain here, or whether he might go to
							Baltimore or Philadelphia where he could find useful business to do. I
							told him he must judge of that for himself. That his demand for the
							acknowledgment of his Government was under Consideration of the
							President; and that if he should go to Baltimore or Philadelphia, and
							any thing important should occur requiring his presence here, I could
							have immediate notice given to him— We had a short visit this Evening
							from the <persRef ref="correa-joseph">Abbe Correa</persRef> the
