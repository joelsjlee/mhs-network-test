						<p><date>1. V:45. </date>Thursday. I rose this Morning with a remnant of the
							pain in my breast, and a troublesome cough. Wrote however until the hour
							for Breakfast, and brought my journal of yesterday within a few lines of
							its close. Received a Note from <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef>, requesting me to call upon him next Monday
							Morning, instead of Saturday which he had mentioned yesterday. I had a
							morning visit from <persRef ref="harris-levett">L. Harris</persRef>— I
							called at <persRef ref="brunet-louis">Brunet’s</persRef> Hotel,
							Leicester Square and left Cards for him and for <persRef
								ref="parish-david2">D. Parish</persRef>. I attempted to return
								<persRef ref="coke-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Coke’s</persRef> visit, by calling at N. 40. Clarges Street, the
							place mentioned in the Calendar as his residence but was disappointed
							and found an empty house. I next went to the <persRef
								ref="williamfrederick">Duke of Gloucester’s</persRef> to make
							enquiries after the <persRef ref="mary2">Duchess</persRef> who has been
							several days ill, with what they call a bunyon on the foot. They shewed

								Villiers’s</persRef>, and at <persRef ref="thomas-tycho"
								>Thomas’s</persRef> Hotel for the <persRef

							Went to <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count Lieven’s</persRef> to
							enquire for <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">Poletica’s</persRef>
							lodgings, and found him there. I had some conversation with him upon
							various topics. I found his prejudices stronger, and his intelligence
							weaker than I had before supposed them. He has a foolish pretension to
							Independence of Sentiment coupled with an ill disguised inveteracy
							against all the principles of civil Liberty. He is very desirous of
							going as Russian Minister to America, but he says that <persRef
								ref="dashkov-andrei">Daschkoff</persRef> is not yet recalled— I
							walked home after stopping at the Bookseller <persRef ref="booth-john"
								>Booth’s</persRef> in Duke Street— I found <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> ill in bed with an
							extremely violent fever. She had been taken somewhat suddenly this
							Morning, with severe rhumatic pains; and had a fainting fit while I was
							out. I sent immediately for <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript"

						<p><date>2. VII: </date>I slept in one of the upper chambers. <persRef

							N. 162 Lombard Street— Of all the insolence I ever experienced there is
							nothing equal to the insolence of Counting house Clerks—one of these
							fellows treated me with so much impertinence, refusing to pay me in the
							description of bills that I wanted, and telling me in a tone of
							superciliousness that I must go to the Bank, I lost my temper. In his
							pursy pomposity he had paid me two pounds ten short of my bill— I threw
							his papers back in his face, and told him to give me my bill again— He
							refused; and was attempting to force back upon me the Bills I had
							refused, when a person, apparently a partner of the house or a superior
							Clerk, took them back and gave me the Bills I had asked for. I obtained
							my object, but left the place mortified, and vexed with myself at having
							been irritated to intemperance by a Bankers Clerk— To get rid of my own
							reflections, I walked my rounds, and purchased <persRef ref="todd-henry"

							<persRef ref="milton-john">Milton</persRef>—and other Books. I came home

							urbanity of manners, and playful wit. I asked him what was the News from
							his <pb n="181" type="ms"/>Castle of Indolence, which he had told me his

								ref="delosrios-carlos">Count Fernan Nuñez</persRef>, who stop’d his
							Curricle and spoke to me. He told me he had had his audience to take
							leave of the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef> yesterday,
							and was no longer Ambassador here. He should proceed for Paris
							to-morrow-morning. He assured me that I should be très content, with
								<persRef ref="onis-luis">Onis</persRef>, and that our affairs with
							Spain should be settled entirely to our satisfaction— That we should
							have what we wanted, and secured to us in the most effectual manner—
							Seulement—de l’autre cotè—les voisins— He himself had lately received
							instructions upon the subject, and was glad to let me know it before my
							return to America— Spain was resolved to give us full and entire
							satisfaction— It might not suit at all the views of some others—but I
							might depend upon it, Spain was firmly resolved to settle all affairs
							amicably with us— There was much nodding of the head, much significance
							of look, and much shew of mysterious meaning in all this, but nothing
							specific or precise. What he meant me to understand him as saying was
							that Spain would cede to us the Florida’s, although England was taking
							all possible pains to prevent it; but that we must satisfy Spain about
							the South-American Insurgents. Neither the time nor place would admit of
							my asking further explanations, and it was evident he meant to raise
							expectations in me, without saying any thing explicit. I answered him in
							general terms, with strong assurances of our earnest desire to settle
							every thing amicably with Spain; with my thanks for his communication;
							the great pleasure which I took in learning from him that the policy of
							Spain towards the United States was thus decidedly pacific and friendly,
							and my best wishes that he might have a prosperous negotiation at
							Paris.— I attended the dinner at the Royal Academy Somerset-House, on
							the opening of the annual Exhibition. It was much like the same party
							last year. The only person of the Royal Family present was the <persRef
								ref="ernest-augustus">Duke of Cumberland</persRef>— The <persRef
								ref="eustache-rene">Marquis d’Osmond</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="desousaholstein-pedro">Count Palmella</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="bourke-edmund">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourke</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="jouffroy-georg">Jouffroy</persRef> and myself were the
							only persons of the Diplomatic corps there. As usual there was a large
							assemblage of noblemen, gentlemen, and distinguished artists. The toasts
							and songs after dinner were like those of last year, but no speech
							making. The foreign Ambassadors and Ministers, were not separately
							toasted. The <persRef ref="gordon-george">Earl of Aberdeen</persRef>,
							President of the Society of Antiquaries, in returning thanks, added a
							very few words in praise of the appearance of the exhibition. Altogether
							the dinner was dull, and there was an air of tristesse about every
							thing. About 9 O’Clock the company rose from table and I walked home. I
							found that <persRef ref="cook-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D.
								P. Cook</persRef>, the Messenger, charged with the Letter from
								<persRef ref="monroe-james">President Monroe</persRef> to me
							announcing my appointment as Secretary of State, had arrived and had
							left his despatches at my lodgings in Craven-Street. Besides the
							President’s Letter, there was a despatch dated 7 March, from <persRef
								ref="graham-john">John Graham</persRef>, the acting Secretary of
							State, enclosing my Commission, a Letter of Recredence to the Prince
							Regent; and copies of two Resolutions of the Senate of 3. March last,
							calling for Reports to the Senate, at the next Session of Congress,
							which make it necessary to collect information from almost every part of

								ref="smith-william-steuben">W. S. Smith</persRef>; and a Letter from
								<persRef ref="forrest-richard">R. Forrest</persRef> with private
							enclosures. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook came in the British
							Packet from New-York. The paragraph in the Newspapers which had stated
							that he was coming out in the Hornet, which was to take us home, was a

						<p><date>4. VII: </date>I wrote a circular Letter to the Ministers and

							member of Parliament for Westminster. It is to be, on the 23<hi

							since <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Everett’s</persRef> return to

						<p><date>5. IV:30. </date>My Journal runs into irresistible arrears, and
							must be reduced in proportion as the absorption of time by other
							occupations increases. By rising so early this morning, I had the
							opportunity of redeeming only the two first days of this Month. At half
							past eleven this Morning I called upon <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert"
								>Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, according to appointment. I gave him a
							copy of the Letter from the <persRef ref="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef>, to the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince
								Regent</persRef>, announcing my recall from this Mission— Lord
							Castlereagh was upon this occasion as civil and obliging as I could
							expect or desire. He congratulated me upon my appointment to the Office
							of Secretary of State at home, and at the same time expressed his regret
							that it would necessarily remove me from this Mission. The compliments
							of course from a European Minister of State, are but so far significant,
							that they shew there is no cause of personal complaint against the
							person to whom they are addressed. I explained to Lord Castlereagh the
							reasons why an immediate appointment had not been made of a person to
							take my place at this Court. The President not having known whether I
							should accept the new Office assigned to me at home. But I assured him
							that a new Minister to this Court would be appointed as soon as
							circumstances would admit, and told him I was instructed in the
							strongest manner to declare the new President M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe’s earnest and anxious desire to cultivate the most
							friendly and harmonious intercourse with Great-Britain. He said that the
							same and an equally earnest disposition and desire existed in this
							Country to cultivate and improve the friendly relations with the United
							States; as an earnest of which he should in the course of two or three
							days send me a Note in answer to that which I had addressed to him a few
							days since in relation to the fisheries— He asked me, if I was informed
							of the state of the Negotiation upon the subject in America. I told him
							I had received copies of the correspondence concerning it, which had
							passed between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe and <persRef
								ref="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef>.
							He then recapitulated the substance of it, and said that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot has been authorized in July last to
							offer a certain extent of Coast being part of the British Territories in
							North America, for the accommodation of the American fishermen; and if
							that should be declined, to offer another portion, and eventually both
							of them. Neither of the propositions had however been found acceptable;
							but in February, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe had suggested
							that the President would be prepared to make a proposition on his part
							which he hoped would conciliate the views and interests of both parties.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot was not then authorized to
							receive this proposition; but the authority to that effect had now been
							sent to him. He had been empowered at the commencement of the
							Negotiation to suspend the orders to the <persRef ref="colpoys-edward"
								>British Naval Commander on the Station</persRef>—to prevent the
							American fishermen from frequenting the British Coast, and had
							accordingly written to him to suspend it. After the failure of his
							propositions, he had notified to the naval commander that the suspension
							of the order was to cease, and the order was accordingly now in force.
							But as the President having now a full knowledge of the views of this
							Government had intimated the disposition to make a proposal which would
							conciliate the interests of both parties; and as a signal proof of the
							desire of the British Government to cultivate the most friendly
							relations with the Administration of the new President, they had
							determined to renew the suspension of the Order to the Admiral during
							the present Season, and it would be immediately sent out. He read me the
							Note to that effect which he said he should be authorized to send me in
							the course of two or three days— He said he would take the Commands of
							the Prince Regent as to the time for the delivery of my Letter of
							recall— I then mentioned my Note to him upon <persRef
								ref="crosby-william">Crosby’s</persRef> case, and told him I had
							some other papers besides those I had sent him concerning it—among the
							rest a written opinion of <persRef ref="emmet-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Emmett</persRef>, a person known to
							him perhaps under unfortunate circumstances, but now one of the most
							eminent lawyers at the Bar, in the United States— He said, yes; he had
							known him; and he was one of the most eloquent men he ever had known. I
							told him that the argument in the opinion was in perfect coincidence
							with that in <persRef ref="reeves-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Reeves’s</persRef> pamphlets although written before they were
							published, and this agreement between two lawyers so entirely different
							from each other in all their political opinions formed of <pb n="183"
								type="ms"/>itself a strong presumption in favour of the soundness of
							their conclusions. I observed that I thought the principle would be of
							great importance, by its influence upon the intercourse between the two
							Nations, and mentioned again the hardship of Crosby’s case, who after
							having been prevented by the War from entering his appeal to the King in
							Council from the decision of the Court in Jamaica, within the limited
							term of one year had also been disappointed in the hope that the
							principle would have been arranged at the Negotiation for the Peace.
							Perhaps all that would be necessary for his case would be to restore to
							him the right of entering his appeal. Lord Castlereagh said that could
							not be done without an Act of Parliament. I said I thought there was a
							discretionary power in the Court of Appeal to extend the time within
							which Appeals are admitted— He replied that in Admiralty cases they had;
							because being governed by the rules of the Law of Nations, they were
							brought within the reach of the king’s Prerogative— But in cases
							depending upon the municipal Law, there was no such power— He said he
							had not seen my Note upon the subject, and supposed <persRef
								ref="hamilton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hamilton</persRef>, upon receiving it, seeing that it must be
							referred to the Law-Officers of the Crown, had sent it immediately to
							them. He likewise told me that there would be sent to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot to be communicated to the American
							Government a full statement of all the disorders and inconveniences
							which had been experienced in consequence of the fishing rights of
							Americans in the British jurisdiction in North America; to shew that it
							was not any commercial jealousy, or any wish to disturb our people in
							the enjoyment of their fisheries, that induced the British Government to
							adhere to this object, but the absolute necessity of protecting their
							own territorial authority.— On leaving Lord Castlereagh’s, I called at
								<persRef ref="anson-thomas">Lord Anson’s</persRef> in S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> James’s Square, to see <persRef
								ref="coke-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Coke</persRef> of
							Norfolk, but he had left town this Morning, for Norwich, to attend an
							Election of a member of Parliament for the County of Norfolk, which is
							about to take place. On returning home I found a <persRef ref="u">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Busby</persRef>, who kept me more
							than an hour, with the account of an invention which he pretends to have
							ready to be carried into execution, of a machine or Carriage to travel
							or to transport merchandize by land, with a velocity equal to one
							hundred miles an hour. A machine perfectly simple in its construction,
							not expensive, and requiring only a road analogous to the iron railways
							now used in this Country, to be carried into effect. The secret he said
							was yet entirely his own; and he came to enquire to what an extent such
							an invention would be useful in the United States. I told him I thought
							it scarcely possible to estimate the extent to which such an invention
							would be valuable in every civilized Country; but there was none where
							it would be more valuable than the United States, in proportion to the
							population and extent of the Country. He enquired whether the Government
							would be disposed to make the acquisition of such an invention; it would
							be of the highest utility in War; and he would offer it in preference to
							the United States, because he adored liberty, and they were the only
							free government upon the globe. I replied that as the invention was not
							of a nature to be kept secret, and required special roads to be made
							upon which the machine must run, to purchase the invention for practical
							purposes would transcend the powers of the Government of the U.S. but if

							is one of that numerous class of inventors who are mad with regard to
							their main objects and sober in all the calculations of detail— Who
							waste a world of learning and ingenuity in undertaking to perform
							impossibilities— He was scarcely gone when <persRef ref="hippisley-john"
								>Sir John Cox Hippisley</persRef> came in. He made some enquiries of
								<persRef ref="smith-john">Smith</persRef> concerning an old friend
							of his <persRef ref="cruger-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cruger</persRef> formerly member of Parliament for Bristol, and now
							living at New-York.— He enquired also concerning the Laws of the United
							States relative to Roman Catholics; and promised to send me a supplement
							to the Report of the Committee of the House of Commons, on that subject,
							and a second copy of the whole, for the American Government. He said the
							British Ministers on the Continent wrote that the Report was in high
							request at all the Courts, and had become a sort of manual, at Berlin
							and Vienna, upon their relations with the Court of Rome— I told him that
							I had perceived on looking into the Report that the Committee had done
							me the honour to notice and to quote from a publication which had
							appeared in my name: the Letters on Silesia, for which I offered him my
							best acknowledgments— <persRef ref="cook-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"

							immediately after dinner to the Play. I went to hear the debate in the
							House of Commons— The subject upon which I found them engaged was a Bill
							for the abolition of two Chief Justices in Eyre, which are Sinecures.
							This Bill was founded upon the Report of a Ministerial Committee on the
							revenues and expenditure of the <pb n="184" type="ms"/>Country. There
							was no opposition to the Bill; but much discussion upon the Report of
							the Committee— The House were in a Committee of the whole and Lord

								<persRef ref="grenfell-pascoe">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Grenfell’s</persRef> concerning the Bank— The Speakers besides him
							were <persRef ref="vansittart-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="ponsonby-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="williamswynn-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> C.
								Wynn</persRef>, and <persRef ref="smith-william9">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> W. Smith</persRef> spoke. next a
							desultory conversation upon the army estimates by <persRef
								ref="temple-henry">Lord Palmerston</persRef>, <persRef

								Grant</persRef>, Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							<persRef ref="goulburn-henry">Goulburn</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="brougham-henry2">Brougham</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="robinson-george">Robinson</persRef>, Vansittart and
							Ponsonby—and lastly a motion by <persRef ref="mackintosh-james">Sir
								James Mackintosh</persRef>, upon a horrible incident which occurred
							last week. An Irishman by the name of <persRef ref="ryan-patrick"
								>Ryan</persRef> was executed for a highway Robbery. A few days
							before his execution <persRef ref="ryan-mary">his wife Mary
								Ryan</persRef> had been taken in an attempt to effect his escape
							from prison— For this offence she was put to the bar, tried, convicted,
							and sentenced to two Months imprisonment, on the very day and within two
							hours after the execution of her husband. Sir James Mackintosh’s motion
							was only for a return to the house from the home Department of the dates
							of the man’s execution, and of the woman’s trial; but his object was to
							pass a vehement censure upon the City Magistrates for having tried the
							woman at-all. The motion was feebly resisted by <persRef
								ref="addington-henry2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> H.
								Addington</persRef>, by <persRef ref="atkins-john">Alderman
								Atkins</persRef> who was one of the trying Magistrates, and by
								<persRef ref="braggebathurst-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								B. Bathurst</persRef>. Some explanations were given and some
							apologetic defence of the Magistrates was offered— It appeared that the
								<persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef>, upon being made
							acquainted with the circumstances had granted to the woman a pardon—
								<persRef ref="romilly-samuel">Sir Samuel Romilly</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Martin</persRef>
							supported the motion. Lord Castlereagh expressed his hopes that after
							the explanations which had been given it would be withdrawn— Sir James
							Mackintosh replied with great feeling and eloquence, insisting upon the
							motion, with which he said the house should dispose as they pleased, but
							upon which he felt it to be his duty to take their sense— Lord
							Castlereagh then said that upon so serious a subject he could not divide
							the house, and should therefore support the motion, which then passed
							without a dissenting voice. There was something curious in this case,
							inasmuch as it presented the identical conflict of Law, and Morality
							which had happened in the case of <persRef ref="hamans-antoine"
								>Lavallette</persRef> and <persRef ref="chamans-emilie">his
								wife</persRef>; so that in disapproving the trial of Mary Ryan,
							there was a sort of oblique stigma cast upon the severity with which
							Madame Lavallette was treated in France. There was also a discussion
							upon the second reading of <persRef ref="gilbert-davies">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> D. Gilbert’s</persRef> bill for
							abolishing the Offices of the Chief Justices in Eyre; upon which the
							Speakers were Sir John Newport—Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							Ponsonby, Grant, Brougham, <persRef ref="wentworthfitzwilliam-charles"
								>Lord Milton</persRef>, and Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							<persRef ref="huskisson-william">Huskisson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="tierney-george">Tierney</persRef>. Between the two last there
							was some sharp debating which became at last strongly personal. Tierney
							was very severe upon the pompous promises and paltry performance of the
							Finance Committee, and Huskisson retorted that Tierney with all his <pb
								n="186" type="ms"/>professions of ardent passion for reform and the
							abolition of sinecures, had no sooner found that they were to be really
							effected than he had shewn his dissatisfaction at the Event— Tierney
							with much warmth called upon Huskisson for his proofs of this charge;
							and Huskisson alledged his having attended only once at the meetings of
							the Finance Committee— Tierney said he left the House to judge what
							credit was due to Huskisson’s assertion— <persRef ref="sharp-richard"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sharp</persRef>, and <persRef

							to <persRef ref="porter-agnes">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Porter</persRef>, who invited us to dine with her next Monday— After
							dinner I attended the debate in the House of Commons upon what they call
							the Catholic Question one of the subjects which are discussed once every
							two or three years in Parliament— This time it was upon a motion of
								<persRef ref="grattan-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Grattan’s</persRef>, and great expectations were entertained of the
							eloquence which would be displayed on both sides— It is a question upon

								opinion—<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="canning-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef> being in favour of the Catholic Claims, while
							other members of the Government are decidedly against them. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Grattan had opened the debate with a short
							Speech, reserving himself for the reply. When I entered the house
								<persRef ref="foster-leslie">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leslie
								Foster</persRef> was speaking against the motion. The other speakers
							on the same side were <persRef ref="yorke-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Yorke</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="hippisley-john">Sir John Cox Hippisley</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="webber-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webber</persRef>,
							member for Dublin, <persRef ref="braggebathurst-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bragge Bathurst</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="peel-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Peel</persRef>. On the other side were <persRef ref="parnell-henry"
								>Sir Henry Parnell</persRef>, <persRef ref="elliotlockhart-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William Elliot</persRef>, Lord
							Castlereagh, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Grattan. The motion was nevertheless so
							weakly defended that its supporters appeared almost as earnest to lose
							the question as their opponents were to defeat it— Castlereagh’s Speech
							was in substance much the best that was made on the Catholic side. He
							speaks with tolerable fluency, but is greatly deficient in precision—
							His sentences are never grammatical or congruent— They begin with a fire
							and end with a waterfall— If his speeches were taken down word for word
							as they are delivered they would make nonsense, and this is the reason
							why the Opposition have or affect so much contempt for his
							Understanding— But although his Sentences are ill constructed, so that
							like Gonzales’s Commonwealth, their latter end forgets their beginning,
							yet they generally do make out to convey an idea to the mind of the
							hearers, and that idea is often strong enough to make an impression. The
							cause of the Catholics in this case was so evidently right; the
							arguments in their favour so obvious and so clear, and the subject from
							the frequent discussions which it has undergone, was so familiar to all
							present that it was difficult to suppose any one could be at a loss what
							to say. Lord Castlereagh was at no loss; but he spoke like a man not
							seriously earnest in his own argument— Like a man pleading for his own
							consistency rather than for his cause. The same remark applies to
							Canning, whose language is good, and who is sometimes the most eloquent
							man in the house. It was but two Nights since he had been called to
							defend himself for what they call here a job—an useless and extravagant
							Embassy to Lisbon, where there was no Court, the <persRef
								ref="carlota-joaquina">Queen</persRef> and <persRef ref="john-vi"
								>Regent</persRef> being in Brezil— A case in itself utterly
							indefensible, but in the debate upon <pb n="187" type="ms"/>which he
							spoke so powerfully that he was universally admitted to have obtained a
							triumph over his adversaries— But his wits were then sharpened by
							personal interest and feeling— This Evening he was cold and tame—spoke
							very shortly and with very little apparent impression or effect. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> William Elliot came off still more
							haltingly— This Gentleman is a Right Honourable, and a sort of
							half-ministerialist, with pretensions to Independence. He is a man of
							fortune, and one of the borough-mongers. He appeared to enjoy great
							consideration in the house; and was much cheered when he rose to speak.
							He began boldly and freely enough, and seemed so much in earnest that I
							was in hopes of hearing at last a real champion for the Catholics— But
							in the course of five minutes he lost the thread of his argument, became
							confused and bewildered, stood several minutes, silent, endeavouring to
							recover his thoughts, then resumed an incoherent discourse of which it
							was impossible to make sense or reason— The more he failed the louder
							and the more generally the House cheered him, and whenever he could get
							out a few words, they listened to him with the utmost patience and
							attention— He hobbled along about a quarter of an hour—uttering a few
							sentences, and stopping alternately two or three minutes at a time to
							rally his reflections—at last he gave it up, and said he would not
							trouble the house any longer. The most eloquent speech of the Evening,
							and one of the most eloquent that I ever heard was that of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Peel, chief Secretary to the <persRef

							subordinate Office in the Ministry, of which Peel is the ablest member.
							He is quite a young Man, but already in high repute, and likely to
							become the most distinguished personage in the kingdom. His speech was
							against the Catholics and had the effect to make the worse appear the
							better reason. It far more than outweighed all the speeches in their
							favour— It was heard with the most undivided attention, and at its close
							was long and loudly cheered from every part of the house— Its style and
							manner were altogether temperate, but persuasive; energetic but without
							vehemence. The language elegant, and plain, but moderately ornamented—
							The Sentiments so liberal that they almost disguised the illiberality of
							the cause. Its effect upon the house was evident, and I perceived it no
							less by the anguish of two or three Roman Catholic Clergymen, who were
							sitting beside me under the gallery. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Webber the member from Dublin also made a long and passionate speech
							against the motion, but scarcely a word of it was to be heard; and his
							voice was finally drowned by the calls for the question from every part
							of the house. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grattan in his reply was
							greeted by the house much in the same manner. Little of what he said was
							heard; and less still was worth hearing. His manner was disgustingly
							fantastical and affected, and his argument weak and inefficient. He too
							was at last put down by the coughing and impatient calls for the
							question— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning came over and sat by me
							in Conversation about half an hour. The question was taken at two in the
							Morning, when we came away. The decision was against the motion 246 and
							222. In the year 1812 they lost the question by a majority of only
							4.</p>

							upon Government in two Volumes also written by him— I thought to have

							meant it for a present— I also took there two other new publications—
							The meeting between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bentham and Vaughan
							was marked with singularity. He began by making an apology to Vaughan
							for having never answered a Note which he had received from him. Vaughan
							invited him, with me and all my family to dine with him and <persRef
								ref="vaughan-sarah;vaughan-rebecca">his Sisters</persRef> next
							Friday at Clapham— I accepted but Bentham refused, and told Vaughan he
							would come to him some day to dine with him alone, upon a beefsteak, and
							to look over all his American Books— I asked of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Vaughan the way to the London Dock, where I was going to see
							the ship Washington; and both M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bentham insisted upon going with me.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan who was the principal person
							in founding and forming the Docks accompanied me all over the spacious
							warehouses now built upon them; after which I went and looked at the
							Ship Washington. She is a vessel of 308 tons registered tonnage, and has
							two Cabins capable of being fitted up with good accommodations for
							passengers. The <persRef ref="forman-jacob">Captain</persRef> promises
							to be ready to sail on the first of June. I engaged to give him my
							answer on Monday or Tuesday. As we were coming from the vessel <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> with <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> arrived to look at her. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Adams was satisfied with the prospect of accommodations—
							After taking a second turn, to view the warehouses which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan was anxious that we should all
							see, I walked back with him to his house, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bentham accompanied M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams—
							From Vaughan’s he walked with me, and left me at the Corner of Craven
							Street to go <pb n="188" type="ms"/>home and breakfast— It was between
							three and four O’Clock—he is upwards of seventy, and had walked at least
							twelve Miles— In the Evening I went with my three Sons to Covent-Garden
							Theatre and saw <persRef ref="shakespeare-william"
								>Shakespear’s</persRef> Coriolanus— The principal part performed by
								<persRef ref="kemble-john">John Kemble</persRef>; who after the
							close of this Season retires from the Stage. It was more than twenty
							years since I had seen him, and nearly thirty four years since I saw him
							first. He is still a favourite with the public, and retains the
							faculties of his mind; but the flesh is weak and exhausted. His lungs
							are no longer equal to the labours of a theatrical life— He is but the
							shadow of what he was— The Play was followed by a foolish farce called
							the highland reel. It was midnight when we came home.</p>

						<p><date>12. VII:30. </date>I received this morning a Note from a Lieutenant

								Macdonald</persRef> with a Volume of which he is the author
							addressed to the <persRef ref="monroe-james">President of the United
								States</persRef>, and a request that I would present it to him in
							his name. It contains a new and improved system of Telegraphic signals,
							which had been adopted in this Country, until since the Peace the
							Telegraphic communications have been altogether laid aside— Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Macdonald afterwards called upon me
							himself— I paid several visits with <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>; and called among the
							rest upon <persRef ref="bourke-edmund">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bourke</persRef>, the Danish Minister and <persRef
								ref="bourke-maria">his Lady</persRef>— We went with them and viewed
							his large Pictures, in Piccadilly. They are principally four very large
							Paintings of <persRef ref="rubens-peter">Reubens</persRef>, which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourke purchased, and brought with him
							from Spain— He says they were painted for the <persRef ref="philip-iv"
								>king of Spain</persRef>, while Reubens was Ambassador there, and
							the most perfect of his works— Every stroke of the brush having been by
							himself, while many of the Pictures that pass under his name were
							painted by his pupils and only retouched by him— The subjects are
								<persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef> offering tithes to <persRef
								ref="melchizedek">Melchisedek</persRef>, The Doctors of the Church;
							the four Evangelists, and the fourth I do not recollect— The figures are
							larger than life; or of what they call the heroic stature—
							Unquestionably very fine Pictures— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourke
							has them for sale, and has been endeavouring to dispose of them to the
							British Government. Disappointed in the expectation he had entertained
							that they would take them, he was desirous of convincing me that it
							would be highly to the honour and glory of the American Government to
							purchase them of him. He was sure if they should purchase them, the
							British Government would feel such extreme mortification at the idea of
							their being sent out of England that they would then purchase them at
							any price. They were at the least farthing worth five thousand pounds a
							piece; and he would not sell them for less here; but if the American
							Government would take the whole they should have them for fourteen
							thousand pounds.— Madame Bourke also joined her influence to that of her
							husband, to stimulate the liberality of the American Government. I am
							apprehensive that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourke will find it
							very difficult to disencumber himself of these precious beauties which
							he obtained doubtless at a price very different from his twenty or even
							his fourteen thousand pounds— There came while we were looking at the
							Pictures, a Frenchman named <persRef ref="u">Francillon</persRef> a
							dealer in these goods; just from Paris, not to buy but to sell Pictures.
							He has brought over a large and precious collection with him, and will
							sell them at auction in three weeks. <persRef ref="christie-james"
								>Christie</persRef>, the auctioneer, he said advised him against it,
							and told him there was no money. But he knew there was money; and we
							should see how his advertisements would set the heads in fermentation.
							And then he sat down, and took snuff, and told us the history of his
							life; and how he became first a Connoisseur and then a dealer in
							pictures— And how he had separated himself from <persRef ref="u">Madame
								Francillon</persRef>, and how he always had a fit of the asthma when
							he came to London. I came away and left him still telling his Story— I
							dined with my wife and <persRef ref="smith-john">Smith</persRef> at

						<p><date>13. VI:15. </date>We breakfasted early, and I went with <persRef
								ref="smith-john">Smith</persRef> to the Admiralty Court at Doctors
							Commons to hear the judgment of <persRef ref="scott-william">Sir William
								Scott</persRef> with regard to the admissability of <persRef
								ref="cochrane-thomas">Lord Cochrane’s</persRef> affidavit. Sir
							William had promised me at <persRef ref="villiers-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Villiers’s</persRef> to give me notice
							when the decision should be delivered, and last Saturday <persRef
								ref="slade-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Slade</persRef>, a
							Proctor of the Court, called while I was out and left a Note informing
							me that it would be this Morning at ten O’Clock. We went first to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Slade’s Office and he accompanied us to
							the Court— The judge read his decision which was in favour of the
							Admission of Lord Cochrane’s Affidavit— It was upon a question of prize
							money arising from the affair of Basque Roads. An affidavit of Lord
							Cochrane was material to the issue, and having been tendered, its
							admission was opposed by the king’s Advocate General <persRef
								ref="robinson-christopher">Sir Christopher <pb n="189" type="ms"
								/>Robinson</persRef> who was engaged on the other side. The
							objection was that Lord Cochrane having been judicially convicted of a
							fraud upon the Stock Exchange was incompetent to give testimony in any
							Court of Justice whatsoever. The judge after observing that this
							question came only incidentally before his Court; that it was a question
							strictly of the law of England, that it ought properly to be settled by
							the Courts of Common Law; that his Court was scarcely bound to know any
							thing of the peculiar Law of England, and that his decision would be of
							no authority in the Common Law Courts, proceeded to lay down as the rule
							of his judgment that he was bound to adhere to prior decisions, and
							could not go a hair’s breadth beyond them. He then took a historical
							review of the doctrine of incapacitation to give testimony resulting
							from a judicial conviction of ignominious offences. The principle of the
							elementary books was that persons convicted of the crimen falsi were
							incompetent to give testimony; but what was the crimen falsi? He then
							cited the definitions given by <persRef ref="coke-edward">Lord
								Coke</persRef>, <persRef ref="hale-matthew">Hale</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="hawkins-william">Hawkins</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="blackstone-william">Blackstone</persRef>, all of which he found
							loose and unsatisfactory. He inclined to think it always implied a
							falsehood accompanied by the sanction of an Oath. He next traced the
							series of decisions from the time when the incapacity was held to be
							derived from the nature of the punishment, namely the pillory until it
							was finally determined to proceed from the nature not of the punishment,
							but of the crime. He finally stated that he had found no case which
							would warrant him in rejecting the affidavit of Lord Cochrane; which he
							should therefore admit, and if his judgment was erroneous, it might be
							corrected elsewhere— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Slade had told me
							that it was expected the decision would have been the other way. Sir
							William’s extreme caution to disqualify and almost to disqualify his own
							decree, gave him very much the appearance of pronouncing it with
							reluctance. Nor did he forbear to cast out some insinuations, that Lord
							Cochrane ought not to have offered his affidavit, but to have proceeded
							in a form which would not have required it. Even after the affidavit was
							admitted a subsequent question was made by which it was rendered
							entirely nugatory.— The object of Lord Cochrane’s affidavit was to
							enable him to amend his libel, in which a material fact had been
							misstated, by the Advocate’s Clerk who drew it up— The motion upon the
							Affidavit was for leave to amend the libel. This was again objected to,
							and the question was argued for <persRef ref="gambier-james">Lord
								Gambier</persRef>, Lord Cochrane’s adverse party, by Sir Christopher
							Robinson, and <persRef ref="adams-william">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> William Adams</persRef>, our old associate at Ghent, and
							for Lord Cochrane, by <persRef ref="lushington-stephen">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lushington</persRef>, whom M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Slade mentioned to me as the most eloquent
							advocate at the bar, and by another. The judge decided that the libel
							should not be amended, because the other party had already answered it,
							as first drawn, and could not be put to answer again, and because Lord
							Cochrane was bound to know before the answer was given, what his own
							libel contained. The affidavit has been admitted said the judge, valeat
							quantum valere potest, but without the amendment of the libel I did not
							see how it could be at all available— We left the Court sitting, about
							noon, and returned home— I wrote despatch 79 addressed to <persRef
								ref="graham-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham</persRef> of
							the Department of State. Received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>
							at Liverpool, with an account of the American vessels now there, bound
							to the United States, but concluded to go by the Washington. <persRef
								ref="forman-jacob">Captain Forman</persRef> was here and I closed

								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, my <persRef
								ref="adams-john2;adams-charles2;adams-george">three Sons</persRef>,
							one man, and two woman Servants and myself. I am to pay him as for seven
							passengers at 37 guineas a head, and for all my extra baggage and
							furniture at two pounds Sterling the ton. My youngest Son, Charles, and
							the three Servants should according to the usual rules be paid for only
							as half passengers, so that I should have paid only for six full
							passengers; but the agreement is that we are to have the use of the
							after cabin exclusively to ourselves; and the freight for my furniture
							is at lower than the usual rate— The Captain of the Lorenzo, by which
							ship I had intended to send it, demanded three pounds a ton for it, and
							actually declined taking two Pounds ten shillings— There was a <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barry</persRef> here, who
							brought me Letters from <persRef ref="williams-samuel2">Sam<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Williams</persRef> and <persRef

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Villiers</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="ensor-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ensor</persRef>
							thanking them for the books they presented to me. <persRef

							the subject of the affair of <persRef ref="kosloff-nicholas"
								>Kosloff</persRef> the Russian Consul General at Philadelphia. He
							admitted that <persRef ref="dashkov-andrei">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Daschkoff</persRef> had extended rather too far the
							Consul’s claim to diplomatic privileges, and said they had been obtained
							for the Russian Consul here, <persRef ref="dubachevsky-andrei">M<hi

							Ambassador’s giving his name at the Office of the Secretary of State for
							foreign Affairs, as one of the persons attached to the Embassy; which he
							said they had done in consideration of his being an old public Servant,
							and from respect for his personal character— After dinner, I went with
							my Son John, and heard the debates in the House of Commons. The Saxon
							Minister, <persRef ref="dejust-william">Baron Just</persRef> came in
							while I was there. They were upon the army Estimates; a dull subject for
							an auditory. <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Croker</persRef> the Secretary
							of the Admiralty likewise came, and spoke to me. He was courteous in his

							other than as brothers. Croker’s real Sentiments with regard to America,
							are so well known, and he knows they are so well known, that I set down
							his kind words to me neither to the account of politeness nor of

						<p><date>14. VI:45. </date>The time appointed for my attendance at Carlton
							House was half-past two O’Clock; at which time I was there. I found
							there <persRef ref="chester-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chester</persRef> the assistant Master of the Ceremonies, and the
								<persRef ref="vonrehausen-gotthard">Swedish Minister Baron
								Rehausen</persRef>. Half an hour later <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> came, and we
							waited then an hour longer before it was announced to us that the
								<persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef> was ready. Lord
							Castlereagh first went in with Baron Rehausen who took leave, upon a
							permission of absence. He is going to Sweden upon that profession, but
							does not expect to come back again— While he was with the Prince,
							Chester remarked with a smile that it was a singular kind of life that
							the Regent led— That we had waited so long, because he had not risen
							when we came, and that he was scarcely ever out of his bed till three in
							the afternoon. Chester also enquired of me in what manner I should chuse
							to receive the usual present given to foreign Ministers on the
							termination of their Missions; which he said was for ambassadors one
							thousand Pounds, and for Ministers of the second order, five hundred. I
							told him that by the Constitution of the United States no person in
							their service was permitted to accept a present from any foreign
							Sovereign; and I must therefore decline any one that might be offered me
							here. He said that having had some idea of the existence of such a
							regulation in America he had made enquiries at the Office how the fact
							had been in the cases of former American Ministers, and had found the
							present had been in some instances accepted, and in others declined. I
							told him I supposed the cases of acceptance were prior to the
							Constitutional prohibition; that I must for my part decline it, and
							would explain to Lord Castlereagh my motives for so doing— He acquiesced
							in this with apparent cheerfulness though probably not without
							reluctance— The prohibition of the Constitution of the United States in
							this case has my hearty approbation, and I wish it may be inflexibly
							adhered to hereafter— The usage itself as practised by all the European
							Governments is in my judgment absurd, indelicate, with at least very
							strong tendencies to corruption— On the part of the United States there
							is a peculiar reason for prohibiting their Servants from taking such
							gifts, because as they never make presents to the Ministers of foreign
							powers, who have been accredited to them, there is not even the plea of
							reciprocity to allege for allowing it— For American Ministers to be
							receiving gifts from foreign Princes, whose diplomatic agents in
							America, never receive any thing in return, would exhibit them rather as
							beggars receiving alms, from opulent Princes than as the Independent
							Representatives of a high minded and virtuous Republic. The Governments
							of Europe are themselves becoming ashamed of this despicable custom.
								<persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> since
							his Resignation as Chancellor of the Russian Empire, has made up a fund
							from the value of all the presents of this kind that he had ever
							received, and made an appropriation of the whole, together with an
							additional sum from his own property to the publick service of the
							state; in aid of the pensions granted to invalid and wounded soldiers. I
							have a strong impression that the peculiar propriety of this patriotic
							sacrifice was suggested to him by the example of the principle
							established by this regulation in the Constitution of the United States.
							Lord Castlereagh in the course of his Negotiations at the Vienna
							Congress and at Paris, received twenty four snuff boxes, each worth one
							thousand Pounds Sterling, besides other articles equally costly; but
							even there, they at last found it necessary to put a check upon this
							market of snuff boxes, and dispensed with the presents in concluding
							some of the Treaties. <pb n="191" type="ms"/>The practice here is to
							give money, which has not even the palliation of sentimentality to plead
							in its favour; but as by the standing usage, ten per Cent from the
							Minister’s present, is deducted, as a douceur to the Master of the
							Ceremonies, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester was probably not so
							fully convinced of the propriety of the American principle as I was.—
							Immediately after Rehausen came out from the Prince’s Cabinet, I went in
							accompanied by Lord Castlereagh, and delivered the Letter of Recall. At
							the same time I told him I was especially instructed by the <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">President of the United States</persRef> to
							assure His Royal Highness of the earnestness of his desire that the
							relations between the two Countries, and the intercourse between the
							Governments should continue upon the most friendly terms. I was further
							ordered to say that an uncertainty in the President’s mind whether I
							should immediately return to the United States was the only cause which
							had deferred the appointment of a Minister to succeed me at this Court;
							and that such an appointment would be made with as little delay as
							possible. The Prince returned the assurances of his disposition to
							continue and promote the harmony between the two Nations, which he said
							was required by the true interests of both. There was no formality in
							the discourse on either side; and the generalities of friendly
							assurances were much alike, and estimated at their real value on both
							sides— The Prince immediately passed to Conversation upon other topics,
							and enquired who were the persons that would compose M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s Cabinet. I mentioned the names of
							the <persRef ref="crawford-william-harris">Secretaries of the
								Treasury</persRef>, <persRef ref="calhoun-john">of War</persRef>,
							and of <persRef ref="crowninshield-benjamin">the Navy</persRef>. He did
							not know either of them; but spoke in handsome terms as he had done at
							my first presentation to him, of <persRef ref="pinckney-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Pinkney</persRef> and of
								<persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								King</persRef>. He said <persRef ref="patterson-marianne">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Patterson</persRef> had told him M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pinkney was now a General in the Army. He
							asked also various questions respecting the organization of the American
							Government, and made his remarks upon it which were neither profound,
							ingenious, nor complacent— The character of this person is a composition
							of obtundity and of frivolity. He is a <persRef ref="falstaff-john"
								>Falstaff</persRef> without the wit and a <persRef ref="henry-iv"
								>Prince Henry</persRef> without the compunctions. His only talent is
							that of mimicry, which he exercises without regard to dignity or
							decorum, to the fitness of his own character or to the feelings of
							others. His supreme delight is to expose persons dependent upon him to
							ridicule, and to enjoy their Mortification. He seemed not to comprehend
							how it was possible to manage a Government where the members of the
							executive Government could not sit as members of the Legislature: and he
							thought the mode of communication between the Legislative and executive
							departments by the means of Committees was a sucking of brains on both
							sides which must encumber all public business, and increase all its
							difficulties. He spoke however in perfect good humour, and dismissed me
							as graciously as he had received me. It was almost five O’Clock when I
							returned home— There was yet the <persRef ref="charlotte2"
								>Queen</persRef> of whom according to the etiquette I was to ask a
							private Audience to take leave; but as she is much out of health, I
							desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester to take measures for
							having it communicated to Her Majesty, that I should be earnestly
							desirous of the honour of a private Audience, to pay my respects in
							person to her upon my departure; but that if it should put her to any
							trouble or inconvenience I should much rather make the sacrifice of my
							own gratification, and would pray her to dispense with the formality of
							an Audience, which I might be entitled to claim— <persRef
								ref="joy-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joy</persRef> was a

								ref="sharp-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sharp</persRef>,
							enclosing one from <persRef ref="mackintosh-james">Sir James

							this stated as a fact, and wished to ascertain its authenticity, with a
							view to notice it in the discussion of a motion which he proposes to
							make in the House of Commons, upon the Droits of the Admiralty— Received

							We went and viewed the spot where Ranelagh had formerly stood. It was
							once a place of highly fashionable resorts in the Summer Season; but was
							gradually deserted and at last totally broken up. I was there in the

							not seen the place since then till this day— Quantum mutatus ab illo—
							Instead of the splendid, company, the song, the dance, the festive
							banquet, the walls are down and removed, the spot is covered with grass,
							and the Cattle are feeding upon it. There is not even a window for the
							fox to look out at; nothing but furrows on the ground to shew the
							Rotundo upon which the building stood— It might serve as an illustration
							of <persRef ref="spencer-edmund">Spencer’s</persRef> Canto of

							The <persRef ref="augustusfrederick">Duke of Sussex</persRef> presided

							given, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pfeffel requested me to answer
							for him as well as for myself which I did— But the dulness of the day
							was sympathetic— I was also at the close of the Evening, urged and in a

							had nothing to say, and said nothing to the purpose— The party broke up

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rossi</persRef>, a Sculptor, who was
							going out to the United States with the view of obtaining employment in

								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh’s</persRef>, and
							introduced him, as charged with the business of the Legation of the

								<persRef ref="mackintosh-james">Sir James Mackintosh</persRef>; from
							whom I had received yesterday a Note requesting information concerning
							the restoration by the American Government, of British vessels seized in
							the Ports of the United States at the commencement of the late war. He
							wrote the Note before he had seen the answer I had written to that of
								<persRef ref="sharp-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sharp</persRef>— I now told him how the facts were. That the
							American Government had allowed British Subjects six Months from the
							Declaration of War, to remove their vessels and other effects;
							considering this as an indulgence usually allowed between Nations in
							modern times— That in some instances where the removal had not been
							effected in the six Months the liberal spirit of the Government had
							permitted the removal even after the expiration of the time— That under
							peculiar circumstances, one instance of a seizure had occurred, and in
							that case by the formal decision of a judicial tribunal the vessel was
							restored. I added that upon this state of facts, the <persRef
								ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert;russell-jonathan;bayard-james"
								>American Plenipotentiaries at the Negotiation of the Peace at
								Ghent</persRef> had been instructed to call upon the British
							Government to make restitution of the American Vessels which at the
							breaking out of the War had been seized in their Ports; but this demand
							had not been successful. The reasons assigned on the British part for
							rejecting it were, first, that all property afloat was at the breaking
							out of a <pb n="193" type="ms"/>war, lawful prize; and the secondly that
							the United States, by the declaration of War, were the aggressors, and
							thus had liberated Great-Britain from any Obligation to restore such
							property. Sir James observed that the first of these arguments might
							perhaps be urged, but the second was ridiculous. It was not the
							Declaration of War that constituted the aggressor and in all modern
							Negotiations for Peace, both parties were universally considered as
							standing upon equal terms. I said we had not thought either of the
							arguments well urged, but I had mentioned them to him as those which in
							point of fact, had been urged. The American Plenipotentiaries, had
							pressed the subject as far as it would bear; until they had no
							alternative but to abandon the demand, or break off the Negotiation upon
							it. Then it was of necessity given up. I would shew him the Notes that
							had passed between the Plenipotentiaries of both parties relating to
							this claim, but they were packed up with my other books and papers to
							take with me to the United States, and I had no access to them— He
							thanked me for the information I had given him, and said he should
							certainly make use of it, upon the discussion of his Motion— Returning
							home I stopped at the Bookseller’s <persRef ref="wetmoreandfenn">Wetmore
								and Fenn</persRef>, and bespoke a set of <persRef
								ref="pickering-danby">Pickering’s</persRef> Statutes at Large for

							answer in Crosby’s case; one from <persRef ref="cornelissen-edige"

								<persRef ref="eustis-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Eustis</persRef>, which came by the Post. One an official answer to
							the circular which enclosed the two Resolutions of the Senate concerning
							weights and Measures, and Navigation Laws; and the other about himself
							and his own wishes and intentions— He had written to ask leave to go
							home this Spring. The Government have instructed him to go home the next
							Autumn and leave <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Everett</persRef> in
							charge— Everett has already gone home, and Eustis says he will decline,
							and is not fit for the place— I know not what has passed between them,
							but they certainly did not agree— Eustis has objections to a Voyage in
							the Autumn, and wishes an option to stay until next Spring. I think
							there can be no difficulty in this: but perhaps he expects an answer
							which will enable him to judge whether there is a prospect of his being
							appointed to the Mission here. Such an answer I am not able to give.</p>

							quarter of an hour than any of the methods of pumping in use hitherto
							can draw in an hour. There was last year an invention of <persRef
								ref="perkins-jacob">Perkins</persRef> of Newbury-Port for the same
							purpose; but upon a different principle, &amp; Percival says this one
							has entirely superseded the other. The inventor of this box is a workman
							in the Navy-Yard at Charlestown—for whom a patent was taken out in the
							United States by <persRef ref="hull-isaac">Captain Hull</persRef>— One
							half the right of property in it was then purchased by a company in
							Boston for 28000 dollars; the use of the box has been introduced into
							all the ships of the Navy of the United States, and Percival comes from
							the Company to try their fortune for introducing it to the British Navy.
							He is also conditionally to take out a patent here; in case of success.
							But it being an expensive operation to procure patents for England,
							Scotland and Ireland, he has hitherto only entered a caveat, which

							therein differs from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bentham, who though
							of nearly the same years, is not so old a reformer, but is much more
							lively as a social companion. Major Cartwright however is a very

							occurrences in which the Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> had reason to
							distrust Grubb’s integrity— One of those Col<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi> Aspinwall told me of, and I now mentioned it to Grubb. He
							could neither dispute the facts nor explain them into a vindication of
							his conduct. He alledged his age—his family—his former connection with
							the consulate. I felt for his circumstances and lamented my inability to
							assist or relieve him— Grubb is unfortunately one of those men, whom
							kindness itself cannot relieve— On my arrival here two years ago, I had
							an opportunity of employing him, then knowing nothing against his moral
							character— I took him first, to write as a Clerk until the arrival of a
							Secretary of Legation, and then recommended him to Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Aspinwall for employment in the
							Consulate. These situations made him and his family comfortable, and it
							was of the utmost importance to him to retain the last. He had scarcely
							left my Office when I discovered that he had contrary to my most formal
							and positive injunction, taken money of Americans for getting their
							Passports through at the Alien-Office, or endorsed at the French
							Ambassadors. I should have been compelled to dismiss him from my Office
							for this had he not already left it. Similar irregularities have now
							thrown him out of his situation at the Consulate, and hard as his
							situation is, I cannot interfere in his favour— I hope he is not so
							unprincipled as Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> Aspinwall believes him,
							but I am afraid he cannot resist temptation— I had morning visits from
								<persRef ref="wilson-robert">Sir Robert Wilson</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="u">Tigère</persRef>, <persRef ref="percival-john">Lieutenant
								Percival</persRef>, and <persRef ref="reeves-john">J.
								Reeves</persRef>— Tigère who came to continue his chemical
							experiments with acids ink and paper finding company with me, promised
							to call and perform <unclear>them an</unclear>other day— I lent Sir
							Robert Wilson the pamphlet upon the Coalition and France. I went with
								<persRef ref="smith-john">J. A. Smith</persRef>, and <unclear>looked
								at the Courts</unclear> in Westminster Hall. The Exchequer and
							Chancery were shut— The Common Pleas were sitting, <unclear>but just
								about to a</unclear>djourn for the day; not engaged upon business of
							any importance. The Court of King’s Bench was so <pb n="195" type="ms"
							/>much crowded that no convenient place either for seeing or hearing was
							to be found. They were arguing upon motions, it being the last day of
							the Term. The Hall where the Court sits is so very small, that there is
							scarcely room for the judges, jurors, lawyers and Officers of the Court.
							It is the same with the other Courts— The gowns and wigs of the judges
							and lawyers give them a grotesque appearance— The only remarkable
							incident that occurred while I was there was an indication of the
							absolute, and domineering discipline of the Court, and the servile
							submission of the Bar. <persRef ref="chitty-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Chitty</persRef> one of the most
							eminent Counsel at the Bar, and author of several legal Treatises in
							high esteem was arguing with great temper and moderation a question
							before the Court, when <persRef ref="law-edmund">Lord
								Ellenborough</persRef>, the Chief Justice stopped him, asked him two
							or three questions which he answered with readiness and apparent
							candour; when Lord Ellenborough said; you have practiced a deception
							upon the Court— Chitty sat down immediately without uttering a syllable
							in reply. From the king’s Bench we went into the House of Lords, below
							the Bar— The <persRef ref="scott-john2">Lord Chancellor, Eldon</persRef>
							was sitting upon the woolsack, and there were six or eight peers
							present; coming and going; but the House was in Session. We heard the
							Oaths of allegiance and abjuration, administered to a number of
							foreigners who were to be naturalized, and saw the form of the delivery
							of several messages from the House of Commons. The same ceremony was
							repeated for every message. The folding doors of the House were thrown
							open, and the Serjeant at Arms, announced a Message from the House of
							Commons. Four or five members of that house then entered, one of them
							bearing Rolls of Parchment. They advanced up to the Bar, while at the
							same time the Lord Chancellor quitting the woolsack; and taking his bag
							in his hand, came down to it. There he received the Parchment Roll’s
							from the Member of the Commons who brought them, and who then with his
							companions withdrew, while the Chancellor returned to the woolsack— The
							folding doors were then closed and immediately afterwards opened again
							for another message in the same form— From the Lords I went into the
							House of Commons, and sat half an hour under the Gallery.— They appeared
							to be expecting an important debate, and there were an unusual number of
							members present for so early an hour; between 5 and 6. O’Clock— I soon
							left the House to go home to dinner— <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> had been down to the
							Ship, at the London Dock, with <persRef
								ref="adams-george;adams-charles2;adams-john2">the boys</persRef>, to
							see the progress made in fitting up the Cabins and Births for our

							and heard the debate upon <persRef ref="burdett-francis">Sir Francis Burdett’s</persRef> motion for the

							some difficulty that I obtained admission for my Son George. <persRef
								ref="patterson-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Patterson</persRef> was under the Gallery. We went in about eight
							o’clock, and found Sir Francis drawing towards the conclusion of his
							Speech which was cool, temperate, and much less animated than I had
							expected. He appeared as if overwhelmed by the Majority wh<unclear>ich

							<pb n="196" type="ms"/>would be against his motion in that house, and as

							a long, dull and heavy speech against it. This person has a high
							reputation for eloquence as an admiralty lawyer, but I was much
							disappointed in him as a Parliamentary Orator. There was no novelty and
							very little ingenuity in the argument with which he exhausted in an hour
							and a half the patience of the house. The calls for Question finally
							brought him down upon his seat again— <persRef ref="curwen-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Curwen</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="cochrane-thomas">Lord Cochrane</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="romilly-samuel">Sir Samuel Romilly</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="tierney-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tierney</persRef> spoke also in favour of the motion; and <persRef
								ref="ward-john3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John William
								Ward</persRef>, <persRef ref="lamb-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lamb</persRef>, and <persRef ref="wentworthfitzwilliam-charles">Lord
								Milton</persRef> against it. The most vehement and bitterest speech
							was made by Lord Cochrane, in favour of reform, and the most splendid
							and eloquent one against it by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward.
							Cochrane’s consisted of little more than sarcasm &amp; invective. Ward’s
							was in its principal parts prepared and doubtless composed beforehand.
							He was two hours in delivering it, and has certainly no natural fluency—
							He speaks slow, repeats the greater part of almost every sentence,
							utters the whole with much hesitation, makes wry faces and sucks
							Oranges. His speech however was as powerful an argument as the cause
							which he supports could produce— He gave a just and very severe
							character of the whigs or as they Style themselves the Moderate
							reformers in Parliament, who he observed were utterly disavowed and
							contemned by the radical reformers without doors— The real object of the
							Radical Reformers he said was a Revolution, the very idea of which was
							his abhorrence— To prove that Revolution was the object of the radical
							reformers he pulled from his pocket the book published last Saturday by
								<persRef ref="bentham-jeremy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jeremy
								Bentham</persRef>, called the Catechism of Reform, and read several
							passages from it, which excited great laughter in the house. He observed
							that the book having been put into his hands only this morning, he had
							not had time to read it, and the quotations which he read were adduced
							only to shew the tendency of the doctrines in the book. He spoke in very
							respectful terms of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bentham, both in
							regard to his abilities and his integrity. But this very book is the
							boldest and most vehement argument for radical reform that has yet
							appeared in print. Bentham told me that he had found some difficulty in
							getting it printed, and was finally obliged to put his name to it, which
							he had not intended. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward could not have
							chosen his proofs better than by quoting this book to shew that
							Revolution is the real object of the radical reformers. He read
							particularly one passage, where the author insists that the reformers
							ought to be satisfied with nothing less than the <hi rend="italic"
								>ascendancy</hi> of the democratic part of the Constitution— Ward
							declared himself satisfied with the Constitution as it is— He deprecates
							all experimental innovation. He is willing to judge of the tree by its
							fruits. He finds that this Constitution has raised England to greatness
							and glory; that it has led to the triumphs of her navy, and the
							victories of her armies— That it has raised her to high consideration
							and influence among the Nations of the Earth; and so riveted is he to
							all her institutions that in the system of her elections he considers
							Old Sarum as essential as Yorkshire— Sir Samuel Romilly, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tierney answered Ward, principally by
							personal reflections. Ward is what they call a Rat— He was formerly a
							whig and has turned Tory— Romilly said no other answer was necessary to
							his speech than a reference to his own speeches in former Sessions of
							Parliament— Romilly complained that it was unfair in Ward to read
							quotations from Bentham’s book but he did not shew why— I thought them
							very much to the purpose. With a high Panegyric of Bentham Romilly said
							he regretted exceedingly his having published that book. Tierney was
							also sarcastic upon Ward’s premeditated speech, and its inconsistency
							with his speeches in former times; but he did not answer it. He declared
							himself in favour of moderate reform, and of the present motion, though
							he had no hopes it would succeed; and he greatly lamented the excesses
							of the deluded radical reformers, because their effect was to render all
							reform impracticable. Sir Francis Burdett made no reply. The House was
							cleared for taking the question about two in the Morning when I came
							home— The motion was rejected by a majority of four or five to one.</p>

							This worthy man I am apprehensive labours under considerable
							embarrassment in his affairs. I had a morning visit from <persRef
								ref="wilson-robert3">Sir Robert Wilson</persRef> and his brother.
								<persRef ref="konig-fredrich">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Koenig</persRef> called upon me, and <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef> and I went with him and saw his new invented
							Printing Presses. There are three machines successively invented, &amp;
							which he calls the single, the double, and the completing machines. The
							second is an improvement upon the first, and the third upon the second.
							We first went to the Printing Office of the Times Newspaper, where they
							have two of the double machines. They strike of the newspaper by two
							operations—one side of the whole sheet at once— It requires three
							persons to attend each press two of them boys and they strike off nine
							hundred copies of each half sheet in an hour. The Press is worked by
							wheels, which are put and kept in motion by a steam-engine with a two
							horse power— They were printing an Evening paper called the <pb n="197"
								type="ms"/>Mail, published twice a week, for the Country; and struck
							off a number of copies while we were present. From thence we went to
							Bensley’s Printing Office, Blackfriars, near the Bridge; and there saw
							in operation the single machine or first invention, and the completing
							machine, the last of which strikes off by a single operation both sides
							of a sheet of Letter Press. Of these König professes that nine hundred
							copies can also be struck off in an hour, but that could not be done as
							usual and ordinary work. The process requires more time, than that of
							the double machine— But as the whole sheet is struck off at once, and as
							they use paper of double size, the machine can perform the work of eight
							Presses, and with three persons the labour of twenty. They were printing
							at <persRef ref="bensley-thomas">Bensley’s</persRef> the Evangelical
							Magazine, a Monthly Publication of which König told me that 22500 copies
							are sold— He also told me that one of his Presses would shortly be used
							for the Examiner Newspaper— The Machines are certainly well adapted to a
							large printing establishment, where there is constant employment for
							several Presses; but they are expensive. König asks £900 for a single,
							£1400 for a double, and 2000 for a completing machine; or a large
							annuity for the permission to use them— The Steam-Engine too is an
							additional expence. König returned with us and left me at Craven-Street.
							I dined with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>,
							and spent the Evening at the Danish Minister, <persRef
								ref="bourke-edmund">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>Trecchi</persRef>. This General Flahaut was at Berlin with <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-louis">Louis Buonaparte</persRef> in the year 1801. I
							then dined with them at Beumonville’s. Flahaut was little more than a
							boy, but a great favourite with the Ladies. He is now here in a sort of

						<p><date>22. VIII: </date>I took a walk this morning with <persRef
								ref="bentham-jeremy">J. Bentham</persRef> through Hyde Park and
							Kensington Garden, in the course of which I had much conversation with
							him upon his political opinions, and views, and upon the situation and
							Prospects of this Country. I mentioned to him the notice taken in the
							House of Commons of his Catechism of Reform, the Evening before last—
							The quotations and Comments of <persRef ref="ward-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward</persRef>, and the remark upon it
							of <persRef ref="romilly-samuel">Sir Samuel Romilly</persRef>— Bentham
							writes in a very peculiar style, and uses a multitude of words of his
							own coining— Ward said it was a sort of Lingua Franca; No language of
							itself, but a compound from various tongues, in which however an
							approximation of meaning was to be obtained— Bentham said that was a
							fair joke; with which he was very well pleased; but he always took the
							privilege of coining words when they were necessary to express his
							ideas— He was much obliged to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward, both
							for the respectful manner in which he had spoken of his personal
							character, which from him he had no right to have expected, and for the
							quotations which he had read from his book; because that would bring it
							more immediately into public notice— It was singular that the reference
							to the Book, should have been made from that quarter which was totally
							unexpected to him; while it had not been even mentioned by Sir Francis
							Burdett, from whom he had expected that something of it would have been
							said— But Sir Francis himself was not an efficient reformer. He was
							rich; his education had been bad. He was above all indolent— There was
							no steady reliance to be placed upon him. As to Sir Samuel Romilly, who
							was his intimate friend, he, Bentham, knew that he would not be pleased
							with the book. Romilly was a whig; and the whigs as a party were just as
							corrupt, and just as averse to reform as their adversaries. I told him
							with how much keenness and severity they had been characterized by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward; and he said they deserved it all. I
							then remarked to him upon the force with which M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Ward argued that the real object of the radical reformers
							was Revolution; and intimated to him my impressions that it was so. And
							recurring particularly to the passage of the Book, where the Reformers
							are exhorted to be satisfied with nothing short of democratic
							ascendancy, I asked him how he could reconcile that even with the sound
							theory of the British Constitution, which I conceived to be a balance
								<pb n="198" type="ms"/>between the Monarchical, Aristocratical and
							democratical branches forbidding the ascendancy of either of them. I was
							aware that he had ridiculed the idea of the balance, by referring his
							reader for it to mother goose, or mother Blackstone, still it was the
							theory of the English Constitution; and how could the ascendancy of the
							popular part of it be established without subverting the whole? He said
							the ascendancy of one part did not necessarily imply the destruction of
							the others. That in regard to religious affairs Protestant ascendancy
							was established by Law— Yet the Roman Catholic Religion was tolerated.
							As to ascendancy of one branch of the government over the others that
							existed in the present state of things; or rather the combination of the
							crown and the aristocracy overpowered the democracy to such a degree
							that the popular check upon them was a mere name— The Liberties of the
							Country were utterly gone— Gone forever, unless the ascendancy of the
							democracy could be substituted for that which now predominated— I told
							him I thought this neither demonstrated, nor necessary to the cause of
							reform— That the only principle upon which reform could be pursued
							distinctly from Revolution, appeared to me, to be that of restoring
							democracy to its equal share of power—of removing the existing
							ascendancy, but without substituting the other in its stead. I asked him
							whether he thought it possible for the monarchy &amp; aristocracy to
							subsist at-all, with his democratic ascendancy? He said he had provided
							for them in his book. The principle of the uti possidetis was a common
							basis for negotiation in international Law; he was willing to assume it
							as a principle of municipal Government. He would touch none of the
							privileges of the Peerage, and none of the prerogatives of the Crown,
							excepting that of creating new Peers at its pleasure. He would leave
							every one in possession of his own. I said that was very well, so far as
							his opinion, and conduct were concerned— But whatever might be the
							advantages of Reform, it must on the most favourable of all possible
							contingencies, be introduced by intrenching upon the principle of uti
							possidetis— It must take franchises or property from somebody. The
							disfranchisement of Old Sarum itself could not be effected, without
							violating the principle of uti possidetis— He to be sure would stop at
							the point where democratic ascendancy should be established; and then
							would let in the principle of uti possidetis to guard the remnant of
							power left to the Crown, &amp; the Peers—but let him suppose a
							Parliament assembled, with a reformed house of Commons possessing the
							ascendancy which his Book recommends— Did he think that house of Commons
							would feel themselves restrained from encroachments upon their
							co-ordinate but not co-equal authorities by his international principle
							of the uti possidetis? He did not maintain that they would— And what if
							they should put down the Crown and the Peerage said he? Is your
							Government in America the worse, for having neither king nor Lords? Or
							are you exclusively entitled to the enjoyment of good Government, and
							must you begrudge it to others? I said he was joking to escape from the
							consequences of his own argument. The question was not between the
							comparative merits of the British and American Governments but whether a
							radical reform in England does or does not involve an inevitable
							Revolution. I considered him now as having conceded that reform with his
							democratic ascendancy would lead to the abolition of the Crown and the
							Peerage. But these Institutions were too powerful and too deeply rooted
							to perish without a struggle; and what would be the consequences of
							that? He said probably a civil war; upon the whole it was likely that no
							great and real reform could be effected in England without a civil war.
							Corruption had so pervaded the whole Mass of the Government, and had so
							vitiated the character of the people, that he was afraid they could be
							purified only by fire. But any thing was better than the present state
							of things and that in which it must terminate, unless a vigorous effort
							on the part of the People should rescue them from that absolute
							despotism under which they are sinking.— From this conversation the
							inference is tolerably clear that M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Ward
							has not mistaken the views of the radical reformers. On returning home
							from my walk I had visits from <persRef ref="sousaholstein-pedro">Count
								Palmella the Portuguese Minister</persRef>; from <persRef
								ref="forbes-john">J. M. Forbes</persRef>, and from a <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burt</persRef> a Ship
							Carpenter, who has strong inclinations of removing to the United States,
							and who states himself to be a near Relation of <persRef

								Pinkney</persRef>. He is also the inventor of a machine for sounding
							at Sea, for which he has a Patent here; which has been considerably
							used, in the British Navy, and which he wishes to have introduced into
							that of the United States. This Evening I attended again the debate in
							the House of Commons. The House was thin, and the Subjects under
							discussion were not of primary interest. There was a Bill for regulating
							Extents in aid, upon which the Speakers were <persRef
								ref="vansittart-nicholas">Vansittart</persRef>, the Chancellor of

								<persRef ref="thompson-thomas2">Thompson</persRef> and Gurney, all
							Speakers of a subaltern Class. Then came a Bill, concerning the
							Residence of the Clergy; introduced by <persRef
								ref="mannerssutton-charles2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Manners
								Sutton</persRef>, who gave some explanations concerning it; in reply
							to remarks from <persRef ref="thornton-william3">General
								Thornton</persRef>— The House went into a Committee upon this Bill,
							and as there was no prospect of any animated debate, I came home about
							eleven—</p>

							Englishman called upon me with a complaint of having been plundered,
							while a passenger on board a Spanish vessel, by the Crew of a Privateer
							under the South American Insurgent Colours, but which he says was an
							American Vessel called the Romp, and fitted out at Baltimore. He has
							addressed a memorial concerning it to this Government, and <persRef
								ref="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef>
							is instructed to support his claim for indemnity. He left with me a copy
							of his Protest and requested my attention to the case after my return to
							the United States. This I promised, observing however that it appeared
							to be a transaction for which the American Government could in no wise
							be responsible. <persRef ref="joy-george">G. Joy</persRef> was here;
							projecting to go to Holland, when it is too late for his purpose.
								<persRef ref="boyd-john3">General Boyd</persRef> likewise came, and
							shewed me the papers relating to his claim upon the East-India Company.
							I had a visit from <persRef ref="bromfield-edward">M<hi

							I have known more than 35 years, first as a partner of <persRef

							at Amsterdam, and afterwards as partner with <persRef
								ref="rogers-daniel">D. D. Rogers</persRef>, neither of which
							connections were successful in business— He has since been settled here
							as a Merchant; alone—married here, and has now retired from business and
							lives at Cheltenham. The last time I had seen him was in 1796. when I
							dined with him, shortly after his marriage— I wrote to <persRef

								ref="ingraham-nathaniel2">N. G. Ingraham</persRef> the Consul at
							Plymouth, calling for explanations and vouchers to his Account lately

							by the necessity that I was under of declining it, <persRef
								ref="chester-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chester</persRef> would lose his usual portion of it. He said that
							if I was inclined to take it, I was entitled to it—not as a matter of
							favour but of right. I observed that the Constitution of my own Country
							was imperative in its prohibition; and left me no alternative. He said
							the East India Company allowed their Servants to take such Presents, but
							required that they should give credit for them in their Accounts— I then
							mentioned to him General Boyd, and his claim upon the East-India
							Company, with his desire to see and confer with his Lordship on the
							subject— He said he would be glad to see him next Thursday at 1/2 past
							eleven. At table we were entertained with <persRef ref="stewart-amelia"
								>Lady Castlereagh’s</persRef> female bull-dog Venom, and with the
							rejoycings and mutual gratulations of the company at the issue of an

							the interest and influence of <persRef ref="coke-thomas">M<hi

							table between Lady Castlereagh and Lord Ellenborough, to whom I spoke of
							his brother <persRef ref="law-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Law</persRef> at Washington. He had not heard from him for a long
							time, and appeared not to take peculiar satisfaction in being reminded
							of him— We left Lord Castlereagh’s between ten and eleven, went home and
							took up <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> and went to the
							French Play and Ball at the Argyle Rooms. This is one of the places of
							most highly fashionable amusement, where under the cover of a

							Country enjoy the luxury of seeing French Plays surreptitiously,
							illegally and very wretchedly performed; the <persRef

							grant them a licence. They were introduced under the patronage of
								<persRef ref="lieven-dorothea">Countess Lieven</persRef>, and the

							just begun: it was followed by La Jeune Femme Colère, and all the
							performers in both rather below mediocrity. After the Plays, commenced
							the Dancing. Waltzes and Quadrilles. The Rooms were crowded and warm to

								<persRef ref="bentham-jeremy">J. Bentham</persRef>. Since the second
							of our long walks we have fallen into one and the same track through
							Hyde Park and Kensington Garden. It makes for me a walk of about seven
							miles, and takes about three hours of my time. I now generally breakfast
							before going out. He says his mind is all the morning in a state of

								Burdett’s</persRef> first election for Westminster, of which it was
							the tenth Anniversary. It was attended by several of the whig members of

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brougham</persRef>— And they made
							speeches about reform and the purity of Elections. Bentham thinks very

							the most effective man to influence elections in all Westminster. He is
							a fashionable taylor, keeps a shop in Charing Cross, and is in very

							professional character, that he will not make a suit of Clothes for
							those who are his political associates. Bentham brought him one morning
							to my door in Craven Street, and introduced him to me there; but neither
							of them would come in— On returning from this day’s walk, I called to
							return Place’s visit, but he was not at home. I met <persRef
								ref="lieven-christopher">Count Lieven</persRef> almost at my door;

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> A Robertson</persRef>, a

								<persRef ref="sinclair-john">Sir John Sinclair</persRef>— This M<hi

								ref="robertson-alexander;robertson-archibald">two brothers</persRef>

							the late <persRef ref="fulton-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fulton</persRef>; and his brother wrote to consult him with regard
							to a design— But he said he had bethought himself to enquire what
							American had done towards erecting a monument to that character who was
							her greatest glory, and an ornament to human Nature, <persRef
								ref="washington-george">General Washington</persRef>. He was
							preparing a Letter to the <persRef ref="monroe-james"
								>President</persRef> and Congress of the United States upon this
							subject, recommending it to their attention and proposing a general
							subscription throughout the United States, to which every individual
							might contribute at his option; to defray the expence of a magnificent
							monument to General Washington. He should then propose to erect a
							building copied from the Parthenon of Athens, one of the noblest
							structures that had ever been raised by the hands of man; and of which
							he possessed a perfect model. He had proposed it, to the Committee for
							the Waterloo Monument; but they had thought proper to prefer a column.
							The next Nation to which he was desirous of offering his model after his
							own Country was the United States; for it would redound to the highest
							glory of any modern Nation, to shew their liberality of Spirit, and
							their taste in the Arts by erecting an exact imitation of the Parthenon—
							I scarcely knew whether this Gentleman was in earnest or jesting; but
							the solemnity of his manner, and the pride of taste with which he
							extolled his Parthenon, could not have been greater, if the design had
							been an original invention of his own. I told him that neither
							subscriptions nor Resolutions for Monuments to Washington had been
							wanting; and promised to call at his house and see his model of the
							Parthenon. <persRef ref="page-w">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							another, appointment, also merely temporary. Joy did not relish my
							advice, but he will follow it— <persRef ref="bentham-jeremy">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bentham</persRef> has a strong desire
							to obtain books and documents published in the United States, and
							relating to America. I have mentioned to him the obstructions thrown in
							the way of this species of literary communication by the English Laws,
							and particularly by the Post-Office regulations. He then proposed that
							this intercourse should be established by means of some bookseller, or
							publisher of a literary journal, and asked me, if I would see <persRef
								ref="phillips-richard">Sir Richard Philips</persRef>, the Editor of
							the Monthly Magazine, if he should call upon me. I willingly consented
							to see him, and he called upon me this Morning. Sir Richard Philips is a
							whig and a reformer, and a sort of republican; but most of all Editor of
							the Monthly Magazine. He said he had a correspondence already
							established in the United States for procuring American Books; but
							complained that they often sent nothing but trash which they could not
							dispose of there. He said the <persRef ref="watts-john">Editor of the
								Port Folio</persRef> had proposed an exchange with him of a certain
							number of copies of that publication, in return for copies of the
							monthly Magazine; which he would gladly agree to do, if he could have a
							prospect of disposing of the copies of the Port-Folio that he should
							receive— And in order to recommend it to English readers he was
							preparing an extract from it, to be republished in the next number of
							the Monthly Magazine— He gave me a proof sheet of this extract, which I
							had however not time to read. Sir Richard then proceeded to tell me,
							what exceedingly erroneous opinions, the English People entertained of
							the Americans; and how desirable it would be to spread more correct
							Notions upon the subject, among them. This might be done by a Daily
							Newspaper which should be published, and the expence of supporting <pb
								n="202" type="ms"/>which, should be defrayed by the American
							Government— Ten pounds a day, together with what would be collected by
							the daily sale of the Paper and for Advertisements, would be sufficient
							for that purpose. Less it could not, and more it need not cost. This was
							the only way in which it was possible to have such statements of facts
							and opinions generally circulated as might be favourable to America— The
							Times was a paper employed in that manner by the <persRef
								ref="louis-xvi">king of France</persRef>, and the Bourbon family;
							but it cost them much more. He verily believed that the downfall of
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Buonaparte</persRef> had been
							occasioned altogether by his having despised to employ such means. He
							himself had heard Editors of some of the Papers say “Damn him, why
							should not he be put down; he pays us nothing.[”] I could have no
							conception of the extent to which they carried this principle— There was
							not an individual who had a lawsuit or a case before a Magistrate to be
							reported, but must pay for it; on the penalty of having the statement
							made in the manner the most disadvantageous to him— I told Sir Richard
							that I was aware how little correct and just representation of American
							Affairs could obtain circulation through the English Press; but there
							could be no motive to the American Government, for spending money,
							merely to make impression upon the minds of the British Public, in
							relation to the United States— Even if there could, the sum that he
							spoke of would in the course of one year amount to more than I believe
							the American Government had expended for secret Service in time of Peace
							from the Establishment of the Constitution of the United States to this
							day— The money could not be expended; without its being at least known
							that so much had been expended in secret Service. It could not long
							escape discovery how and for what it would be expended; and once known,
							it would do more injury to the American Government, than a hired daily
							Newspaper in London could do them good in a century— Sir Richard said it
							was much to the credit of the United States to have spent so little
							money for secret Service; for it was one of the modes of extravagance in
							which the British Government had run to the worst excess. He had merely
							meant to suggest a mode of enlightening the public opinion here
							concerning America, if it should be thought advisable— He then asked me
							if I had ever taken an interest in the question so much and so often
							agitated in England; who was the author of Junius?— I said I had shared
							the public curiosity so much as to have read many of the speculations
							imputing those Letters to various persons; but I had not read the book
							lately published to prove that <persRef ref="francis-philip">Sir Philip
								Francis</persRef>. I had heard that the Evidence adduced in support
							of this opinion was very strong, but I had not examined it— He said that
							he had started another candidate, in the last Monthly Magazine a person
							named <persRef ref="maclean-lachlan">Lochlan M’Lean</persRef>— There
							would be more about him in the next number, and perhaps some information
							upon the subject might be obtainable from America— There was said to be
							a Gentleman in Virginia, who possessed Junius’s own copy of his printed
							Letters— He did not recollect his name, but would write it to me; and if
							I could hereafter give him any further information concerning this fact
							it would greatly oblige him— I promised him I would if it should be in
							my power— It was past two when Sir Richard left me, and a moment before
							he went away I recollected an appointment I had made with <persRef
								ref="sinclair-john">Sir John Sinclair</persRef> at half past one; a
							time that he had named in order that I might be present at a meeting of
							the board of agriculture. I went immediately to the house, but it was
							too late—the meeting was over. Sir John told me however that it had been
							very thinly attended and little or no business done. Two of the members,
								<persRef ref="young-arthur">Arthur Young</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="vaughan-robert">Sir Robert Vaughan</persRef> a welshman were
							still there. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Young is a very old man;
							upwards of eighty—and now blind: but he yet appears, cheerful; enjoying
							lively Spirits, and expressing his Sentiments with energy. I
							congratulated him upon the improvement of the agricultural condition and
							prospects of this Country; but he shook his head and said they were bad
							enough. America he added was the only Country in the world, enjoying
							happiness, and with prospects of greatness— Of too much greatness said
							he, if you should remain long united—but you will not— You will soon
							break up into several Governments. So extensive a Country cannot long
							remain under one Government. I told him I hoped we should prove to the
							world that it could, and that its greatness would be a benefit and not
							an injury to the rest of mankind. Sir John Sinclair gave me several
							Letters to correspondents in the United States, and shewed me some of
							their new invented implements of agriculture— I spoke of the hay-making
							Machine, of which <persRef ref="coke-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Coke</persRef> had spoken to me; Sir John told me that
							Sir Robert Vaughan, to whom he introduced me, was going immediately to
							several shops where they had them for sale, and advised me to go with
							him. I went accordingly; and Sir Robert Vaughan, a man of portly
							Stomach, after stopping to take an ice-cream, at a pastry Cook’s in
							Oxford, took me successively to four or five shops where I saw all the
							nick-nack machinery of English Agriculture— I saw several of the
							hay-making machines, but could not well judge of their usefulness. Their
							construction is of great simplicity. There were Ploughs and Churns in
							great numbers &amp; variety. Iron fences for farms, waggons, waterpots,
							and much costly trumpery, of which the usefulness is altogether
							questionable— Also samples of iron pavements and iron rail-ways. I was
							finally obliged by the shortness of time, to leave Sir Robert Vaughan in
							the midst of his machinery, and to call at <persRef
								ref="robertson-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> A.
								Robertson’s</persRef> in Gerrard Street, where I found again Sir
							John Sinclair, of whom Robertson is painting a miniature. I stopped
							merely to look at the <pb n="203" type="ms"/>model of the Parthenon, and
							told Robertson I would call upon him again to-morrow. I went home, and
							with <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> out to Ealing, and
							dined at <persRef ref="nicholas-george2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nicholas’s</persRef>. <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My

								>John</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>

								<persRef ref="u;u">Fletcher’s</persRef> and <persRef

						<p><date>28. VII:15. </date>Took the morning walk through Hyde Park, and
							Kensington garden, with <persRef ref="bentham-jeremy">J.
								Bentham</persRef>. I found he had already been informed of the
							conversation which I had yesterday with <persRef ref="phillips-richard"
								>Sir Richard Philips</persRef>, and he approved the answer which I
							gave to the proposal for setting up an American Newspaper in London. He
							said it was a foolish idea of Sir Richard’s, and he was very glad to
							hear that the American Government expended so little money upon secret
							service. He sent me some days ago a printed statement of the sums
							employed in that manner by the British Government, which amount to about
							half a million Sterling a year— On returning from my walk I found
								<persRef ref="williams-samuel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Samuel Williams</persRef> at my Office— I gave him an order upon the
								<persRef ref="baringbrothers">Brothers Baring</persRef>, in favour
							of <persRef ref="maury-james">Ja<hi rend="superscript">s.</hi>
								Maury</persRef>, to discharge his last Accounts of expenditures for
							destitute Seamen, and took of him a check upon his bankers, for my
							private account— On returning to the United States, I have after some
							hesitation concluded to take with me most of the household furniture for
							a family establishment at Washington. My final determination was
							contrary to my own sentiment of discretion and regard to economy, and
							solely in compliance with the inclinations of <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>. The expence in which
							it has already involved me is embarrassing to my Affairs. I have reason
							to fear it will be much more so, in America— I am also making
							considerable purchases of Books, for the State and War Departments; for
							most of which I employ a Bookbinder named <persRef ref="u"
								>Pratt</persRef> 20. Russell Court, where I called this day to
							bespeak a set of the new Editions of the State Trials and Parliamentary
							Debates— I called with <persRef ref="smith-john">Smith</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> upon <persRef
								ref="winthrop-john">Winthrop</persRef>, and with tickets that he had
							procured, went and saw the <persRef ref="levesongower-george">Marquis of
								Stafford’s</persRef> collection of Pictures, said to be the most
							precious private collection in England— They are all of the Italian,
							Spanish, French, Dutch and Flemish schools— No English Pictures; of
							which there are a number in <persRef ref="grosvenor-robert">Earl
								Grosvenor’s</persRef> collection. The Apartments are larger and more
							magnificent than Lord Grosvenor’s and there are perhaps a greater number
							of Pictures by the first Italian Masters; but the general effect of the
							collection, and the particular impression of some individual pictures
							was greater upon my mind, at the view of Lord Grosvenor’s house last
							Summer, than at that of the Marquis’s now. The apartments were crowded
							with visitors, and we met several persons of our acquaintance— Among the
							rest <persRef ref="carr-colston">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Carr</persRef>, the rector of Ealing and <persRef
								ref="carr-frances;carr-sophia">his two daughters</persRef>— From
							thence I went and called upon <persRef ref="robertson-andrew">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Robertson</persRef>; viewed his model
							of the Parthenon; and told him it had been already copied in the riding
							school of the horse guards at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Petersburg; a piece of information which appeared to surprize more than
							it pleased him. I dined at the <persRef ref="desousaholstein-pedro"
								>Portuguese Minister Count Palmella’s</persRef>, with a diplomatic
							company; about twenty-persons; among whom was <persRef
								ref="smythe-percy">Lord Strangford</persRef>— Accounts have within
							these two or three days been received of an insurrection at Pernambuco
							in Brezil. The information leaves it uncertain how far it has extended.
							Count Palmella and Lord Strangford are both of opinion, that it could be
							neither extensive nor formidable to the Government. They say there was
							neither the cause; nor the materials for a dangerous revolt— No signal
							misgovernment; no general discontent; <persRef ref="dumouriez-charles"
								>Dumouriez</persRef> however in the last conversation that I had
							with him spoke otherwise, and predicted a dangerous insurrection in
							Brezil.— I agreed with Count Palmella to call upon him next Monday at
							one, and with <persRef ref="esterhazy-paul">Prince Esterhazy</persRef>
							to receive him at Craven-Street next Sunday at Noon— I received Letters
							this day, from <persRef ref="fox-robert">R. W. Fox</persRef>, enclosing

							has invented of pickling herring, pronounced as he says to be much
							superior to the Dutch fashion— He received a prize medal for it, at the

							the <persRef ref="augustusfrederick">Duke of Sussex</persRef> presided;

							that whatever my advice should be he would not go, and thinking it
							proper that he should settle with <persRef ref="forman-jacob">Captain

							instances I have met with in life, of men, not deficient in
							Understanding, but whose wits are buried in self-delusion. I did not
							flatter his expectations, but he will not easily resign them— I had
							named this day at five O’Clock for <persRef ref="ogilvie-james2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ogilvie</persRef> to call upon me. He
							came between six and seven, just as we were sitting down to dinner, and

							with us to Rossi’s, who shewed us many of his models and designs and the

							greatest work, is the Monument of <persRef ref="cornwallis-charles"
								>Marquis Cornwallis</persRef>, erected by the East-India Company, in

							The first time that he sat; it was for about twenty minutes— After that

							about dogs and horses— We returned home with M<hi rend="superscript"
