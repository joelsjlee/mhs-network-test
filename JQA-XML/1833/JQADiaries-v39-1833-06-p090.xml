						<p>I finished this morning the first weeding of my Nursery for the Season:

								Whitney</persRef> preached from Luke 23.46. “And when Jesus had
							cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my
							Spirit; and having said thus, he gave up the Ghost.”— He administered
							the Communion, and his afternoon text was from John 14.23. “Jesus
							answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my
							words”—upon which he delivered a very earnest exhortation to his
							Christian hearers, to join in communion with the Church— This would have
							been a very proper subject for the morning’s discourse— Instead of which
							he introduced into that a very strange argument in mitigation of the
							crimes of <persRef ref="judas-iscariot">Judas Iscariot</persRef>, which
							he represented as having been exaggerated— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Whitney did not intend to justify Judas Iscariot, but he
							does not believe in eternal punishment— His object was to urge that
							punishment less than everlasting torment may atone even for his crimes—
							But to extenuate the crime, is not the most discreet or rational means
							of obtaining remission of the punishment.— I read the fourth Sermon of
							the third volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, upon
							the sublimest devotion— An ingenious and learned discourse upon
							enthusiastic Religion—one of the remarkable vagaries of the human mind—
							Saurin disapproves of mysticism, and fanaticism; but recommends
							religious fervour scarcely falling short of them. <persRef

								Adams</persRef> were here at tea— <persRef ref="angier-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Angier</persRef> returned to Medford
							this Morning. Towards Evening I took a turn in my Garden and Nursery—
							Found a number of the Elm seeds which I had planted on the 16<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May, coming up. This experiment is
							now thus far complete— The seeds should be gathered as they fall from
							the trees, from the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May to the 1<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of June— Sown immediately in loose
							ground and barely covered with Earth— The seed leaves that come up are
							scarcely perceptible— Not larger than those of chickweed— How they will
							stand the heat of the Sun is next to be seen. <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">Price Greenleaf’s</persRef> grafts of the
							present year, and his buds of August 1831 are vegetating with great
							promise. I found also in one of my boxes, a seed of the honey locust,
							which has been two years in the ground coming up— And in the garden, one
							new Oak.— The Apple seedlings of the present year, will all perish
							unless sheltered from the Sun.</p>

							signed M, and no doubt written by herself—a French Translation in
							Manuscript of the Harper’s Song in Dermot, and the arguments of the six

							afternoon in my garden, and gathered a parcel of Elm Seeds under the
							Trees. Having ascertained that they come up freely, I would now collect
							a large parcel to plant them, though I believe it now too late— I found
							on the largest of the Cherry trees that I have raised in the garden
							Nursery, Myriads, perhaps hundreds of thousands of a small black louse
							or fly, and the same leaves covered with black Ants— Here and there a
							seedling Oak is coming up, of the many hundreds which I planted last
							Autumn— Almost all my seedling Apples of the present year, are scorched
							to death by the Sun— The Cherries follow to like destruction—it is
							doubtful whether one of either kind will be left— The wild cherry bears

						<p>The first seedling Apple-tree that I had observed on my return here, just
							out of the ground was on the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of April.
							It had grown slowly but constantly since, and had put out five or six
							leaves— Last evening after my return from Boston I saw it, perfectly
							sound— This morning I found it broken off, leaving one lobe of the seed
							leaves, and one leaf over it— This may have been the work of a bug, or
							perhaps of a Caterpillar— It would not be imaginable, to any person free
							from hobby-horses, or fanciful attachments, how much mortification such
							an incident occasions— <persRef ref="saintevremond-charles">S<hi

							induced exorbitant attachments to insignificant objects— My experience
							is conformable to this— My natural propensity was to raise trees—fruit
							and forest, from the seed— I had it in early youth, but the course of my
							life deprived me of the means of pursuing the bent of my inclination.
							One Shellbark walnut tree in my garden, the nut of which I planted 8.
							October 1804. and one Mazzard Cherry tree in the grounds North of the
							The Stone of which I planted about the same time, are the only remains
							of my experiments of so ancient a date— Had my life been spent in the
							Country, and my experiments commenced, while I was at College—I should
							now have a large fruit garden; flourishing Orchards of native fruit, and
							very valuable Forests— Instead of which, I have a Nursery of about half
							an Acre of ground; half full of seedlings from five years, to five days
							old; bearing for the first time perhaps twenty peaches, and a few
							blossoms of <pb n="93" type="ms"/>Apricots and Cherries, and hundreds of
							seedlings of the present year, perishing from day to day, before my
							eyes— I worked three hours of this Morning, and planted a long row in
							the garden of wintered walnuts, cherries [symbols] and Elm seeds— Of
							these planted between the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 25<hi

						<p>Weather variable— Light showers morning and Evening; and so cold that we
							had fires in the dining room and bed-chambers—but not in my
							writing-chamber— I spent almost the whole morning in my Nursery, and the
							afternoon in the Garden. In weeding with the hoe, I work to produce a
							streaming perspiration, and think its effect very favourable to my
							health. The labour is its own, and almost its only reward. I am
							preparing the patch at the bottom of my nursery, already covered with
							young Elms and English Oaks, to plant seeds in the rows between them for
							the benefit of the shade when they come up— At least three fourths of
							all my Apple-seedlings of this year have perished for want of shade—
							Many cherries have had the same fate— This afternoon, I deposited an
							Earthen Pot at the west end of my garden, with four white ripe
							Strawberries, and I propose to multiply the experiment of raising
							Strawberries from the Seed— In the same pot I also planted 6 Steeped
							Cherries— From the young Apricot tree there, I took out a large white
							worm. A few of the Elms which first came up, are putting out their
							second set of leaves, but are yet no bigger than a pin’s head. Among the
							vegetations of this year, is here and there a grape and a currant— The
							damp weather gave me a rhumatic head-ache, which disqualified me much
							for reading or writing.</p>

							that was my full proportion; and I added that I was not altogether
							satisfied with the manner in which the first contributions had been

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bryant thanked me for the assistance

							against the Government, and which was refused upon a senseless opinion
							given by the <persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">Attorney General Roger B.
								Taney</persRef>— This afternoon a man alighted at my house from the
							Stage, and directed the Stageman to call for him here, next Monday
							Morning— He came in and announced himself as an old and very intimate
							acquaintance by the name of <persRef ref="u">Hart</persRef>— I
							recognized neither him nor his name— He said his intimacy with me had
							been at <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Macqueen’s</persRef> house at the Hague in 1795 and 1796 and 7. It
							was with my brother <persRef ref="adams-thomas">Thomas</persRef>; whose
							intimacy at Macqueen’s I well remember, but in which I had no
							participation— I saw Macqueen several times; but never was at his house—
							Macqueen was an Englishman who kept a jewellers shop— Holland and
							Great-Britain were then at War, and as Minister from the United States I
							purposely abstained from frequenting an Englishman who was allowed to
							reside and keep his shop there; but was regarded with some Suspicion—
							Macqueen had a handsome and lively <persRef ref="u">wife</persRef>, and
							my brother was less scrupulous of acquaintance than I was. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hart upon finding that he had now mistaken
							me for my brother, said that he recollected me— That my brother had
							introduced him to me, and he had then a project for coming to America
							and establishing a glass manufactory here—concerning which he had then
							consulted me— He said he had since then lived in various
							countries—particularly many years in France; before and after the
							downfall of <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef>— That
							he had now been about five years in this Country, with which he was
							delighted— That he resided at New-York, but had recently come from
							Canada. That he now contemplated establishing a new manufactory, in
							Boston or its vicinity, of Files, Saws, and Pins; but it was a great
							undertaking and would require a large capital, and an associated
							company— I asked him if he knew any thing about the present condition of
							Macqueen or his family. He seemed unwilling to speak of them— He said
							there had been irregularities in the family— That Macqueen’s wife had
							left him and gone off with a <persRef ref="u">Captain
							Stofford</persRef>, Captain of an English small vessel of War, lost on
							the Coast of Holland, and whom he had often met with my brother at
							Macqueen’s— I remembered my brothers having repeatedly spoken to me of
							this Captain Stofford. I mentioned that Macqueen came to see me when I
							was at Ghent in 1814—and complained of having been severely persecuted
							and abused—and that he was then poor and miserable— I find in my
							Letter-book of that time a Letter to my brother of 17. September 1814
							giving him an account of Macqueen’s visit to me, and of his complaints—
							His wife was then with him— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hart
							that my brother died in March of last year; and I regretted his
							disappointment, on learning that his old friend was deceased, and I felt
							some mortification that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harts account of
							his own adventures for the intervening forty years since his
							acquaintance with my brother, and his present speculative objects, with
							some apparent unwillingness to speak of his present Situation, prospects
							and connections in this Country, did not encourage me to offer him those
							hospitalities which he seemed confidently to have expected from my
							brother— After about half an hour’s conversation, he enquired the way to
								<persRef ref="u">French’s</persRef> Inn, to which he proceeded—
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>Called from my Nursery and Garden by a visit from <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Quincy</persRef>, President of Harvard University— I asked him when it
							was proposed to appoint a Professor of Natural History— He said the fund
							bequeathed by <persRef ref="fisher-joshua">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Fisher</persRef> had not been received, two of the
							Doctor’s relatives being authorised by his Will to retain the use of the
							fund, for one year after his decease. I mentioned to him the desire of
								<persRef ref="waterhouse-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Waterhouse</persRef> to obtain this appointment, of which he said he
							had not been informed— He was apprehensive that D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Waterhouse would be thought too old— I suppose him to be
							about 76. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy thought <persRef
								ref="nuttal-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Nuttall</persRef>, the curator of the Botanic Garden, must necessarily
							be the person chosen, but said <persRef ref="harris-thaddeus2">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef> now the Librarian had
							also been mentioned— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nuttall is now in
							Europe, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy had been longer
							without hearing from him than he thought proper— He told me also that as
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef> is about
							visiting Boston, the Corporation of the University had thought it
							necessary to invite him to visit the Colleges—that he M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy should address him in a Latin
							Discourse; and confer upon him the degree of Doctor of Laws— And he
							intimated that I should receive an invitation to be present at these
							ceremonies— I said that the personal Relations in which President
							Jackson had chosen to place himself with me were such that I could hold
							no intercourse of a friendly character with him— I could therefore not
							accept an invitation to attend upon this occasion— And independent of
							that, as myself an affectionate child of our alma Mater, I would not be
							present to witness her disgrace in conferring her highest Literary
							honours upon a barbarian, who could not write a sentence of Grammar, and
							hardly could spell his own name. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy
							said he was sensible how utterly unworthy of Literary honours Jackson
							was; but the Corporation thought it was necessary to follow the
							precedent, and treat him precisely as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe his Predecessor had been treated— As the People of the United
							States had seen fit to make him their President, the Corporation thought
							the honours which they conferred upon him were compliments due to the
							Station, by whomsoever it was occupied— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Quincy said it was thought also that the omission to shew the same
							respect to President Jackson, which had been shewn to <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>,
							would be imputed to party Spirit, which they were anxious to avoid— I
							was not satisfied with these reasons, but it is college ratiocination
							and College Sentiment— Time serving and Sycophancy are qualities of all
							learned and Scientific Institutions— More than 50 years since the
							College gave this degree of Doctor of Laws to a Frenchman by the name of
								<persRef ref="devalnais-joseph">Valnais</persRef>, about as fit for
							it as Andrew Jackson— Valnais was the first French Consul at Boston, and
							the People were so tickled with the glory of having a Consul to reside
							among them, that <persRef ref="cooper-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Cooper</persRef> prevailed upon the then Corporation to
							make him a Doctor of Laws. I had some good humoured discussion with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy upon this occurrence, but adhered
							to my determination to stay at home— <persRef
								ref="foster-james;foster-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Foster</persRef> were here this
							afternoon— They had been to <persRef ref="greenleaf-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Greenleaf’s</persRef> to see
								<persRef ref="cranch-william">Judge Cranch</persRef> but he was gone

						<p>The weather is cloudy with occasional sprinklings of rain, not sufficient
							to lay the dust in the Streets. The drought here is already great, but
							with prospect of continuance months longer— The grass crop is already
							diminished by nearly one half from its usual produce— There is
							appearance that the corn, crops will largely fail— The coolness of the
							atmosphere and a beclouded Sun, have hitherto saved and spared much of
							the vegetation, but their deficiencies will very soon be distressing— I
							laboured morning and afternoon upon my Garden and Nursery, and am
							undertaking to get out a few more rocks from the Soil— My seedling
							Strawberries, raised in an Earthen Pot, are now bearing; and ripening—
							They are of the same kind with those planted for seed— I therefore now
							plant—the white and red of the garden—the Downton, the Kean Seedling,
							the Garden Railway Seedling; the Medford, and the Nursery Seedling—
							Seven different kinds, with the design, if life and health allow to
							ascertain which of them will vegetate, and which of them produce their
							kind— I am also now planting Cherry Stones from the Cherry trees, just
							now ripening in the Garden said to be the Kentish Cherry—or the red
							Morella. I have at least one hundred elms, growing from seeds planted
							since the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May— I have seven Earthen
							Pots, one Quart Tumbler, and one green wooden flower-box all planted
							with Seeds— My buds, grafts, and Seedling Trees in the Nursery and
							Garden, amount to several hundreds, and promise fruit,which a very few
							of them begin to bear.— The second shoot of the red Oaks, is already
							putting forth; I find only one black Oak that has it— The shoot from the
							Nettle-tree, which I headed down as dead, has grown fifteen inches, but
							a weed is the Antaeus of gardening— The beetle bug has topped one of my
							four beautiful Ashes, and of course arrested its growth— I linger over
							these things morning and afternoon, till the half days are inexcusably
							wasted—and I do nothing else.</p>

						<p>I rose before four O’Clock—the day was cloudy and cool, with a frequent

								ref="walter">Walter</persRef><space/>this morning take out a rock at
							the lower part of my Nursery, which must have weighed at least three

								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston, and returned

								<persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull</persRef>, the Cadet at West

								Wilde</persRef> of Braintree came to mention a project of some

							Capen’s lane; to shorten the distance and wind round the hill instead of

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wildes object was to ascertain whether if
							it should be undertaken, I should expect payment for my land which would
							be taken, and the cost of fencing it— I told him I thought I should, but

							for the road— He said the Commissioners were to survey the grounds next

						<p><date>22 IV:10 </date>Saturday.</p>
						<p>There were copious showers in the Night, which relieved the vegetation
							for a few days from its perishing condition, and saved me no small
							number of seedling trees— I found a large breach this Morning in the
							Western Wall of my Nursery near the old, central Apple-tree. It had
							fallen in since last evening, and crushed a young Horse Chesnut and a
							Hickory-Walnut-tree— <persRef ref="kirk-john;walter">My two
								men</persRef> soon put up the Wall again, and then by my direction
							took out two rocks weighing each from 3 to 400 pounds from the bearing
							ground— I had their places filled up with old manure from the Garden— I
							planted a row of 60 Garden Cherry Stones on the Eastern border of the
							patch opposite to the Nursery gate, and behind them at proper intervals
							a Medford—a Downton—a Nursery Seedling, and a Kean Seedling Strawberry—
							Marking the places where they are planted with Stakes and inscribed
							Stones. I found 3 new Seedling trees just up, not knowing what they are—
							My Elm seeds have come up more freely than any others that I ever
							planted— I had my patch of Railway wild Strawberry plants at the
							entrance of the Nursery Gate spaded up. It was over spread and smothered
							by clover grass— This experiment has failed, and shews that the
							transplantation of the plant of the wild Strawberry does not improve its
							fruit— I devoted the afternoon to writing. Received a Letter from
								<persRef ref="robb-john">John Robb</persRef> acting Secretary of
							War; with Certificates of Pensions for <persRef ref="loud-david">David
								Loud</persRef> and <persRef ref="hayward-daniel">Daniel
								Hayward</persRef>, each for 80 dollars a year from 4 March 1831 and
							remarks upon several other applications— There was much cannonading this
							afternoon, at the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President’s</persRef>
							reviewing of the Military companies in Boston. The distant Report of
							them gave me a double relish for the solitary tranquility of my own
							occupations— No period of life has ever yielded me so much quiet
							contentment, as that which I enjoy with my family in health about me,
							totally uninterrupted by visitors, and cultivating in such health as I
							have, my Seedling plants and trees; labouring bodily from three to four
							hours a day, upon horticultural experiments, all hitherto fruitless; but
							some few of them beginning to promise fruit— Alteri Seculo is the motto
							of all my plantations; but I am yet sensible and conscious that this
							life of pleasure is not a life of profit.</p>

							is—joy.[”] I had never heard him before— His voice is not good and his
							articulation is indistinct; but the composition of his Sermons is very
							good, and his afternoon discourse was occasionally pathetic— Religious
							sentimentalism, is the most common characteristic of the writings of the

							the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>; upon the difficulties of the
							Christian Religion— An argumentative disquisition—very elaborate and

							Popery and Infidelity—in all of which he insists there are greater
							difficulities than in Christianity— His greatest Labour is to prove the
							propriety of believing the Trinity and rejecting Transubstantiation— I

							an excellent cherry, and I wish if possible to raise trees from its
							stones— I gathered a large number of them from the trees; but of these
							at least four out of five float in water, and their kernels wither and
							shrivel in the shell without ripening.— This happens to almost all

								>Charles</persRef> at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg—the
							deep anxiety and almost despondency with which I looked forward to the

							whole term of our residence there—the comfort and tranquility, and
							friendly hospitality which marked the mode of existence of the People,
							the trying struggles and collisions, with the British Commissioners, and
							with my own colleagues which I underwent; the success beyond my most
							sanguine expectations which closed the Negotiation and the subsequent
							signal discomfiture of a dark conspiracy there concerted against my
							character and good name have endeared that period of my life to my
							memory beyond any other— I arrived at Ghent, in company with <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">Jonathan Russell</persRef>, who then <pb

						<p>The Sun rose and sat perfectly clear; but there were heavy Showers before
							noon. I was working in my Nursery, till <persRef
								ref="waterhouse-benjamin">Doctor Waterhouse</persRef> came and dined
							with us— The Doctor is now near fourscore years of age—and his
							Constitution seems to be breaking up. He told me that he had never felt
							the effects of old age so much, as within the last six Months, and that
							this would probably be the last visit he should pay me— He found it
							troublesome to go so far from home, and must soon shut himself up and
							keep house— He was however present yesterday at the ceremony of
							conferring the Degree of Doctor of Laws upon <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President <pb n="103" type="ms"
								/>Jackson</persRef>, and was much captivated by the ease and
							gracefulness of his manners. He shook hands with him twice, and told him
							he had heard of him many years ago; and was very glad to take him by the
							hand now— But he says Jackson is so excessively debilitated that he
							should not be surprized if he should never reach Washington again— I
							believe much of his debility is politic—part his own policy to suit his
							returns of civility to his own convenience, and pleasure, and part the
							policy of his physicians, pour se faire valoir— He is one of our tribes
							of great men, who turn disease to commodity, like <persRef
								ref="randolph-john">John Randolph</persRef>, who for forty years,
							were always dying— Jackson ever since he became a mark of public
							attention has been doing the same thing— He is so ravenous of notoriety,
							that he craves the sympathy for sickness as a portion of his glory— He
							is now alternately, giving out his chronic diarrhea, and making <persRef
								ref="warren-john">Warren</persRef> bleed him for a Pleurisy, and
							posting to Cambridge for a doctorate of Laws, mounting the monument of
							Bunkers Hill to hear a fulsome address and receive two Cannon-Balls from
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef>, and riding
							Post to Lynn, Marblehead and Salem, receiving Collations, deputations
							and addresses at them all, in one and the same day—four fifths of his
							Sickness is trickery, and the other fifth mere fatigue— He will drag
							himself along in this way—disconcerting all the costly arrangements for
							his reception—disappointing three fourths of the People, male and
							female, who are agonizing to see him, and boast all their lives of
							having shaken hands with him, and finally crawl back to Washington,
							perhaps shut himself up one or two days, and then come forth in the
							Globe; never in better health and Spirits and determined to live these
							twenty years— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Waterhouse discussed the
							propriety of the University’s conferring upon him a Doctorate of Laws— I
							said a Doctorate for which an Apology was necessary, was a cheap honour,
							and that I thought it a Sycophantic compliment— The Doctor said it was
							thus truly characterised— He consulted me upon a point of some delicacy—
							He has received confidential Statements which he believes true, that one
							of the teachers of the University has a secret and infamous vice— Is it
							his duty to expose the man? I told him I thought the <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">President of the University</persRef> ought to
							be apprized of the facts— Whether <hi rend="italic">he</hi> should tell
							him or not, depended upon the question, whether his relations with the
							inculpated party were or were not such that his information might be
							imputed to personal enmity— If not, he should make the communication
							confidentially— If they were, he might advise the person who made the
							Statements to him, to make them to President Quincy— This was my advice—
							The Doctor left us at four O’Clock to return home— <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;adams-abigail4">Our Ladies</persRef>
							went to Weymouth and took tea with <persRef ref="tufts-mercy2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tufts</persRef>— I walked to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy’s gate, and observed his Hedge of
							Scotch Hawthorn in full blossom— I am adopting the practice of ticketing
							my seedling plants upon small Stones. <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> went to Boston and returned to dine.</p>

							Volume upon Proverbs 23.23—the purchase of Truth. In general the

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel Sewall</persRef> read at the
