						<p>Thick foggy morning. Cleared away by noon, and almost Summer warmth the
							remainder of the day— From noon till past three O’Clock we had a
							succession of visitors— A few members of Congress—a few members of the
							foreign Legations, and a few private Citizens— In all perhaps a hundred
							persons—very few Ladies; <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> being known to be

								Webster</persRef> who arrived and took his seat in the Senate,

								>All the other members present</persRef>— There appears to be no
							disposition in the Committee now to do any thing. I brought up again my
							proposed Resolution to call upon the <persRef ref="mclane-louis"
								>Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, for an estimate of the
							deficiency in the Revenue, and of the increased expenditure to be
							expected in the event of the collection of the impost’s being suspended,
							and of resistance to the execution of the Laws in South-Carolina. John
							S. Barbour discussed the point principally with me—all the other members
							were against me, except D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Condict; who said
							nothing; but urged me to offer my proposition as a Resolution in the
							House— There was some talk among the members of making a Report to the
							House, approving or disapproving the Bill, reported by the Committee of
							Ways and Means. Findlay said he thought this Committee would have
							finally to report a Bill, for he did not think that reported by the
							Committee of Ways and Means would pass. This was the first indication I
							had observed, of indecision in the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Presidential</persRef> Ranks— The Committee adjourned till Monday
							Morning at ten— In the House <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward
								Everett’s</persRef> Resolution for reducing the rates of Postage was
							discussed. Hoffman moved to lay it on the Table, which was opposed by
								<persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef>.— No
							decision— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— <persRef
								ref="verplanck-gulian">Verplanck</persRef> proposed to take up the
							Tariff Bill, but consented to postpone it till to-morrow— Several
							appropriation Bills were taken up and laid aside, and <persRef

							the President and Vice-President directly to the People. <persRef

							Tariff Bill— He said they expected I should take the field for the
							Manufactures— I told him I should do nothing but vote against the Bill
							and all its parts— The manufacturers themselves are all silent and

						<p>I presented to the House the Petition of <persRef ref="callender-william"
								>William Callender</persRef>, for compensation for an improvement in
							Gunnery— Referred without reading to the Committee of Military Affairs.
							I had presented a similar Petition from the same person at the last

							take up the Tariff-Bill reported by him as Chairman of the Committee of

							one day— Verplanck asked unanimous consent to consider it now. objection
							was made— He moved to suspend the Rule, and for the yeas and nays— They
							were 106 to 78— Not two thirds and the rule was not suspended—but
							to-morrow the vote will be carried, and the Bill will pass by about the
							same majority— The question was renewed, whether the Appropriation Bills
							were or were not yesterday reported by the Committee of the Whole on the
							State of the Union to the House— <persRef ref="root-erastus"
								>Root</persRef> after some recalcitration and discussion with the

								>Ellsworth</persRef> complained; but there was a second to the

							89. but the hour for Resolutions had passed away and the previous
							question could not be taken. There was afterwards some debate on the
							Bills reported from the Committee of the whole, on the State of the
							Union, and upon a private Bill— I went into the Senate Chamber, and gave
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>In the House a bill reported by the Judiciary Committee, for continuing
							the Office of Reporter of the decisions of the Supreme Court of the
							United States with a Salary of 1000 dollars a year, came up at the
							second reading— <persRef ref="ellsworth-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Ellsworth</persRef> of the Judiciary Committee wished
							it to pass without the delay of going into a Committee of the whole— But
							there is a Rule of the House that every motion or proposition touching a
							tax or charge upon the People, shall be first discussed in Committee of
							the whole. The Speaker decided that this Bill came within the Spirit of
							the Rule— <persRef ref="wickliffe-charles">Wickliffe</persRef> reminded
							him that at the last Session he had decided the opposite way on a case
							precisely the same in principle; but he denied it and there was no
							record of the decision— I wished to have a record made of this decision,
							and therefore took an appeal from it; but after some discussion, finding
							the sense of the House generally in favour of the decision, and some
							difference of opinion among the oldest members upon the practice, I
							withdrew my appeal— It was however renewed by <persRef
								ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef> of Tennessee to have the
							decision recorded upon the Journals— The decision was affirmed by yeas
							and nays 162 to 14.— Although I had withdrawn my appeal, I voted against
							the decision, which as one of construction upon the Rule was wrong; and
							which <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Stevenson</persRef> would have
							decided next week the other way, if it had come up in the shape of a
							party question— This debate however consumed the hour allotted to
							Resolutions; so that <persRef ref="polk-james">Polk’s</persRef> previous
							question upon the Tariff Bill, could not be taken up— A few private
							Bills were discussed till 3. O’Clock when the House adjourned— The
							weather was this day nearly at Summer heat. I found myself so weak and
							languid under it, that for great part of the Evening I was unable to
							write. In the latter part of it I recovered so that the whole Evening
							was not wasted.</p>

							by Ballot of a Committee of 24. Members, one from each State, with

							that these Complaints have been reiterated, till one of the States has
							undertaken to annul the Laws, and threatens to secede from the Union—

								Raymond</persRef> brought me a Letter of Introduction from <persRef
								ref="stone-william2">William L. Stone</persRef>— He is concerned in
							a Manufactory of Flint-glass at Brooklyn on Long-Island: he comes to
							deprecate the proposition in the Tariff Bill reported by the Committee
							of Ways and Means, to take off the duty of two cents a pound upon flint
							glass— He says that the British Government give a bounty of a penny a
							Pound upon flint glass of their own manufacture, and that if the duty
							here is repealed the manufacture will be destroyed— He said <persRef
								ref="bergen-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bergen</persRef>
							was his Representative; and through him though a <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> man, he had obtained an
							introduction to <persRef ref="hoffman-michael">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hoffman</persRef>, who had promised him, if he could
							prove that the British Government gave this bounty, he would move to
							have the duty here continued— The bounty he said was a matter of public
							notoriety, but he did not know whether he should be able to prove it— I
							told him he had done right to engage the aid of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hoffman, and if he would propose the amendment to the Bill,
							restoring the duty it would pass—and that he might depend upon every
							assistance that it might be in my power to give him— At the House, A
							Bill for the relief of <persRef ref="lincoln-jotham">Jotham
								Lincoln</persRef>, Administrator was reported by the Committee of
							Claims to whom I had yesterday obtained the reference of his Petition
							with the accompanying papers— The Bill was read a first and second time;
							referred to the Committee of the whole, and made the order of the day
							for to-morrow— Before one the House went into Committee of the Whole on
							the State of the Union—the Tariff Bill was taken up, and <persRef
								ref="huntington-jabez">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Huntington</persRef> made a Speech of two hours against it— He was
							followed by <persRef ref="ingersoll-ralph">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Ingersoll</persRef>, now the solitary member of the
							Committee of Ways and Means, opposed to the reported Bill— He was
							unwell, and soon gave way to a motion for the Committee to rise—the
							House soon after adjourned. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hoffman came
							up to me and we had an hour’s conversation upon the proposed
							Tariff-Bill. He professes to be a radical, and has all the contracted
							prejudices of that political Sect. He has considerable Talent and some
							power of Eloquence; but his whole system of Government is comprized in
							the maxim of leaving money in the Pockets of the People— This is always
							the high road to popularity, and it is always travelled by those who
							have not resolution, intelligence and energy to attempt the exploration
							of any other. Yet it appears to me that Hoffman is now somewhat
							distrustful of it himself, and would take another road if he dared.</p>

						<p>I am suffering with a ceaseless catarrhal cough, and with local partial
							inflammations, which afflict me much and in part disable me from
							labour;—but I yet trudge and drudge on with them as well as I can— At
							the House, they soon went into Committee of the whole on the State of
							the Union, and took up the Tariff-Bill— <persRef ref="ingersoll-ralph"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingersoll</persRef> finished his

								<persRef ref="ellsworth-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ellsworth</persRef> of Connecticut then moved the Committee to rise—
							It was carried by a vote of 70 to 63. counted by Tellers. The House then
							adjourned near four— I had company to dine; the names in the margin 15
							at table, the Ladies absent. The weather has become intensely cold; and
							I found the walk from the Capitol home very distressing— I have been
							accustomed to brave the severity of the Seasons, and even at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersbourg, walked before Sunrise in the
							heart of winter; without regard to the state of the Thermometer— The
							suffering of this day should teach me that I can no longer trifle with

						<p><date>11. V. </date>Friday. I was obliged to ride this day, to and from

							printed? I stated the reason: because they were so voluminous, and
							because the returns were incomplete; some of them having not been even

							was referred, and I notified the members of the Committee except

								ref="smith-william-steuben">W. S. Smith</persRef>— Sergeant, is in
							full and profitable practice at the bar, and is here attending the
							Session of the Supreme Court of the United States— But he has fallen
							into unpopular politics and is soured in temper.— He was nominated by
							the National Republican Convention at Baltimore last December, and by
							the Convention of young men at Washington last May, as a Candidate for
							the Office of Vice-President of the United States; with <persRef
								ref="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef> as their Candidate for
							President— These nominations have totally failed, and Sergeant feels
							severely the disappointment— Sergeant is an honest, and very able man,
							of a class that never can be favourites of the People— It is his
							misfortune to be associated in this nomination with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Clay, whose vaulting ambition has
							overleaped itself. The aspirants to the Presidency ruin their own
							prospects by the precipitation with which they rush to their prize— This
							has been especially the mistake of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay,
							who with more eloquence and much more management than Sergeant has less
							real talent, a weaker judgment, and far less consistency of principle—
							The last ten days have been to me one long agony, without remission. The
							only ability left me is that of reading, and the mind is too much
							preoccupied with alarm and affliction, for reading with any profit.</p>
