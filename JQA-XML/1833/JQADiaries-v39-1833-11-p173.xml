						<p>I finished this morning the draft of my Letter to <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>, and now it will take
							a longer time to revise, than it has taken to write it— I went out to
							work in my Garden but was soon called in to a young Gentleman from
							North-Carolina named <persRef ref="u">Jones</persRef>— He came to
							enquire, if I could furnish him with a copy of a Letter from <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father</persRef> to <persRef ref="williams-john"
								>John D. Williams</persRef> of Tennessee, relating to what is called
							the County of Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence— The Letter he
							said was written in 1819 or 1820— I examined my father’s Letters of that
							period, but found no such Letter— I did find however several Letters
							relating to that Subject written in 1819. and particularly the Letter
							from my father to <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson</persRef> of 22. June 1819.
							enclosing the Essex Register of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							that month, which contained the Mecklenburg County Resolutions,
							extracted from the Raleigh Register— I read this Letter to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones and he asked me for a copy of it,
							which I promised him— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones is at the Law
							School at Cambridge— <persRef ref="thayer-eliphaz">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Eliphaz Thayer</persRef> was here— He
							is not satisfied with the <hi rend="italic">amount</hi>, of the Pension
							allowed him, and wishes me to apply to the <persRef ref="cass-lewis"
								>Secretary of War</persRef>, in his behalf that it may be increased—
							He claims for a service of 9 Months and receives only for a term of 4
							Months and 12 days— He desires to have a pay roll examined which he says
							is at the War-Office. I advised him to give me a minute of it in
							writing, and he promised to call again to-morrow My Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came out from Boston and
							dined with us, and returned home early in the <pb n="174" type="ms"
							/>Evening— There was a fire in Boston this Morning which burnt down a
							house in Washington Street— <persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey
								Field</persRef> called this afternoon, and told me he had sold this
							morning the remainder of the wood standing on my <persRef
								ref="borland-leonard">Borland</persRef> lot— He says it sold for
							upwards of 800 dollars— He said too there was yet some small difficulty
							about the bounds in one corner. <persRef ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah
								Adams</persRef> came in the Evening, and agreed to hire one of my
							pews in the Meeting House. N. 72 or 73—if the first, for a Rent of 6
							dollars for one year and if the second for 7. dollars he to occupy only
							two or three Seats— I walked at the beginning of the Evening to <persRef
								ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B.
								Adams’s</persRef>, and afterwards to <persRef ref="greenleaf-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Greenleaf’s</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-lucy">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Greenleaf</persRef> has been for some time much indisposed, and is
							confined to her chamber— She said they had written to her Son <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-william">William</persRef> by <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>; but she thought they
							would write again— I walked home, but found the exertion to write in the
							Evening was more than I could go through—</p>

						<p>The weather has been for the last four days and Nights, wintry cold with
							sharp frosts, which have killed the leaves of almost all the trees. Last
							night the wind came round to the Southward, and it blew a very heavy
							gale all Night— It gave me much concern for my family, which I supposed
							to be on their passage from Providence to New-York— This morning I wrote
							two short and urgent Letters as to bring up some of the arrears of my
							Correspondence— For the last fortnight my time has been so constantly
							absorbed in writing to <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
								Lincoln</persRef>, that every thing else has been neglected— I
							packed up also my small black trunk with books, and sent it by <persRef
								ref="baxter-james">James Baxter</persRef> to Boston, to be shipped
							for Washington— <persRef ref="thayer-solomon">Solomon Thayer</persRef>
							was here again, and left with me a paper to fortify his clam to an
							increase of Pension— It was a recollection that the Corps of Artificers
							to which he belonged were obliged to find their own tools. <persRef
								ref="hardwick-henry">Henry Hardwick</persRef> came to speak again
							about the strip of Saltmarsh land, which he wishes to buy of me. But I
							have been only twice at the Mount Wollaston farm the whole of this
							Season— Hardwick says that <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus
								Spear</persRef> is dangerously sick with a Typhus fever. <persRef

								<persRef ref="beale-benjamin">Captain Benjamin Beale</persRef>— M<hi

							of Dedham, which <persRef ref="spear-daniel">Deacon Spear</persRef> had
							lent me, and which the Deacon had authorized M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Thayer to ask— From Breakfast time till Evening I wrote
							nothing— And in the Evening nothing but this Diary. I was all the rest
							of this day, morning, and afternoon with <persRef ref="foss-walter"
								>Walter Foss</persRef>, transplanting trees— I removed two
							Horse-Chesnuts from the Nursery to the Easternly Grass plot—
							Transplanted all the seedling trees, in my three wooden boxes to beds in
							the Garden, and I set out in the Garden two rows of Peach and
							Cherry-trees—taken up chiefly in the Nursery— Took out also the three
							seedling Cherry trees which had grown up in one of my white earthen Pots
							and set them out near the centre of the Garden.</p>

						<p>The cold and clear weather returned, and I found it difficult to write,

							extract from each chapter one or two verses. Something better than this
							however may I hope be done hereafter— Continuous Dissertations upon the
							character of the several parts of the Bible, may be made useful to
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2;adams-john2">my Children</persRef>,
							which mere extracts of single verses cannot. Heard <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney</persRef>— His morning text was Hebrews 11.1. “Now faith is the
								<pb n="175" type="ms"/>substance of things hoped for, the evidence
							of things not seen”— That of the afternoon was Matthew 7.20.
							[“]Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.” There was a child of

								<persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Degrand</persRef> came out from Boston, and dined with us, and

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef> afterwards called— I
							read the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon of the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef>; upon the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, preached
							on Easter Sunday— It is an argumentative Discourse, upon the Evidences
							of the Resurrection— The topic is common, and always treated the same
							way. The fact of the Resurrection, seems hardly susceptible of
							demonstration— The more pains taken to prove it, the more objections
							against it multiply— Sometime after I sent back to <persRef
								ref="otis-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George Alexander
								Otis</persRef>, his translation of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero’s</persRef> Offices, with my remarks upon it, he wrote to me

							throughout the work. I this day answered M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>The keenness of the morning pinched my fingers so that I could write but
							little; and I am now called to make preparation for my departure— I
							received a Letter from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef> at Providence but was disappointed in the expectation
							of one from New-York— I wrote to <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones</persRef>, at Cambridge, and
							enclosed to him a copy of the Letter from <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father</persRef> to <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson</persRef>, of 22 June 1819.
							which I had promised him— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones told me
							that in looking over with <persRef ref="sparks-jared">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparks</persRef>, some Boston
							Newspapers of the year 1775 they had found the Mecklenburg County
							Resolutions printed at the time.— I received this Morning a Newport
							Newspaper, containing a heavy battery against <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef>, late Member of Congress
							and again a Candidate, but who will never go to Congress again—a
							Mistake. There is a correspondence between him and a man named <persRef
								ref="cranston-robert">Cranston</persRef>, lately removed from the
							Post-Office, which demolishes Pearce, and shews him in a light so
							mortifying, that I feel utterly ashamed of him— There is no feeling more
							distressing than that of seeing a man whom you have esteemed and
							respected prove unworthy of your regard— I was engaged all the remainder
							of the day till dark, in transplanting trees, and taking in the flower
							Pots, in which I have had seeds and Stones all Summer in the Garden—
							Nothing has vegetated in any one of them, and the ground has frozen so
							hard that I had great difficulty in taking them up— I have taken out all
							the seedling trees that had grown up, in my four large boxes— I have set
							out Elms and Horse-Chesnuts— Several Walnuts, Apples, Cherries and
							Peaches—and Pears— All the species that were vacant in the Eastern
							enclosure, I have supplied with forest trees, and transplanted into it
							this day, one Shag bark walnut from the Summer house cellar, and one
							Ash, from the Nursery— <persRef ref="brooks-maria">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Maria Brooks</persRef> the authoress
							of Zophiel or the bride of Seven, paid me a visit this afternoon— She
							resides at a place which she calls granite cottage at Milton— She is
							desirous of having Editions of her poem published in all the principal
							Cities of the United States; the profits of which are to be appropriated
							to the benefit of the Poles— And she wishes me to write something in its
							favour, to help its popularity and Sale— A word from me would more
							likely be fatal to it— This Lady says she was born at Medford, and has
							lived some years in the Island of Cuba</p>

						<p>I was awaked by the Clock striking five; two hours later than usual—
							There is nothing in the state of my health, which gives me so much
							concern as the gradual diminution of sleep in the Night, which is
							growing upon me. I have now upon an average less than five hours in a
							Night, and it is always disturbed, unquiet Sleep—full of tossings as the
							Psalmist says. The comfort of going to bed with a moral certainty of
							being asleep in five minutes— The refreshment and composure of awaking
							after seven hours of peaceful Slumber I never more shall know. The
							misery of rising with Self-reproach, may I never know— I had yesterday
							brought in my Seedling Pots from the Garden— This day I filled them with
							whole Apples or seeds, Pear Cores and Cherry-Stones and had them all
							twelve put down cellar— <persRef ref="otis-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George A. Otis</persRef> called upon
							me, and read to me five or six chapters more of his translation of
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> Offices— He had with

								Cockman’s</persRef> Translation, a book which he found in the
							University Library. It had belonged to <persRef ref="parsons-theophilus"

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Otis had not received my Letter. I advised
							him to publish his translation, and lent him my two Editions of the
							French Translation by <persRef ref="barrett-jean">Barrett</persRef>, of

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gourgas</persRef> was here, and

							Will as he had requested—but promised I would— I commenced my
							preparations for departure, by packing my trunk, and discharging sundry
							Bills, which occupied me the remainder of the day— With the rest of my
							effects I packed up this Book, to which I shall not again have access
							till I reach Washington, and must in the mean time keep my Record, upon
							loose sheets or Sybilline leaves.— This packing for departure is an
							irksome and an anxious task— I planted whole Apples and Pears in the
							large wooden boxes, which had been previously emptied, and disposed of
							all my Seedlings— Wrote this Evening a short Letter to <persRef

								Davis</persRef>— Her <persRef ref="davis-isaac">husband</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="davis-thomas2">Son</persRef> were not at home— I dined
							at Charles’s with Alexander H. Everett, who assured me that he did not
							write the part of the National Republican Convention Committee’s Address
							which concerned me.— He said it was very much debated and he disapproved
							it— But he thought it would bear a different construction from that
							which I applied to it. There has been a great struggle to strike off
							Everett from the Senatorial ticket this year, but they finally carried
							him in the Ward Committee Convention, by a majority of two votes— Judge
							Hall came in after dinner, and again in the Evening. He told me that
								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> had
							consulted him about his foolish Letter to me, and he had told him he
							thought he was wrong—but he seemed delighted with the thought that he
							could charge an equivocation upon me— Charles urged me to omit a part of

							do. <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De

							We stopp’d to drop and take in passengers at Newport at half past two—
							At four we turned the cape of Point Judith, and about eight in the

							Passengers, and not one of them was known to me, excepting our own
							Company. A young man named <persRef ref="u">Buck</persRef>, who sat by
							me at dinner said he believed I had the pleasure of being acquainted

							U.S. Senator, to <persRef ref="craig-john">D<hi rend="superscript"

							dark, a-head. Not uncomfortably cold— Our Ladies were almost Sea-sick.—
							I had no book, and felt no disposition to read.— Verses were accordingly
							running in my head, and I penned four Stanza’s upon Truth— The first
							three, shaken out by the motion of the Stage were completed without much
							difficulty— I wrote them down after dinner, in the boat. The fourth came
							very hard, and I stuck fast in the middle of the fifth— This occupation
							in Stage and Steam-boat passes time— Winding round the Blue Hills
							through Dedham and Walpole always opens my poetical vein— It flowed
							however this day very scantily. I went upon deck two or three times in
							the course of the Evening, and saw successively the Watch-hill,
							Stonington, New-London and Gull-Island Lights, and then paced the floor
							of the long-room till past ten, when I retired to bed—</p>

						<p><date>8. V. </date>Friday.— From New-York to Philadelphia.</p>
						<p>Blessed! ever Blessed be the name of God! that I am alive, and have
							escaped unhurt from the most dreadful Catastrophe, that ever my eyes
							beheld— We arrived at New-York, at half past six this Morning— I took
							leave of <persRef ref="harrod-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Harrod</persRef>, <persRef ref="harrod-ann">his daughter</persRef>,
							my niece <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="gourgas-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gourgas</persRef>—took a Hack with <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Potter</persRef>, and crossed from the
							East to the North-River; put my baggage into the Steam-boat Independence
								<persRef ref="u">Captain Douglas</persRef> and walked to the City
							Hotel— I found that <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef> and family proceeded thence last Monday on their way
							to Washington— There was a card of invitation, to attend a public dinner
							to be given to <persRef ref="chauncey-isaac">Commodore
								Chauncey</persRef> to-morrow, to which I wrote a declining answer. I
							then returned to the Steam boat, which left the wharf at eight and
							landed the Passengers at Amboy about twenty minutes past ten. The boat
							was crowded almost to suffocation; and people of every land and language
							seemed congregated in it— Among the rest a whole tribe of Wild Irish,
							whose language I now for the first time heard spoken. The only persons
							of the passengers whom I knew, were <persRef ref="ogden-david3">David B.
								Ogden</persRef> of New-York, and <persRef ref="u">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> M’Dowell</persRef>, whom <persRef
								ref="condict-lewis">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Condict</persRef>
							introduced to me last winter at Washington, and who was then a Professor
							at Princeton College; but has since left it, and has removed to
							Philadelphia— There were upwards of 200 passengers in the Rail-road
							Cars— There were two Locomotive Engines, A and B. each drawing an
							Accommodation Car, a sort of moving Stage, in a Square, with open
							railing— A Platform and a row of benches holding forty or fifty
							persons—then four or five Cars, in the form of large Stage Coaches, each
							in three Compartments with doors of entrance on both sides, and two
							opposite benches on each of which sat four passengers— Each train was
							closed with a high quadrangular open railed baggage waggon, in which the
							baggage of all the passengers in the train was heaped upon the whole
							covered with an Oil-Cloth— I was in Car B N. 1. and of course in the
							second train— Of the first ten miles, two were run in four minutes
							marked by a watch of a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								De Yong</persRef> in the same Car and division with me— They
							stopped, oiled the Wheels and proceeded— We had gone about five Miles
							further, and had traversed one mile in one minute and 36 Seconds, when
							the front left wheel of the Car in which I was, having taken fire and
							burnt for several minutes, slip’d off the rail— The pressure on the
							right side of the Car then meeting resistance, raised it with both
							wheels from the rail, and it was oversetting, on the left side; but the
							same pressure on the Car immediately behind, raised its left side from
							the rail, till it actually overset, to the right, and in oversetting
							brought back the Car in which I was to stand on its four wheels, and
							saved from injury all the Passengers in it— The train was stopp’d I
							suppose within five seconds of the time when our wheel slip’d off the
							Rail; but it was then going at the rate of 60 feet in a second, and was
							dragg’d nearly two hundred feet before it could stop. Of sixteen persons
							in two of the three compartments of the Car that overset, one only
							escaped unhurt— A <persRef ref="u">Doctor Cuyler</persRef>— One side of
							the Car was staved in and almost demolished. One man, <persRef
								ref="stedman-john">John C. Stedman</persRef> of Raleigh, North
							Carolina, was so dreadfully mangled, that he died within ten minutes.
							Another named I believe <persRef ref="u">Welles</persRef>, of
							Pennsylvania can probably not survive the day. <persRef
								ref="vanderbilt-cornelius">Captain Vanderbilt</persRef> had his leg
							broken, as had <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								West</persRef>; Minister of the Episcopal Church at Newport
							Rhode-Island— <persRef ref="bartlett-harriet">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Bartlett</persRef> wife of <persRef
								ref="bartlett-william2">Lieutenant Bartlett</persRef> of the U.S.
							Corps of Engineers, and <persRef ref="u">her Sister</persRef>
							dangerously hurt—<persRef ref="u">her child</persRef>, about three years
							old, is not expected to live. <persRef ref="u;u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charless</persRef>
							of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Louis, Missouri, severely cut and
							bruised; a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dreyfuss</persRef> of Philadelphia, cut in the head, and sprained in
							the back and six other persons, among whom are Doctor M’Dowell, and a
							young <pb n="179" type="ms"/>Lady with him gashed in the head and
							otherwise wounded— The Scene of sufferance was excruciating. Men, women,
							and a child, scattered along the road, bleeding, mangled, groaning,
							writhing in torture and dying, was a trial of feeling, to which I had
							never before been called—and when the thought came over me that a few
							seconds more of pressure on the car in which I was would in all
							probability have laid me a prostrate Corpse, like him who was before my
							eyes, or a cripple for life—and, more insupportable still,—what if my
							wife and <persRef ref="adams-mary4">grandchild</persRef> had been in the
							Car behind me! Merciful God! how can the infirmity of my Nature express
							or feel the Gratitude that should swell in my bosom, that this torture,
							a thousand fold worse than death, has been spared me— At my request a
							Coroner’s inquest was called upon the deceased.— The other dying man,
							was left at Hightstown, 3 miles beyond where the disaster happened, and
							after a detention of nearly three hours, the train was resumed, and
							leaving the two broken cars behind, the rest proceeded to Bordentown 35
							miles from Amboy. The Coroner’s inquest held by a magistrate, of the
							County had been sworn, and I had given my testimony before we left the
							fatal spot— Several of the wounded were left at Hightstown— The rest
							were transported on Cushions from the Cars over the Rail-way to
							Bordentown; and thence with us in the Steam boat New Philadelphia, to
							Philadelphia— On reaching the wharf, the <persRef
								ref="brackenridge-john">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brackenridge</persRef> came on board,
							and told me he had heard I had been seriously injured, by the Accident
							on the Railway— Apprehensive that such rumours might circulate and reach
							my family, I wrote on board the Steamboat, to my wife at Washington and
							to my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> at Boston, and
							despatched the Letters to the Post-Office at Philadelphia. We landed at
							Chesnut Street wharf between six and seven in the Evening, and I took
							lodgings with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Potter at the United States
							Hotel— I resolved to proceed on my Journey to-morrow morning, but called
							and spent an hour of the Evening at <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Sergeant’s</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crommelin</persRef> came in,

						<p><date>9.</date> V.45. Saturday— From Philadelphia to Baltimore.</p>
						<p>At 7. O’Clock I left the United States Hotel at Philadelphia, and
							embarked in the Steam-boat Robert Morris: <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Potter</persRef> still in company. We
							landed at Newcastle at half past ten; took the Railway Cars, and in one
							hour and five minutes, reached the Wharf at Frenchtown. Then embarked in
							the Steam-boat Carroll, <persRef ref="chaytor-james">Captain
								Chaytor</persRef>, and at five in the afternoon landed at Baltimore.
							We concluded to stop here for the Night. Captain Chaytor told me, that
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef>, and her family went down in his boat
							to Baltimore, the day before yesterday; and there took lodgings at the
							Indian Queen— The old Inn, newly fitted up and kept by <persRef
								ref="newcomb-reuben">Newcomb</persRef>. I therefore came with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Potter took lodgings at the same house—
							They gave me a Parlour, Bed-chamber and too plentiful a Supper; and I
							spent the Evening partly in Conversation with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Potter, and partly in musing Meditations— <persRef
								ref="ogden-david3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> David B.
								Ogden</persRef>, whom I had met in the Boat from New-York, was with
							us again to day; but went to lodge at <persRef ref="barnum-david"
								>Barnum’s</persRef>, and promised to go in the same Stage with me
							to-morrow Morning. We had in the Steam-boats, as fellow-passengers also
							this day, <persRef ref="shubrick-william">Captain Shubrick</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="coulter-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Coulter</persRef>, a Surgeon in the U.S. Navy.— There were, besides,
							several persons, Strangers, who entered into Conversation with me; among
							the rest a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Greenway</persRef>, a man of pleasing and polished manners, who had
								<persRef ref="u">his wife</persRef>, and children with him, and told
							me he had taken lodgings at this house for the Winter, and that <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> had
							done the same. My Mind has been in a state of Agitation, unable to think
							composedly, since the dreadful accident of yesterday. I dare not indulge
							the superstitious impressions which involuntarily arise in it, and fear
							to trust my own thoughts. A danger so extreme— A deliverance so
							wonderful. Not a Sparrow falleth to the ground, but by the will of my
							Heavenly father. Can I be seen grateful without presumption. How shall I
							do, to take it as a warning faithfully to perform the duties of the
							minutes of life still left for me?</p>

						<p><date>10.</date> V. Sunday— From Baltimore to Washington</p>
						<p>I had an indifferent Night’s rest, but rose at five, and having two hours
							of leisure before day light employed them partly in writing, and partly
							in reading <persRef ref="verplanck-gulian">Gulian C.
								Verplanck’s</persRef> Discourse upon the Right Moral Influence and
							use of liberal Studies—delivered after the Annual Commencement of Geneva
							College, the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last August at the
							request of the Alpha Phi Delta, and Euglossian Societies of that
							College— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Verplanck sent me a copy of this
							Discourse, with which I am much pleased— It is a picture of the Author’s
							mind, pure and honest, and originally ardent, but subdued by time and
							disappointments into tameness. There is a gentleness in his character
							now, unsuited to the tug of political controversy in these Times—
							Originally an ardent and stubborn federalist, at the final downfall of
							that party after the last War, with Great-Britain, he was one of about
							forty who formally renounced it, and joined the Republican party—the
							vicissitudes of which he has since followed. In the State of New-York,
							he suffered himself to be drawn by successive compliances into the
							opposition against me, his early friend, and the friend of <persRef
								ref="verplanck-daniel">his father</persRef>— This brought him into
							Congress where he has been eight years— But his principle of yielding to
							the dictates of party Spirit, was so severely tried, that he at last was
							brought to a pause— He would not go into their extreme measures and they
							instantly dropp’d him from Congress, while they adhered to that utterly
							unprincipled fellow <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
								>Cambreling</persRef>, as to a wall of adamant— The characters of
							those two men form a contrast of moral and political speculation— We
							breakfasted at Baltimore, and shortly before nine, left the house, in
								<persRef ref="fuller-azariah">Fuller’s</persRef> Stage— Arrived at
							Washington about three in the afternoon— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> and her family party
							had arrived here, the Evening before last— They were at dinner; but I
							missed my Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef>, and found he
							had been a fortnight confined to his chamber with a bilious fever;—the
							rest of the family were as well, as I can ever expect they should be—
								<persRef ref="frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Frye</persRef>, and her Son <persRef ref="frye-thomas"
								>Thomas</persRef> were there— <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> W. S. Smith</persRef> came
							sometime after dinner—and was soon after followed by <persRef
								key="smith-william-steuben">her husband</persRef>— This Evening thus
							passed away— I read the last six Chapters of the Book of Job and began a
							Letter to my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, in
							which I did not advance far. My heart poured forth its gratitude to the
							giver of all good, for the safe arrival of my wife, my family and myself
							again at this place; with an ejaculation for a propitious winter, and
							for the recovery of my Son.</p>

							an attempted answer to the charges against him in the Herald of the

							irretrievable— Among the deepest mortifications that I have been

							friendship—sometimes by the treachery and sometimes by the unworthiness
							of those in whom I had confided— Pearce has wilfully degraded himself by
							basely cringing to the vilest of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President

							Coal-fires in the chambers— I was finally obliged to leave my bed, to go
							in to the bed in the small bed-chamber adjoining my writing chamber, and
							leave its door open, after throwing open the window in my writing
							chamber— With these expedients, after lying about an hour, my head-ache
							subsided— I fell asleep, and slept till half past six, broad day-light.
							I then rose much relieved, though not without a remnant of head-ache
							which lasted through the day. I had morning visits from <persRef

						<p>My Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> was taken ill again in
							the Night, and confined all this day to his bed— <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> continues extremely ill, but we

								key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> is convalescent— The
								<persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">youngest of John’s two

							things and the prospects of the winter that it holds out are deeply
							distressing, but I know that from human aid no relief can be foreseen—
							To the hands of him, the disposer of all things I must commit my sorrows
							for the present and my hopes for the future, with prayer for mercy and
							for resignation. I received this morning the Boston Independent
							Chronicle of Wednesday last, containing the returns of votes from 94
							towns, from which it is reduced to a moral certainty that there will be
							no choice of Governor by the People of Massachusetts for the ensuing
							year— It is also nearly certain that my name will stand second or third
							upon the list of Candidates for selection by the House of
							Representatives of the two, to be presented to the Senate, and from whom
							the Senate will have to choose the Governor— There will be numerous
							vacancies to fill up in the Senate, and of the complexion of the house
							it is as yet impossible for me to judge. I shall have in this emergency
							a part to perform of great delicacy—requiring much deliberation; much
							discretion; a steady, undeviating regard for the public good, and pure,
							dispassionate Patriotic Principle— May the consciousness of rectitude
							sustain me in it, and carry me through it. I had a morning visit from
								<persRef ref="morris-charles">Commodore Morris</persRef>, and
							afternoon calls, from <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Huntt</persRef>, <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>, and a <persRef
								ref="pedrick-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pedrick</persRef>, a man who had been here ten or twelve years
							since, and who told me he had lately returned <pb n="184" type="ms"
							/>home, after a residence of eight years in South-America— He told me
							that before he went to South-America he had made over his property to
							Assignees for the benefit of his creditors—that there had been then
							collected enough to pay 90 per Cent of his debts and they had since
							realized enough to cover the remainder— That he had a claim of indemnity
							here, before the French Commissioners, but his Assignees had entered the
							claim as for themselves. He had consulted <persRef ref="dane-nathan"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dane</persRef>, to know whether
							he could not take the claim out of their hands. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Dane had seen his Assignment, and said it was broad enough
							to cover the claim— But he advised him to come here, and enter the claim
							for himself; and he had given him a Letter for a Lawyer here— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pedrick had not seen the Lawyer, but he
							wished for my opinion in the case— I was apprehensive he made his point
							more favourable to himself than the reality, and gave no positive
							opinion— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt said the Columbian
							Institute now wished me to deliver their Annual Address, referring to a
							conditional promise I had heretofore given, that I would at some future
							day perform this task, but I informed him that it was quite
							impracticable now— I spent part of the Evening at <persRef
								ref="macomb-alexander">General Macomb’s</persRef>— He asked me if I
							continued to play Chess; but I have taken an aversion to that game,
							because I could never learn to play it well— I wrote a Letter to my Son
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>.</p>

								Smith</persRef> this morning at the second Presbyterian Church from
							Ephesians. 2.22. “In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation
							of God through the Spirit.” Upon this figure of Speech in which the
							members of a Christian Church are represented as constituting a Temple
							for the habitation of God, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith
							descanted with some ingenuity, though without much eloquence— Like most
							Presbyterian Divines he has a partiality for the writings of <persRef
								ref="paul">Saint Paul</persRef>, and takes almost all his texts from
							them— He noticed that this Epistle was addressed exclusively to the
							Gentile converts at Ephesus, though he proved from the Acts—ch. 19. that
							there was at Ephesus a Synagogue of Jews to whom Paul preached for the
							space of two years— After dinner I attended at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s Church and heard <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read prayers for the
								24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity, and preach
							from John 9.4. “I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is
							day: the night cometh, when no man can work.”— The congregation was very
							small— <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Smith</persRef> was here this afternoon— One of the
							hymns which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith gave out this morning
							to be sung was the 64<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of the second Book,
							entitled God the glory and defence of Sion— The following are two lines
							of that hymn— Then Let our Souls in Zion dwell:</p>
						<lg>
							<l>Nor fear the wrath of Rome and Hell.</l>
						</lg>
						<p>And it was written by <persRef ref="watts-isaac">Isaac Watts</persRef>,
							and it is not to be doubted that he believed this coupling of Rome and
							Hell was genuine Piety, and Christian Charity— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Smith had the good sense to direct the omission of this
							verse; but there it is in the book, forming a part of Christian worship—
							Rome had doomed Watts to Hell, with equal Sincerity— So it is with
							brethren of the same faith— I once heard <persRef ref="cheverus-jean"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cheverus</persRef>, but it was
							in Boston, before he was an Archbishop, or even a Bishop, preach in
							Boston. He related the Story told of some heathen man, who in the early
							age of Christianity, witnessed the devotions and harmony of some
							Christian Church, and exclaimed— [“]Behold how these Christians love one
							another”— But said father Cheverus, if he could come and witness now the
							Sentiments of Christians reciprocated between them he would be much more
							ready to cry out Behold, how these Christians <hi rend="small-caps"
								>hate</hi> one another. Cheverus himself is an exception—</p>

						<p>My time runs away, and my purposes remain without execution. I began this
							Morning an Address to the People of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
							different altogether from that of which I had written two or three
							sheets before I left Quincy— I went up to the Capitol, but was
							disappointed in not finding <persRef ref="carr-overton">M<hi

							to their chambers—and <persRef ref="greenleaf-william">W. C.
								Greenleaf</persRef> did not return from Georgetown till I had nearly
							done dinner— I received a Letter from my Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, and one from <persRef
								ref="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef> which gives me the deepest
							concern— He has involved himself in the whole controversy relating to
							the Bank, without apparent necessity—on the wrong side and by means
							which it is difficult to justify— He complains of bitter persecution
							from the Bank of the United States and its friends— I fear his good
							Genius has deserted him— <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> told me that he had
							sent a copy of the Second Edition of his Residence in England to
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef>; who
							answered him by a Letter of thanks to which he replied; and in his reply
							took occasion to declare his approbation of the President’s order,
							removing the Deposits in the Treasury, from the Bank of the United
							States— This he does not say in his Letter to me; but he avows his
							opinion against the Bank, and complains of being persecuted for it; and
							he informs me that he has sent an exposition of his opinions to be
							published in the Globe— There is at this time a breaking up of parties,
							which strangely tries the temper and the principles of men.</p>

						<p>I continue writing upon the Address to the People of Massachusetts, but
							without much satisfaction.— I had intended to go with a Letter to the
								<persRef ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of War</persRef>, in behalf of
							sundry claimants of Revolutionary Pensions but I was in interrupted, and
							could not get my Letter finished. I was obliged again to postpone my

							Secretary of State, who has been some days absent has returned to the

							M’Lane, who he said was conscious that he had been wrong, in taking part
							last Winter against the Bank of the United States, and was now desirous
							of repairing that wrong— I told Wyer, that I had nothing against M’Lane,
							and should be very willing to see him—but I said no more. M’Lane is in a
							perilous condition, and I have no confidence in his steadiness, his
							firmness, or his political integrity— Whoever trusts in him will be
							betrayed— Wyer spoke to me of a ferocious Article in the Globe this day,
							and he afterwards sent it to me— It is editorial, but evidently comes
							direct from the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>— It
							exhibits a violence of Passion foreboding extremities, quite unexpected;
							but the anticipation of which is alarming— Judge Cranch has been holding
							Court at Alexandria, and said he expected a troublesome Session here— I
							had no opportunity to converse with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Torlade upon the condition of affairs in his Country, where a civil war
							is raging for the right to the Crown— He is the Representative of Don
							Miguel, recognized here as king de facto, but really an Usurper, and
							likely to be overthrown— There is a decree of <persRef ref="pedro-iv"
								>Don Pedro</persRef>, the Regent in the name of his daughter on
							whose favour he abdicated, <persRef ref="maria-ii">Donna Maria de
								Gloria</persRef>, against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torlade,
							which I have seen in the newspapers lately— Torlade appears to be a
							worthy and intelligent man, placed in a difficult and embarrassing
							situation— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell has come here with
								<persRef ref="u">his <pb n="186" type="ms"/>wife</persRef> to pass
							the winter; for her health—though he thinks he himself will be obliged

							Hughes has been upon a visit of several days to <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef>
							in Virginia— Hughes has lately returned to this Country, after a long

							and seeking which he may do for a long period, another mission abroad.
							He has a <persRef ref="hughes-charles">son sixteen years old</persRef>,
							and he says six feet tall, whom he is going to place at West-Point.—
							These visits detained me till dinner time, and towards Evening I walked

						<p><date>23.</date> V:30 Saturday.</p>
						<p>I answered this morning a Letter from <persRef ref="rush-richard">Richard
								Rush</persRef>, which I have had three or four days upon hand, and
							it was a painful operation— I fear he is irretrievably lost, and that
							his Passion to go again to England, which has haunted him ever since his
							return from that country, has at last turned his head— In his desperate
							plunge to obtain it, he has thrust himself uncalled for, rashly upon the
							controversy respecting the withdrawal of the public deposits from the
							Bank of United States, and the manner in which he has intruded upon the
							dispute is as exceptionable as the mode in which he is conducting it— If
							I am to believe his Letter to me, he has done this without one
							forethought of the storm which it would bring down upon his head—and he
							complains of the persecution of him by the Bank and its friends, as if
							he had given no provocation to any mortal man— His wild, unjust and
							foolish onset upon the Bank will go far to demolish Anti-Masonry in
							Pennsylvania— It will destroy every particle of his influence upon that
							question which has been great, and will turn all his arguments in favour
							of that cause into sophisms against it— There is danger that his
							reputation with the Anti-Masons will mislead many of them into a support
							of his present blunders, and sink their cause in the struggle to keep
							him afloat— I have found it exceedingly difficult to give him my
							Sentiments upon his conduct, without unnecessarily wounding his
							feelings, which are sensitive to an extreme— But I had no middle <pb
								n="188" type="ms"/>course to pursue, and I have given him my
							opinions upon his vagaries with as much delicacy as possible, but with a
							certainty of losing his friendship forever— His reply, will, I have no
							doubt be frantic— “Lean not on Earth, twill pierce thee to the heart!”
							this was the motto of a mourning ring of <persRef key="adams-abigail">my
								dear Mother’s</persRef>, when she lost her daughter <persRef
								ref="adams-susanna">Susanna</persRef>— O! how often in the course of
							my life, have I been reminded of it— And friendship! what friendship
							have I ever formed; but it has been disgraced by misconduct, or betrayed
							for sordid interests— There are exceptions—rare, indeed— Within the last
							four Months I have lost four friends upon whom I did place some
							reliance—two by misconduct, two by treachery— May I at least die without
							ever losing one by misconduct or treachery of my own— I walked to the
							Capitol before dinner— Met <persRef ref="force-peter">Peter
								Force</persRef> going there— <persRef ref="wilde-richard">R H.
								Wilde</persRef> of Georgia, <persRef ref="wardwell-daniel">M<hi

						<p>Heard this Morning, <persRef ref="woodbridge-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbridge</persRef>, Agent for the
							Tract Society, at the second Presbyterian Church— His text was from 2.
							Samuel 5.24. “And let it be, when thou hearest a sound of going, in the
							tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shall bestir thyself, for
							then shall the Lord go out before thee, to smite the host of the
							Philistines.”— A collection was taken up for the funds of the Tract
							Society; and the Sermon was an earnest exhortation to the Auditory to
							contribute liberally— The analogy between the text and the discourse was
							rather fanciful, and indeed it was left to the imagination of the
							hearers to make. Nothing was said explanatory of the primitive meaning
							of the text; but the sound of the going in the tops of the
							mulberry-trees; the duty of bestirring ourselves, and the smiting of the
							host of the Philistines, was all typical of Religious Missions in Asia,
							and the distribution of religious tracts— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Woodbridge cited Letters from the Missionaries in Asia, Hindostan the
							Birman Empire and China— It is scarcely credible what multitudes of
							Tracts they give away in those Countries, and what a demand there is for
							them— They spent 10.000 dollars last year in Asia, and they now propose
							to raise 20000 dollars for the same purpose— After dinner I heard
								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church
							read the Evening prayer for the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday
							after Trinity— His Discourse, which was less than ten minutes in length
							was from James 4.4.—“know ye not that the friendship of the world is
							enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is
							the enemy of God.” This is the same subject, though not precisely the
							same text upon which <persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Smith</persRef> of the Presbyterian Church gave us six
							Sermons last spring— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley despatched it
							more expeditiously— I was again able to write very little in the
							Evening— There was a light fall of Snow.</p>

						<p>The ground was covered with Snow this Morning before day light; but it
							turn’d to rain, and was soon swept away. The Newspapers announced the
							decease of two persons with whom I <pb n="189" type="ms"/>have been at

								<persRef ref="callender-john">John Callender</persRef>, a Classmate
							at Cambridge of my late brother <persRef key="adams-thomas"
								>Thomas</persRef>, and with whom I was afterwards on terms of much
							familiarity in Boston— But for the last thirty years I have scarcely
							seen him— He has been great part of that time Clerk of the Supreme Court
							of the State of Massachusetts, and died very suddenly one night last
							week, of Apoplexy— The other is <persRef ref="roberdeau-mary">Mary E.
								Roberdeau</persRef>, who died last Thursday,—about 30—an amiable,
							intelligent and accomplished young woman, cut off in the prime of life,
							and who seemed destined to a happier fate— It is a melancholy privilege
							of Old age, to survive the generation of cotemporaries— Those with whom
							we have lived, and whom we have loved drop around us one after another—
							Till, dying, all we can resign is breath— At every death of a friend or
							acquaintance these reflections return, and yet when death comes it finds
							us as unprepared as if we had never received a warning— I walked to the
							Capitol, and returning at <persRef ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef>
							the visits of <persRef ref="huntington-jabez">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Huntington</persRef> and of <persRef

						<p>My only certain time for writing, is the morning from my rising hour till

							unaccountable casual calls, consume Time, like fire without flame
							fretting it away by the five or ten minutes at a time, till the moment
							of sallying forth for exercise comes, and unless seized, is gone— A walk

							reading or writing are both irksome, and often impracticable— This
							Evening I was with a lamp in my hand reading a prosy Article in the
							Telegraph, when it lulled me to a doze, and my lamp set fire to the
							Newspaper which it took some expense of breath to extinguish— I made
							several efforts to write, but was obliged to give it up. I had a morning
							visit from <persRef ref="sewall-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sewall</persRef>; and before dinner walked to the Capitol— There I
							met <persRef ref="allan-chilton">Chilton Allen</persRef> of Kentucky,

								Foster</persRef> of Georgia, and <persRef ref="potts-david">M<hi

								ref="crockett-david">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> David
								Crockett</persRef> of Tennessee— I did not recognize him, till he
							came up and accosted me—and named himself— I congratulated him upon his
							return here; and he said yes— It had cost him two years to convince the
							People of his District that he was the fittest man to represent them,
							that he had just been to <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef>, and requested him to
							announce his arrival, and inform the Public that he had taken for

								ref="downing-jack">Major Jack Downing</persRef>— The <pb n="190"
								type="ms"/>only person in whom he had any confidence for information
							of what the Government was doing— This Major Jack Downing is the

							writes Letters from the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President’s</persRef> House, as entirely in his confidence, and
							telling all the petty intrigues of the cabinets and favourites by whom
							he is surrounded— After dinner <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Everett</persRef> called, and
							we had some conversation upon the state of Politics in Massachusetts— I
							found he was anxious to convince me that if the House of Representatives
							should elect <persRef ref="morton-marcus">Morton</persRef> and me as the
							two Candidates from whom the Senate are to choose a Governor, the Senate
							would choose Morton— I told him I supposed they would, and should be
							much obliged to them if they should— I saw his object was to prevail
							upon me to decline in favour of <persRef ref="davis-john4"
								>Davis</persRef>; but I was not disposed to let him know what my
							intentions are— He and his brother <persRef ref="everett-alexander"
								>Alexander</persRef> are both reeds shaken with the wind— I spent
							part of this Evening in assorting pamphlets.</p>

						<p>Rainy Night and Morning:—confined me to the House till about Sunset— I
							received this Morning a Note, from a <persRef ref="stras-martha"
								>Niece</persRef> of <persRef ref="henry-patrick">Patrick
								Henry</persRef> requesting me to appoint a time this day to see her
							upon business of importance— I appointed twelve O’Clock, Noon and she
							came. She brought with her a Letter very well written, setting forth her
							merits, and her affinity with Patrick Henry the great Virginian Patriot
							and Orator, the intimate friend of <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>—and requesting a loan of a hundred dollars for two
							Notes of 50 dollars each payable in three and six Months— I told her it
							was not in my power— She referred me to <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Speaker Stevenson</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="rives-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rives</persRef>, and all the Virginian Delegation, said <persRef
								ref="southall-valentine">her Son</persRef> was a member of the
							Virginia Legislature, and would pay a draft of hers for 1000 dollars—
							Could not I let her have fifty dollars, if not a hundred?— I said no—
							She had also a Magazine or Periodical publication which she said was
							published by <persRef ref="stras-emily">her daughter</persRef>—and she wished to dedicate the same to
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef>— This I also declined, and she took
							leave— I had visits from <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="watmough-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Watmough</persRef>, who told me that the <persRef
								ref="taney-roger-brooke">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> had
							withdrawn the third draught for 500000 dollars which he had furnished to
							the Banks where the public monies are deposited upon the Bank of the
							United States— Two of them were presented and paid— The object in giving
							these draughts was to embarrass and distress the Bank of the United
							States—but in the operation the pressure fell entirely upon the State
							Banks— He also told me that the President of the Bank <persRef
								ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Biddle</persRef> was perfectly satisfied with the condition of the
							Bank, and its ability to meet, and surmount any pressure that the
							Government of the United States could bring to bear against it— That
							their answer to the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President’s</persRef>
							denunciation was ready, and would be complete— That it would totally
							demolish the Statement of the Government Directors, and triumphantly
							refute their charges— He said he had been endeavouring to ascertain what
							the course of the Administration here would be on this Bank question
							would be though without success— That one person had told him, <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van-Buren</persRef> the Vice-President, had
							said that Taney’s exposition of the reasons for removing the Deposits,
							was the greatest State paper that had been produced since the existence
							of the federal Government— If Van Buren has said so, it must have been
							because he wrote it or great part of it himself— Watmough said <persRef
								ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> was for impeaching the
							President at once— I said I thought we should assume an attitude
							strictly defensive; avoid all attack upon the President and attempt
							nothing beyond a Resolution that the Reasons assigned by the Secretary
							of the Treasury for removing the deposits are not satisfactory to the
							House. This is more than will be carried— Towards Evening as it began to
							grow dark in my chamber, I walked round the Capitol Hill, but returned
							in Egyptian Darkness— I was able to write very little in the
							Evening.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> Since my arrival here, I have
							put myself again with regard to the distribution of my time upon the
							Winter Establishment— I rise not very regularly between four and six
							O’Clock, and after reading five Psalms, write till Breakfast between
							nine and ten. But I have intermitted entirely my minutes of scriptural
							reading; but write Letters, or upon the draft of an Address to the
							People of Massachusetts— From Breakfast about three hours are whiled
							away in newspaper and pamphlet reading— Walk an hour and a half, dine
							between 3 and 4. and dinner is scarcely over when the dusk of Evening
							comes. From that time till ten or eleven, I sometimes write sometimes
							read, and occasionally converse with my family, or with evening visitors
							as they call— So closes this Month.</p>
