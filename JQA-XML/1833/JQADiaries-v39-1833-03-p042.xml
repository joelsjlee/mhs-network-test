						<dateline>Friday 1. March 1833.</dateline>
						<p><date>1. VII:30. </date>Friday— Before the meeting of the House this
							morning, I asked <persRef ref="beardsley-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Beardsley</persRef>, a member from New-York, to
							expostulate with his colleague <persRef ref="hoffman-michael"
								>Hoffman</persRef>, against his avowed purpose to talk out the
							remainder of the Session to prevent the printing of my Minority Report
							of the Committee of Manufactures, and to tell him he must allow me time
							to reply, and the House, time to take the Question— Beardsley spoke to
							him, and he agreed to take the question by yeas and nays, without saying
							any thing further on either side— When the Report was called up, I
							stated this agreement to the House, to which Hoffman assented. <persRef
								ref="barbour-john">John S. Barbour</persRef> said there was not
							perhaps in the whole Report a Sentiment with which he concurred; but
							that he should vote for the printing as a right of the Minority. The
							question was taken by yeas and nays, and the printing was carried 93 to
							58. about 50 members not voting. There was a Report from the Majority of
							the Committee of Ways and Means, favourable to the Bank of the United
							States, concluding with a Resolution that the public funds, may be
							safely deposited <pb n="43" type="ms"/>in it—and a Counter-report made
							by <persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> for the Minority, with a
							budget of Documents. Ten thousand copies of both were ordered to be
							printed— The Question upon the passage of the Revenue collection-bill
							was taken by yeas and nays 149 to 48. <persRef ref="mcduffie-george"
								>M’Duffie</persRef> moved an Amendment of the Title—to read—[“]An
							Act to subvert the Sovereignty of the States of this Union, to establish
							a consolidated Government, without limitation of powers, and to make the
							civil subordinate to the Military power” <persRef ref="wayne-james"
								>Wayne</persRef> moved to lay the amendment on the Table; but
								<persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">the Speaker</persRef> declared this
							to be not in order— <persRef ref="speight-jesse">Speight</persRef> moved
							the previous Question, which was carried 150 to 35, and set aside
							M’Duffies’s Amendment. The subsequent orders of the day were then
							postponed to take up <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay’s</persRef> Bill for distributing the proceeds of
							the Public Lands. The House went into Committee of the whole on the
							State of the Union, Polk in the Chair: the bill was debated captiously
							by <persRef ref="clay-clement">C. C. Clay</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="mardis-samuel">Mardis</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="plummer-franklin">Plummer</persRef> from Alabama and
							Mississippi. Plummer was especially tedious and provoking— About 11. at
							Night the Bill was reported to the House and driven to the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d</hi> reading by previous Questions. It passed
							by yeas and nays 96 to 40. Then the Harbour and Light-house bill was for
							some time considered, laid aside and followed by the general
							Appropriation Bill. After which a Bill authorising <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">the President</persRef> to appoint a clerk to
							sign his name to Land Warrants was agreed to. The Bills were reported to
							the House, which then, sometime after one in the Morning, adjourned. The
							Session had continued little short of fifteen hours, without a recess.
							Yesterday and this day there have been large falls of Snow, and severer
							cold than during any part of the winter— Potowmac frozen over.</p>

						<p><date>2. VII:30. </date>Saturday.— The first business taken up by the
							House was the Resolution reported by the Majority of the Committee of
							Ways and Means that the Public funds may safely continue to be deposited
							in the Bank of the United States, against which <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> of Tennessee made a violent Speech.
							He was answered by <persRef ref="ingersoll-ralph">Ingersoll</persRef>,
							and afterwards by <persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie</persRef>. The
							previous Question was moved, and although <persRef ref="wayne-james"
								>Wayne</persRef> of Georgia pleaded hard to speak was carried, and
							the Resolution was adopted 110 to 46. Wayne voted against it, upon which
							I condoled with him. He was mortified to be compelled to give such a
							vote, and afterwards read to me a Letter that he had written to a friend
							saying that his vote was not owing to any doubt of the solvency of the
							Bank, but because the withdrawal of the Public Deposites was a
							discretionary power given by Law to the <persRef ref="mclane-louis"
								>Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, and he would not divide with
							him the responsibility— Wayne said that was ground which I had taken at
							the commencement of the Session, which was true—but that was before the
							investigation referred by the House to the Committee of Ways and Means,
							and against the appointment of a select Committee. The General
							Appropriation Bill was taken up and debated till four O’Clock, and then
							by the previous Question, ordered to be engrossed for a third reading.
							There was a recess from 4 to 6 O’Clock. I went and dined again with
								<persRef ref="newton-thomas">Thomas Newton</persRef> at his
							lodgings. <persRef ref="dorsey-clement">Clement C. Dorsey</persRef> was
							among the fellow lodgers there. At 6 we returned to the House. The
							Appropriation Bills were passed, and sent to the Senate, who had half a
							Night to consider and pass them— The House went into Committee of the
							whole on the state of the Union, and hurried through an Indian-Treaty
							Bill. The Bill to explain the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section
							of the Act of 14 July 1832— The Hard-ware Bill, upon which at my motion
							was engrafted as an additional Section, a Bill from the Senate,
							restoring duties upon Brass, copper, and tobacco in leaves, which being
							a Bill to raise revenue could not constitutionally originate in the
							Senate and the Light house Bill, upon which there was much wrangling.
							The House sat till five O’Clock Sunday morning. <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">The President</persRef> retained the Land-bill
							without signing it. <persRef ref="grundy-felix">Felix Grundy</persRef>
							stopped the Light-House Bill in the Senate, by objecting to its being
							read the second time on the same day. <persRef ref="howard-benjamin"
								>Howard</persRef> of Baltimore moved the vote of thanks to <persRef
								ref="stevenson-andrew">Stevenson</persRef>, which was entered as
							passed unanimously, though when he came to the word impartiality, there
							was a burst of laughter in the House. About two O’Clock in the Morning,
								<persRef ref="lyon-chittenden">Chittenden Lyon</persRef> of
							Kentucky, drunk as a Lord, presented Resolutions of the Legislature of
							Kentucky, which he said he had just <pb n="44" type="ms"/>received, and
							which he moved to be laid on the Table and printed— On being asked what
							was the subject of the Resolutions, he drivelled out “Nullification.”
							Almost every quarter of an hour after Midnight, business was suspended
							for want of a Quorum— Shortly before 3. O’Clock, <persRef
								ref="whittlesey-elisha">Whittlesey</persRef> of Ohio prevailed upon
							the House to go again into Committee of the whole. There was a call of
							the House and 116. members answered to their names— Several private
							Bills passed through the Committee, were reported to the House and
							passed— About 4. <persRef ref="sevier-ambrose">Sevier</persRef>, the
							Delegate from Arkansas moved and urged the house to go into Committee of
							the whole, upon three important territorial Bills, but on taking the
							question only 90 members answered— Of course 26 had withdrawn, since the
							call, half an hour before— A Message was received from the Senate, that
							they had appointed a Committee to wait on the President, and inform him
							that unless he had further communications to make to Congress, the
							Houses were ready to adjourn. <persRef ref="white-campbell">Campbell P.
								White</persRef> of New-York, and Polk of Tennessee were appointed
							the Committee on the part of the House. They soon returned and announced
							that the President had no further communications to make. Stevenson, the
							Speaker, made a silly Speech, in return for the vote of thanks, and
							adjourned the House without day— The hands of the Clock were pointing,
							at five, as we passed under them out of the Hall. I took <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> home, and we were in
							imminent danger of oversetting in the midst of the Pennsylvania Avenue,
							nearly opposite to <persRef ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef>. We got
							out of the Carriage—<persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirk</persRef> was asleep,
							and the horses had stopped. I ordered <persRef ref="u">Ball</persRef> to
							take the reins; we re-entered the Carriage and got into the Macadamized
							part of the Avenue— On reaching M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett’s
							lodgings, I alighted with him, and thence walked home, with <persRef
								ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit’s</persRef> Thermometer at 6. the
							extremest cold of the winter, and the ground covered with snow. The day
							was dawning and I retired to bed, exhausted and dejected, but with
							blessings of gratitude to the Supreme disposer of Events, for the
							merciful dispensations of his Providence, in bringing the affairs of the
							Country to a condition more favourable to Peace and Union than it has
							been of late, and though still surrounded with dangers— And also in the
							disposal of my own destiny for conducting me through the severe and
							humiliating trial, which I have endured, without absolute and
							irretrievable ruin— My Career is yet to be closed. It is in its last and
							lingering Stage— May its remaining afflictions be mitigated— May its
							last moments be serene— May its transition be to a happier state of
							existence.</p>

								<persRef key="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef> was their Candidate
							for the Presidency— They mustered 49 electoral votes, with the help of

							upon which it should be executed— The History—the Legislation and the

						<p>I am endeavouring to resume my habits of industry, and employed a due
							portion of this day in writing. First, making an abstract of the Law, as
							contained in the Book of Deuteronomy— After breakfast, I looked up some
							of the Letters upon Pensions and other claims, to which I was unable to
							attend during the Session of Congress. Made abstracts of four of them,
							upon which I applied for three to the <persRef ref="cass-lewis"
								>Secretary of War</persRef>, and for one to the <persRef
								ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>. They were the
							cases of <persRef ref="bates-benjamin">Benjamin Bates</persRef>, of
								<persRef ref="hayden-caleb">Caleb Hayden</persRef>, and of <persRef
								ref="donnison-william">William Donnison</persRef> for Pensions, and
							for <persRef ref="u">the widow</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="banks-lilliston">Liliston Banks</persRef>, for prize-money. The
							Secretaries promised immediate attention to them. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cass had a Charleston Mercury, in which
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay’s</persRef> Tariff-Bill was mentioned as having set aside the
							nullifying Ordinance, and the opinion is expressed that the Convention
							would not pass another. It spoke of the enforcing Bill as a mere
							effusion of Spleen, on the part of the Administration, of which
							South-Carolina would take no notice. I called at the Office of the
							National Intelligencer to enquire for the Manuscript of the Minority
							Report of the Committee of Manufactures, and also whether any copies of
							the Report were yet struck off. I had sent them back the proof revised
							last Evening— I afterwards met both <persRef ref="gales-joseph"
								>Gales</persRef> and <persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef>,
							and Gales promised to send me the Manuscript this Evening, and several
							copies of the Paper in time to forward them by the mail, but he did not.

							of Rhode-Island, who told me he was going to-morrow. He had sent me his
							Speech against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s Tariff-Bill, and
							his reply to <persRef ref="daniel-henry">Daniel</persRef>. He said he
							had been much urged not to publish them, but he would not keep from the

							of the Session of Congress before the last— He said he had just received

							Laws of the Session, and the returns of Manufactures of the preceding
							Session— None of them were ready— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clarke
							spoke of the compilation of Documents relating to the History of this
							Country, prior to the establishment of the present Constitution. He <pb
								n="54" type="ms"/>said he was going shortly to collect materials for
							it— As I was returning home, I met at the door of <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Strother’s</persRef> house a man
							named <persRef ref="wallace-andrew">Andrew Wallace</persRef>, who was
							coming to see me, and came— He said he was one hundred and three years
							of age, the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month. A Scot,
							born, descended from <persRef ref="wallace-robert">Robert</persRef>, a
							brother of <persRef ref="wallace-william2">Sir William
							Wallace</persRef>.— He was at the Battles of Preston Pans and Culloden,
							a Soldier of <persRef ref="charlesedwardstuart">Prince Charles
								Edward</persRef>, whom, as well as the <persRef
								ref="williamaugustus">Duke of Cumberland</persRef> he well
							remembers.— After the Battle of Culloden, he fled first to Ireland, and
							thence in 1752. to this Country— Served in our army from 1776 till it
							was disbanded—re-inlisted in 1786 and continued as a Sergeant-Major in
							the army till 1813— Then discharged at the age of 83. Has since been a
							teacher till his strength failed— Lives at West-Chester, Pennsylvania,
							and comes here now to solicit an increase of Pension. His eye-sight,
							hearing and Memory seem unimpaired. What a life, and survival of
							chances! I had also a visit this Evening from <persRef
