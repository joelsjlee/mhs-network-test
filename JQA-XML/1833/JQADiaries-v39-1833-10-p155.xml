						<p>Cooler weather, and some appearance of rain all day. I worked, an hour or
							more in my garden, and was interrupted by the visit of <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph;gales-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
									M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Gales</persRef> of Washington,
							with their adopted daughter, <persRef ref="walker-juliana">Miss
								Walker</persRef>. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My

							gone into Boston, to see <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-john17">baby</persRef>, but they returned home to dine.
							The Lessons to my Granddaughter try my philosophy— I read the report of
							the Committee of <hi rend="strikethrough">Common</hi> the Council of the
							Commonwealth, upon the judgement of <persRef ref="thatcher-peter">judge
								Peter Thacher</persRef> of the Municipal Court in Boston upon an
							Indictment against the <persRef ref="wells-charles">Mayor</persRef> and
							Aldermen of the City for a false return of the Election for a member of
							Congress from the District on the first Monday of April last. They
							omitted from the return 332 votes, given for <persRef
								ref="odiorne-george">George Odiorne</persRef>, the Anti-masonic
							candidate— Some days after they made a second return which the Council
							refused to receive— The judge decided that the Governor and Council
							ought to have received the second return— The Antimasons petitioned the
							Governor and Council to take the opinion of the judges of the Supreme
							Court, which they refuse, because they entertain no doubt that the
							decision of the judge was wrong, Such is the Administration of Justice,
							when Masonry and Anti-masonry are at issue. The judge pronounces the
							Council wrong— The Council pronounce the judge wrong; and the Antimasons
							suffer by both decisions. I read also the second Canto of Zophiel, and
							wrote to my Son Charles about Insurance at the Mutual Office— Lost a
							rubber and game at whist.</p>

						<p>Rainy night and morning. Changes of wind, from North-east to South-west;
							and then to North-west— Showery day and cleared off at night. Finished
							my Letter to <persRef ref="rush-richard">Richard Rush</persRef>, and
							wrote one to <persRef ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Josiah Quincy jun<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi></persRef> He came immediately and expressed great
							mortification at the inferences drawn from his Letter in the Daily
							Advertiser of last Monday, concerning the publication of my Letter to
								<persRef ref="davis-john3">John Brazier Davis</persRef> of 6. April
							1832 in the same paper two days before.— He said <persRef
								ref="davis-ezra">Davis’s father</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u;u"
								>two brothers</persRef> had been in prodigious excitement at the
							publication of this Letter, one of the brothers having just returned
							from India—<hi rend="italic">why</hi> they were excited he did not
							state; but it was the crafty frenzy of Masonry— The pure Spirit which
							sunk <persRef ref="morgan-william2">Morgan</persRef> in the waters of
							the Niagara— They insisted upon Quincy’s writing and publishing the
							Letter which he did, and urged him to make it stronger— He suffered
							himself to be made their tool, and after I had told him that the Letter
							was mine, and had been published with my assent, he published this
							declaration that he was the administrator of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Davis, and that he had never seen this Letter—the effect of
							which was to make a question of its authenticity, and accordingly the
							Newspapers opposed to my election charge me with forging my own Letter—
							And all this because <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H.
								Everett</persRef> in publishing the Letter, foolishly stated that
							the Letter was found among Davis’s papers after his death— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy was so much mortified and in so
							much terror of getting into difficulty himself that my resentment at his
							publication subsided into compassion— He professed a disposition to do
							any thing in his power to repair the injury he had done me— I desired
							him to communicate my Letter to him, to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Davis’s family and to assure them that asserting my own right to publish
							my own Letter at my pleasure, I would not have consented to its
							publication, if I had been aware that they had the slightest objection
							to it. And then I should leave him to take such measures as he himself
							should think proper, to remove the effect <pb n="156" type="ms"/>of the
							inferences drawn by the Boston Courier, dishonourable to me, from his
							Statement. Both of which he promised to do.— I read the third Canto of
							Zophiel— The Poem is a singular mixture of the story of <persRef ref="tobit">Tobit</persRef>, of the
							Heathen Mythology, and of the Rosicrusian demonology.</p>

						<p>Again a clear sky and a fine day— My Son <persRef key="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> went to Boston, and <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> came back with him to dinner. <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> went with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> after dinner, and
							paid a number of visits to take leave— I read parts of several
							pamphlets— At 6 O’Clock this Evening, my Son John, with his wife, his
							second daughter, <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Georgiana
								Frances</persRef>, her Nurse <persRef ref="goode-eleanor">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Goode</persRef>, and the Mulatto boy
								<persRef ref="thomas-alfred">Alfred Thomas</persRef> left us to
							return to Washington— <persRef ref="gillet-simon">Gillet</persRef> with
							the Quincy Stage, and a pair of horses, took them to Dedham where they
							are to pass the Night and await the Stage from Boston to Providence
							to-morrow Morning and they proceed by Stage, Steamer and Railway as fast
							as they can go, to Washington. This was to me, a melancholy parting. A
							strong presentiment weighs upon my mind that this is the last visit he
							will make to Quincy with his family; and that he goes to a destiny
							towards which I cannot look with composure— We are all in the hands of a
							merciful God: but human life wears away, all must, and by the general
							Law of moral as well as physical nature, that which has flourished must
							have its time for decay: and when that has once begun, nothing can
							arrest its course—it must perish— Such is the lot to which I myself am
							verging and which seems to extend with irreversible proclivity to my
							family— My Son John had devoted himself with the most unbounded filial
							affection and duty to my fallen Fortunes— He has been my kindest
							friend—my Steward, my Housekeeper, my Secretary, and my social
							companion— I had provided for him by the purchase of the Columbian
							Mills, a reputable, and I had a reasonable hope, would prove a
							profitable occupation— He gave to it the most assiduous and intelligent
							industry— It has failed by no fault or neglect of his, and has involved
							him and me heavily in debt. The disappointment preys like a gangrene
							upon his Spirits— It is now a year and a half since he was attacked with
							a disease in his eyes, which almost deprived him of sight— In July of
							last year he came with me from Washington to Philadelphia to consult
								<persRef ref="physick-philip">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Physick</persRef> upon that complaint, but D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Physick was absent from Philadelphia, and he did not see
							him— He consulted <persRef ref="hopkinson-john">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hopkinson</persRef> however, who made light of it, and
							John returned without relief to Washington.— I parted from him then as
							now, with an evil-boding mind, and an almost breaking heart— He has
							within these few weeks partially recovered his sight—may he wholly
							recover his sangwine Spirit and his active Industry, and obtain a
							blessing upon it—a more honest Soul, or more tender heart never breathed
							on the face of this Earth— O, if agonizing prayer could prevail! but may
							my Soul be prepared for whatever may befall. <persRef ref="kirk-john"
								>John Kirke</persRef> went with them to Dedham, and returned about
							10 at Night. I read the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Canto of
							Zophiel. The Convention of National Republicans at Worcester unanimously
							nominated <persRef ref="davis-john4">John Davis</persRef> as their
							Candidate for Governor.</p>

								type="ms"/>My Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							came out from Boston— <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi

							him, to suggest to him for my consideration the expediency of my
							withdrawing my name as a Candidate for the Office of Governor of the
							State in favour of <persRef ref="davis-john4">John Davis</persRef>— To
							this step Everett had been urged by <persRef ref="bancroft-george"
								>George Bancroft</persRef>, Davis’s brother in Law, who after the
							unanimous nomination stipulated for by Davis, as the condition of his
							acceptance, came post haste to charge Edward Everett to negotiate with
							me to withdraw, in favour of Davis my name from the nomination— I had
							told <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H. Everett</persRef>,
							that if the Convention at Worcester would nominate his brother Edward,
							or any man, whom the Antimasons would support, I would cheerfully
							withdraw my name, and Edward supposes that if I would withdraw now, a
							part of the Antimasons would support Davis— I desired Charles to say to
							Edward Everett that I had the same disposition to do any thing in my
							power that was honest to restore Union and harmony to the National
							Republican party, and that I wished him to make his proposition to me in
							writing. Charles said he was confident Everett would not write. I
							desired him to say to him in that case, that if he would come and see me
							I would converse with him on the subject— He will probably not do this,
							for on reflection he will be ashamed of the project he has undertaken,
							and will say no more about it— Charles said <persRef ref="quincy-josiah"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Quincy</persRef> had been to
							him about the matter of my Letter to <persRef ref="davis-john3">John B.

							at the North end of the Nursery, and a row of dwarf Apples, with Pear
							Cores, Peach and Plum Stones between two Peach trees in the Garden.
								<persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H. Everett</persRef> was
							here; and gave me some account of the proceedings at the Worcester
							Convention of National Republicans— A nominating Committee of two
							members from each Congressional District was appointed, excepting
								<persRef ref="shaw-henry">Shaw’s</persRef> district from which there
							was but one member at the Convention— This Committee were about five
							hours out, and could not make a majority for any one Candidate— They
							finally reported the names of <persRef ref="silsbee-nathaniel">N.
								Silsbee</persRef> and <persRef ref="calhoun-william">William B.
								Calhoun</persRef>— A young man from Boston named <persRef ref="u"
								>Park</persRef>, moved to add the name of <persRef ref="davis-john4"
								>John Davis</persRef>, and spoke slightingly of the two men, whose
							names were returned— <persRef ref="grennell-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Grennell</persRef> who had been a
							member of the nominating Committee said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Davis had declared that he would not accept the nomination on account of
							ill health, and other reasons— His name was nevertheless added— A
							committee was then appointed to enquire if he would accept, and they
							reported that he would, and he was then nominated unanimously, by
							acclamation— Everett said that finding it would be impossible to carry
							in the Convention a nomination of me, he had intended not to attend the
							Convention; but that two or three days before the Meeting, several of
							the party in Boston had thought the Worcester Convention might nominate
							his brother <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward</persRef>— That Davis
							himself had been in his favour; but that it was impossible to get up a
							nomination of him in the Convention. Alexander said he had declined
							being on the State Committee of which he has been two or three years the
							Chairman, and <persRef ref="sullivan-william">William Sullivan</persRef>
							is appointed in his place— He said he had gone to Worcester, in company
							with William Sullivan, and had found <pb n="158" type="ms"/>him
							exceedingly prejudiced against me— That he was generally much influenced
							by <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>, and he had told him that Webster was for
							confirming the nomination of the Antimasonic convention— But it had no
							effect upon him— Sullivan has the double venom of Hartford Convention
							federalism and of spurious Masonry in his blood. I told Everett that
							Sullivan was one of <persRef ref="otis-harrison">Otis’s</persRef>
							compurgators, in their attack upon me in 1829. and that he had been
							confronted with a book of his own, upon Morals, in a debate in the
							Legislature, when it was proved that the Masons had bought him with his
							Land— It was a curiosity that the Worcester Convention appointed a
							Committee of which Everett himself is Chairman, to write the Address to
							the People in support of the nomination— I said to him that I had one
							request to make with respect to that—which was that he would be sparing
							of my name in it. He said that he had not yet begun the writing of it—
							That he had intended to say something respectful and complimentary of
							me, in it. I desired him to take no notice of me at all— The Convention
							had taken none, though he knew that the whole of their proceedings were
							impelled by the single motive of excluding me; and that any token of
							respect in their name to me would be too gross a mockery— They had
							treated me, much as the Legislature of New-York had treated <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">DeWitt Clinton</persRef> when they turned him
							out from being a Canal Commissioner<hi rend="strikethrough">s</hi>.
							Everett said that he had acted with the National Republican party, upon
							public principle; but he thought he should decline a re-election to the
							Senate of the State. The masonic faction was so strong it was impossible
							to resist them; and if he should decline he thought he should leave the
							State— He spoke also about his publication of my Letter to <persRef
								ref="davis-john3">John Brazier Davis</persRef>; upon which I said
								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Quincy</persRef> was to write something to be published, after which

							that neither he, nor Davis’s family knew of its existence— I desired him
							to add that he had also seen Davis’s Letter to me to which mine was an
							answer; and that he would enquire of <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2"
								>Governor Lincoln</persRef>, if he had not received from me a Letter

							writing for the promotion of my own election—not even by the refutation
							of the basest calumnies. In all my election contests therefore, my
							character is at the mercy of every Slanderer; and Slander is so
							effective a weapon in all our elections, that the Candidates for the
							highest Offices, use it without scruple against each other. It never was

									rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams’s</persRef>— I was at
							home alone, and after giving a lesson of reading to <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">my Granddaughter</persRef>, I spent the remainder
							of it in writing— As I write my subject expands before me, till I become
							bewildered, with it, and find myself like a mariner who should embark
							upon an excursion for pleasure, and should Sail till he lost sight of
							Land, and should then discover that he had neither chart nor compass
							onboard— The waters deepen as I go; and the bottom is already beyond the
							reach of my line. <persRef ref="spear-william">William Spear</persRef>
							was here this morning, and proposed to advertise the sale of the wood
							remaining on the <persRef ref="borland-leonard">Borland</persRef> lot,
							for the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of November, to which I
							assented—intending to leave this place for Washington, the last day of
							this Month. His brother <persRef ref="spear-daniel">Daniel</persRef>,
							the Deacon, is still confined, chiefly to his house, and will probably

								>Robbins</persRef>, in the morning from John 6.12. [“]Gather up the
							fragments that remain, that nothing be lost” and in the afternoon from

							cursed.” The discourses were sensible: that of the morning
							especially—but the delivery was sluggish and drawling— The auditory was
							very thin—the day being tempestuous and showery— There was rain almost
							all night— I read the third Sermon of the 5<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
							>Saurin</persRef>—upon the last Discourses of Jesus Christ to his
							Apostles— For the first Sunday of Lent; or of what he calls the Passion
							Weeks— The text is the first verse of the 14<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Chapter of John, and there is a note that to derive any
							useful fruit from the Sermon, it is indispensably necessary, before
							perusing it, to read the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> 15<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							chapters of John. It is less impressive than some other Discourses of
							the same collection— The Dutch reformed Churches, and those of the
							French Protestants, keep the festivals of Christmas and Easter, and this
							volume is occasional; containing a Sermon delivered upon each of the
							days having reference to the Birth, Death or Resurrection of Christ—
							This was all the reading that I could accomplish this day, and with the
							minutes of Diary for yesterday and this day, absorbed my whole time— I
							heard <persRef ref="adams-mary4">my Granddaughter</persRef> read twice,
							and in the evening wade through 30 pages of <persRef ref="dew-thomas"
								>Professor Dew’s</persRef> Review of the Debate, on the project for

							produced by the existence of Slavery in a free community— To the mind of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dew, Slavery is the source of all
							Virtue in the heart of the Master.— His argument against the
							practicability, of abolishing Slavery by means of Colonization, appears
							to me conclusive, nor do I believe that emancipation is the object of
							the Colonization Society, though it may be the daydream of some of its
							members. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dews argument that the danger of
							Insurrection among the Slaves diminished in proportion as their relative

							Letters from Silesia, in the Lectures upon Rhetoric and Oratory; in
							occasional fugitive pieces in verse—original and translated, and finally
							in this Poem of Dermot MacMorrogh which is original and at once a work
							of History, Imagination and Poetry— It has come to a third Edition, and
							will now be forgotten; as will be all my other writings in prose and
							verse— Like the rest of American Poetry, it resembles the juice of
							American grapes— It has not in ripening, the property of acquiring
							alcohol enough to keep it in preservation— I have pushed my experiment
							on the public temper far enough.— In the Evening I read to the Ladies in
							an Edinburgh Review of 1823 the Article upon the Memoirs of <persRef

							History of the latter part of the reign of <persRef ref="george-ii"

							unwillingness to shackle myself with obligations to controul my

							manifesting a tendency to encroach upon personal freedom; and from an
							opinion that the cause itself is so well sustained by others, and so

						<p>The preacher this day was a young man by the name of <persRef
								ref="burton-warren">Burton</persRef>; his morning text was from 2.
							Corinthians 4.17 [“]For our light affliction, which is but for a moment,
							worketh for us a far more exceeding, and eternal weight of glory.” On
							temporary afflictions— In the afternoon it was upon Anger—from Proverbs
							16.32. He that is slow to Anger is better than the mighty; and he that
							ruleth his Spirit, than he that taketh a city— They were both edifying
							discourses—particularly the latter, but very indifferently delivered—
							Our unitarian preachers are almost universally cold and drawling in
							their elocution— Their Sermons are disquisitions upon abstract points of
							morals, and they are so dependent upon their Parish that they dare not
							set before them their real vices and corruptions— There was rather more
							boldness in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burton’s addresses to his
							hearers than is usual— I read the fourth Sermon of the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef>, upon the Sacerdotal prayer of Jesus Christ—
							Preached on one of the Sundays of the Passion—that is, of Lent— The text
							is the whole 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of John, and it
							is a sequel to the preceding Sermon, which was upon the 14<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and
								16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapters. Saurin always reasons
							upon the mysteries of his doctrines as if he did not himself believe his
							own argument— He always entangles himself with objections, which he
							feebly attempts, and is unable to refute— In this Sermon he runs foul of
							the unity of Jesus Christ, with God the father— He maintains that Jesus
							Christ is one, with the father as God—and also as Mediator between God
							and Man— He says that this unity of Christ, as Mediator, with God, has
							its degrees—(degrees of unity!) and that as Mediator, Christ was never
							in error, but that he did not always know the whole truth— The whole of
							this Sermon may be called Gallimatius. Well may he apostrophise the
							mysteries of Redemption, and exclaim how far they are above our
							expressions and our thoughts!— It rained, or rather sprinkled the whole
							day, and I rode home from Meeting. Morning and Afternoon— The auditories
							were very thin. Notice was given after the morning service, that
								<persRef ref="frost-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frost</persRef> would deliver his Lecture on Temperance, at the
							Episcopal Church at half past six O’Clock this Evening— I intended to
							have gone to it, but it rained heavily in the Evening and I concluded
							not to go. I resumed my Diary in this book, and wrote a long Letter to

						<p>There was a sprinkling rain continued through the whole day—which
							confined me to the house; excepting about a half an hour after dinner,
							when I planted in my Nursery 5. Dwarf Apples whole, in a row opposite
							the central Apple-tree along the Eastern fence. I was then obliged to
							retreat within the house again— I was very steadily occupied the whole
							day and Evening. My Grand-Child <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Mary-Louisa</persRef> has been these two days unwell, and her
							reading Lessons have been abridged— She yesterday finished reading the
							Child’s own Book, and I gave her this Morning the Fables for the
							Nursery— But upon trial I found she was not sufficiently advanced for
							reading them, and I put her into the blue Spelling-Book— I began and
							wrote three pages <pb n="167" type="ms"/>of a Letter to <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>, in reply to his
							Letter of nine pages to me— The more I reflect upon that Letter the more
							unfair, bitter and rancorous it appears to me— He imputes to my
							Anti-masonic publications the falling off of his Supporters, and the
							consequent necessity to him of declining a Re-election— I believe him to
							be mistaken— My Letters have given strength to the argument of the Anti
							Masonic Cause, but they have roused and stimulated all the energies of
							all my personal Adversaries, against the Cause espoused by me— All
							personal opposition to me redounds to the benefit of Masonry— This will
							be the only cement to keep the National Republican party together— They
							would now go to pieces but for the rallying point of opposition to me—
							It is two years since I published the Letters on the Masonic
							controversy, with which I began, and one since the publication of those
							upon the Entered Apprentice’s Oath— In that time the numbers of the Anti
							Masonic party do not appear to have increased in this Commonwealth at
							all— They have apparently diminished, in New-York and Pennsylvania— They
							are wavering in Rhode-Island, and although they have atchieved a signal
							triumph in Vermont their power is precarious, and a more complete union
							between the two political parties, would yet prostrate anti-masonry—
							This controversy seems destined to destroy the comforts and tranquility
							of my last days, and to bring my life to close in hopeless conflict with
							the world.</p>

						<p>A Night and third day of steady though very moderate rain— Rather a

						<p><persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> went into Boston

									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Isaac Brooks</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="thaxter-anna">Miss Anna Thaxter</persRef> were here, and
							brought me a Letter from the <persRef ref="brooks-charles">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> Charles Brooks</persRef> of Hingham
							requesting a Letter of introduction to <persRef ref="lafayette">General
								La Fayette</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks is going
							to spend a year in Europe for the improvement of his health. He has
							obtained permission for that purpose from his Parish, and proposes to go
							next Tuesday from Boston to New-York, there to embark for Havre— My Son
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came from Boston and
							dined with us, and returned this Evening home. He has made his
							arrangements for having <persRef ref="adams-john17">his Son</persRef>
							baptized to-morrow, and invited his Mother, me, and <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> to go in, be present at
							the Ceremony and dine with him— I had two or three interruptions
							yesterday which prevented me from finishing the transplantation of my
							trees, and this day I was prevented entirely from resuming it— I wrote
							upon my Letter to <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
								Lincoln</persRef>, but the subject enlarges as I proceed— Though I
							rise at four in the morning, and write till ten at Night, my progress is
							exceedingly slow and I am very diffuse for want of method— But my daily
							minutes of the chapters of the Bible which I read: my Diary, and the
							Letters I am occasionally obliged to answer absorb so large a portion of
							my time that they break in upon the continuity of my argument
							continually— Hence I am seldom able to write any thing of it after
							breakfast— This Evening I wrote a Letter of Introduction for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Brooks to General La Fayette, to
							whom I send copies of my 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July
							Oration at Quincy, and my Eulogy upon <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef> of 25 August 1831— I
							wrote also a Letter to my Son Charles, to deliver to him, with <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Seal, and took a copy of the
							Letter— The child <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef> was
							very sick, and had some fever— <persRef ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Holbrook</persRef> attended her. My
							teaching her to read is of course totally suspended.</p>

						<p>I went into Boston this Morning, with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> and <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C.
								Smith</persRef>—we stop’d and left her at <persRef
								ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H
								Foster’s</persRef>, and went on to my Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house N. 3. Hancock Avenue—
							We thence went to the first Church in Summer Street, where <persRef
								ref="adams-john17">my Grandson</persRef> was baptized by <persRef
								ref="frothingham-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frothingham</persRef> by the name of John Quincy, and may it please
							almighty God, that the child may live and grow up with his blessing and
							make his name respectable and useful in his own person— <persRef
								ref="stevenson-jgreeley">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Stevenson</persRef> had a <persRef ref="u">daughter</persRef>
							baptized at the same time. Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
								wife</persRef> held their child during the ceremony, and Charles
							presented him at the baptismal font. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frothingham afterwards preached from 1. Corinthians 1.27 “But God hath
							chosen the foolish things of the world, to confound the wise; and God
							hath chosen the weak things of the world, to confound the things which
							are mighty”—one of the most excellent Sermons that I ever heard— The
							theme is rich, and it was treated with great power— We all dined with
							Charles— I gave him <persRef key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Seal
							at arms, and the Letter I had written to him last Evening— I left with
							him also the Letter to <persRef ref="lafayette">General La
								Fayette</persRef>, with the copies of my two Discourses, to be given
							to <persRef ref="brooks-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								Brooks</persRef>— Charles showed me five Volumes of my fathers and
								<persRef key="adams-abigail">mothers</persRef> Manuscript Letters
							which he has had bound— After dinner Charles took home to Medford,
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Reed</persRef>, the
							Nurse of his Son, from his birth, but who now leaves him. <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef>
							came after dinner and spent an hour with me— He is still friendly to me;
							and flatters himself that a portion of the National Republican party
							will cast their votes for me. In this he is certainly mistaken— Single
							individuals using no influence in Elections beyond themselves may vote
							for me; but the parties are so organized and disciplined that the
							National Republicans may probably carry their whole ticket— The excess
							of zeal inspired by the single motive of opposition to me, will more
							than balance any defection from the National Republican ranks in my
							favour— At half past three we left Charles’s House, and returned to
							Quincy—reaching home before five— <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">Price
								Greenleaf</persRef> was here in the Evening, and asked me to lend
							him <persRef ref="michaux-francois">Michaux’s</persRef> Silva America,
							for the winter, which I readily promised— I began to read but could not
							finish the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin’s</persRef> 5<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Volume, on the Passion.— I had more comfort, upon retiring
							to bed with my Prayers and my hopes this Evening, than I have had for
							some years— May they be realized!</p>

							will be impossible for me to finish it as I would wish before my
							departure for Washington; nor there where I shall want many books and
							pamphlets to which I must resort— I have also been compelled to write
							with so much precipitation that there will be many weak points in it of
							which advantage will be taken— I hope I shall not suffer it to go
							without a thorough revisal, and severe self-criticism— It takes me
							almost entirely from my Garden and Nursery, so that I shall not have
							time for transplanting my trees— I did merely transplant a seedling Pear
							tree, from Pot N. 3. to the Garden, and planted in the Pot, filled with
							fresh Earth one whole dwarf Apple and 4 [symbols] <persRef
								ref="adams-josiah">Deacon Adams</persRef> was here this morning, and

									>r.</hi> I P Davis</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="townsend-alexander">Alexander Townsend</persRef> came out from
							Boston and paid me a visit. Davis had a book recently published in
							England, by a Traveller in the United States named <persRef ref="u"
								>Foot</persRef>, in which there are engravings of the old man of the
							Mountain, of <persRef ref="crawford-ethan">Ethan Crawford’s</persRef>
							<pb n="171" type="ms"/>house—and of the Notch of the White Mountains—
							The profile is not well executed—the others are sufficiently well done—
							Davis has been to Washington, since we were in New-Hampshire— Townsend
							told me that in some of the Philadelphia papers, my Fable of the Plague
							in the forest published in the Token of 1834. was attacked as a
							Plagiarism from Florian—and that the extracts from <persRef
								ref="florian-jean">Florian</persRef> were given the pretended
							Plagiarisms; but there was no similarity, and far less of identity,
							between the passages quoted and those pretended to be borrowed from
							them— I said that the charge of stealing from Florian was
							ridiculous—there was not a line of his in my fable; which was taken from
								<persRef ref="lafontaine-jean">La Fontaines</persRef> Animaux
							Malades de la Peste—not as a Plagiarism; but as La Fontaine himself had
							taken from <persRef ref="phaedrus">Phaedrus</persRef>, from <persRef
								ref="aesop">AEsop</persRef>, and from every fabulist who had written
							before him— <persRef ref="laharpe-jean">La Harpe</persRef> expressly
							says that La Fontaine invented nothing, and it is affirmed that not one
							of his whole collection of Fables is original— I have made free with him
							as he made free with others— Davis said that the same view of it was
							taken by a writer who defended me in the New-York Evening Post, a paper
							where he should not have expected it— My fable is told in my own
							way;—borrowing from La Fontaine what I could well adapt to the English
							Language; but varying the details at my pleasure— <persRef
								ref="bass-lewis">Lewis Bass</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="field-william">William Field</persRef> were here this Evening,

								Adams</persRef> went into Boston this morning, and returned home to

							with us— I had a succession of visitors the whole day long, which did in
							no wise advance the progress of my Letter to <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>— A <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Procter</persRef> came here from
							Boston and gave me a long and wearisome account of a claim upon the
							Government of the United States, of indemnity for certain English goods.
							Broadcloths, seized by him as a Custom-house Officer at Castine during
							the late War; but which were restored by order of the Government to
							their owners— He says he was at an expense of more than eight thousand
							dollars, in those Seizures, and in the prosecutions which succeeded
							them, which have never been paid. He thinks the Government, ought fully
							to indemnify him. He dwelt in his narrative upon so many minute and
							uninteresting details that it became almost insupportable to me—luckily
								<persRef ref="thayer-solomon">Solomon Thayer</persRef> came in and
							interrupted him— I advised him to prepare a Petition to Congress; and
							promised if he would send it to me, to present it to the House of
							Representatives— I had sent word to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thayer that I wished to see him. He came, and I read to him the Letter
							from the <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of War</persRef>, and the
							Letter from <persRef ref="edwards-james">J. L. Edwards</persRef> to him
							containing their objections to the increase of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Thayer’s pension— He explained the principal one to my
							Satisfaction— I desired him to make the same Statement in writing—and
							promised to take it on with me to Washington and discuss the matter with
							the Secretary of War— <persRef ref="bartlett-zacheus">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Zacheus Bartlett</persRef> was next
							here, and gave me two affidavits in the support of claims to Pensioners
							named <persRef ref="u;u">Burges</persRef>, brothers belonging to
							Plymouth—he named a third, which I took down in a pencil mark— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bartlett said Something upon Politics, but
							not much. After him came a <persRef ref="battles-gerard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gerard Battles</persRef>, from
							Scituate, accompanied by a neighbour of his, a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Stodder</persRef>— Battles thinks he
							has a claim to be paid for certain sails of a boat belonging to him,
							which were taken from him, in the year 1776, for Soldiers tents. He
							admits that he was paid for them at the time: but it was in paper money
							which <pb n="172" type="ms"/>was good for nothing, and he thinks he
							ought to be paid for his Sails again— Upon further conversation I found
							that his Sails had been taken under the authority of the Provincial
							Government, and told him he must petition the General Court of the
							Commonwealth. Battles was himself a Soldier during the Revolutionary
							War, and has a Pension of 80 dollars a year—but he says he was obliged
							to pay 12 dollars for his papers to procure it. I had an afternoon visit
							from <persRef ref="hallett-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> B.
								F. Hallett</persRef>, and <persRef ref="gassett-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gassett</persRef> who took tea with

							trial of <persRef ref="avery-ephraim">E. K. Avery</persRef>; and that of
							the trial of <persRef ref="clough-ebenezer">E. Clough</persRef> for
							Embracery— I finished reading the second Volume of <persRef
								ref="thomson-charles">C. Thomson’s</persRef> Translation of the
							Septuagint Bible, and of the Book of Psalms—where I shall pause for the
							present—to proceed in the reading of the next volume, on my return here
							next Spring.— This Translation is upon the whole far inferior to the
							common English Bible—and in no part of it more than the Book of Psalms—
							My Diary lingers.</p>

						<p>We have a succession of frosty Nights and cold days. My Garden and
							Nursery are repulsive, and I have less and less time for working in

							resumed the reading of the common Bible with the Book of Job, but wrote
							no minutes— <persRef ref="adams-ebenezer">Ebenezer Adams</persRef> was
							here, and I settled with him an account for six Cords of wood— Settled
							also several other Bills— <persRef ref="thayer-solomon">Solomon
								Thayer</persRef> was here and gave me a paper containing a new
							statement in support of his claim for an increase of Pension— After

							money to make up 200 dollars for <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>my wife</persRef> who proposes to depart to-morrow for Washington—
							I was about an hour at Charles’s house, and then returned home—which I
							reached before seven— Evening employed in writing with much difficulty—
							Charles told me that my Fable of the Plague in the forest was published
							in the National Intelligencer, with a remark that some persons had
							perceived in it a political bearing, which they, were unable to
							understand— I thought of <persRef ref="swift-jonathan">Swift’s</persRef>
							Key to the Lock, and of old <persRef ref="u">Captain Brown’s</persRef>
							answer to me on board the Frigate Alliance in 1779. Upon my asking him
							whether any such People as those mentioned in <persRef
								ref="lemuelgulliver">Gulliver’s</persRef> Travels existed in any
							part of the world—he said yes—they were all to be found in the Isle of
							Man— My Fable has brought the <persRef ref="goodrich-samuel">Editor of
								the Token</persRef> into trouble— The book has been annually
							published, several years in succession, and has been regularly puffed
							and gone into oblivion. This year it has been furiously attacked, and as
							faintly and insidiously defended— The Baltimore Patriot asks if it is
							the Plague in the Forest that has given the fever to the Boston Editors—
							They have not named the Fable, but assailed the whole book of which it
							constitutes about four pages. This is one of the imps the hopeful
							progeny of the union of free-masonry, with Essex-Juntoism, and Hartford
							Convention federalism.</p>
