						<p>Heard this morning <persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Smith</persRef> at the Presbyterian Church, from 2.
							Timothy 4.8. [“]Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of

									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Taliaferro</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="whittlesey-elisha">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elisha
								Whittlesey</persRef> of Ohio— Visits after Church was over, from
								<persRef ref="armstrong-andrew">Andrew Armstrong</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="munroe-thomas">Thomas Munroe</persRef>— After dinner,
							at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read prayers for the first Sunday in Advent, the beginning of the
							Ecclesiastical year, and preached to an almost empty house a short
							Sermon from Isaiah 60.19. “The Sun shall be no more thy light, by day;
							neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord
							shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God, thy Glory.” There
							is rhythmical measure in this verse, as in many other passages of the
							prophet <persRef ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef>, in the common English
							Bible; and it gives the Book of Isaiah its high tone of moral sublimity—
							The thought in this verse is exalted and highly poetical, and the last
							clause “and thy God thy Glory,” sounds like the close of a Sapphic
							verse— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley’s discourse, as usual, was
							an affectionate exhortation to his hearers to take care of their own
							Souls— Evening spent in preparation for to-morrow.</p>

						<p><date>2. IV. </date>Monday.— Twenty-third Congress—first Session</p>
						<p>At eleven this morning I walked to the Capitol, and took my Seat, N. 26.
							as a member of the House of Representatives— At precisely twelve O’Clock
							the <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Clerk of the House of the last
								Congress</persRef> called the members to order and the names of the
							members were called over by States—231 members answered to the call, but
							when he came to the State of Kentucky, <persRef ref="allan-chilton"
								>Chilton Allan</persRef> a member from the State, rose and remarked
							that there were two members claiming the Seat for the fifth District of
							that State— Some enquiry arose who was entered on the Clerk’s roll, as
							the member, and the Clerk said it was <persRef ref="moore-thomas3"
								>Thomas P. Moore</persRef>. There was a discussion of more than an
							hour, in which <persRef ref="wayne-james">Wayne</persRef> moved that
								<persRef ref="archer-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Archer</persRef> of Virginia should take the Chair—but finally the
							Clerk was allowed to act as Chairman— <persRef ref="letcher-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Letcher</persRef> finally proposed
							that both he and Moore should withdraw, and without voting for speaker
							let the other members be sworn and the Speaker chosen, and bring on the
							question who was to represent the district, before the house after it
							should be organized— The rest of the roll was then called and the
							ballots taken when <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Andrew
								Stevenson</persRef> of Virginia had 142 votes of 218 and was
							elected— There were 13 who did not vote 10 blanks 39 for <persRef
								ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> 15 for <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> and 12 scattering
							votes. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stevenson was conducted to the
							Chair by Lewis Williams, and made a short frothy Speech of
							acknowledgment concluding with a flourish of tautology about making the
							Union imperishable and immortal—upon which there was a wise clapping of
							hands— He was then sworn by Lewis Williams, and administered the Oath to
							support the Constitution of the United States to all the members
							present— The House then proceed to ballot for a Clerk—<persRef
								ref="mann-joel">Joel K. Mann</persRef> of Pennsylvania nominated
								<persRef ref="franklin-walter">Walter S. Franklin</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="king-henry">Henry King</persRef>, also of Pennsylvania
							nominated Matthew S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Clair Clark— At the
							first ballot 231 votes were taken—every member present Clark had 113
							votes and Franklin 107. but at the third Franklin had 117 and Clarke
							110. Franklin was elected. A Message was received from the Senate
							announcing that they had formed a Quorum, and chosen a Committee on
							their part to join one on the part of the House, to wait on the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President of the United States</persRef> and
							inform him that a Quorum of both Houses were <pb n="194" type="ms"/>were
							assembled, and ready to receive from him any communication that he may
							be pleased to make—but the House did not act upon it They adjourned at
							about 4. O’Clock. I found my Carriage at the head of the Avenue, and
							rode home— I found myself much exhausted and more mortified at the
							failure of Clarke’s re-election— There never was a better Clerk, and his
							dismissal is an act of heartless cruelty— It is also a dark foreboding
							of what is to follow through the Session.— Towards the close of the
							Evening I was able to write, and finished my Address to the People of
							Massachusetts.</p>

						<p>A young <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Vickar</persRef>, Son of <persRef ref="mcvickar-john">Professor
								M’Vickar</persRef> of Columbia College at New-York, brought me this
							morning a Letter of introduction from his father. At the House <persRef
								ref="ward-aaron">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward</persRef> of
							New-York offered a joint Resolution to wait on the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> to notify him of the
							Meeting of Congress— But the Resolution of the Senate to that effect was
							taken up and concurred in— Ward who wanted to figure as a member of the
							Committee to go to the President, forgot the preliminary Order for a
							Message to the Senate and one to the President announcing the
							organization of the House, and the election of <persRef
								ref="stevenson-andrew">Andrew Stevenson</persRef> as Speaker. I was
							obliged to move these orders myself and only one of them that of the
							Message to the Senate was adopted. These are formalities of order
							falling into neglect— The practice has even ceased of the members
							producing their Credentials at the Clerk’s Table— I delivered mine
							yesterday; but asked to have them returned to me this day—and they were
							promised me. The Serjeant at Arms <persRef ref="randolph-thomas3">T. B.
								Randolph</persRef> was re-elected by ballot 158 of 220 votes.—
								<persRef ref="carr-overton">Overton Carr</persRef> was by nomination
							without ballot reappointed Door-keeper, and <persRef ref="hunter-john"
								>T. W. Hunter</persRef> Assistant Door-keeper— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward reported from the Committee to wait
							upon the President, that he would make a Communication to Congress at
							one O’Clock and at that hour the Message came— Its most peculiar
							characteristic is a bitter invective upon the Bank of the United States—
							Not a word about Alabama— It was laid on the Table, and 10,000 copies of
							it ordered to be printed. A motion was made by <persRef
								ref="sutherland-joel">Sutherland</persRef> of Pennsylvania, that the
							Rules and Orders of the last House of Representatives should be adopted
							for the present House until further order. <persRef ref="hubbard-henry"
								>Hubbard</persRef> of New Hampshire moved an exception of two
							rules—those prescribing the appointment of the standing Committees, and
							the numbers of which they are to consist— Instead of seven members he
							would have nine and instead of three, five— <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>Polk</persRef> of Tennessee moved as an addition to the rules that
							the members should wear their hats no longer in the House, unless by
							Permission— <persRef ref="patton-john">Patton</persRef> of Virginia
							proposed another change—and that the Speaker should be required to vote
							in all cases. Sutherland who sits at the extremity of the house near the
							door said he would vote for Polk’s motion not to allow the wearing of
							Hats, if Polk who has a warm seat in the centre of the House would
							exchange Seats with him— <persRef ref="burges-tristam">Burges</persRef>
							of Rhode-Island said it would be well for the House to think not only of
							the Hats, but of what was under them— The old Rules were adopted with
							the exceptions, the consideration of which was postponed till to-morrow—
							Adjourned soon after two— <persRef ref="franklin-walter"
								>Franklin</persRef> the new Clerk, in reading the Message—read for
							Central America—Controul America. I spent the whole of this Evening in
							writing</p>

						<p>I wrote a Letter to <persRef ref="verplanck-gulian">Gulian C.
								Verplanck</persRef> of New-York; thanking him for a copy which he
							sent me of his Discourse upon the Right Moral influence and use of

								<persRef ref="allan-chilton">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Election between <persRef ref="moore-thomas3">T. P. Moore</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="letcher-robert">Robert P. Letcher</persRef>.— The
							question was upon Moore’s being sworn and taking the Seat. There were

								<persRef ref="burges-tristam">Burges</persRef> against him— <persRef

							a Session of Parliament— In the Postscript to which he says— There are
							several cases of contested Election— The Ministry as usual return their

							called for, and debated till near three O’Clock, when the house got
							tired, and a motion to adjourn was made— It was suspended to present to
							the House several Reports from the <persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke"
								>Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, among which was a very long
							one upon the removal of the deposits from the Bank of the United States—
							There was also a Report from the Treasurer, and one from the Engineer
							Department— The Reports were all laid upon the Table, and ordered to be
							printed, without reading—10000 copies of the Report on the removal of
							the deposits ordered— Adjourned about 3. O’Clock— I went to <persRef
								ref="dennis-littleton">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Littleton P

						<p><date>5. V. </date>Thursday.</p>
						<p>I wrote this Morning to <persRef ref="bartlett-zacheus">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Zacheus Bartlett</persRef> at
							Plymouth, and a short one to <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
								Lincoln</persRef> of Massachusetts instead of that one in forty
							pages, which I had written in reply to his strange Letter of the 14<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October. I have in this as in many
							other cases wasted much time and labour to no purpose.— Governor Lincoln
							is a man always meaning well, and possessing considerable talent— But
							elevated a little above his Sphere, and having been for nine successive
							years elected Governor of the State, the frequent resort to popular
							suffrage, and the gradual decline of popular favour, after possessing it
							very highly have made him timid, sensitive, and punctilious— His
							besetting Sin is pride—and whatever mortifies that throws him off his
							guard— His Temper masters his Judgment, and he stumbles— This has
							happened to him on various occasions— The Masonic controversy has driven
							him from his Office— Two years ago, the Antimasonic Convention being
							about to nominate a candidate for Governor wrote him a Letter asking his
							opinions upon the subject of Masonry— He took fire at being questioned,
							and answered them very satisfactorily as to Masonry; but in a tone, at
							which they took offence— They nominated me and I declined. They
							nominated <persRef ref="lathrop-samuel">Samuel Lathrop</persRef>, and by
							raising an Opposition to Lincoln, reduced his majority <pb n="196"
								type="ms"/>to 4 or 5000 in 1831. and to 2 or 3000 in 1832.— He saw
							the probability of losing his majority this year, and declined a
							re-election— It was a compulsive measure and has left him excessively
							sore— He imputes his loss of public favour to me and indulges his
							resentments— It was his influence that procured the nomination of
								<persRef ref="davis-john4">John Davis</persRef> against me; and a
							Letter from him that prevailed upon Davis to accept the nomination— This
							was the death-blow to the National Republican party which is now
							languishing and will die under it— His Letter of the 14<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> to me was written in a state of
							excitement, alarm, and jealousy; and he exposed himself in it to
							exemplary chastisement— More of it than can be necessary would be
							inflicted by my Letter of 40 pages, and I have now made less than two
							answer the purpose— At the house there was a debate of three hours upon
							two Resolutions, offered by <persRef ref="hardin-benjamin">B.
								Hardin</persRef> of Kentucky, that the Certificate presented by
								<persRef ref="moore-thomas3">Thomas P. Moore</persRef>, was not
							sufficient to entitle him to be sworn as a member of the House and that
							it should together with all the other evidence collected by him and by
								<persRef ref="letcher-robert">R. P. Letcher</persRef> his
							competitor, be referred to the Committee of Elections when chosen—
								<persRef ref="hawes-albert">Hawes</persRef> of Kentucky, <persRef
								ref="hubbard-henry">Hubbard</persRef> of New Hampshire, <persRef
								ref="beardsley-samuel">Beardsly</persRef> of New-York and <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> of Tennessee all stoutly maintained
							that Moore’s Certificate was sufficient to entitle him to be sworn—
								<persRef ref="allan-chilton">Allan</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="chilton-thomas">Chilton</persRef>, and Hardin of Kentucky, and
								<persRef ref="ellsworth-william">Ellsworth</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="huntington-jabez">Huntington</persRef> of Connecticut spoke
							against it, without effect— At last <persRef ref="archer-william"
								>Archer</persRef> of Virginia bolted from the party, and very truly
							said that Moore’s Certificate was on its face Evidence that he had not
							been elected, and that it was not only incomplete but
							self-contradictory— He was followed by <persRef ref="jones-seaborn"
								>Seaborn Jones</persRef> of Georgia, on the same side— Upon which it
							was announced that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Letcher had agreed that neither of them
							should be sworn till the Committee of Elections shall have examined and
							reported on the Evidence— Archer protested against any agreement between
							the parties, but the reference to the Committee was carried— The first
							Resolution was withdrawn, upon Moore’s withdrawing his claim to be
							sworn— A Resolution was then passed, for the appointment of the standing
							Committees increased in numbers to nine and five—which was ineffectually
							opposed by <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">Whittlesey</persRef> of
							Ohio. It was then resolved to go into Committee of the whole House on
							the State of the Union, next Monday, and the House about 4. adjourned
							over to Monday— I spent the Evening at <persRef

						<p>A number of visitors engaged almost the whole morning. I had various
							conversation with them all. <persRef ref="bell-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef> intimated to me, that
							the Senate would probably be managed by the understanding between
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> and <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>, and that there
							would be a majority of that body against the Administration at least not
							concurring in any mischievous measures of the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>.— <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pearce</persRef>
							of Rhode-Island, who took his Seat in the House Yesterday, told me the
							occasion of his writing to <persRef ref="kendall-amos">Amos
								Kendall</persRef> against <persRef ref="cranston-robert"
								>Cranston</persRef> the late Postmaster at Newport— Pearce said he
							had by his exertions kept this man in Office four years under this
							Administration <pb n="197" type="ms"/>and that last Summer, Cranston
							with the remnants of the old federal party and the National and Jackson
							Masons got up a Jackson man in opposition to him, and prevented his
							Election— That afterwards he, Pearce, having occasion to write to Amos
							Kendall, upon business, concerning his <persRef ref="u">Pearce’s
								Son</persRef>, had said to him, that he had always supported
							Cranston, but should support him no longer— He added that <persRef
								ref="u">Updike</persRef> his competitor had come out in favour of
							the Bank, and that he himself had come out in favour of the President’s
							reasons for removing the deposits from the U.S. Bank— That is said M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pearce, on the ground that the Charter is
							not to be renewed— This Letter Kendall shewed to <persRef ref="u"
								>Mallett</persRef> a friend of Cranston’s, and Mallett reported its
							contents not correctly to Cranston, which produced the attack by
							Cranston in Newspapers and handbills upon Pearce— And they set up
								<persRef ref="dixon-nathan">Dixon</persRef> a blue-light federalist
							against him— Now the whole of this Story, has an aukward aspect for
							Pearce— I did fully believe that it would not only defeat his election,
							but ruin forever his character— The means used against him were no doubt
							profligate and base, and no doubt originated in the Masonic lodges— The
							Masonic Nationals supported a Jackson man against him, and he in his
							desperation turned the tables upon them— But he was obliged to give his
							principles to the winds, and his mode of taking revenge of Cranston, by
							secret denunciation to Amos Kendall, is moral and political Asafoetida—
							It is a melancholy contemplation of human nature to think, that if
							Pearce had used none but honest means in his defence, he would in all
							probability have sunk under the combination against him— What an
							illustration too of a Government by a Kitchen Cabinet— To turn out
							Cranston from the Post-Office, Pearce addresses himself not to <persRef
								ref="barry-william">Barry</persRef> the Post-master General, but to
							Amos Kendall an Auditor of the Treasury— Amos turns out the Post-master,
							and then betrays Pearce his informant— How many dishonest men, says
								<persRef ref="montesquieu-charles">Montesquieu</persRef>, to one
							transaction!— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay was not in very good
							humour; and entertained me with the extraordinary sterility that he had
							found throughout the whole of his recent tour in Massachusetts,
							excepting in the valley of Connecticut river; and the leanness of the
							Cattle he had seen at Brighton—though he had met with good Cattle of the
							Durham breed, and eaten good beef in the State— <persRef

							meet his present conciliatory dispositions with a like return— I had

							and were Strangers to me— <persRef ref="martindale-henry">M<hi

							take the lead on the Administration side—another said he thought

							in the Boston Daily Advocate My visitors absorbed the morning. Before

						<p>Rain all Night and till nine or ten this Morning— Then a sweeping off of

							Church from Ecclesiastes 7.14. [“]In the day of prosperity be joyful,
							but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over
							against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.”
							The latter part of this verse is obscure, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Smith undertook to explain it. There is much matter, in this
							Chapter, and some melancholy views of human life— What a contrast
							between the tone and temper of <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon’s</persRef> Song and of the Ecclesiastes. I was not
							altogether satisfied with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith’s

							at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read the Evening prayer for the second Sunday in Advent, and preached
							from Hebrews 12:18–24. A text almost as long as the discourse—the last
							verse is “And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the
							blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of <persRef
								ref="abel">Abel</persRef>.”— This is a parallel between the Old and
							the new Covenant M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley said that the
							blood of Abel did not here mean his own blood—but the blood of his
							sacrifice, which is said to have been acceptable to the Lord—perhaps he
							is right, but it seems to be doubtful— The blood <pb n="199" type="ms"
							/>of sprinkling means baptism, but in the doctrine of the atonement,
							baptism is efficacious only, as typical of the washing in the blood of
							Christ, and the natural comparison of that is with the blood of Abel,
							and not of his Sacrifice— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley’s
							parallel between the Old and New Covenant was short, and the drift of
							his discourse as usual exhorting his hearers to rely for Salvation upon
							the blood of the lamb.— <persRef ref="jesup-thomas;jesup-ann">General

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Polk</persRef> of Tennessee,
							making a few remarks— He is now the Chairman of the Committee of Ways

							agreed to without opposition. My Colleague in <pb n="200" type="ms"/>the

							appointing them by ballot—on this motion the <persRef ref="white-hugh"
								>President Hugh Lawson White</persRef> had asked yesterday to be

							being taken he was excused; and the Resolution for appointing the

							is not a member of the present Congress, and is a loss to the public
							Service— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard is a Senator for six
							years— Doctor Condict had his arm in a sling, having broken it, some
							weeks since— At the House, <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">the
								Speaker</persRef> called over the States, for the presentation of
							Petitions— I presented that of <persRef ref="u">Hedges</persRef> and
							others for an Appropriation to build a Custom-House at Plymouth, and it
							was referred to the Committee of Commerce— After the Petitions were gone
							through according to the rule, the States should have been called over
							again, for the members to offer Resolutions, but that was postponed till
							to-morrow— The House went into Committee of the whole on the State of
							the Union, and the Speaker, to my astonishment and confusion called me
							to the Chair— He had once done so at the last Session, and once at the
							Session before upon Committees on private bills of no importance, and
							finished in ten minutes; and I had no suspicion he would do otherwise
							now— I was attentively reading a newspaper, when I heard him pronounce
							my name, and looking up found he was just leaving the Chair— I took it
							somewhat aukwardly, and it was some minutes before I fully recovered my
							presence of mind. <persRef ref="clay-clement">C. C Clay</persRef> of
							Alabama, offered a string of ten Resolutions, parcelling out as usual
							the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President’s</persRef> Message for
							reference to various Committees. <persRef ref="wilde-richard"
								>Wilde</persRef> of Georgia moved that a separate question should be
							taken upon the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> which was to refer to a
							Select Committee the Recommendation of an Amendment of the Constitution,
							in the Election of the President. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilde
							wished to have other Amendments to the Constitution considered in
							connection with that, and that they should all be embraced in one
							reference— He spoke of the People of Georgia, as desiring many
							amendments to the Constitution, and brought up his Colleague <persRef
								ref="wayne-james">Wayne</persRef>, who said he was mistaken— <hi
								rend="italic">He</hi> thought the People of Georgia were satisfied
							with the Constitution as it is—and he added some warm remarks, to which
							Wilde replied and was sustained by <persRef ref="gilmer-george"
								>Gilmer</persRef>, <pb n="201" type="ms"/>They had a sharp debate
							upon it of upwards of an hour— It was finally agreed to take the
							question separately upon that Resolution— <persRef ref="mcduffie-george"
								>M’Duffie</persRef> of South-Carolina then moved to except the
							second Resolution, which referred the parts of the Message relating to
							the Revenue and the Bank of the United States upon which he had some
							discussion with <persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef>, and he
							proposed if Polk would agree to strike out the part relating to the
							Bank, to let the remainder of the Resolution pass with the rest; but
							Polk would not consent; and after some altercation, M’Duffie moved that
							the Committee should rise, which they did— Having also excepted the
							Resolution, respecting the combustion of the Treasury building, at the
							motion of <persRef ref="jarvis-leonard">Leonard Jarvis</persRef> of
							Maine—on returning to the House Polk moved a reconsideration of the vote
							of the House yesterday, referring the Report of the <persRef

							removal of the Deposits to the Committee of the whole House on the State
							of the Union, but without entering upon the debate on this question—the

								>Cambreleng</persRef>, <persRef ref="binney-horace"
							>Binney</persRef>, and finally by <persRef ref="mckinley-john"
								>M’Kinley</persRef> of Alabama, and <persRef ref="wayne-james"
								>Wayne</persRef> of Georgia, who closed a long Speech not very
							fairly by moving the previous question. It is not fair because the man
							who makes it secures the delivery of his own Speech, and cuts off the
							opportunity of the adverse party to answer him. The question was taken
							by Yeas and Nays—104 to 107 So that there was not a second— The House
							then adjourned after an ineffectual attempt by <persRef
								ref="burges-tristam">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burges</persRef>
							to move an adjournment over to Monday.— I called at <persRef
								ref="peale-rembrandt">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rembrandt
								Peale’s</persRef>, and informed him that as the House would be in
							Session to-morrow, I could not give him a sitting for my Picture; but
							promised to call for a short time before the Meeting of the House— His
							Collection of Pictures of his own painting is pleasant. One of them a
							very good copy of <persRef ref="sanzio-raffaello">Raphaël’s</persRef>
							Madonna of the Chair; a Picture which I always delight to see— There
							were also several Portraits—one of <persRef ref="roy-rammohan">Rammohun
								Roy</persRef> the Hindu Christian recently deceased in England.
							Peale said he painted it, but a few days before his Death— Also a
							Portrait of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Oliver</persRef>, a fat Poetess— I could not write this Evening— The
							Senate yesterday at the motion of <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, sent a Message to the
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>, asking a copy of
							his written communication, to his Cabinet made on the 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September last, about the removal of
							the Deposits from the United States Bank; and he has sent them this
							morning a flat refusal— There is a tone of insolence and insult in his
							intercourse with both Houses of Congress, especially since his
							re-election, which never was witnessed between the Executive and the
							Legislature before— The domineering tone has heretofore been usually on
							the side of the Legislative bodies to the Executive, and Clay has not
							been sparing in the use of it— He is now paid in his own coin.</p>

								<persRef ref="davenport-thomas2">Davenport</persRef> of Virginia

						<p>It began to Snow early this morning, and continued through the whole day
							and Evening—increasing to a violent Snow-Storm— I received a Letter from
							my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, and answered a
							long one, from <persRef ref="hallett-benjamin">Benjamin F.
								Hallett</persRef>, which was delivered to me yesterday by <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef>; both these Letters shew
							the delicate and very difficult position in which I am placed, as the
							AntiMasonic Candidate for the Office of Governor of the Commonwealth—
							There is great danger of displeasing all parties; and this is the
							position in which I have been ever since I returned to public life by
							accepting a Seat in <pb n="203" type="ms"/>Congress— I have now three
							fourths of the People of Massachusetts against me— By alienating from me
							the Antimasons, I shall become obnoxious to the whole, and my public
							life will terminate by the alienation from me of all mankind— It cannot
							be of much consequence, for I have but little time to live; and for that
							remnant of days retirement would be more suitable than the turmoil and
							collisions of public Service— It is scarcely possible for me to abstract
							myself from the great questions which agitate the Country, but it is the
							experience of all ages, that the People grow weary of old men— I cannot
							flatter myself that I shall escape the common Law of our Nature— There
							is an ill-fortune that pursues in old age, especially men whom Fortune
							has much favoured in Youth— I have been of that Class, and must now pay
							the penalty of Good luck in my early years, and even till I became
							President of the United States— From that day is dated my decline, and
							every exertion made by me to arrest the course of the descent, has
							recoiled upon me— It is vain to struggle against the Will of Providence,
							and I must meet my Fate with what resignation I can— Above all it
							behooves me not to flatter myself that I can during my life, recover the
							good will of my Countrymen that I have lost— I have answered Hallett’s
							Letter, adhering to the determination I had taken, of withdrawing from
							the canvas for Governor in the House of Representatives of
							Massachusetts.</p>

						<p>I rose twice First at half past four with a racking head-ache and some

							covered with ashes, blown in from the chimney— There had been a tempest
							with floods of rain falling all Night— I took my Bibles and my Letter to

								<persRef ref="patton-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							his rejected motion,—by representing it as a motion to amend a

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hubbard</persRef> of New-Hampshire—
							Patton said that it killed his proposition, and he only wished to give
							it a decent burial— Every body knew that for him to offer an amendment
							to any resolution of the Gentleman from New-Hampshire would be absurd
							presumption— The fact was that his, Patton’s motion was a distinct
							proposition of his own, and the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> rule
							had been expressly excepted from those adopted on the <pb n="205"
								type="ms"/>motion of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hubbard—
								<persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">The Speaker</persRef> said M<hi

							which was of course an Amendment proposed to the motion of M<hi

							fifteen minutes, with frequent reference both to the Journal, and the
							daily minutes for the Journal— Patton’s complaint was on a very nice
							distinction, but was just— There was no decision, and indeed no formal
							question moved by Patton— <persRef ref="crockett-david">David
								Crockett</persRef> moved a Resolution for the appointment of a

								<persRef ref="clay-clement">C. C. Clay</persRef> opposed the motion

							large majority— The annual Report of the <persRef
								ref="taney-roger-brooke">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> upon
							the finances was received and 10000 copies ordered to be printed—
								<persRef ref="polk-james">Polk’s</persRef> motion to reconsider the

							also one between <persRef ref="washington-george">President

							very great and mischievous errors— This is now admitted by almost all of

						<p>I received this morning a Letter from Weymouth requesting me to obtain a
							certified copy of a document relating to a Pension; and I called at the
							Pension Office to enquire for it—and also to ascertain the principle
							upon which the amount of the last pension Certificate of <persRef
								ref="thayer-solomon">Solomon Thayer</persRef> was fixed at 178:56.
							The Office was full of members of Congress, there upon business similar
							to mine— I left the Letter I had received with <persRef
								ref="edwards-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Edwards</persRef>, who promised speedy attention to it, and who told me
							that the amount of S. Thayer’s pension was graduated by the time, of his
							Service, as shewn by his papers— I then returned home— Received many
							visits by Cards and one in person from <persRef ref="vinton-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Vinton</persRef> of Ohio. Afterwards I
							called upon the Secretary of the Treasury <persRef
								ref="taney-roger-brooke">Roger B. Taney</persRef> and had a
							conversation with him upon the Petition from sundry Merchants of
							Plymouth, praying for an Appropriation to erect a building there for the
							Custom-house and Post-Office— It was presented at the last Session of
							Congress, and then referred to the Committee of Commerce, who made no
							Report. I called it up, on the first Petition day of this Session and
							had it again referred to the Committee of Commerce I spoke of it to
								<persRef ref="sutherland-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sutherland</persRef>, now Chairman of that Committee; who professed
							to be favourable to it, but said it would be of course referred to the
							Secretary of the Treasury. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taney had not
							seen the petition and papers, but upon enquiry found that it had been
							received from the Committee this Morning. He professed also to be well
							disposed to the object of the Petition, but asked a number of questions
							with regard to the expediency of building a Custom House at Plymouth,
							and appeared disenclined to recommending any considerable extraordinary
							appropriations, saying I might see by his annual Report on the finances
							that there would be considerable surplus of Revenue to spare the ensuing
							year— On sending for the Petition, and finding that it asked only an
							Appropriation of 12000 dollars, he said there would be no difficulty
							with regard to the amount of the Sum that being so small— He promised to
							refer it according to the usage to the Collector at Plymouth; and he
							would urge him to report to him concerning it as soon as possible. I
							dined with <persRef ref="vaughan-charles">Sir Charles R.

						<p>At the Presbyterian Church this Morning I heard <persRef

							from Isaiah 57.1. “The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to

								<persRef ref="adams-mary4">Louisa</persRef> to Church with me.—
							After dinner I attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							Church, where <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read the Evening prayer for the 4<hi

							only one Lesson, from the New Testament, and that the Lesson for the
							third Advent Sunday. His Sermon of ten minutes was from Luke 24.26.
							“Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his
							glory?” It is somewhat remarkable how M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hawley contrives to preach always in the afternoon the same Sermon—
								<persRef ref="blunt-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Blunt</persRef> was here this Evening: having left New-York on
							Friday Morning. <persRef ref="silsbee-mary;u">M<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, enclosing one to
							the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of
							Massachusetts, withdrawing my name from the Canvas of Candidates to be
							sent from the House to the Senate for the election of a Governor— I have

							myself as unpopular with them, as I am with the two other parties in
							Massachusetts. To be forsaken by all mankind, seems to be the destiny
							that awaits my last days— In such cases a man can be sustained only by
							an overruling consciousness of rectitude— To withstand multitudes is the
							only unerring test of decisive character— Yet it requires wisdom as well
							as virtue— Stubborn adherence to a principle, is wise, only so far as
							the principle is important, and as the adherence to it may be productive
							of practical good— The useful end of stubborn adherence to Anti-masonry
							is yet problematical— Men of excellent moral principle, and of powerful
							intellect utterly disapprove of political Antimasonry— I have staked my
							reputation, character and fortune upon it— The wisdom of my course must

						<p>I partly revised my proposed Address to the People of the Commonwealth of

								my Sons</persRef> have suggested various Amendments, and I have
							adopted them all— At the House, which I found in Session when I reached
							the Capitol, the States were called over for Petitions and Resolutions—
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef>, offered a
							joint Resolution for adjourning over to next Monday.— <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> required that according to the rule
							of the house, the Resolution should lie over a day— I enquired of

							some days at Baltimore— That <persRef ref="brooks-gorham">Gorham
								Brooks</persRef> was here, having come on yesterday with <persRef
								ref="silsbee-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Silsbee</persRef>, and had invited him to return with him— I invited

								Watmough</persRef> to come with <persRef ref="pleasonton-matilda"
								>his wife</persRef>, and dine with us in a family party on Christmas

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Duffie</persRef> finished his
							Speech, upon his proposed Amendment to instruct the Committee of Ways
							and Means, to report a joint resolution that the revenues hereafter to
							be collected shall be deposited in the Bank of the United States—
							Altogether the Speech has occupied about three hours—he was still more
							severe upon the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>, and
							upon the <persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> this day than he had been last Thursday— When he
							finished, <persRef ref="wilde-richard">Wilde</persRef> of Georgia, and
							Polk of Tennessee both rose and moved the adjournment. Polk will have
							the floor to-morrow; and will attempt to answer M’Duffie— What Wilde
							proposes to do is uncertain. <persRef ref="wayne-james">Wayne</persRef>
							told me he hoped Polk would confine his answer, to the defence <pb
								n="210" type="ms"/>of the President and the Secretary. There was a
							good deal of agitation in the House among the Administration Members at
							parts of M’Duffie’s Speech— As I was going this morning to the Capitol I
							met <persRef ref="wyer-edward">Edward Wyer</persRef> who walked with me
							and entertained me with his disappointment in receiving only two votes
							for the Office of Serjeant at Arms of the Senate He named to me eight or

							but attributes his failure to <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi

							under it— They would have attempted to controul me, in every act of my
							Administration, and insisted upon the regulation of all the affairs of
							the State with a view to sustain the party— At the House—after the call
							of the States over for Petitions and Resolutions, <persRef

							first insisted upon the Rule that the three readings should be read on
							separate days— Everett moved a suspension of the rule, and it was
							carried by a large majority— Clay then moved that the question should be
							taken by yeas and nays, which the house refused, not more than 15
							members rising to support the call. The Resolution was passed without
							further opposition; but came back within a quarter of an hour from the
							Senate non concurred— Everett then moved that when the House adjourned
							it should be till Friday; which he said they could do without the
							Senate— And the House after passing twenty-five private Bills, did
							adjourn till Friday</p>

							money of the United States, deposited in the Bank of the United States,
							and its branches, communicated to Congress on the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> day of December 1833 are unsatisfactory

							him next week— He said no—not upon this Subject. But said I—you must

							mean to give myself a holiday now— I said, perhaps it was not quite so
							important that he should give proof of zealous patriotism now, as it was
							last winter— He laughed and said no—it was of no consequence at all— He
							knew my allusion was to his re election as Senator from Tennessee, which
							he succeeded in effecting, in spite of Jackson’s interference to
							supplant him, by <persRef ref="eaton-john">John H. Eaton</persRef>—
							Grundy drudged through thick and thin till he extorted from Jackson a

								<persRef ref="selden-dudley">Dudley Selden</persRef>, a young member
							of the House from the City of New-York, whose collar is already galling

						<p>I receive almost every morning volumes of Newspapers, and seldom less
							than two or three pamphlets which engross my attention from breakfast
							time, till it encroaches upon the hour for attendance at the House
								<persRef ref="lincoln-jotham">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jotham
								Lincoln</persRef> of Hingham, called upon me this morning to request
							my attention to the Bill for his relief which has passed the House and
							is now before the Senate I promised to speak of it to <persRef
								ref="bell-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef>, the
							Chairman of the Committee of Claims of the Senate. At the House, which I
							found in Session: upon the calling of Petitions and Resolutions <persRef
								ref="chilton-thomas">Thomas Chilton</persRef> of Kentuckey offered a
							Resolution that the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions should enquire
							into the expediency of extending the provisions of the Act of 7. June
							1832 to all persons who served in the Indian Wars, from the conclusion
							of Peace with Great-Britain in 1783 to the Treaty of Greenville in
							1794—this gave rise to a debate of two hours in which Chilton, <persRef

								>Lewis Williams</persRef>, <persRef ref="blair-james"
								>Blair</persRef> of South Carolina, and <persRef
								ref="bouldin-thomas">Bouldin</persRef> took part— Williams moved to
							lay the Resolution on the table which was rejected by yeas and nays 50
							to 136— Finally the further Consideration of it was postponed till
							Monday next— Adjourned about 3. O’Clock— I went for half an hour into
							the Library, and looked into <persRef ref="darwin-erasmus"
								>Darwin’s</persRef> Zoonomia, and <persRef ref="raynal-guillaume"
								>Raynal’s</persRef> Philosophical, and Political History, for some
							observations respecting the mechanism of the hand, which I did not find—
							I received this morning two Letters: one from a person named <persRef
								ref="sherman-william">W. P. Sherman</persRef> dated at Trenton
							New-Jersey, requesting copies of my Letters on political Antimasonry—
							And one, an insulting Letter with a fictitious signature from Attica,
							Genesee County, New-York, also upon Masonry— I shewed the last to
								<persRef ref="lay-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lay</persRef>, the Member from that District, who took it, and told
							me he thought he could discover the author of it— He said the signature
							was intended to be taken by me, for that of a person named <persRef
								ref="u">Earl</persRef>, a very respectable man and an Antimason— But
							the name was not wholly written, the rascal who wrote it, meaning to
							evade the charge of forgery— We had again a rubber at whist at home this
							Evening.— The House adjourned over to Monday.</p>

							90.–9. “We spend our years as a tale that is told”—a written occasional

								<persRef ref="post-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Clergyman would give a course of Lectures, to explain the nature and
							Evidences of the Unitarian doctrines— This of M<hi rend="superscript"

							attended S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, where <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read Prayers for the Sunday after Christmas. The Evening service; and

							of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart,
							fervently; 23. Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
							incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.” It
							was obviously a discourse upon the new birth, according to the usual
							strain of the preacher, whose talent consists in varying the language,
							always to express the same thing— I answered a Letter from <persRef
								ref="snow-charles">Charles Snow</persRef>, of North-Port, Alabama,
							Son of the <persRef ref="snow-elizabeth">eldest daughter</persRef> of
							the <persRef ref="adams-zabdiel">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>

								<persRef ref="calhoun-william">Speaker of the House of
								Representatives of Massachusetts</persRef>— I sent him a duplicate
							of the same Letter last Thursday—and to make security trebly sure,
							despatched a triplicate with my Letter this Evening— In the house
								<persRef ref="davis-john4">John Davis</persRef> presented a Memorial
							of <persRef ref="fletcher-noah">Noah Fletcher</persRef> late a
							subordinate Clerk in the Office of the Clerk of the House; dismissed by
							the present Clerk <persRef ref="franklin-walter">Franklin</persRef>—
							Davis in presenting the Memorial made some severe remarks upon the
							dismission of Fletcher, for which he was called to order by <persRef
								ref="clay-clement">Clay</persRef> of Alabama, and pronounced not in
							order by <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">the Speaker</persRef>—he
							nevertheless continued, and concluded by offering a Resolution, that the
							removal of Fletcher was improper, and that he ought to be re-instated—
							This Resolution according to the rule of the House lies over one day—
							There were two long debates, upon Petitions for Buoys, and for removing
							obstructions from rivers—the Questions were whether they should be
							referred to the Committee of Commerce, or to the Committee of Roads and
							Canals— The question was finally taken upon one of the Petitions by yeas
							and nays, and it was referred to the Committee of Commerce, by a vote of
							105 to 97— There were therefore 38 members <pb n="215" type="ms"
							/>absent, and it was the first test question in the present house upon
							the principle of Internal Improvement. It appears from this vote, that
							there is a small majority of the present House of Representatives
							opposed to the prosecution of works of internal improvement by the
							authority of Congress and at the expense of the general Government— This
							majority consists of the most devoted partizans of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, and a few others,
							Southern nullifiers and New-Yorkers— The House adjourned over New-Years
							day to Thursday— <persRef ref="polk-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Polk</persRef> did not resume his Speech in answer to
								<persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							affected by the state of my health which is infirm— My lost time is

							afflictions which it is my duty to bear with resignation—and
							interspersed with trials, the only resource for encountering which has
							been Fortitude, and patient endurance— From the middle of January for a
							full month I was severely indisposed. the Congress terminated on the
								3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March— The only useful result of
							my service at that Session was the Report of the Minority of the
							Committee of Manufactures, which with great difficulty I was able to
							introduce into the House where it was merely laid on the Table and
							printed— I remained at Washington until the 11<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of April, with much and distressing sickness in my family,
							and much occupied with Correspondence, and solicitation at the
							War-Office, for Revolutionary Pensioners.— On the day of my departure
							from Washington was published my first Letter to <persRef
								ref="livingston-edward">Edward Livingston</persRef>, then Secretary
							of State, and Grand High Priest of the General Grand Royal-Arch Chapter
							of the United States— It was followed by five others, published in the
							Boston Daily Advocate, and since collected in a pamphlet. In the months
							of July and August, my health was again very bad, and my Spirits were
							proportionably affected— The last week in August and first in September
							were spent upon an excursion with <persRef ref="davis-isaac">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Isaac P. Davis</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="davis-susan">his wife</persRef>, to the White Mountains in

							Election as Governor of the State— The National Republican Convention at
							Worcester nominated <persRef ref="davis-john4">John Davis</persRef>
							against me; and the consequence was a total failure of the Election, of
							Governor, Lieutenant Governor and of one half the members for the Senate
							throughout the State— In April I was re-elected a member of the House of
							Representatives of the United States, a Station much more suitable and
							more agreeable to me than that of Governor of Massachusetts, and I have
							determined to withdraw my name from the Canvass in the Legislature of
							the State— On the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of September my Son
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> had a <persRef
