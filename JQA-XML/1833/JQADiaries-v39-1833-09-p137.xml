                        <p>Rising early I was enabled by an exertion to write before Breakfast half
                            a Letter to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>—
                                <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson</persRef>
                            a Lawyer of Bath who was going to Concord, took my Letter with a promise
                            that he would put it into the Post-Office at Haverhill— Several persons
                            were introduced to me at Bath this Morning but I have no recollection of
                            their names— There was a new Meeting-house, nearly finished, near
                                <persRef ref="u">Carleton’s</persRef>, the house where we lodged,
                            but there was no preaching in it yet— There was public worship about two
                            Miles distant; but the Stage which was to take us on came, before the
                            time of Service, and we came in it thro’ Lisbon to Littleton—17. Miles—
                            The road as we approach the Mountains becoming less pleasant, and the
                            Country over which we travel, wilder, and more unsettled— There were one
                            man two women, and a little girl four years old, Strangers, fellow
                            passengers with us in the Stage— The woman with the Child met her
                            husband at Littleton, and they went on in the Stage. One drunken outside
                            Passenger had been somewhat annoying before we left Bath; and on the
                            road, but we saw no more of him after reaching Littleton— He arrived
                            there about one O’Clock, and I proposed attending Public worship in the
                            afternoon— But there was no Service at the Meeting-house (a new one)
                            near our Inn, and it was too late to go to the nearest Church, upwards
                            of two Miles distant. The house where we put up is kept by a man named
                                <persRef ref="u">Gibb</persRef>, and is very comfortable. The
                            village is neat, and there are several handsome and rather showy houses
                            in it— After dinner, I took a walk of half an hour with <persRef
                                ref="davis-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis</persRef>,
                            but the weather, chilly and raw, with rain drove us back to the house—
                            In the Evening we had several visitors, Inhabitants of the town,
                            well-educated and intelligent men, whose names, with the exception of
                                <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eli</persRef>,

                        <p><date>2. V. </date>Monday.— Franconia— The Profile— Dinner at Littleton—
                            E. A. Crawford’s.</p>
                        <p>We went in a Waggon with a pair of Horses to the Franconia Notch— Saw the
                            Profile or Old Man of the Mountain—distance 11 Miles— The region all
                            round is mountainous and ranges of thick clouds were scudding along upon
                            their Seeds— It was doubtful whether the Old Man would shew his face,
                            which he often and capriciously veils in smoky vapours. He was however
                            this day when we reached the spot from which he can be seen, perfectly
                            bare, with a clear Sky, and presented a Profile and throat as distinct,
                            as if it had issued from the hands of a Sculptor— We saw him for a
                            quarter of an hour, from three different stands or points of view, two
                            in the road over which we came, and one from the border of a smooth and
                            placid Pond at the foot of the Mountain, and which is the Head of
                            Merrimack river. Another Pond, about half a mile distant is the head of
                            the Saco river. The Profile, is at the summit of a Mountain covered with
                            wood, said to be about 1200 feet above the surface of the Pond at which
                            we stood. The Mountain on one side ascends in an Elliptic curve, not
                            apparently very steep— The descent from the top is precipitous and the
                            Profile projects over the nearly perpendicular side of the rock below—
                            It shews a curly forehead, Homeric nose, lips, chin, cheek, beard and
                            throat with the prominent Adam’s Apple; but not the back part of the
                            head, nor the cylinder of the skull— Its appearance, relatively to the
                            Mass of the Mountain is very diminutive, as if to exhibit an
                            illustration of the contrast between the grandeur of Nature and the
                            littleness of man. It stands like a human head, looking out from the
                            hollow of the Mountain, reflecting upon the sublime Scenery before it,
                            and meditating upon the omnipotence of the Creator— It strikes you as if
                            the mountain itself was instinct with life—teeming with intelligence,
                            gifted with the faculty of Speech and on the point of proclaiming with a
                            voice of Thunder, the Majesty of God. <pb n="138" type="ms"/>We returned
                            immediately to Littleton; stopping as we had done when going at the
                            half-way house; where were the New-Hampshire Iron works— We had not time
                            to visit them, but saw several specimens of Iron Ore—and had a full view
                            of the hill called after the name of <persRef ref="lafayette">La
                                Fayette</persRef>— At Noon we went up on the top of the Tower of the
                            Meeting-House at Littleton from which there is a fine view of all the
                            mountainous region around. We saw the top of Mount Washington, the
                            highest peak of the ridge, white with Snow, which the Gentlemen who
                            accompanied us said must have fallen yesterday— We then went and visited
                            a party of Indians from Canada—S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Francis
                            Indians, who had pitched their Tents, in an open field near the Village—
                            There were two or three families, men, women and children, remnants of a
                            larger number, fifty or sixty who had been here several days, and had
                            departed a few days since— They looked very miserable; but had some
                            stuffs of their own fabrics which they sold at excessive prices— I
                            purchased for 3 1/2 dollars a pair of Mocassins worth perhaps 50 Cents.
                            Five or six Gentlemen of Littleton, invited themselves to dine with us
                            and insisted upon giving us the dinner, to which we consented— The
                                <persRef ref="fairbank-drury">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Fairbanks</persRef> the Minister of
                            the place was also invited and dined with us.— We left Littleton at 2
                            O’Clock P.M—with the waggon and pair driven by <persRef ref="u">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Gibb</persRef>, our host, and came to
                                <persRef ref="crawford-ethan">Ethan Allen Crawford’s</persRef>, at
                            Hart’s Location, 20. Miles— The road was almost a continual ascent
                            without steep hills; through a forest, chiefly of Hemlock and Mountain
                            Ash—the Maples having dwindled into shrubs, and the Oaks and Walnuts
                            having disappeared.— We saw some wild pigeons and a few blue jays, but
                            the scarcity of birds is one of the most remarkable characteristics of
                            these woods. A beautiful young Buck came close up to the road—looked
                            very steadily at us, and then turned round, and galloped away— We
                            arrived at Crawford’s just in time to see the Sunset beautifully clear—
                            We met at the Inn a party consisting of <persRef ref="paine-sarah">M<hi

                        <p>My Chronometer stopp’d at 3. A.M. with the cold.— I rose soon after five.
                            It was then broad day light with the sky perfectly clear— <persRef

                            Washington— Since the day when I saw the Sun rise from the Riesenkoppe
                            in Silesia, I had not viewed so sublime a sight. Crawford fired his
                            Morning Gun, the echoes of which reverberated more distinctly than they
                            did last Night— Immediately after breakfast the four young Men of

                            perhaps half a mile long; the rocks on both sides being so steep and
                            precipitous to an elevation of about 2000 feet that the look as they had
                            been ruptured by the convulsions of an Earthquake— The trees are Wild

                        <p>At four of the Morning we departed from Conway in the Stage, with new
                            fellow Passengers—Strangers. 12 Miles to an indifferent Breakfast at
                            Eaton— Then 18 Miles to Centre Harbour at the head of the Lake. Here at
                            11. we embarked in the Steamer Belknap; and traversing the Lake, landed
                            at 1/2 past 2. and dined about 2 miles distant from the landing, at
                            Alton.— The lake is 20 miles long, and no where two Miles wide. There
                            are said to be in it 365 islands.— We had numerous fellow-passengers of
                            both sexes— One party from New-Orleans, travelling with their own

                            the last. The travellers to the white mountains are numerous of late;
                            and they are objects of real curiosity— The introduction of the
                            Steamboat upon the Lake brings it from the unexplored savage state into
                            the centre of civilization— It seems like exploring a new world. </p>

                        <p>We left Portsmouth in the Stage, at 8 O’Clock this Morning— Passed
                            through Hampton and Salisbury to Newbury-Port 20. Miles— There was a
                            daughter of <persRef ref="coombs-william">Captain Coombs</persRef>, a
                            traveller with us in the Stage. The Public House at Newbury-Port is on
                            the site of that in which I lived nearly two years with <persRef

                            There was an hour of interval between the arrival of the Stage at
                            Newbury-Port, and its departure for Boston; which hour I employed in
                            visiting some of the haunts of my early youth, in this place, after
                            forty-three years of absence from it— I found a new world, with relicks,
                            yet fresh in my Memory, of what was there. <persRef ref="coffin-hector"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hector Coffin</persRef> took me
                            to an exhibition of the horticultural Society, where there was a fine

                            round the Town— I marked the old ferry landing where I often bathed with

                            Newbury Meeting-House, where I was wont to hear the excellent Sermons of
                                <persRef ref="tucker-john">Doctor Tucker</persRef>— He has long
                            since gone to his reward, and the House has been rebuilt, so that I only
                            recognized the Spot. Returning through High-Street, I saw the Tracy

                            wooden Statues before it— Met separately <persRef ref="farris-william"

                            me of my Poem, the Vision in which she was introduced— He pointed her
                            out to me as she was walking in the Street but I had no opportunity to
                            speak to her. The houses of <persRef ref="parsons-theophilus">Theophilus

                            Stage again started, and we came over the Turnpike road through Newbury
                            and Rowley— Dined at Ipswich— Then came through Hamilton, Wenham,
                            Beverley, Salem, Lynn, Chelsea, and Charlestown, to Boston, where we
                            landed at 6. P.M. at <persRef ref="davis-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            consent began to make excuse.” an argumentative discourse in successive
                            refutation of the various excuses commonly offered for not taking an
                            interest in religion— The reasoning good— The delivery of the Sermon,
                            animated— That of the prayer cold, but short— I read the 7<hi

                            the indispensable obligation of entire devotedness to the divine Laws.
                            The text is from James 2.10. “For whosoever shall keep the whole Law,
                            and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.” The preacher appears
                            to be much perplexed with his text, and says this Epistle might be
                            called the paradoxes of <persRef ref="james">Saint James</persRef>. He
                            qualifies very largely the general assertion of the text, and exposes

                        <p>I had flattered myself on returning from my recent excursion to have

                            of the Season with assiduity to my appropriate labours— But on visiting
                            my garden and nursery this morning I found myself unable to work and
                            perceived a languor and debility which increased upon me the whole day—
                            I was however not totally disabled from writing a few lines. <persRef

                            might be given to me, which it accordingly was on Sunday the 12<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July. My Great-grandfather died the
                            next Morning, in the 79<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> year of his age—
                                <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Beale</persRef> was here this Evening, and presented me a vote of
                            the parish at their adjourned meeting last Monday accepting my proposal
                            to take the 30 remaining pews in payment of the debt of 3000 dollars due
                            to me by the parish. He had also a statement—shewing that a Settlement
                            has been made with the pew holders, who had made past payment before,
                            and that provision has been completed, for paying all the rest of the
                            parish debt by a subscription the greatest part of which has been
                            already collected.</p>

                        <p>I was twice up in the night, and this whole day in a state of prostration
                            of strength, unable to put pen to paper, and consequently in a dejection
                            of mind which almost made life a burthen— It was the birthday of my Son
                                <persRef key="adams-john2">John’s</persRef>
                            <persRef ref="hellen-mary">wife</persRef>, and also of his youngest
                            daughter <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Georgiana Frances</persRef>,
                            who this day three years ago was born, at this house— We had invited our
                            friends to dine with us; and <pb n="143" type="ms"/>I had hoped to share
                            joy on this occasion— But I was obliged to leave the table, and passed
                            nearly the whole day upon my bed. Yet the judgment that I bear is in
                            mercy. I suffer no pain but am in a state of lassitude, unable to hold
                            up my head, to stand upon my feet, or to sit up in a chair. The powers
                            of the mind are proportionally debilitated— I could only lie upon my bed
                            and read, without taking any pleasure in reading, and scarcely forming a
                            reflection upon what I read.— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi

                            next day— This disease of debility is ashamed of itself. Suffering no
                            severe pain, I feel as if I ought to be occupied, and cannot realize the
                            imbecility which disqualifies for action I read several Odes of <persRef

                                Holbrook</persRef> I took this morning an emetic of Ipecacuanha,
                            which had one mild operation, and kept me in a state of debility all the
                            morning of the day, and part of the afternoon. It is like the Talisman
                            of an Arabian Tale, and seems to strip a man of all his Sinews— I wasted
                            most of this day in reading <persRef ref="u">Buckingham’s</persRef>
                            English Parliamentary Register—four numbers of which were lent me by

                                Davis</persRef>. It is a miscellany containing merely an abstract of
                            the debates in the reformed Parliament with much other matter. The
                            reform does not appear to have improved the character of the House of
                            Commons. There are new Speakers, but none who acquire much influence
                            over the house— None who take away the lead from the principal Orators
                            of the preceding times— <persRef ref="williams-francis2">M<hi

                            additional which barely pays my parish-tax for the present year. I have

                            Castor oil, mixed up with a teaspoonful of tincture of Rhubarb. This
                            finished the first part of my remedial course of Physic: and the second
                            commenced this Evening, with a small pill of Calomel, Opium and
                            Ipecacuanha, each one grain which I am to take nightly for 8 or ten

                            and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Merrick presented to me three
                            Resolutions of the Convention, the last of which was a unanimous
                            nomination of me to be Governor of the Commonwealth for the ensuing
                            year. I had done every thing in my power to prevent this, which is an
                            exceedingly unwelcome movement to me; but it was placed upon grounds
                            which left me no honourable option of declining. So I concluded on
                            reflection. I promised the Committee to have my answer transmitted to
                            them by ten O’Clock, to-morrow morning, and they took their leave— I
                            sent my answer by Charles who returned this Evening to Boston. I accept
                            the nomination, which casts me again upon the stormy ocean of political
                            electioneering when I hoped and believed I was snug in the Port. If

                        <p>Fine cool weather after a rainy afternoon yesterday, and a frost last
                            Night. I returned to labouring in my garden, and cleared two avenues
                            between the Rasberry bushes, of almost a waggon load of weeds; most of
                            which have grown up from two to seven feet high since the first of July.
                            I was between two and three hours at work. <persRef ref="savil-samuel"
                                >Deacon Savile</persRef> came with a Petition to the Selectmen to
                            widen the road near the Meeting-house, which he wished me to sign— I
                            declined at present on a doubt of the right of the Selectmen, by Law, to
                            widen a road by their mere authority— I promised to consider of the
                            proposal, and enquire into the Law. <persRef ref="thayer-solomon"
                                >Solomon Thayer</persRef> brought two old Documents, shewing his
                            military service and pay at 20 dollars a month, with a view to having
                            his Pension increased— I advised him to authenticate them as original
                            papers, by Oath before a Magistrate, and promised then to transmit them
                            with a recommendation to the <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of

                            which I staid, but John came home before supper. I had conversation with
                            several persons upon my recent excursion to the white mountains, and
                            with some of the Quincy’s upon an old Letter from <persRef

                        <p>I cannot yet return to my interrupted course of Life, and all my regular
                            occupations run in arrear—above all, my diary which I cannot even keep

                            necessary, honest, and at least not a waste of time. These are my only
                            consolations— May the blessing not be withdrawn— <persRef

                                >Charles</persRef> came out here and went back. I weeded the third
                            alley between the rows of Rasberries and found a row thickly sown of
                            white Mulberry trees, just up from the seeds which I planted in July—but
                            not one of my Strawberries <pb n="145" type="ms"/>has come up. That
                            experiment as invariably happens with those on which I place any
                            reliance, has totally failed and it is so late in the Season, that I
                            cannot expect any of my white mulberries will survive the Winter. The
                            hickory pignuts planted last Autumn, still continue to shoot up from the
                            surface of the ground— I found two or three just appearing this day— I
                            had two stumps of Old Peach trees dug up by my workman <persRef
                                ref="walter">Walter</persRef>, and taken away. Yet remnants of the
                            Roots were left in the ground. As they were they reminded me too much
                            and too often of my own Condition. Dead to all useful purpose, but
                            presenting a permanent ruin to the eye, and occupying by its mere
                            existence a place which might be filled by young, healthy and profitable
                            Plants— Miserere mei Domine. (N.B. 21 June 1835. The querulous tone of
                            this day’s record was written in no becoming Spirit, under the pressure
                            of disease, disappointment, and melancholy forebodings— A Christian
                            should endure with fortitude and resignation all the ills of life, and
                            never lose his trust in a superintending Providence— The failure of my
                            planting experiments, trifles lighter than air grates upon my feelings,
                            by the train of associated ideas linked with the purposes and hopes of
                            life— My white mulberries were all killed by the succeeding winter,
                            because they were sown too late— The Strawberries all came up in the
                            Spring of 1834. and in the Summer of 1835 are exterminated by an
                            invasion of self-sown clover— The great difficulty of raising Hickory
                            trees, arises from the lateness of the Season when they come up— The
                            stem has not time to ripen before the killing frost comes. Patience and
                            a mind fortified against disappointment are indispensable to a raiser of
                            seedling trees. He must always remember the story and moralize to his

                        <p>I found my health amended— Heard <persRef ref="presbury-samuel">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Presbury</persRef>, a young man whom I
                            had never before seen— His morning Sermon was from Luke 15.31. “And he
                            said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is
                            thine,” upon that most admirable parable of the Prodigal Son. Considered
                            in a point of view different from that which is most usual. That is, he
                            urged the preferable condition of the virtuous and industrious brother,
                            who needed not forgiveness, and had nothing of which to repent— The text
                            of the afternoon was from 1. John 1.9. “If we confess our sins, he is
                            faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
                            unrighteousness.” <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Whitney</persRef> was in the Pulpit the whole day, and

                            humain. Upon the persversities of the human mind— There is no word in
                            the English Language corresponding exactly with the French word Travers,
                            as here used— Cross-grained is the nearest approximation to it— The
                            Sermons themselves are admirable; and there is a third upon the same
                            Subject. The preacher as in many other cases perplexes himself with
                            difficulties too mighty for him to solve, and he is again haunted by the
                            Spirit of <persRef ref="bayle-pierre">Bayle</persRef>, whom he
                            vituperates in one passage, and quotes with approbation in another.

                            Justice of Peace— The repetition of the same Christian name in families
                            through successive generations breeds confusion— Why is it that in the
                            English Language there are no words expressive of filiation but father
                            and Son—Mother and daughter— The Latin has avus and nepos, Proavus,
                            abavus, atavus and Tritavus. Six degrees ascending. The French have
                            ayeul, bisayeul, trisayeul four degrees ascending— The English has only
                            the adjunct grand added to father or Son indiscriminately for the second
                            degree up or down, and then the compound adjunct great, added to grand,
                            and repeated as many times over as there are degrees— So that the Roman
                            Tritavus is in English Great, great, great, great Grandfather. Thus
                                <persRef ref="adams-henry">Henry Adams</persRef>, the first founder
                            of my family in this Country was the Tritavus of my Sons, and the first

                                Quincy</persRef>.— The appropriation of specific names to the remote
                            relations of descent indicates a people devoted to family attachments—

                            taken the 30 pews, which had remained unsold. It is to me extremely
                            burdensome as a tax, and teaches me what I ought to have known without
                            needing the admonitions of experience: that the warmest and the best of
                            feelings require the steady guidance of discretion— I spent two hours of
                            the morning in my garden and Nursery. The Seedlings of the year which
                            have survived the drought are now preparing to meet the frost of winter.
                            A very great proportion of them have perished— The dwarf Apple is just
                            now ripe, and a very fine fruit. The growth of weeds is gigantic— I
                            employed much of my time in writing. My scriptural minutes of the
                            morning; and Diary minutes— Copy of a Deed in the Manuscript Book of
                            Documents relating to the Execution of <persRef key="adams-john">my

                                French</persRef> of Randolph came and spoke to me of a small piece
                            of Land, about 3. Acres, taxed in the town of Randolph to the heirs of
                                <persRef ref="adams-john">John Adams</persRef>; said to have been a

                                >Shadrach Turner</persRef>, the Collector for the present year; he
                            supposes to gratify his Masonic Resentments— French was himself the
                            Collector for the year 1830, and the tax was then six Cents— That of the
                            present year must have been about as much— I have never been able to
                            find either the Land or the evidence of title to it— I proposed to call

                            by the Thunder-Shower, returned late this Evening—about ten— I walked at

                            and back for exercise— Of my Seedling Plantations, one Nectarine and six
                            Peach trees bear this year for the first time— On the day of my return
                            from the white mountains, my Son <persRef key="adams-john2"
                                >John</persRef> sent five of the Nectarines to the Horticultural
                            Society’s exhibition, and they were fine. The Peaches are all of small
                            size, but all good of their kinds. None remarkable. The dwarf Apple tree
                            bears this year perhaps a peck of excellent red Apples about the size of
                            a Pearmain— Many of my wintered walnuts planted last May have come up—
                            But none of the wintered Ohio Walnuts. No cherry Stones and no
                            Strawberries. The failure of these I attribute to the drought. This has
                            also been my reason for the forbearance as yet to plant my Peach and
                            Plum Stones, and Apple and Pear-Seeds.— The time for planting Acorns,
                            and Walnuts, and most Stone fruits is the month of October— If planted
                            in the Spring, it is so late in the Summer before they come up, that
                            they have not time to harden for the first Winter’s frost— This is the
                            greatest trial of all seedling trees in this climate— But insects and
                            field mice and Squirrels, and the Summer Sun, and drought, and
                            strangling weeds are also deadly enemies to them— A tree is as hard to
                            raise as a child.</p>

                            and most of the Springs in the neighbourhood are failing. I planted one
                            row in the garden, and one in the Nursery, on the North and west side of
                            the fence, of Peach and Plum Stones and Apple seeds with six whole
                            Apples. Found two of the fairest looking of the wintered walnuts which

                            this proscriptive Spirit— I told him of my Letter, declining the

                            to Cowell— He asked me for copies of them, but after much reflection, I

                            and technical form. He left the Paper with me— I walked about Sunset to
                            the sixth Mile-stone for exercise— I am somewhat apprehensive that
                            weeding and garden labour does not absolutely serve the purpose of a
                            substitute for walking: and am indeed almost desponding of any good
                            result from these labours. In that of bodily exercise I had undoubting
                            confidence, and yet has it greatly failed— The infirmities of old age
                            may be delayed, but must come sooner or later, and exercise and even
                            temperance can secure health only for a Season— My journal and
                            Correspondence continue to run in arrear, but I wrote a short answer to
                            a Letter from <persRef ref="payne-john">John Howard Payne</persRef> and

                        <p>My Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> continued quite unwell,
                            the whole of this day— I laboured in my Garden and Nursery, morning and
                            afternoon— Planted in front of my chamber windows South of the house, a
                            Stone of <persRef ref="cruft-edward">E. Cruft’s</persRef> late Apricot,
                            with Pears, Peaches, Apples and Plums. (N.B. 24. June 1835. Neither M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Cruft’s Apricot, nor any of the Plum
                            Stones came up; but two of the Peaches, several of the Pears, and one of
                            the Apples did, and are undergoing various experiments— After surviving
                            two winters some of them can scarcely fail to survive me. So long as I
                            pass my Summers here, they may be always under my eye, and I may indulge
                            the hope, not presumptuously but in humility that some of <persRef
                                key="adams-charles2">my children</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna;adams-louisa3;adams-john17"
                                >grand-children</persRef> may live to taste the fruits which they
                            will bear. I fix the day here on which the <pb n="151" type="ms"/>seeds
                            were sown and the stones were planted) I planted also in the Garden a
                            row of whole Officetree Apples, and in Pot N. 2, which I emptied and
                            refilled with Earth from the Garden a whole dwarf-tree Apple in the
                            Centre, 2 Canada Plum stones, and 6 cherries [symbols] Almost all my
                            seedling Apple-trees in the garden and Nursery, come from the Office
                            tree, or the dwarf tree, which I believe bears the same fruit— I have
                            been able to identify no other— The remainder of the day was devoted
                            without interruption to labour—reading and writing, with the lessons of
                            reading to my grand-child Mary Louisa— A Message came by <persRef
                                ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef>
                            from my Son Charles to <persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirke</persRef> to
                            go into Boston to morrow morning at 6 O’Clock to exchange our old
                            Carriage for a new one built by <persRef ref="u">Knowles</persRef>— I
                            had received a notification to attend a meeting of the historical
                            Society at Noon; and determined to go to Boston myself. I make slow
                            progress in reading <persRef ref="thomson-charles">Thomson’s</persRef>
                            version of the Book of <persRef ref="job">Job</persRef>, comparing it
                            with that of <persRef ref="james-i">King James’s</persRef> Bible, and
                            with <persRef ref="noyes-george">Noyes’s</persRef> recent Translation—
                            The main design of the Book is to prove that the afflictions of the
                            righteous, do not authorise the impeachment of the Justice of God— Satan
                            is permitted by God to afflict Job for the trial of his virtue— But Job,
                            his wife, <persRef ref="bildad;eliphaz;zophar">his three
                                friends</persRef> and <persRef ref="elihu">Elihu</persRef> are all
                            ignorant of the real cause of his afflictions— The friends rashly
                            conclude that they are in punishment of some secret guilt.— His wife
                            more rashly imputes it to divine injustice, and considers God as an evil
                            Spirit— Job himself admits that his sufferings are evidence against his
                            purity, but protests his innocence, and expostulates against his
                            calamities— God himself speaking from the whirlwind reproves Job for his
                            self-justification, and his murmurs; by contrasting his own almighty
                            power with the importance of Job— But God severely censures Job’s
                            friends, for their unjust inferences against him; and ends by restoring
                            him to a double portion of the Earthly blessings of which Satan had
                            deprived him It does not appear that Job ever knew what had passed
                            between God and Satan—nor how it became known to any one— Hence the
                            probability that the whole Story is an Allegorical parable. The
                            questions discussed, are all settled before hand for the reader, who
                            knows from the first that the afflictions of Job are not for his
                            punishment, but for his trial. The question whether such a trial is
                            consistent with divine Justice, remains for solution.</p>

                            Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house, I found

                            recovering from the sudden and violent illness, which she has had.

                            fever of her confinement, which was for a few hours extremely severe and
                            critical. <persRef ref="adams-john17">Her boy</persRef> weighed ten

                            him a Letter which I wrote to <persRef ref="davis-john3">John Brazier
                                Davis</persRef> in April 1832. instead of a copy of the parts of my

                            he did not publish and which on reflection I declined giving because it
                            would seem unkindness to the Anti-masonic party for me now to authorise
                            its publication. Everett read to me an Article, which he had prepared
                            for the Daily Advertiser, and which he had intended to have inserted as
                            Editorial; but which he said <persRef ref="hale-nathan">M<hi

                            supineness of all party action here excepting among the Masons. He
                            thought the Masonic power altogether unaccountable, considering in how
                            low estimation it had been held before this controversy arose. I told
                            him I thought it might easily be accounted for. The power had formerly
                            operated without being seen; but it might be traced, to <persRef

                            The Masonic Oaths and mysteries give ten fold power to the knot of
                            association, and by the secresy vital to the Institution, it became a
                            conspiracy of exclusive privilege to the members at the expense of all
                            the rest of the community— I attended the meeting of the Historical

                        <p>I went into the woods of the 600 Acres lots, with <persRef

                            Sales of the standing wood are to be made. The weather was fair. the sky

                            autumnal day. We were out nearly six hours, from eight in the morning
                            till near two in the afternoon. We visited the <persRef
                                ref="borland-leonard">Borland</persRef> lot, the wood from about two
                            thirds of which was sold, and cut off last Winter—the Quincy lot, and
                            the three half trees lot— Part of the ground over which we went was so
                            thickly overgrown with bushes that it was with great difficulty we got
                            through— We came out of the woods westward of the lot which I purchased
                            last year of <persRef ref="baxter-james">James Baxter</persRef>, and
                            there I saw Cattle said to belong to a man named <persRef
                                ref="thayer-david">David Thayer</persRef>, grazing. There were
                            sundry breaches in the Wall upon the road, which I engaged M<hi

                            directed the wood remaining on the lot and the three others to be sold—
                            Seven years have now passed away, since I first traversed these rocky
                            woodlands, the autumn after the decease of <persRef key="adams-john">my
                                father</persRef>—and I deeply felt this day the departure of my
                            bodily strength in those seven years. My warnings, solemn warnings,
                            daily return. Would that they might produce upon me their proper effect!

                            namely, whom they should nominate for the Office of Lieutenant Governor

                            Marblehead who has declined the nomination of the Convention. I thought
                            they should make no new nomination, but permit the party to vote as
                            every individual should please, or recommend to them to vote for the

                            Boston, on Thursday, and invited them— They are <pb n="153" type="ms"
                            />travelling in this part of the Country to procure documents for a
                            compilation relating to the History of our Revolutionary War— They made
                            some enquiries concerning the nomination of <persRef

                            biography, written by himself in 1802. This is one of the numerous
                            incidents of our revolutionary history deemed so unimportant at the time
                            when they happened, that no record of them public or private was made,
                            and about which curiosity grows more intense from day to day— They
                            become subjects of controversy, in which conjecture takes the place of
                            evidence, and sometimes remain ultimately unsettled or become Articles
                            of faith in conflicting political creeds— My Son <persRef

                            There is much agitation in the Public mind, about an order from <persRef

                            self-knowledge and self-examination. And in the afternoon from Luke
                            17.20. “And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of

                            not with observation. 21. Neither shall they say, Lo here! or Lo there!

                            had been found among his papers. That he was Davis’s Administrator, and
                            had all his papers; but had never seen that Letter, and did not know by
                            whom it had been published— He had written a note to <persRef
                                ref="hale-nathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hale</persRef> to
                            make enquiry on the subject. I told him that it was found in a draw of
                            his writing desk, sold after his decease, and was now published with my
                            assent.— It is the Letter which I gave to <persRef

                            request I told him the manner in which it was returned to me after the
                            death of J. B. Davis, but he inconsiderately stated in publishing it,
                            that it was found among Davis’s papers— Upon this Statement Col<hi

                            that honorable purpose— To make an issue upon the fact, whether I wrote
                            a Letter, published with my assent—because he, the Administrator of the
                            person to whom it was written had not seen it— So much for

                            Friendship Sense of Justice and Independence of Spirit. So much for the

                            the third on the perversions of the human mind—and the first of the 5<hi
                                rend="superscript">th</hi> volume on the Sunday before Christmas—
                            His text is from Isaiah 9.5.6. The prophecy “Unto us a child is born,
                            unto us a son is given: <pb n="154" type="ms"/>and the government shall
                            be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful,
                            Counsellor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
                            Of the increase of his Government and Peace there shall be no end, upon
                            the throne of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef>, and upon his
                            kingdom, to order with justice, from henceforth even forever.” He gives
                            a historical exposition of this passage, and of the chapter from which
                            it is taken, and the two preceding chapters.— He then argues its
                            prophetic character as usual weakly answering strongly stated
                            objections. The passage has been tortured by mistranslations, not only
                            into a prophesy of Christ as the Messiah, but into a proof that Jesus is
                            the Mighty God, and the everlasting Father— It is by no means certain
                            that the passage has any reference to Christ whatever. I wrote to

                        <p>The drought continues, and a Midsummer Sun, pouring torrents of heat upon
                            the atmosphere kept me from my Garden and Nursery, where the exercise of
                            labour, under such a blaze is too potent for an enervated Constitution—
                            I confined myself to the house, and resumed the teaching of the Alphabet
                            to <persRef ref="adams-mary4">my Grand child</persRef>. I finished
                            reading the Book of <persRef ref="job">Job</persRef>, in <persRef

                            Leviathan absorbed my attention— Neither of these animals is known,
                            although one is supposed to be the Hippopotamos or river-horse, and the
                            other the Crocodile. I read the Article of the Crocodile, in <persRef

                            None in our part of America— After dinner I read a few Letters of

                            Towards Evening I took a short walk on the Hill opposite to my house, to
                            see if <persRef ref="thayer-solomon">Solomon Thayer’s</persRef> grain

                            rubber of whist in the Evening— My health is partially recovered, and a
                            recent blessing of Heaven, sheds a last ray upon my hopes of the future
                            as regards the present world— They have been too sanguine, and too
                            fondly cherished— <persRef key="adams-abigail">My mother</persRef> had a

                                >Young’s</persRef> Night thoughts— I read it when a child, and it

                            leaning upon Earth— There is no Passion more deeply seated in my bosom,
                            than the longing for posterity worthily to support my own and <persRef

                            in his and his descendant’s name— For this I have done my part— <persRef
