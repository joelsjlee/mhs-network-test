                        <p>In visiting my garden and Nursery, my attention is still arrested by my
                            seedling trees, although my experience has sufficiently proved, that
                            upon this labour all my time and interest is wasted— I have trees of
                            five successive years from the seed; of which one Mazzard Cherry, two
                            Apricots and two or three peach trees shew blossoms—of last years growth
                            there are numbers living of various sizes and strange shapes, and many
                            dead— The nettle trees so promising in their appearance the last Season
                            are all dead— The Sweet gum and willow Oaks, dead—the Honey locust,
                            beginning to shew vegetation— The Ashes alive and promising— Many of the
                            yearling Oaks looking well— Peaches, Cherries, Apples alive, and wanting
                            to be trimmed— 3. Apples, and three pears, budded in 1831. promising. I
                            had the Lima-beans given me by <persRef ref="mease-james">D<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Mease</persRef>; sown— The old dead
                            English walnut cut down for firewood— The two Currant-bushes from the
                            seed, living— Others barely out of the ground in the boxes— The
                            Strawberries, scarcely beginning to spread— I have in the garden and
                            nursery, I suppose a hundred Apple seeds, and cherry stones, just up,
                            scarcely yet able to discriminate them from one another— I prune freely
                            the trees of two and three years standing— <persRef ref="spear-daniel"
                                >Deacon Spear</persRef> came and settled with me, for the Notes due
                            by him for wood on the Sales of last Autumn— I had also much
                            Conversation with him upon the Parish debt— Nothing done— The Parish
                            Treasurer inactive: the Collector delinquent. Deacon Spear made an
                            arrangement with me for several parcels of my lands for the ensuing
                            year. After dinner I walked down to the Mount Wollaston farm— My Orchard
                            planted in 1830. is in little better condition than my other rural
                            undertakings— Almost every one of my Seedlings has perished— Of the
                            border of forest-trees scarcely one is left— They have all been
                            extirpated by the frost, or smothered by rank growths of weeds— I met
                                <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> who was going
                            to Dorchester, and continued my walk down to Rock-Island, where I met
                                <persRef ref="spear-luther">Luther Spear</persRef>— He shewed me the
                            whole range of fence which he said he had set out, and for which he
                            calls upon me to pay. I saw it all, and asked what he would wish to
                            charge me for it— He said about twenty-five dollars but afterwards
                            admitted that might be too much— He said he would talk it over with his
                            brother Alpheus, and then let me know the result— I walked home, and
                            wrote all the Evening.</p>

                            stay and dine with us— His principal object seemed to be to ascertain
                            whether I would accept an invitation to an Evening party at his house to
                            meet <persRef ref="kemble-charles;kemble-fanny">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> and Miss Kemble</persRef>— He said the young Lady was
                            desirous of being introduced to me— And I could but say that it would be
                            very pleasing to me— She comes as an extraordinary personage— A young
                            woman little more that twenty-two years of age, performing the first
                            female parts of the drama, both in Tragedy and Comedy; and having
                            herself at the age of sixteen written a Tragedy called Francis the
                            first, which has been eminently successful She has also written much
                            miscellaneous and fugitive poetry which is greatly admired— Withal a
                            most affectionate and profitable daughter, to her father, whom she has
                            relieved from great pecuniary embarrassments—perfectly unexceptionable
                            in her deportment, and regular in attendance upon religious duties— A
                            niece of <persRef ref="siddons-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                                Siddons</persRef>, and of <persRef ref="kemble-john">John

                            most respectable Societies, and has elevated her <pb n="76" type="ms"
                            />profession to the standard of the most liberal— As a sort of a
                            personage myself, of the last century, I was flattered by the wish of
                            this blossom of the next age, to bestow some of her fresh fragrance upon
                            the antiquities of the past—and I answered D<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r.</hi> Parkman accordingly. After dinner I had a visit from the
                                <persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">present Lieutenant Governor of the
                                Commonwealth, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Armstrong</persRef>,
                            who thanked me for several public documents, which I sent to him during
                            the late Session of Congress, and with whom I had a long conversation
                            upon nullification and the Colonization Society— <persRef

                            promised to engraft apples and pears upon some of my young Stocks— I
                            observe that the red Oak seedlings flourish the most and the white Oaks
                            the least of any of my forest trees— Cherries the most and pears the
                            least of my fruit-trees— The new Seedlings suffer by the drought.</p>

                            superannuated that he can give no corrected account of his Services— I
                            questioned him particularly with regard to the time for which he was
                            engaged under his several enlistments; but it was to no purpose. I

                            draw upon me for the remainder of the debt due to him, by the bequest in
                                <persRef key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Will— Spent much of
                            the morning in my Garden and Nursery— I have a succession of seedling
                            trees, from five years old to seeds just up, sown last Summer and
                            Autumn, and this Morning I sow’d a row of white beech seeds, and mazzard
                            cherry stones which have been kept over the winter, and of which I
                            conclude that none will come up— Of the first vegetation of this year,
                            nothing appears yet, but the seed leaves of Apples and Cherries.
                            Sometimes the cherry stone itself, and the apple seed come out of the
                            ground, cast off their broken shells, and expand to seed leaves— Several
                            of those which had come up are already dead. I have a row of red, and a
                            row of black Oaks, of which I planted the Acorns at the same time the
                                8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October 1831. The red Oaks have
                            a growth of the last Season, twice at least upon the average, greater
                            than that of the black— I have as yet no appearance from Acorns, nor
                            even from any Peach-stone, planted the last Autumn— The Apricot-trees
                            suffer greatly— White Elms grow with great rapidity— So do the English
                            Oaks, but they get Winter-killed to the roots, and then grow up scrubby.

                                Gannett</persRef> of Cambridgeport; this Morning from 2. Peter 1.16.
                            “For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known
                            unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were
                            eye-witnesses of his Majesty”—and in the afternoon from Luke 12.51.
                            “Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you Nay; but
                            rather division.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gannett dined with
                            us—he is a young man of intelligent, but I think of anxious and
                            melancholy disposition. He has difficulties with his Parish, and is much
                            alarmed at the rapid progress of infidelity— It is indeed exceedingly
                            remarkable that the state of profound peace and universal tranquility
                            which for the last fifteen years has prevailed in this Country, has bred
                            a portentous indifference to the military Spirit, and to religion—
                            Within the last two years it has spread all over the Country to an
                            extent which I can hardly realize— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Gannett appears to be under great discouragement, and dejection of
                            Spirits— He told us that he had asked for a dismission from his parish;
                            but did not say whether they had agreed to the proposal— <persRef

                                >Cicero’s</persRef> Offices, and others of his moral Treatises,
                            concerning which he asked for my opinion—whether I thought the

                            reputation— He read to me five chapters of the third Book of the
                            Offices, which I thought very well done— He left the manuscript with me
                            and I promised to read it, and give him my opinion of it— He said he had
                            now an application for a third Edition of his Translation of Botta, for
                            which he is to receive 2000 dollars— That he had received 4000 dollars
                            for the first Edition, and 500 dollars for the second. The edition now
                            proposed, is to <pb n="78" type="ms"/>be in Stereotype— M<hi

                            would be a difficulty with regard to the word honestum, which he renders
                            by the word honest. It has not the same signification. He said he was
                            sensible of this difficulty, and it had been mentioned to him, by M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Pickering, but there was no other word, in
                            English which could be substituted for it. I advised that in using it,
                            he should give an explanatory note— We had an early dinner, and I went

                            Autumn has come up— Much of this day, morning and afternoon was absorbed
                            in the Garden— But I answered a Letter from <persRef ref="gray-daniel"
                                >Daniel L. Gray</persRef>, inviting my attendance at the anniversary
                            of the New-York Young Men’s society; which is auxiliary to the American
                            Young Men’s Society, for moral and intellectual improvement— I am
                            obliged to decline attendance at their meeting, which is to be on the
                                15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month.</p>

                        <p><persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston, and
                            returned to dinner. The day was intensely warm, and the afternoon
                            oppressively sultry— I visited the garden and Nursery, where the
                            progress of vegetation affords me pleasure, and acquires for the time, a
                            very disproportionate interest— It is also useful bodily exercise— I
                            have planted in two rows in the Garden a number of Spanish Chesnuts
                            which Charles brought out from Boston, but which will probably not come
                            up— With them are a number of Cherry-Stones and white Beech seeds kept
                            over winter which have doubtless <pb n="79" type="ms"/>perished in like
                            manner. My experience convinces me, that the only proper mode of raising
                            trees, whether for fruit or for the forest, is from the seed; but that
                            it is an art, requiring skill, and a continued course of minute
                            observation—a long and persevering pursuit of the object— Patience in
                            waiting for results—fortitude to bear disappointments with good temper,
                            and judgment and reflection to draw profitable facts from observed
                            phenomena— After six years of persevering experiment, I am yet to learn
                            how to sow or plant the seed, so that any considerable portion of it
                            shall come up— And how to protect it when up from frost—from the heat of
                            the Sun; from insects, and from mice— I answered Letters this day from
                                <persRef ref="hopkinson-joseph">Judge Hopkinson</persRef>, and from
                                <persRef ref="walsh-robert">Robert Walsh</persRef>— And I read
                            several chapters of <persRef ref="otis-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Otis’s</persRef> translation of <persRef

                            the Original and with the German and French Translations— Otis
                            translates nothing but the words, and preserves entirely the Latin
                            idiom— His book therefore will be scarcely more intelligible to the
                            English reader, than the Latin itself— The heat of the weather reduced
                            me to idleness, from dinner till Night.</p>

                            He said he was born and bred at Athol in the County of Worcester—that he

                            business at Quincy had come to see me from mere curiosity. I read a few

                        <p>I was called in from my inspection of vegetation in my garden and
                            Nursery, this morning by two Men, going round for subscriptions to raise
                            money, they say 5500 dollars to build a bridge, and open a road from
                            Commercial point in Dorchester, to Boston; a project of which I heard
                            much some 25 years back, but which since that time has slumbered till
                            now. They supposed it might shorten and improve the road from my house
                            to Boston so much that I should be willing to subscribe something for
                            it; but I declined— I received a Letter from <persRef ref="smith-john"
                                >John A. Smith</persRef> notifying me, that he had drawn upon me for
                            960 dollars, the whole balance due him, upon the bequest to him in
                                <persRef key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Will, as I had
                            proposed to him by Letter a few days since. At the same time I received
                            from the Cashier of the Suffolk Bank in Boston, notice that the draft
                            was payable— <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> therefore
                            went into Boston, with my Check upon the U.S. Branch Bank, and took up
                            the draft— He came home to dine— <persRef ref="spear-luther">Luther
                                Spear</persRef> came with a bill of 14:75 for the fence, for which
                            he has had a claim upon me, which I took for consideration— He spoke
                            also of purchasing part of my Land at the foot of Penn’s Hill, or taking
                            a Lease of <pb n="80" type="ms"/>my farm there for five years, upon
                            which we shall converse further hereafter.— <persRef ref="kirk-john"
                                >John Kirk</persRef> went with the Carriage to Dedham, and about six

                                    >r</hi> Wallack</persRef> of Washington, from thence to Dedham—
                            She was quite ill this Evening; and fainted before going to bed— But was
                            afterwards better— The Newspapers contain accounts of a personal assault
                            by the late <persRef ref="randolph-robert">lieutenant Randolph</persRef>
                            of the navy, upon <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President
                                Jackson</persRef>, on board a Steamboat at Alexandria— He simply
                            tweaked him by the nose, and went away— Jackson was much disposed to
                            chastise him with his cane—but Randolph got away without even being
                            arrested by the President’s retinue— A bench warrant from the Circuit
                            Court, and a Justice’s warrant were issued against Randolph, but he got
                            out of their reach, and out of the district into Virginia, before they
                            could be served— A President of the United States pulled by the nose, is
                            a new incident in the History of this Country; and as he himself has
                            countenanced personal violence against members of Congress, he will not
                            meet with much sympathy. The law provides no special penalty for this
                            offence,—the judicial proof of which would be a hundred times severer
                            punishment upon the sufferer than upon the culprit— Randolph may run a
                            risk of being mobbed, and certainly would be so, in a place where the
                            President should be very popular— He is not so now, in the district of
                            Columbia.</p>

                        <p>In my Morning visitation of my Garden and Nursery, I took up and
                            transplanted a Plum tree, the only one raised from the Stone of a
                            multitude that I have planted, and which had grown up between a Peach
                            tree, and a Cherry or Apricot, and now too near to both— As none of my
                            seeds specially staked out have come up, I probed the ground where I had
                            planted a whole wood house apple, and found it in full vegetation, four
                            or five inches beneath the service— It would probably never have made
                            its way to the surface, or if at-all, so late in the Season that the
                            plant could not have had time to outgrow the destruction of the next

                                Shattuck</persRef> came in after dinner. I had much conversation
                            with Miss Kemble, chiefly upon dramatic Literature; but it differed not
                            from what it might have been with any well educated and intelligent
                            young woman of her age— I spoke to her of some of her own poetical
                            productions, but she did not appear inclined to talk of them— What she
                            appeared chiefly to pride herself upon was feats of horsemanship. She
                            said she had rode this Morning about thirty miles, and leaped over many
                            fences and Stone walls— She said they expected to remain in this Country
                            till about this time next year. I asked her if she had ever seen her
                            Aunt <persRef ref="siddons-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                                Siddons</persRef> upon the Stage— She had not but had heard her read
                                <persRef ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef>. She had
                            known her only as a very good woman. She observed that she herself had
                            been chiefly educated, and spent the greater part of her life in France,
                            and until a very few years since had never had an idea of going upon the
                            Stage herself— I had called at <persRef ref="hall-joseph">judge

                            been reported by the Committee of Claims early in January, but that the
                            days usually devoted to private business, having been wasted upon the
                            Tariff Bill, his claim had not been reached— And I promised to give the
                            earliest attention to it at the next Session of Congress— <persRef

                            with him to the Parish-Meeting, which was not numerously attended— I was
                            chosen Moderator— Votes were passed 1. Authorizing the Treasurer to sell
                            the 30 pews remaining unsold, for 3000 dollars if so much can be
                            obtained for them. 2. To revoke the permission to the purchasers of
                            pews, partly paid for, to hold them, by paying interest on the balances
                            due upon them— 3. Directing the Treasurer to require payment or
                            satisfactory security for the balances due, on or before the first of
                            July next— 4. That the 3. Assessors, the 3. Deacons and the Treasurer be

                        <p>Promises of rain in the weather, with little performance— I receive
                            Letters, which it is difficult to answer, and sometimes they absorb an
                            undue proportion of my time— Shortly before I left Washington, I
                            received from <persRef ref="newman-robert">R. Newman</persRef> of
                            Romney, Virginia, a View of the Solar System in 24. Folio pages, with
                            three or four Sheets of Diagrams, containing a theory of astronomy,
                            which he put under my protection— I brought it with me from Washington,
                            but have not had time to examine it— This day I received from the author
                            a second Letter, enquiring if I had received the other— There came also
                            a Letter from <persRef ref="middleton-robert">R: W. Middleton</persRef>
                            of Gettysburg Pennsylvania, enquiring my opinion, whether seceding
                            Free-Masons are justifiable in disclosing the Secrets of Masonry— And a
                            Letter from <persRef ref="angier-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                John Angier</persRef> of Medford, giving the opinion that <persRef

                            garden and nursery I found vegetation much at a stand—discovered new
                            shoots of two seedling trees, but not so distinct that I could tell what
                            they were— The morning wasted away—and the afternoon till near Sunset,

                        <p>The Season is exceedingly dry— There was last Night and this morning a
                            very light warm rain, the effect of which upon vegetation was visible— I
                            spent about three hours of this Morning in my garden and Nursery— I do
                            so almost every morning, and the only apology that I can make for this
                            waste of time, is that it serves for bodily exercise— I wish also to use
                            it in observing the phenomena of vegetation, and thence to draw useful
                            conclusions— But this is a source only of disappointment— I commenced
                            this morning the labour of eradicating weeds, which will give me
                            constant and laborious exercise— I found this morning at the bottom of
                            the Nursery three seedling cherry trees, in a range where I have been
                            three years endeavouring to raise them without success— There was one
                            came up there last Summer but it perished— I ascertained by turning up
                            the ground of a whole dwarf Apple, which I had specially staked out,
                            that it has vegetated, but I probably destroyed the Seedlings— My
                            Nettle-trees which I headed down thinking them dead have put out shoots
                            in profusion— The Night-beetle has topped off all the shoots of my red
                            Oaks, without sparing one of them— I received a Letter from the <persRef

                                Newman’s</persRef> Views of the Solar System, and answered his
                            Letter, proposing to present his paper to the American Academy of Arts
                            and Sciences— He considers the Newtonian doctrine of attraction and
                            gravitation as inadequate to explain the phenomena of Astronomy. He
                            supposes an elastic gazeous principle necessary to account for the
                            motion of matter, and thinks <persRef ref="newton-isaac"
                                >Newton’s</persRef> theory defective in assuming that the Sun is
                            stationary. I am not sure that Newton’s system does assume or require
                            this— I got engaged this morning in some enquiries respecting the
                            Chronology and History of the books of <persRef ref="ezra"
                                >Ezra</persRef> and <persRef ref="nehemiah">Nehemiah</persRef>, and
                            the names of <persRef ref="cyrus-ii">Cyrus</persRef>, <persRef

                                >Ahasuerus</persRef> and <persRef ref="artaxerxes"
                                >Artaxerxes</persRef>, contained in them— The Assyrian, Syrian,
                            Babylonian, Median and Persian Monarchies, are blended together in my
                            mind, so that I have no distinct idea of their history, nor indeed of
                            the Geography of the Countries where they existed— I looked into
                                <persRef ref="lenglet-nicolas">Lenglet du Fresnoy’s</persRef>
                            Tablettes Chronologiques, and into the Tables of the Dictionnaire
                            Historique, where I found some information, and indications where more
                            is to be found; but it consumes time, and leaves me still to search and
                            read— I laboured also in my Garden and Nursery, and began upon the
                            extirpation of weeds. I observe the difference in the vegetation of the
                            Shell bark and pignut walnut trees— This afternoon I gathered a few elm
                            seeds, and planted a row of them in the garden— The horse chesnut tree
                            in front of my chamber window is in full blossom.</p>

                        <p>Much of the morning was occupied in weeding my Nursery, the weather being
                            still so cool, that I could work there. After dinner I walked to

                        <p>Midsummer heat— It was yesterday so cold that I was obliged to make a
                            fire in my chamber to read and write with comfort; and this morning
                            after going into my nursery to continue the process of extirpating weeds
                            I was obliged to retreat from the scorching heat of the Sun, back into
                            the house— This is the constant alternation which in this Climate passes
                            for the Spring of the year— I finished sowing the single row of Elm
                            seeds, which I had commenced last Thursday—and prepared the ground for a
                            second row. <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to

                                Whitney</persRef>, this morning from John 1.46. “<persRef

                            the afternoon from 1. Corinthians 14.40. “Let all things be done
                            decently and in order.”— I read the second Sermon of the 3<hi

                            7.36–50. a very edifying discourse, remarkable especially for the
                            statement of a great controversial question, whether the sins of this
                            woman were forgiven because she loved much; or whether she loved much
                            because her sins were forgiven— That is which was the cause, and which
                            the effect— The narrative certainly gives occasion for such a question—
                            The repentance of the woman is proportioned to the magnitude of her
                            Sins, and her pardon is obtained by the sincerity of her repentance, and
                            the warmth of her affection.— She is saved by her works, and she is
                            saved by her faith— I looked into the Jewish Antiquities of <persRef

                            Josephus multiplies difficulties— He says it was <persRef

                            commissioned Ezra and Nehemiah, and that Cyrus, called by the Greeks

                            Nehemiah— That this could not be Xerxes seems apparent for he reigned
                            only 20 years and Nehemiah speaks of the 32<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
                            year of the king. To reconcile the Bible names and Chronology with those
                            of the profane historians must be given up as a desperate job— The
                            morning of this day was so warm, that I totally dismissed my winter
                            clothing; there was a sudden and instantaneous change this afternoon, by
                            the wind’s coming round to the East— Very little rain.</p>

                            of pecuniary interest, with a poor man—where there is doubt, the
                            equitable rule is to yield rather than contend. The maxim of Wisdom
                            would be, concede everything to the poor, which they claim of right. I
                            worked in my Nursery garden Morning and afternoon— The Seedlings of the
                            present Season have ceased coming up; and the heat of the Sun has killed
                            so many of them, that it is doubtful whether any of them will survive
                            the Season— I gathered a few Elm seeds, and sowed a second row of the
                            seeds in the garden— The Horse Chesnut, Lilac and Strawberry are in
                            profuse blossom— A single peach has come up in the garden and one in the
                            Nursery, an Apple bud inserted by <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">Price
                                Greenleaf</persRef> in August 1831 and which we thought had failed,
                            shoots out since he grafted the same Stock— Several of his grafts are
                            also vegetating— I pursued my Chronological enquiries till I became

                            upon me for the Penny-ferry lot of Saltmarsh of 2 1/2 acres which I own
                            in that town— This high way tax is an extra burden, besides those of the

                            declined— Odiorne asked me whether I thought it would be advisable for
                            them to omit the delivery of an Oration for this year, and I answered
                            that I did. I went with <persRef ref="spear-luther">Luther

                            upon it, but expects to have it very cheap— I met there <persRef

                            one years interest upon my Canal Notes.— I made some small examination
                            of the receipts and expenditures of the Canal; and was not entirely
                            satisfied with the management of the affairs of the Corporation— M<hi

                            large a stake in a small corporation— I walked home, and was in the

                        <p>The differing Chronologies of the Hebrew and Septuagint Bibles absorb my
                            time. The 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of Genesis contains
                            the genealogies and chronology from the creation to the flood— The 11<hi

                            whole 3434 years—the Hebrew Bible 1948— Here is a difference of 1486
                            years— The modern Systems of Chronology are generally founded upon the
                            Hebrew text, but the phenomena of the Earth and the populousness of the
                            antient Nations seem to require the more extended term— There can indeed
                            be no authentic record of History, nor of proper names of much earlier
                            date than the invention of Alphabetical writing— It is difficult to
                            comprehend how there could be Language, or at any rate, Grammar before
                            that time— The Hieroglyphics of Egypt were painted emblems— If <persRef

                            the afternoon from 1. Chronicles 28.9.—[“]for the Lord searcheth all
                            hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou
                            seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him he will cast
                            thee off forever.”— The day was dull and gloomy though with very little
                            rain, in short drizzling Showers— The auditory very small, both parts of

                            four days after the Battle of Ramilies, and its principal object is the
                            refutation of <persRef ref="bayle-pierre">Bayle’s</persRef> paradoxical
                            and heterodoxical opinion that a people could not subsist as a

                            than refuted this opinion of Bayle— Saurin meets it with furious
                            invective;—in the biographical dictionaries it is said that Bayle died
                            in December 1706. this Sermon mentions him however as deceased before it
                            was delivered— Here is a third Example added to those of <persRef

                            was a free thinker—perhaps an infidel; but how harmless to his
                            reputation is this abuse of Saurin—a man whose reputation though yet
                            high as an eloquent preacher is yet far below that of Bayle— I read also

                        <p>Another gloomy day with an East wind and very little rain— Morning and
                            afternoon in the garden and nursery—weeding—no new vegetation— After
                            dinner I gathered an handful of Elm Seeds, strewed on the ground, fallen
                            from the Trees, and planted them in Earthen Pots— The germ of the Elm is
                            a small seed about as big as the head of a pin, covered with a cuticle,
                            forming a round flat leaflet, about a quarter of an inch in diameter—
                            They are now thickly strewed on the ground under the Trees— The colour
                            of the covering pellicle has faded, but the germ at the centre is yet
                            green— The ash has a similar germ under a cover of a different form— The
                            germ of the Oak and that of the Chesnut are not larger, but they are
                            enclosed in large pulpy acorns and nuts— It is said that the seeds of
                            elms readily come up; but this is the first time I have had the
                            opportunity of trying them. <persRef ref="mcmahon-bernard"
                                >M’Mahon’s</persRef> gardener’s Calendar says the seeds should be

                            cast, and covered not more than a quarter of an inch deep of Earth—
                            Neither the drying, nor the sowing at Broad cast seems to be essential—

                            promised another for his descendants— Yet the Assyrian, and Egyptian
                            Monarchies then existed—and the descendants of <persRef ref="ham"
                                >Ham</persRef> were in permanent possession of the land, which was
                            to belong finally to the children of Israel. Here is a wide field of
                            enquiry open— I went this morning with <persRef key="adams-charles2"
                                >Charles</persRef> to Boston, and after calling at <persRef

                            Officers of the last year were re-elected— The nomination book for new
                            members was lost. I presented the paper of <persRef ref="newman-robert"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newman</persRef> of Virginia
                            upon the Solar System, which was referred without reading to the
                            publishing Committee— A new Volume of the Transactions was prepared for
                            publication, and the price for it was fixed at four dollars— There were
                            about fifteen members present; but excepting my communication, no
                            approach was made to the consideration of any subject of a Scientific
                            character. I moved that in the list of Members to be published with the
                            new Volume, all honorific Titles should be dispensed with in designating
                            domestic members—which was agreed to— The Meeting adjourned about one
                            O’Clock, and I returned with Charles to Quincy to dine— After dinner I
                            lounged about my garden and did nothing. Nor could I read but a few
                            pages this Evening—</p>

                        <p>The weather continues cloudy and cold with Easterly winds, and
                            occasional, but very light rains. I wade along with <persRef

                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Mary Dawes</persRef>— I spent
                            hours of the morning in the Nursery and of the afternoon in the Garden.
                            I continue the labour of weeding while I may— My Strawberries which I
                            raised from the seed in 1831. and transferred from the pot to the Bed
                            last Summer have blossomed, and will bear this Season. But the wild
                            plants which I brought from the Rail way in November 1830. have been
                            totally smothered, by a spontaneous growth of red Clover—which with
                            sundry weeds has wholly overspread the patch of ground. I gathered and
                            planted a row of Elm Seeds— And after I had concluded that the putting
                            forth of Seedlings had ceased for the year, I discovered a row of half a
                            dozen Oaklings coming out of the ground, and as almost always <pb n="89"
                                type="ms"/>happens, in a totally unexpected place— I found in a box
                            of dry sand, a heap of acorns, Shellbark walnuts and chesnuts which I
                            had buried there last October, to keep them over winter, and which I had
                            forgotten till now. Had they been planted when I first came home, they
                            might have come to something— I deposited almost the whole of them in a
                            heap at the corner of the Nursery— Some of the Horse-Chesnuts may come
                            up.</p>

                            Nursery—the weeding of which yet gives me full occupation— After dinner

                            employed the afternoon in writing, and took a very short walk just after
                            Sunset— Three hours of exposure to the air, with the labour of weeding
                            which produces profuse perspiration, is exercise enough for the day; and

                            and most of the buds—upon the same trees which had been inserted in
                            August 1831. and which we thought had failed, are opening leaves, and
                            putting out shoots— My seedling apples of the present year are perishing
                            in the radiance of the Sun— The wild Cherries bear it much better— My
                            seedling Strawberries are promising with blossoms, and I have high
                            Blackberries, Currants and Grapes coming up— The Beetle bugs devour in
                            the Night, the tops and leaves of my red Oaks— The Ash grows more
                            beautifully than any other tree, and no Insect appears yet to attack it—
                            My Walnut trees from the Pennsylvania Nut come out later than those from
                            the Nuts of our own Soil. Charles is planting Larch, Fir, Spruce, red
