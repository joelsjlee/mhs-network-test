						<p><date>1. </date>Monday IV:30— I walked this morning before breakfast with
							my Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="cranch-william">Judge Cranch’s</persRef> on the Capitol Hill,
							where he and John witnessed the Execution by me, and took my

								ref="brigham-daniel">David T. Brigham</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="davis-isaac">Isaac Davis</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="goddard-perley">Perley Goddard</persRef>, of upwards of 500
							Acres of Land at Princeton— I had received the Deed from my Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, yesterday, and despatched it
							to him by the Mail with a short Letter this Evening— I received also a
							Letter from <persRef ref="thomas-william">W. Thomas</persRef> at
							Plymouth with the name of Ezra<space/>as a claimant for a Revolutionary
							Pension in addition to those he had sent me before. I went to the
							Pension Office, and gave to <persRef ref="edwards-james">James L
								Edwards</persRef> the Commissioner this name, and enquired of all
							the rest whose names I had given to the <persRef ref="cass-lewis"
								>Secretary of War</persRef> on Saturday— Edwards said the Papers had
							been found; they were now in hand; and he would give me information
							concerning them—tomorrow or the next day. The Papers in one case only,
							that of <persRef ref="lucas-ephraim">Ephraim Lucas</persRef> had not
							been found.— I wrote Letters to <persRef ref="bates-stephen">Stephen
								Bates</persRef>, to thank him for returning to me a Letter which I
							had written last April from Philadelphia to <persRef ref="davis-john3"
								>John B. Davis</persRef>, and after his death, was in the draw of a
							desk, sold with the effects of his— Bates procured and returned it to
							me— I wrote also to <persRef ref="slocum-christopher">Christopher
								Slocom</persRef> at Medway, and sent him a copy of a remonstrance
							against his petition for a new Post-Office— I was writing almost the
							whole day, and made little progress in preparation for my departure— The
							Election in Massachusetts for the Members of the House of
							Representatives to the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Congress, took
							place this day. I received from the Telegraph Office 100 copies of the
							Report of the Minority of the Committee of Manufactures.— <persRef

						<p>As I copy the Manuscripts of Masonry from <persRef ref="stone-william2"
								>W. L. Stone</persRef>, new reflections occur to me, and new proofs
							of the pernicious character of that Institution— I received an order
							from <persRef ref="smith-john">John A. Smith</persRef> for the payment
							of 500 dollars of the bequest from <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father</persRef> to him—which I accepted— Despatched about 40 copies

							Boston, by <persRef ref="eastburn-john">Eastburn</persRef>, under the

								ref="walsh-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walsh</persRef>
							writes me that they will circulate many thousand copies of the
							Supplement to the National Gazette containing the Report. The Hingham
							Gazette of Friday last, has several electioning Essays pro and con—but
							the National Republican Convention at Scituate on Thursday the 28<hi

							a Candidate for the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Congress—and passed
							a handsome resolution of approbation of my Service in the 22<hi

							Suspicions, which were founded on the attacks against me in the Hingham
							Gazette, unanswered; the cold and doubting neutrality of the Old-Colony
							Memorial, and the shyness of the Pilgrim— These are all the newspapers
							published in the District, excepting the We The People, an Antimasonic
							Paper, of scarcely any circulation, the zeal of which was rather <pb
								n="56" type="ms"/>adapted to stimulate and exasperate the Masonic
							opposition. The party adverse to Anti-Masonry in the District, is 3/5 of
							the whole vote— Not quite half consisting of National Republicans, and
							about one seventh of Jacksonians— These have nominated <persRef
								ref="lincoln-jedediah">Jedidiah Lincoln</persRef>, whom I do not
							know— There is an Article in the Hingham Gazette, recommending to the
							adversaries of Antimasonry, National Republicans to vote for the
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> Candidate, if they
							present a decent man— It is probable that the greater number of them
							will not vote at all— I went to the Clerk’s office of the House of
							Representatives, but <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clarke</persRef> was not there— In the

							three or four afterwards in addressing copies of the Minority Report to
							the Members of the Massachusetts Legislature— I sent a copy to each
							member of the Council, after having much difficulty, and consuming much
							time in ascertaining their residences. In the number of We the People
							which came this day, the Letter of the Anti-Masonic Members of the
							Massachusetts Legislature to me, dated in January, and my answer dated
							the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March, are both published; I
							suppose taken from the daily Boston Advocate—it ascertained to me the
							fact, of which I had some doubt—whether my Answer had been received,
							before the adjournment of the Legislature. They adjourned on the 28<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi>— We the People has also the address of
							the Anti-Masonic Convention which nominated me for Election to the 23<hi

						<p>I want the art of writing short Letters. This morning I began one to

							send to him a copy of <persRef ref="macmurrough-dermot">Dermot</persRef>

							left it with him, requesting him that if possible the cases might be
							decided and the Certificates or answers sent to me before next Wednesday
							that being the day upon which I propose to depart upon my homeward

							the returns of five towns in the County of Norfolk, but none from the
							County of Plymouth— <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> promised

							Also a little band of Italian Musicians with two Harps, one Violin, a
							Clarinette and a flute, who enlivened the passage with much discourse of
							sweet Music. I got into a discussion with Duff Green, upon the Tariff,
							Domestic Manufactures and Protection, Slave labour and consolidation,
							which attracted round us a circle of listeners, to my great annoyance.
							Another discussion arose between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Messenger, and another passenger, upon the project of <persRef
								ref="grey-charles">Earl Gray’s</persRef> Ministry to emancipate the
							Slaves in the British West-Indies, from which discussion, I with some

							Told me that <persRef ref="thayer-sylvanus">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l</hi> Thayer</persRef> was actually removed from the

								ref="kendall-amos">Amos Kendall</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="vanness-john">Van Ness</persRef> the Mayor of Washington had
							undertaken to investigate certain charges of peculation against <persRef
								ref="rodgers-john">Commodore Rodgers</persRef>, and went to him at
							the Office of the Navy Commissioners— That Rodgers told them, if he had
							been guilty of Official Misdemeanour he had a right to a trial by his
							Peers— That he should not hold himself accountable to them— That there
							was the door of the Office, out of which he recommended to them to
							retire, to save him and them the mortification of his kicking them out,
							which he should certainly otherwise do— They sneaked off and then an
							Article of the Globe disclaimed any intention of trying the Commodore,
							and pretending that the enquiry was only of some malversation of his
							Clerks— Andrew Wallace, the descendant from <persRef
								ref="wallace-robert">Robert</persRef> the brother of <persRef
								ref="wallace-william2">Sir William</persRef>, fought over again his
							battles of Preston Pans and Culloden, and at the suggestion of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Messenger, a collection of a few dollars
							was made for the old man among the Passengers— I had a Conversation with

								<persRef ref="eaton-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Eaton</persRef> came up and spoke to me several times— He told me
							that on the day of the conflagration of the Treasury Department he had
							picked up in the Street an order signed by the <persRef
								ref="mclane-louis">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> the day
							before, for a repayment of duties, under the act of the last Session—
							The order had been blown off by the wind from the perishing Edifice, and
							though somewhat scorched was still entire— We landed at Frenchtown at 11
							O’Clock, and crossed the Peninsula to Newcastle in the Railway Cars
							impelled by the locomotive engine in fifty minutes—16 miles— But we had
							flakes of fire floating about us in the Cars the whole time with the
							allowance of two minutes for the slackening of speed at the departure
							and arrival we travell’d at the rate of a mile every three minutes; and
							were precisely one hour from landing at Frenchtown from one Steamer to
							leaving the wharf at Newcastle in the other— We landed at 4. O’Clock at
							Philadelphia, and I took my lodgings at the United States Hotel— At 6. I
							called at <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nicholas Biddle’s</persRef>, but he was not at home; then at
								<persRef ref="walsh-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Walsh’s</persRef> and spent an hour with him— Then at <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Sergeant’s</persRef>— He was going out with his <persRef
								ref="sergeant-anna;sergeant-margaretta2">two elder
								daughters</persRef> to a tea-party— I came home to my lodgings and
							wrote till eleven, to bring up arrears of diary, and press <persRef
								ref="livingston-edward">Edward Livingston</persRef>. I met at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Walsh’s a Frenchman by the name of
								<persRef ref="u">Picot</persRef>— Walsh told me he had issued 9000
							copies of the Supplement to the National Gazette containing the Report
							and the United States Gazette issued it in a Supplement also.— Walsh
							spoke also of my Letter to Edward Livingston; but not in the same tone
							of approbation— He disclaims being at all under Masonic influence, but
							has not published the Letter, nor will he publish it.</p>

							and in some purpose of the observer; and not pour l’amour de mes beaux

							Told me he was a foreigner; that he had heard me at Boston deliver an
							Eulogy upon <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef>; and that he was naturally desirous of seeing
							distinguished persons, as in Europe People always wished to see kings

							Welsh Churches—(more than one) somewhere near Utica in the State of
							New-York— He had certificates of his respectability, and of his being
							employed in that service; but I declined giving him a contribution— I
							was with <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Biddle</persRef> great part of the day. Twice at the Bank, but our
							Conversation was continually interrupted there by persons, coming to him

							the place upon which the Girard College is to be built— It is already
							staked out— There are 45 Acres of Land, but the directions of the Will
							are so particular and minutious that they are compelled to erect their
							building in oblique direction to the Streets of the Squares,
							discomposing the Symmetry of the City— I met there <persRef
								ref="richards-benjamin2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Richards</persRef> late Mayor of the City, and several other members

							we paid a short visit to the penitentiary which I had visited when here
							last Spring.— Among the convicts I conversed again with the remarkable

									>rs</hi> Lawrence</persRef>; where we heard a Sermon from
								<persRef ref="furness-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Furness</persRef> from Psalm 145.9. “The Lord is good to all, and
							his tender mercies are over all his works.” The argument was a special
							Providence, beneficent to every individual and inferrible from the
							blessings which never fail to flow from obedience to the will of God.
							This position was original to me, and was sustained with great force and
							ingenuity— He began by asserting that the belief of a Supreme being, and
							of a general superintending Providence was useless and unprofitable
							unless accompanied with that of a special Providence providing for the
							happiness of every individual— And the proof of this he inferred from
							the fact that Virtue never loses its reward—but is always conducive to
							happiness— <persRef ref="kirkland-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							brought themselves to reason very coolly. <persRef ref="fletcher-thomas"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher</persRef> came and
							invited M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence and his family and me to

							Hulme was with us at both— I called then upon <persRef
								ref="walsh-robert">R. Walsh</persRef> and passed about two hours

								>Palsgrave</persRef> on the British Constitution. He gave me a
							Globe, containing a burlesque parody in verse of part of my published
							Letter to <persRef ref="livingston-edward">Edward Livingston</persRef>—

							should address to Livingston upon that subject, but that they wanted to
							keep me confined to <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> and

									>l.</hi> Thayer’s</persRef> resigning the Superintendent’s <pb

								<persRef ref="bunker-william">Bunker’s</persRef>, intending to take
							lodgings there with him— But they had just, spare room for him and his
							family, and none for me— I thence went to the City-Hotel, where they
							were so full, that they could give me at first only a bedchamber so
							shabby that I could not put up with it—one of their lodgers however went
							off to Albany, and they gave me his bed-room; about the size of a
							penitentiary cell; without fire-place; but a great improvement on the
							other. I soon went out, in search of <persRef ref="smith-john">John A.
								Smith’s</persRef> Office, N. 10. Vesey Street; which I found, with
							his partner in it— He went with me to meet him at his lodgings, at the
							Clinton Hotel. I met him with a Cousin of his, Son of his Aunt at
							Philadelphia— I looked at a Bed-chamber, at the Clinton-Hall, but it was
							no better than the one I occupied at the City-Hotel— I agreed to go with
							the Smith’s to the Italian Opera— <persRef ref="davis-charles2">M<hi

							in the drama— The jealous furies of an ugly blackamoor at the supposed
							infidelity of a beautiful daughter of a Venetian Senator are not more
							pathetic in Song than in Story. I never relished Othello— Otello is not
							more amusing— Signora Pedrotti sung and acted very well; but there was
							no enthusiasm, no good songs and much dull recitative— The House was
							full, and fashionable— The Play is in three Acts— No afterpiece, and I
							was at my lodgings in bed, before eleven O’Clock— My raking life has
							already brought my eyes into jeopardy— The lights in the house were so
							oppressive, that I was obliged to shade my forehead with my hand almost
							the whole Evening.</p>

						<p>My suffering eyes debar me from reading, writing or early rising— How
							large a portion of my life, I have wasted in careless indolence!— How
							much I lose now in compulsive indolence! My nephew <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas2">Lieutenant Thomas B. Adams</persRef> arrived
							here this Morning in the Steamer Boston from Providence— He has had a
							short furlough to visit his friends, and returns now to proceed to

								Hull</persRef> at West Point; and the <persRef
								ref="dewindt-caroline;dewindt-john">De Wint family</persRef> at
							Fish-kill Landing. After Breakfast I called at the Office of the
							Commercial Advertiser, and saw <persRef ref="stone-william2">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> William L. Stone</persRef>— His
							partner <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark</persRef>
							was with him— He was the person who wrote the Masonic Manuscripts which
							Stone sent me, and of which I have taken a copy— I asked him to let me
							keep the Originals—to which both he and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clark assented— I told them I should probably publish them— Clarke said
							he should wish that the name of <persRef ref="u">Chief Justice
								Hoemer</persRef> should not be used—nor that of <persRef
								ref="moseley-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Moseley</persRef>; but otherwise did not object to the publication—
							I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stone that I had not given up the
							cause of abolishing the Masonic Obligations, and hoped he would not give
							it up—but he was very lukewarm upon the Subject— He said the whole
							concern of Masonry and Anti-Masonry was going down in the State of
							New-York as fast as it could— That all interest upon the subject was
							rapidly subsiding— That the Masons were giving up their Lodges, and the
							Anti-Masons would never again muster so strong a vote as they had the
							last Fall— He seemed inclined however to publish a cheap edition of his
							own book; with my Letters to him upon the Entered Apprentices Oath, and
							those to <persRef ref="livingston-edward">Edward Livingston</persRef>,
							by way of Supplement or Appendix— I asked him <pb n="66" type="ms"/>if
							he could furnish me with the proceedings of the Grand Lodge of the State
							of New-York at their recent Meeting at Albany— He could not— I enquired
							if he knew what number of Lodges there had been in the State— He said
							about six hundred— My next visit was to <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> C. A. Davis</persRef>, who urged me
							much to go this Evening to a Soirée, a small musical party given by
								<persRef ref="u">Miss Douglas</persRef>, the Sister of <persRef
								ref="monroe-james2">James Monroe’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="monroe-elizabeth2">wife</persRef>, and who has lately
							returned from Europe— Coming back to my Lodgings, where my bedchamber
							was again changed, I found <persRef ref="fisher-redwood">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Redwood Fisher</persRef>, Editor of
							the New-York National Advocate, a paper much in the manufacturing

							approves very highly the Minority Report, and I have been so much
							flattered, and by so many persons upon that paper, that I am ashamed of
							myself for being elated with it; and duly grateful that it has been the
							means of softening many bitter animosities against me. M<hi

							stay till to-morrow— I had several visitors—<persRef ref="smith-john"
								>John A. Smith</persRef> and his Cousin Lieutenant T. B. Adams were
							with me part of the day— I breakfasted and dined at the Public Table and

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dewey</persRef>, part Editor of the
							New-York whig an anti-masonic Newspaper, and two other persons, one of

							had some project of republishing my Letters to Edward Livingston, which
							I could not encourage— They are to call again at ten to-morrow Morning—
							The <persRef ref="matthews-james">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Matthews</persRef> came, and I
							promised to call at his House to-morrow at Noon— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Fisher walked with me to his house, and I took tea with him
							and his family— I had engaged to go with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Davis to Miss Douglas’s; and he came for me at a quarter after nine—but
							I did not get home till near ten from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Fishers— So I lost the Soirée— <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph
								Blunt</persRef> called upon me, yesterday and this day— I left a

						<p>I am to lead for sometime a life of comparative Solitude—but my time is
							precious. I began last Evening a Letter to <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, and finished it this
							day— I heard <persRef ref="lamson-alvan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Alvan Lamson</persRef> of Dedham, in the Morning from Psalm 14.1.
							“The fool hath said in his Heart, there is no God.”— But the Discourse
							was not an argument upon the existence of God— It was a Dissertation to
							prove that Religion was a natural impulse in the human heart— The
							afternoon Sermon was from Micah 6.8. “He hath shewed thee, O man, what
							is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and
							to love mercy, and to walk humbly, with thy God”— They were both
							sensible, well written Sermons; but delivered in a low tone of voice so
							that the preacher could not be heard over the whole house— I delivered
							Letters to <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="adams-ann">widow</persRef>, and to <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-lucy">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John
								Greenleaf</persRef>. At home I read a Sermon of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef> the 8<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of the second Volume—upon the disasters of Europe—
							Preached during the War for the Spanish Succession— It was a time of
							great Calamity, and we have had such <pb n="69" type="ms"/>times in our
							own age— Since the Peace of Ghent now nearly nineteen years, our
							condition has been of a totally different character— We have had a
							career of general prosperity such as man upon Earth seldom enjoys, and
							yet we are not happy.</p>

						<p>My first visitor this morning was my Tenant <persRef ref="carr-john2"

							where the first signs of vegetation are appearing, and my young trees
							have a totally discouraging aspect— Of the fruit trees, hundreds dead,
							and among them many upon which I had vested hopes— Of the living the

								<persRef ref="thayer-solomon">Solomon Thayer’s</persRef> Oats or

						<p>Though less interrupted this day than yesterday, it passed off like that,
							and left me with nothing done— <persRef ref="spear-luther">Luther
								Spear</persRef> came about a patch of fence at Mount Wollaston,
							concerning which he has teazed me these two years— <persRef
								ref="bartlett-ibrahim">Ibrahim Bartlett</persRef>, Parish Clerk
							brought me a written vote adopted at the Parish Meeting yesterday;
							appointing me Chairman, and twelve others a Committee to devise means,
							for paying off the debt of the Parish, and for considering the
							expediency of employing an assistant or Colleague to <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney</persRef>, and consulting with him upon the subject—and I was
							requested to appoint a time and place for the Meeting of the Committee.
							I appointed accordingly to-morrow Morning ten O’Clock, at the town Hall—
								<persRef ref="williams-francis2">Williams</persRef> the tax-gatherer
							came to demand again payment of the Parish Assessment upon my Mount
							Wollaston Estate, for the last year— I declined paying it, and he spoke
							of advertising it for Sale. I said the Assessors must do as they pleased
							about it— That Spear the tenant paid a parish tax for the same place,
							and refused to pay the tax assessed upon it to me, though bound <pb
								n="70" type="ms"/>to pay all the taxes by his lease— Williams said
							that my refusal to pay that tax had thrown the whole parish into
							confusion— I said I could not help that—to which he replied that he
							would not, if he was I.— The truth is the Parish have got deeply into
							debt by building a Stone Meeting-house at double the cost which they
							ought to have incurred; and now they are expecting me to extricate them
							from their difficulties, because <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father</persRef> made them a large donation for the building of the
							Church, and because I at my own expence, and without a cent of cost to
							them erected tombs under the Church, and a marble slab within it, as a
							frail memorial of affection and reverence to my father and <persRef
								key="adams-abigail">mother</persRef>. Was there sin in this? A
							merciful God knows— I thought myself performing a solemn duty. Was there
							no mixture of worldly pride or vanity in my motive? It has brought me
							into perplexities, from which divine wisdom alone can relieve me, and in
							which I pray that I may proceed in meekness and humility, and without
							weakness or folly, or imprudent Passion— I spent the Evening at <persRef

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"

								Gourgas</persRef> and <persRef ref="taylor-thomas4">Thomas
								Taylor</persRef>— The subjects referred to the Committee were
							discussed for upwards of two hours.— With regard to the payment of the
							debt, which amounts to near nine thousand dollars, various proposals
							were made, and none adopted— The management of the Affairs of the Parish
							has been very bad, and it is now upon the verge of dissolution— Every
							body threatens to withdraw from the Parish, to escape from its burdens,
							and there is nearly three thousand dollars due to the parish for pews,
							which they have neglected to collect, and great part of which they will
							lose. To re-instate the affairs of this Parish, either I must devote
							time, labour and money, or they will go to utter ruin; and how to do it
							without ruining myself, I know not— There was a proposal to report the
							expediency of rescinding a Resolution passed two years since,
							authorising the holders of pews not paid for, to hold them until further
							order, paying interest upon their debts—but this was not decided— Then
							there was much discussion of the question concerning a Colleague for
								<persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitney</persRef>,—and a sub-committee of 3. appointed to confer
							with him upon the subject— They put me upon this Committee too; but I
							declined serving; stating that I was entirely satisfied with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney, and am besides not here one half
							the year— I was excused, but there was great difficulty in obtaining a
							Committee, every one appointed desiring to be excused— At last Captain
							Souther, Noah Curtis and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brigham were
							compelled to undertake the task, and the Committee adjourned to meet at
							3. O’Clock P.M next Friday to receive the report of the Sub-Committee,
							and further to prepare for reporting to the Parish— Thus was absorbed
							one morning upon a business thrust upon me, and to which I see no
							prospect of end. <pb n="71" type="ms"/>After dinner, I wrote until the

							educate, and who is at her Son in Law <persRef ref="angier-john"
								>Angier’s</persRef> school at Medford, has an invincible repugnance
							and incapacity for learning, and will not go to College— The Letters

						<p><persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel
								Greenleaf</persRef> called on me this morning, and invited me to
							dine with him— I was diverted from the proper occupation of redeeming
							the arrears of this Diary, by researches, to ascertain the definition of
							the word Orphan— The Greek Lexicons, Latin Dictionaries, that of the
							French Academy, the Epistle of James in the New Testament, <persRef
								ref="calvin-john">Calvin’s</persRef> Lexicon Juridicum, <persRef
								ref="euripides">Euripides</persRef> and the French <persRef
								ref="donquixote">Don Quixot</persRef>, were referred to and
							consulted— A Child who has lost both parents or either is an Orphan; in
							the strict acceptation of the word— In common parlance an orphan is a
							fatherless child. I had consumed the morning till noon in these
							enquiries, when my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							came in from Boston; <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>
							having gone to <persRef ref="brooks-peter">her father’s</persRef> at
							Medford to spend the day.— We both dined at M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf’s with his brother <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-thomas">Thomas</persRef>— At three in the afternoon
							we attended the adjourned meeting of the Committee of the Parish; I was
							obliged to leave Charles to amuse himself in my Library, and he returned
							to Boston, before the Committee adjourned. They sat till near Sunset—
							All present excepting <persRef ref="josselyn-nathan">Nathan
								Josselyn</persRef>, and <persRef ref="wood-h">Henry Wood</persRef>.
							The Sub-committee appointed to confer with <persRef ref="whitney-peter"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef> reported that
							they had called upon him on Wednesday, and mentioned to him the
							dissatisfaction which existed among some of the Parishioners, with some
							of his Clerical brethren with whom he exchanges; and some complain that
							they are not able to hear him— They inclined therefore either to settle
							a Colleague with him, or to employ occasional assistance to him to
							supply the <pb n="72" type="ms"/>pulpit, part of the time— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney had asked time to consider the
							proposition till this day at 2 O’Clock, and then he had declared his
							willingness to relinquish part of his Salary, to obtain assistance for
							half the time. By M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney’s original
							Settlement in 1800 he was to receive 500 dollars a year— From 1813 to
							1816 additional grants were made to him of 250 dollars a year, and in
							1816 a vote was passed, allowing him 250 dollars a year while he should
							supply the Pulpit. He is now willing to relinquish 150 dollars of this
							additional allowance, to relieve him from preaching half the time— The
							proposal is to raise by subscription about an equal amount, and to
							employ occasional Candidates, at ten dollars a day, with some further
							charges which for half the year may amount to 300 dollars— There was
							much discussion upon this report without coming to any decision— And so
							with regard to making provision for payment of the debt, there were
							various proposals, but no conclusion— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thomas Greenleaf at last reminded the Committee that neither of the
							subjects on which they had been deliberating had been inserted in the
							Warrant for calling the Parish Meeting, at the adjournment of which this
							Committee was appointed, and therefore nothing could be done with legal
							effect upon these Subjects, at the Meeting to which this Committee are
							to report— There are 30 pews yet unsold—appraised at a reduced valuation
							at 3750 dollars, but which cannot produce so much— It was proposed to
							sell them at Auction, but objected that they would not thus fetch 2000
							dollars— A paper was handed round for making up a Subscription to
							purchase them for 3000 dollars to be held in common by the Subscribers—
							I subscribed to this paper 500 dollars, and an effort is to be made to
							get the Subscriptions filled, before the Parish Meeting next Monday,
							when the Committee are to report. It was agreed to report a
							recommendation that a Meeting should be called competent to take
							measures on the subjects irregularly referred to this Committee, and to
							state the substance of the conference with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Whitney— At near Sunset I came home. Charles was gone, and I
							spent the Evening till near Midnight, in writing.</p>

								ref="veazie-george2">George Vesey</persRef> were here—all upon small
							teazing concerns of which life is full, when there is nothing of more
							importance to engross attention and interest— George Vesey is to bring
							over the barn from the hill opposite the house, and place it by the side
							of the others— At four in the afternoon I attended the adjourned
							Parish-Meeting— <persRef ref="brigham-josiah">Josiah Brigham</persRef>
							Moderator— I made verbally the report from the Committee of 13. That
							nothing definitive can be done by the Parish upon the subjects referred
							to the Committee; those Subjects not having been inserted in the
							warrant, by which the Parish Meeting was called— The Committee therefore
							recommended a Resolution, that the Assessors be instructed to call a
							Meeting of the Parish, in the warrant for which shall be inserted the
							proposition to consider of measures to be taken for the payment of the
							debt due by the Parish— A Resolution to that effect was adopted at the
							motion of <persRef ref="curtis-noah">Noah Curtis</persRef>, the Meeting
							to be held on Monday the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May, at
							four O’Clock P.M— Report was also made informally, of the conference
							between <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitney</persRef> and the Sub-Committee, but the Parish took no
							order upon that— Some alarm was expressed by Deacon Spear, as being
							entertained by individuals in the Parish, that a proposition would be
							made to raise an additional sum, for payment of the Parish debts, to
							that which has been voted for the current expenses of the year—that is
							1200 dollars— Upon which Deacon Spear said it would depend whether
							several members of the Parish would leave it or not. <pb n="74"
								type="ms"/>A vote was therefore proposed and adopted that no further
							sum should be assessed for the current expenses of the year— It appeared
							in the course of the Meeting that the Treasurer’s Accounts of the last
							year were in much disorder, and that the collector had not accounted for
							one quarter part of the Assessment of the year 1832.— The Alteration of
							the third Article of the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of the
							State, which has twice passed the Legislature, and will be adopted by
							the People next November will dissolve great numbers of Parishes in this
							Commonwealth, and very probably this one— I met here at this Meeting
								<persRef ref="newcomb-bryant">Bryant Newcomb</persRef>, who told me
							he had been in the Mills Prison, in England during the Revolutionary
							War, and at Amsterdam in 1780 when <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef> was there. The meeting adjourned shortly before
							Sunset— I returned home, and with abstinence wrote till past ten in the
							Evening— Still with head-ache and feverish heat from the exposure of the
							Morning.</p>

						<p>The Summer heat continued through the Night, and I had little and broken
							rest—the feverish heat however and head ache subsided, and I was this
							morning, well enough for occupation. I was again obliged after breakfast
							to come in from the garden by the pressure of heat, but about noon the

							seven years since at Washington, and again I believe since— I received
							from him on my return here a long Letter dated at Medfield the 8<hi

							health both of body and mind—says he was kidnapp’d and abducted from
							Boston in 1822 and has been under grievous persecution ever since— His
							state of mind appears to be precisely the same that it was seven years
							ago. He said he had left <persRef ref="u">his father’s</persRef> house
							yesterday and was now going towards Dorchester I found that questions
							made him garrulous,—and as it was drawing towards night, advised him to
							proceed. He said something about his having formed in 1822. an
							attachment to <persRef ref="hinckley-david">David Hinckley’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="u">daughter</persRef>, which reminded me of some romantic
							adventure of hers about that time; but I have no distinct recollection
							of what it was— I took a short walk about dusk and spent the Evening in
							writing— Finished a 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Letter to <persRef
								ref="livingston-edward">Edward Livingston</persRef> upon Masonry—
							Received one from <persRef ref="southard-samuel">S. L.
