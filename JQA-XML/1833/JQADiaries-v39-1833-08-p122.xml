						<p>Called again from my garden exercise, by a visit from <persRef
								ref="whitney-augustus">Augustus Whitney</persRef> second Son of the
								<persRef ref="whitney-peter">Minister of the Parish</persRef>, who
							is to be graduated at the approaching Commencement— I labour less in the
							Nursery than heretofore, but planted a row of nuts, cherry-stones and
							seeds this morning— The rain has recovered some of the drooping plants—
							Others are irretrievably gone— I attempt to write on my biographical
							essay but it labours— I read the papers of the controversies from the
							time of the Stamp Act, between <persRef ref="bernard-francis">Sir
								Francis Bernard</persRef>, and the General Court of Massachusetts,
							and part of those which succeeded, with <persRef ref="hutchinson-thomas"
								>Hutchinson</persRef> first as Lieutenant Governor and then as
							Governor.— I read also in part Hutchinson’s account of these disputes in
							the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Volume of his History— One man
							always contends to extreme disadvantage against many, but Bernard
							appears to have been a shallow conceited Englishman, full of Vanity and
							self-importance— Hutchinson was an abler man, but not a wiser one— They
							were both brought by their official positions into the conflicts which
							ruined their reputations; but Hutchinson had the additional misfortune
							of being engaged in a contest against his native Country— I walked
							towards Evening, and read a few Letters of <persRef

						<p>On the second of August 1779. this day fifty-four years elapsed I landed
							with <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> from the French
							frigate La Sensible, on the Beach of the Mount Wollaston farm from which
							I had eighteen months before, on the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							of February 1778 embarked for France on my first Voyage to Europe— This
							is one of the important anniversaries of my life; and through how many
							Scenes of good and of evil fortune have I since passed— How many of deep
							distress? how many of exquisite enjoyment— How many of severe trial—how
							many of painful and pleasant labour—how many of overruling passion—and
							how few of virtuous self-denial and of disinterested exertion for the
							good of my fellow creatures. I cannot dare to say like <persRef
								ref="rousseau-jean">Rousseau</persRef> of Geneva that I am prepared
							to present myself before the throne of omnipotence with my confessions
							in my hand, and affirm that no better man than myself ever lived. There
							have been better because there have been incomparably wiser men— I have
							little to answer for in my relations with mankind, and have a firm
							though humble reliance on the mercy of my maker— A return of rhumatic
							infirmity this day gave me a new admonition to prepare for the close of
							life— <persRef ref="thayer-minot">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Minot
								Thayer</persRef> was here this morning, and introduced a young man
							by the name of <persRef ref="u">Strong</persRef>—a Grandson of <persRef
								ref="strong-simeon">Simeon Strong</persRef> of Amherst, whom I
							remember as once a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth— I
							visited my Garden and Nursery but was disabled from working much— The
							young trees are ceasing their growth for the Season.</p>

						<p>Sharp touch of Sciatica or Lumbago, which breaks me down for labour both
							of body and mind. <persRef ref="williams-francis2">Francis
								Williams</persRef> the tax-collector and <persRef
								ref="bass-benjamin">Benjamin Bass</persRef> were here together—
							Williams gave me my tax-bill for this present year amounting to 419

							He spoke to me of the balance of the last year’s bill, which I told him

							surface— It is one of a row in which there are now three walnuts and two
							Oaks. I planted by the side of it a row of Ohio Walnuts, Mazzard Cherry
							Stones, 1 Apricot Stone, and crushed whortleberries and currants kneaded
							up in dry Garden Soil— I have here and there a Currant Bush, Vine,
							Raspberry, Blackberry and Thimbleberry plants from the seed; but as yet
							no Whortleberry— I have planted whole berries; but now try the seeds
							disengaged from them.— Of three seedling Cherry-trees at the bottom of

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> P.
								Whitney</persRef>, from Matthew 10.38. [“]And he that taketh not his
							cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me”— After the Sermon,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney administered the Communion—
							His text after dinner was from Job 14.14. “All the days of my appointed
							time will I wait, till my change come.” a discourse upon death and
							immortality— The argument of immortality from the transformations of
							insects is plausible but superficial— The transmutations of matter are
							perpetual standing miracles; but a resurrection of living matter after a
							dissolution of all its parts is not one of the phenomena of ordinary
							nature— Of disembodied Spirit we have no evidence except miracles—the
							transformation of insects is no evidence of it whatever. A
							thunder-shower came up in the midst of the afternoon Service. <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and I rode home. It continued
							for more than an hour afterwards— I read the 3<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> Sermon of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin’s</persRef>
								4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Volume, on the Devotion of Sentiment
							from Psalm 63.5.— A parallel between Religion, as a dictate of Reason
							and Judgment, and that which comes from the heart— It is in many respect
							the difference between the Religion of the Catholic and the Protestant
							Churches— But it is not considered in this light by Saurin— He was a
							Protestant—a refugee from the persecuting Religion of <persRef
								ref="louis-xiv">Louis 14</persRef>— In his Sermon upon Patriotism,
							he refers directly to the condition of the French Refugees—but he never
							indulges in declamations against popery, and alludes if at all, only
							indirectly to the Tyranny of Louis 14— I was suffering severe pain last
							Night, and all this day with cette Sciatique—sympathising with the state
							of the atmosphere.</p>

						<p>Another painful day, with a gathering eruption upon my right hand— It
							suspends most of my labours of the hand in the garden and Nursery and of
							the head in my chamber. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> sent for <persRef
								ref="woodward-ebenezer">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Woodward</persRef>, to whom I gave a history of my complaints, of my
							Constitution and almost of my life— He prescribed sundry remedies, some
							of which I shall perhaps try; but with a strong conviction that my only
							effectual remedies are Patience and Resignation; and above all
							preparation for my last change— If this idea presents itself too often
							in these pages, it is because it is not often enough in my mind; and
							never with any good practical result— My present infirmity serves me
							only as an apology for wasting my time in idleness— I have for the last
							ten days devoted about an hour every day to teaching my Grand daughter,
								<persRef key="adams-john2">John’s</persRef> Child <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Louisa</persRef>, to read the Alphabet— She seems
							to make no progress, though not deficient in intelligence— I find here
							too that the qualities perhaps the most indispensable to a Schoolmaster
							are Patience and Perseverance— After repetitions almost numberless of
							pointing out the same Letter or the same Syllable to a child, it forgets
							them; and it seems as if the more pains you take the more the memory of
							the child recalcitrates against the admission of the idea into the mind,
							which you would plant there— I sometimes find <pb n="124" type="ms"
							/>myself to believe it wilful obstinacy in the child—but in the teacher
							this is more to blame than the child for its inaptitude to learn— The
							belief that the child is obstinate excites anger in the teacher, and
							anger is impatient to punish— The teacher is then the party that needs
							punishment— Soothing, coaxing, flattering, a little, very little shaming
							is needed by the child. Imperturbable equanimity, untiring Patience,
							unweariable Perseverance are the wants of the Instructor— What trials of
							temper for the teaching of one child— When I feel much exasperated at my
							Scholar’s dulness of apprehension, my best resource is to tax myself
							with learning the Hebrew Alphabet, which I have been endeavouring to do,
							some forty odd years, and have not yet accomplished— The thickest skull
							upon which Instruction ever lost its labour never resisted its
							impression more than mine has done to exclude it, and as the association
							of ideas is sometimes odd in its operations— Louisa’s difficulties in
							learning the English Alphabet have put me for the twentieth, perhaps the
							thirtieth time upon surmounting those of the Hebrew. I make my own
							indocility the apology for hers.</p>

						<p>The day is a blank in my Life. With a stricture of severe pain across my
							loins, and a poultice on my right hand I have but a poor account to give
							of my occupations—and only wasted the time— But yesterday and this day
							were both anniversaries of the dies fasti of my life— Yesterday was
							twenty-four years, since I embarked in the ship Horace, <persRef
								ref="bickford-benjamin">Captain Beckford</persRef>, at Charlestown
							for S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg; and this day sixteen
							years since, I landed at New-York, from the Ship Washington, <persRef
								ref="forman-jacob">Captain Forman</persRef>, from London and Cowes
							where I embarked on my return from that residence in Europe— I went out
							as Minister of the United States at the Court of the Emperor Alexander
							of Russia; I returned as Secretary of State of the United States— Eight
							years of diplomacy in Europe, in various important negotiations, in
							critical and trying times, eight years in the Department of State,
							followed by four years as President of the United States, constitute the
							most active period of my existence— The last four years have been
							comparatively insignificant, and I have only to pray that the remnant of
							my days may be marked with equal tranquility. I belong to the age that
							has past, and can look forward with rational hopes or wishes only for an
							euthanasia. It was with great difficulty that I wrote my morning minutes
							from the Septuagint of <persRef ref="thomson-charles">Charles
								Thomson</persRef>, and the diary of yesterday— I visited the garden
							and nursery, only to view the flourishing prosperity of numberless rank

								<persRef ref="hill-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hill</persRef> of Roxbury— There were heavy Showers of rain in the
							night and this morning— This moisture has very much revived the
							vegetation—which was drooping and perishing with drought— I visited my

							elm is so easy to raise from the seed, that I have them shooting up not
							only where I planted the seeds in rows, but single trees in every part
								<pb n="125" type="ms"/>of the Nursery or Garden, where I happened to
							drop a seed. There is very great difference however in the rapidity of
							their growth, and like other seedlings when first up they require
							shelter from the Sun— Four at least in five of the first row which came
							up have been killed— I remark that my seedling Pear trees, of last year,
							the roots of which have been protected, by my seedling Strawberry vine,
							without growing much, look fresher and healthier than any others— My
							Apple shoots from buds and grafts have ceased growing from about the
							first of this Month— All the white Ashes have been topp’d by Insects—
							The bugs are also making free with my Vine-leaves— From some of my red
							Oaks a third shoot appears from about the first of this Month— I am

							at 5 O’Clock in the afternoon. I attended and acted again as Moderator.
							The meeting was very thin— <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef> the Treasurer made a
							Report of the debts and means of the Parish— The Subscription for the

							made to take the pews now unsold in payment of the debt of 3000 dollars
							due to me, makes ample provision for sweeping off the whole debt, with
							the exception of that due for pews sold and partly paid for, but of
							which the purchasers neither complete their payments nor give up their
							pews. These have done nothing— A vote was passed directing the Treasurer
							to call upon those Pewholders for settlement, and to take possession in
							the name of the Parish of all the pews which shall not be paid for, or
							security given to the Satisfaction of the Treasurer and Parish
							Committee, and deeds taken, on or before <pb n="127" type="ms"/>the last
							day of this Month; and that he also collect the monies subscribed, by
							that day, and make report on the execution of this Resolution at the
							adjournment of the Meeting. And the Meeting was adjourned to Monday the
								2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of September at 4. O’Clock in the
							afternoon— I stated distinctly to the Parish what I would do— After all
							the rest of the Parish debt shall be paid, and not before, I will take
							the remaining 30 Pews in full payment of the debt to me of 3000
							dollars—and to specify precisely what I consider the amount of this
							offer to be, I engaged to transfer all those pews to any person or
							company who would pay me for them in cash, with a deduction of 20 per
							Cent from the price at which I propose to take them— It is therefore an

							the most striking Evidences of the apathy into which this Society has

								ref="woodward-ebenezer">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Sermon of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, from Colossians 4.6. upon
							Conversations— A practical, and very excellent discourse— He warns
							against 5 vices in Conversation 1. Swearing. 2 Obscenity. 3. Back-biting
							4. Flattery. 5. Idle talk— One hundred and twenty years at least have
							passed away since this Sermon was delivered by a French refugee at the
							Hague in Holland—and it would be a good Sermon to deliver to-morrow, in
							any City Town or Village of these United States— The Vices of
							Conversation are perennial— Swearing and Indecency are I believe less
							prevalent now than they were, a century back—but Slander, Flattery and
							Idle talk are yet superabundant— Saurin boldly tells his hearers that
							they are addicted to evil-speaking in the worst extreme, and that all
							the Vices which he reproves in this discourse are but exemplifications
							of what he has witnessed among them— This is the true and proper tone of
							a Christian Minister— Of this we have now too little—and perhaps it can
							scarcely be expected from Ministers, who depend for their subsistence
							upon their hearers. The calvinistic preachers are censorious enough; but
							their vituperation is pointed only against errors of doctrine, as they
							hold them, without touching upon deficiencies of morals <persRef
								ref="pope-alexander">Pope</persRef>, though a Roman Catholic said
							that his mode of faith could not be wrong whose life was in the right—
							The Calvinists reverse this maxim, and think the life cannot be wrong,

						<p>There was a now deceptive appearance of abundant showers, which passed

							extraordinary varieties in the forms of their first leaves. No other new
							plants now shew themselve—except weeds, the multitude, and growth and
							towering size of which are appalling— The insolence with which they
							surrounded and overtop, and eradicate the lowly, modest and scarcely

							world. How much of <pb n="132" type="ms"/>the same sort of comparative

								Capen</persRef> of South-Boston, in the morning from Numbers 22.19.
							“Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this Night, that I may

							subject difficult to treat after <persRef ref="butler-joseph">Bishop
								Butler</persRef>. The text of the afternoon was from John 10.18.—“I

								>th.</hi> Sermon of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of
								<persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>— Upon the beatific

							mystified in the Schools. It is sufficiently mystified by him— His text
							is from 1. John 3.2.—[“]We know that, when he shall appear, we shall be
							like him; for we shall see him as he is.”— There is much laborious
							ratiocination to shew how it follows that we shall be like him, because
							we shall see him as he is— The closing part of the Sermon is a very

							I read part of two books of <persRef ref="milman-henry"
								>Milmans</persRef> History of the Jews— My ardent desire to abstract

						<p>At four of the Morning we were in the Stage at Nashua—the first town in
							the State of New-Hampshire; but there were two Stages which came on
							together from Boston yesterday—and this Morning they changed our Stage
							companions— We had now six Performers of the Italian Opera, among whom
							were <persRef ref="u;u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and Madame
								Pedrotti</persRef>, and the base singer <persRef ref="u"
								>Fornasari</persRef>, a very handsome man and an Elegant. They
							confined their Conversation almost entirely to themselves and it was
							altogether in Italian— They had also an enormous load of baggage, and
							seemingly provisions for a week— We breakfasted at Wilton 15 Miles, and
							dined at Charlestown 43 Miles from Nashua. There had been much and
							frequent rain, on the road over which we travell’d and there were no
							symptoms of drought— The weather was quite cold and rather cheerless.—
							The country through which we came was not remarkable either for
							barrenness or fertility— Indian corn was the principal burden upon the
							fields, and no where a heavy one— Few Pastures— Woods and Rocks in
							plenty—undulating hill and dale—<pb n="135" type="ms"/>some Oats, Rye,
							Flax, and Buckwheat— A very few Orchards, and occasional moderate sized
							Beeches, Oaks and Maples; with White and Pitch Pine, Cedar and Hemlock.
							The most remarkable objects that I see, are the race of men—larger than
							those of my native State— Much larger than those of England—France, or
							even Germany— About noon <persRef ref="davis-isaac;davis-susan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Davis</persRef> and myself changed our Stage, and returned to the

							was overloaded, and threatened much to break down— At Charlestown where
							we dined we parted from our theatrical company. We turned back and at
							Bellows falls cross’d the river to the Town of Rockingham and State of
							Vermont— We came in about five O’Clock, but the afternoon and evening
							were rainy, and we were almost confined to our Inn— It is kept by
								<persRef ref="u">Robinson</persRef>; and here we met <persRef
								ref="tucker-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>Before leaving Bellows Falls this morning, I walked with <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall</persRef> down to the
							Bridge, and Banks of the river, below the falls, where we step’d over a
							number of rocks upon which are cut, numerous figures resembling those
							upon the Dighton rock, and doubtless the work of Indian hands— We
							departed immediately after Breakfast from Rockingham in the Stage; and
							among our fellow travellers was the <persRef ref="parker-benjamin">Rev’d
									M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Parker</persRef>, Minister of
							the Episcopal Church at Woodstock, Vermont, and two Misses Parker, one,
								<persRef ref="u">his daughter</persRef>, and the other <persRef
								ref="u">a daughter</persRef> of <persRef ref="parker-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel D. Parker</persRef>, County
							Attorney in Boston, Granddaughter of my old friend <persRef
								ref="mason-jonathan">Jonathan Mason</persRef>; we travelled along
							the Banks of Connecticut river, till we arrived at Windsor where we
							dined at <persRef ref="u">Petty’s</persRef>— Here we parted much to my
							regret from the Parker family, and shortly before Sunset came to
							Hanover, the seat of Dartmouth College— Here it was the week after
							Commencement, and the College was deserted— The Square before the
							College buildings is bordered by four rows of Maple-trees about forty
							years old— From Hanover where we took up in the Stage a young man named
								<persRef ref="duncan-william2">Duncan</persRef>, who had delivered
							last week an Oration upon taking his second degree, we came on, still
							along the Banks of Connecticut river, through Lime to Orford—where we
							arrived between 8 and 9 in the Evening, where we stopp’d for the Night.
							61. miles from the place of our Departure this Morning— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Duncan proceeded on this Evening to
							Haverhill— He appears to be a very well bred and promising young Man—
							The house where we lodged at Orford is kept by a Man named <persRef
								ref="wheeler-asa">Wheeler</persRef>, who told me he had been
							introduced to me at Worcester in September 1821 when I was going with
								<persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> to visit <persRef
								ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Boylston</persRef> at Princetown and when we had received in the
							morning at Framingham, the news that my father’s house at Quincy had
							taken fire, and narrowly escaped burning down, within an hour after we
							had left it the day before</p>

						<p>I was very much indisposed in the Night, and obliged to get up, about 2.
							O’Clock in the Morning— Still unwell at Breakfast time; but we concluded
							to proceed at least as far as Newbury Springs. But we have now no
							regular Stage, and engaged a covered waggon with a pair of horses—
							Walking before breakfast I measured two or three of a row of Maple Trees
							about fifty years old, and found the largest of them 5 feet 4 inches in
							Circumference— We crossed Connecticut river to Fairlee in the State of
							Vermont and rode 16 Miles to Newbury— Here the house was kept by
							brothers <persRef ref="u">Atkinson</persRef>— There was rain great part
							of the Morning— We found in the garden the Trees covered with the Canada
							Plum, looking like ripe Cherries, but not quite ripe itself— It had very
							little flavour to the taste— There are Sulphur Springs and hot Wells at
							Newbury— <persRef ref="davis-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Davis</persRef> and myself took each a warm bath, and drank a
							Tumbler of the Sulphurated water, which was very weak— After dinner
							found the house dull; as there were no travellers there, and we
							determined to proceed in the waggon and pair to Bath—12 Miles— We
							crossed again the Connecticut river about 2 Miles before we came to Bath
							on the Ammonoosuck— We reached this place about Sunset— We met here a
							traveller from Peachum in Vermont, and a person named <persRef ref="u"
								>Low</persRef>, of Lowell— I was told some of the Gentlemen of the
							place wished to be introduced to me; but being not very well and much
							fatigued, I requested to be excused till the Morning— Made a short
							Evening and retired early— Our route this day as yesterday has been
							chiefly along the banks of Connecticut river— Less fertile; but still
							pleasing—generally level; with green meadows—Oak, Beech, Hemlock and
							Maple Trees.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>—</date> The early part of the Month I
							was much indisposed; first with the distressing rhumatism, and
							lumbago—then with the painful and disabling boil on my hand— The
							proposition of <persRef ref="davis-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Davis</persRef> that I should accompany him and <persRef
								ref="davis-susan">his wife</persRef> upon this excursion,
							diversified the incidents of my Life, and has had a cheering influence
							in the darkness of my declining days— I have continued rising early, and
							endeavouring to occupy myself profitably, but all is discouraging and
							gloomy— There is a tide in the Affairs of Men, and when that Tide turns
							against them in the decline of life—exertion is vain— Prayer is
							inefficacious— No blessing of Heaven, no smile of Fortune seconds the
							purest purposes and most unwearied energies— To lie down and die is a
							privilege denied— A lingering death tortured with disappointments more
							and more aggravated, and prospects beyond the grave, of no promise for
							this world, are all that I can see or expect— So it is that prosperous
							Fortunes go to ruin, and so it is that families are extinguished— There
							was Mercy for the last days of <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>— Will there be any for me?— Yes— I will say in
							humble hope—if not here—hereafter— Be it mine to ask Fortitude for
							endurance, and resignation for the divine Will.</p>
