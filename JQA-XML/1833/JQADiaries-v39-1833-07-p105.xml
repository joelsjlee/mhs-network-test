						<p>Summer is at length disclosing itself in its appropriate character— We
							had <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit’s</persRef> Thermometer
							at 90 which has not happened before since April; or the first week in
							May. My Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> left us to
							pay a visit at Medford— I have finished reading the Book of Numbers in
								<persRef ref="thomson-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thomson’s</persRef> version of the Septuagint, and begun upon that
							of Deuteronomy— I loitered much of the morning in my garden and nursery;
							but was compelled by the heat of the Sun to suspend my labour of
							weeding— At noon I went and bathed at <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf’s</persRef> wharf—
							Swam about five Minutes— First Sea-water bath for this Season, and I
							took <persRef ref="kirk-john">J. Kirk</persRef> with me— After dinner I
							rode with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Louisa</persRef>, to Dorchester, and visited <persRef

							Neponset Bridge— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sullivan</persRef> the new purchaser of Germantown came here while I
							was gone to the Bath, but I did not see him.— The Bath gave me a drowsy
							spell before and after dinner, and thus absorbed much of my leisure— I
							received a Letter from <persRef ref="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>,
							with a copy of his book, upon his Residence in England— Moon eclipsed
							this Evening</p>

						<p>It is said that <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit’s</persRef>
							Thermometer was at 90 yesterday in Boston. The heat was not quite so
							intense this day and there was a fresh breeze, to serve as a continual
							fan— There was a man here by the name of <persRef ref="u"
								>Branch</persRef> from Mansfield, Connecticut, a maker of silk, who
							came to persuade <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> to purchase some of
							his Silks; but they were not inviting— I took however an ounce of his
							White Mulberry seed though it is a full Month too late for sowing them.—
							I planted some Elm-seed in one of my earthen pots, and about ten of them
							came up; but they do not grow so well there as in the open ground. I
							took them out therefore and planted them in the open ground, and filling
							the pot with fresh earth, buried in it six Mazzard Cherries steeped in
							rum— I have some equivocal evidence, that the steeping in rum does not
							destroy the germ, and I wish now to ascertain the fact— I planted also a
							number of large Ohio Walnuts, and black-heart Cherry Stones—both with
							little promise— <persRef ref="deane-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Deane</persRef> says that the Stone of no cherry from a
							graft or bud will ever come up, and this my own experience confirms— Yet
							I continue to plant many— The Mazzard is the only cherry I have been
							able to raise from the Stone— I found one Hickory Walnut up this
							Morning, and the seed leaves of one grape— My apple bud shoot is now 32
							inches long, continuing to grow at the rate of 1/2 an inch a day— I
							bathed and swam about 10 minutes at <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">D.
								Greenleaf’s</persRef> wharf— I was hoarse in the Evening, and
							suspect I must soon renounce my Sea-bathing and swimming altogether—or
							must make it a rule to restore the suspended perspiration by exercise,
							after coming out of the Bath.— <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President
								Jackson</persRef> has been obliged by the feeble state of his
							health, to give up the remainder of his tour; and from Concord in New
							Hampshire, yesterday returned through Lowell, to Roxbury, without
							passing through Boston— He lodged last Night at the House of <persRef
								ref="bradford-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bradford</persRef>, one of his partizans in Roxbury; to proceed this
							day to Providence; thence in the Steam-boat to New-York; and intending
							to reach Washington on Thursday— And so ends this magnificent Tour— But
							whether from real disease, crafty sickness or the collisions of rival
							servility between the two parties in New-Hampshire, is yet uncertain—
							Perhaps a little of all three.</p>

						<p>The change of weather, or my exposure in the Garden and Nursery, or my
							Sea-water bath, I fear this last more than any thing else, has thrown my
							habitual inflammation up into my throat, and I was this day exceedingly
							hoarse— The morning lowered, and it began raining about ten O’Clock, and
							rained with little intermission, almost the whole day. My Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came out from Boston, before
							dinner and remains at present with us— <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">His
								wife</persRef>
							<pb n="106" type="ms"/>and <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">child</persRef>
							are still at Medford, and the child has been these two days unwell— I
							planted a row of white, garden Strawberries of Ohio Walnuts and of black
							heart Cherry-Stones, where I take it for granted nothing but the
							Strawberries will come up— The growth of all my seedling plants of the
							present year is excessively slow, and those which promised best are
							attacked by Insects— The Elms are more thrifty than the rest. I spent
							the afternoon reading <persRef ref="mcmahon-bernard"
								>MacMahon’s</persRef> instructions for the management of the Garden
							and Nursery— My own observation though attentive appears yet to have
							given me no profitable instruction—</p>

						<p>I awoke before One O’Clock this morning with a high fever, and a sore
							throat, so much obstructed that I found it very difficult to swallow— I
							thought of rousing the family, but was shortly relieved by a free
							perspiration, and without sleeping again rose at four— The hoarseness
							continued nearly the whole day and turned at last to the regular
							Catarrhal cough— I planted a row of White Mulberry seeds, with Ohio
							Walnuts and Red Strawberries— <persRef ref="souther-john">Captain
								Souther</persRef> and <persRef ref="brigham-josiah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brigham</persRef> called upon me to
							converse with me upon the assessment on me for my Parish tax I was
							assessed last year near 300 dollars for the parish tax alone, and was
							here to attend on public worship little more than 3 Months of the year—
							They assessed me 46 dollars for the Mount Wollaston Estate— <persRef
								ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> rents it upon a lease by
							which he is bound to pay all the taxes upon it—he refuses to pay the
							assessment upon it—alledging that he is assessed for the same Estate to
							the Universalist Church and Society where he attends— The Estate is of
							course taxed twice—once to him, and once to me— I therefore declined the
							payment of the tax, and it remains unpaid— They are now about to make
							the assessment for the present year, and came to discuss the matter with
							me— The plain matter of fact is that by the Laws of this Commonwealth
							all a man’s Estate within the Commonwealth may be at the will of the
							Assessors taxed to support the Religious Society to which he belongs— It
							is the tything system in its worst form— There is an Amendment to the
							Constitution, which has twice past both Houses of the Legislature, and
							is to be acted upon by the People next November.— There is no doubt it
							will be adopted, and then all support of public worship will be
							voluntary— Captain Souther told me that any abatement of my tax would
							cause great uneasiness in the parish, because there were other Estates
							in the same condition, which they would also be obliged to abate, and
							there must be a re-assessment upon others. I told him that to avoid all
							uneasiness I would pay the tax, and must of course pay the assessment
							for the present year: but I should leave the Church and Society,
							considering it an imposition to which I ought no longer to submit— They
							said they should be extremely unwilling that I should leave the Society,
							and wished to do no injustice in the assessment— I told them I fully
							believed it illegal—for that Spear, the tenant belonging to the
							Universalist Church and Society their Assessors had a right to assess
							him, and had assessed him for the Estate— He has paid therefore one
							Parish tax, and ought not in Justice to be required to pay a second— He
							refuses to pay it, and I do not choose to sue him at law, for what I
							think he ought not in Justice to be bound to pay— The real question at
							Law is between the two sets of Assessors, both of which cannot legally
							assess the same Estate; but neither Spear nor I ought to be parties to
							the suit— Captain Souther told me last Summer that he would take the
							opinion of <persRef ref="jackson-charles">judge Jackson</persRef> upon
							the case— He said now that he had called upon Judge Jackson for that
							purpose, but he was not at home— We parted without coming to any further
							agreement, and I am to be spunged once more in the taxes of the present
							year. Captain Souther also gave me notice that I should be charged for
							the wood-lot which I purchased <pb n="107" type="ms"/>last year of
								<persRef ref="baxter-james">James Baxter</persRef>, and for the land
							in Braintree which was <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my

							must be charged not to <persRef

								>the heirs of my Brother</persRef>— <persRef ref="angier-joseph"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Angier</persRef> was here
							this afternoon; he had come from Medford this morning with <persRef
								ref="angier-rebecca">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								rend="superscript">r</hi> and a <persRef ref="u">Son</persRef> of
							the late <persRef ref="law-john">John Law</persRef>, of Washington.
							After a Song or two from M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Angier and
							Joseph, we came home— I heard the distant cannonading and Bells at
							Boston for the celebration of the day; but it has been no festival to
							me— A day of gloomy thoughts, desponding anticipations, and self
							reproaches for useless waste of time.</p>

							White Strawberries of the common Scarlets intending to cover the ground
							with Plants from the seed— One of my Willows; the stem from the Cellar,
							set out in the garden had put forth leaves luxuriantly, but they are
							destroyed by a small white worm— My seedling Apples are covered and
							their growth is arrested by the green aphides or lice— I have this day a
							new fruit to attempt raising from the seed— The black mulberry, and I
							planted a row of seeds of the White Mulberry, with Ohio Walnuts and
							steeped Cherries— I have two seedling plants growing, not knowing what
							they are— One a tree in the Garden— The other a weed in the Nursery— I
							took it last October out of a box where I had planted Currants, Black
							berries and grapes— I took it for a Blackberry Vine and have so
							considered it, till within a fortnight, but it has grown up totally
							different, and now bears a small yellow blossom. What it is and how it
							got into my box are mysteries— Towards Evening I took a short walk, and

						<p>Morning hours in the Nursery and Garden— Experiments with Mazzard Cherry
							Stone, and Black-Mulberry— Sun too powerful for digging— Having found my
							bath yesterday beneficial I repeated it before dinner this day; but the
							Sun was intensely ardent— The tide not up, the atmosphere calm, the
							water at the wharves so much soiled that I was obliged to go in at the
							shelving bank, where the green blood sucking Salt-water fly was
							annoying— Yet was the bath refreshing— The Parish Meeting of 13. May had
							been adjourned to 4 O’Clock this afternoon— I went soon after to the
							town Hall, and about six O’Clock there was a meeting of 18 or 20
							persons. Little had been done, in consequence of the votes of 13. May—
							The Treasurer <persRef ref="beale-george">G. W. Beale</persRef> had been
							very remiss in the performance of his duties— A Committee of two
								<persRef ref="souther-john">John Souther</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field</persRef>, were joined to the
							Treasurer to carry round the Subscription paper, to collect money to pay
							the other part of the Parish debt, and report to another adjournment of
							the Meeting; which was fixed for the second Monday in August at 5.
							O’Clock in the afternoon; to which all the business adjourned over to
							this time was again referred. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale had
							not got even my written proposal to report; and when called for he
							reported it verbally— Beale is an acute and attentive and very active
							person, in whatever concerns his own interest; and equally careless and
							inattentive, as Treasurer of a Religious Congregation involved in debt.
							In such <pb n="108" type="ms"/>Societies every thing is slightingly
							done. I have hitherto had little experience of them, and wish to have as
							little as possible in future— As Moderator of the Meeting of 13 May I
							was so, by the general usage at this adjournment— <persRef
								ref="curtis-noah">Noah Curtis</persRef> paid me the Rent of Goose
							Pasture, and <persRef ref="humphrey-levi">Levi Humphrey</persRef> tax
							collector for Braintree called on me for a tax of 66 cents highway tax,
							for the woodlot I bought last October of <persRef ref="baxter-james"
								>James Baxter</persRef>— He told me as a friend, that there were
							Cattle pasturing upon it which ruined the growing young wood;—and said
							there were sundry persons in Braintree, who always kept their Cattle in
							Summer, in the highways, or in their neighbour’s Pastures. He advised me
							to look to it— I spoke to <persRef ref="gourgas-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gourgas</persRef> about the tax on the
							Land that was <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brothers</persRef> in
							Braintree, and he said he would call upon me, Monday Morning.— Walking
							homewards with <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thomas Greenleaf</persRef> I asked him to step into my
							Nursery and look at the plant, which I have raised for a Blackberry vine

								Whitney</persRef> the Minister of the Parish, preached this morning
							from Colossians 1.15. [“]Who is the image of the invisible God, the
							first born of every Creature: 16. for by him were all things created
							that are in heaven, and that are in Earth, visible and invisible,
							whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities or powers: all
							things were created by him and for him: 17. and he is before all things,
							and by him all things consist; 18. And he is the head of the body, the
							Church: who is the beginning, the first born from the dead; that in all
							things he might have that pre-eminence: 19. For it pleased the father
							that in him should all fulness dwell.”— The afternoon text was from
							Romans 2.6. “Who shall render to every man according to his deeds.”—
							Both these discourses were upon Subjects now much controverted—the
							former with the Orthodox Calvinists, upon the character and person of
							Christ; and the latter with the Universalists upon the doctrine of
							future retribution.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney gave his
							impressions upon both these Subjects as far as he understood them
							himself— There were two female children baptised this afternoon—the
							first baptisms since I came home— It seems to be going out of practice
							to baptise children at all—both these must have been nine or ten Months
							old— This is one of the numerous evil signs of the decay of religious
							worship which I have observed within these three or four years. I read
							the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon of the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef>, being the Second upon Proverbs 23.23. on the Sale
							of Truth— These two Sermons are admirable— Though in the text there
							seems to be some incongruity; for if the truth is bought it must be
							sold— Wherever there is a buyer there must be a Seller, and if the
							precept not to sell the truth is of universal application, no man can
							enjoy the benefit of the purchase, but by the violation of the rule on
							the part of the Seller— <persRef ref="quincy-josiah;quincy-mary2">Col<hi

							on the border of a running brook behind the house— All done by young

							Perseverance— He has undertaken it within two or three years, and his

								Beale</persRef> came this morning, with a proposal to me, that I
							should in addition to the offer which I have made to the parish to take
							the unsold pews, in payment of their debt of 3000 dollars to me, give
							them the interest due upon the note—that is 180 dollars more— I told him
							that I would give what should remain of that interest after payment of
							my parish tax for the year— He said it was exceedingly difficult to
							raise the money to pay the other portion of the debt, and some of the
							Parishioners were of opinion that I was making a very profitable bargain
							by taking the unsold pews for 3000 dollars— I said I would enable such
							persons to make a still more profitable bargain, for I would transfer
							mine to them with a deduction of twenty per Cent if they would take it
							off my hands— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale complained much of
							his parish tax and said that the Assessors had valued his House and farm
							at 11000 dollars, when they were really not worth five— I do not believe
							that Beale would sell them this day for ten, nor for eleven—but nothing
							can be more iniquitous than this mode of taxation for Parish rates— It
							is much worse than Tythes, and has produced its natural consequence, an
							amendment to the Constitution of the Commonwealth, under which all
							assessments for the support <pb n="110" type="ms"/>of religious worship
							hereafter will be voluntary— <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his

								Benjamin F. Hallett</persRef>, and <persRef ref="gassett-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gassett</persRef>, with whom I had a
							long conversation upon Masonry and Anti-Masonry— They had also the
							object of urging me to consent to be nominated by the Antimasonic
							Convention which is to be held in September next for the Office of
							Governor of the Commonwealth, which Hallett stated was equally desired
							by the Anti-Masonic party, and by a portion of the National Republican
							party— He named particularly the <persRef

								Everett</persRef>, <persRef ref="phillips-stephen">Stephen C.
								Phillips</persRef>, <persRef ref="white-stephen">Stephen

							to me a variety of considerations especially of public interest to
							induce me to yield to their wish, which I answered by repeating those
							which sway my inclination to the contrary. My own conviction is strong
							that I ought not to yield to this proposal— I cannot see any important
							interest which requires of me the sacrifice, which it would demand, of
							inclination, of feeling, and of judgment. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hallett said Alexander H. Everett had promised him, that he would see
							and converse with me very shortly, upon this Subject— My own judgment is
							against it, and I wish I may have firmness to adhere to it— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hallett spoke of the probability that
								<persRef ref="morton-marcus">Marcus Morton</persRef> might be
							elected, and said that some of the National Republican party had made
							proposals to <persRef ref="baylies-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> William Baylies</persRef> who had declined on the ground
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morton had prior pretensions— M<hi

							written a Letter to <persRef ref="lafayette">General La
								Fayette</persRef> and were expecting his answer— That M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Everett had been invited to attend
							the recent Anti-Masonic Meeting at Concord and had written an answer

							The Committee then dined with the <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2"

								Brigham</persRef> the Parish Assessor had taken the opinion of
								<persRef ref="metcalf-theron">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Metcalf</persRef> the Lawyer at Dedham, that Parish Assessors may
							lawfully assess the taxes upon the owners in fee of Lands, and not upon
							Leasehold Tenants— That I must therefore pay the Parish tax on the Mount
								<pb n="114" type="ms"/>Wollaston farm, and as he was bound by his
							lease to pay all the taxes I must look to him for repayment— He said he
							thought the tax unreasonable— He was willing to pay a reasonable tax of
							the usual amount. He was willing to leave it to three men, instead of
							twelve; but not Quincy men— He said Metcalf had not disputed but what
							the Assessors had the right to assess the tax on me; but advised him not
							to pay it, because he did not believe a jury would give their verdict
							against him.— The plain English of which is that the jury would consider
							me as a rich man, and Spear as a poor man, and would fleece me to clothe
							him— This is no uncommon idea of Justice— I told Spear I had been
							informed that he had been instigated to make this question with me, and
							asked him whether he thought it was honest, considering the express
							engagement in his lease, to refuse performing it, under a reliance that
							a Jury would favour him at my expense, because they would hold me for a
							rich and him for a poor man— He then said he believed the tax illegal.
							He supposed I had been told that he was the ringleader in all this
							disturbance about the parish tax; for he knew he had his enemies— But
							perhaps I had been misinformed— He was willing to do any thing that was
							reasonable, but he thought this tax unreasonable— I told him I had not
							yet paid the tax—but that I must pay it, and I should then apply to him
							again.— I took after this Conversation a short walk.</p>

						<p>I spent about two hours again this morning in my Nursery and Garden
							preparing the ground at the bottom of my Nursery— This portion of time
							appears to be sufficient for my bodily exercise, but not for keeping my
							nursery in order. I deposited this morning a heap of Ohio Walnuts in the
							spot, where I had lately taken out a large Rock, and where yesterday
							rank weeds were shooting up to gigantic growth. <persRef
								ref="gourgas-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gourgas</persRef>
							was here with <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C.
								Adams</persRef>— He mentioned to me the proposal which he had made
							to the Directors of the Lowell Railway Corporation, for indemnity to the
							Estate that was <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef> at
							Medford, for the damage done by their passing through the land— He had
							asked 800 dollars— <persRef ref="jackson-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jackson’s</persRef> proposal to him
							was to pay 115 dollars for one Acre and 25 rods of the land which they
							have taken, and 15 dollars for damage— He said they had settled with
								<persRef ref="felt-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Felt</persRef> for the damage to his portion of the Estate, at less
							than this— He said that <persRef ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Holbrook’s</persRef> bill against my
							brother’s Estate was yet unpaid; and that was the only remaining debt—
							He spoke also of the Lands in the State of Vermont, and left with me a
							letter and account of <persRef ref="baxter-portus">Portus
								Baxter</persRef>, the last Agent employed by my brother in that
							concern— <persRef ref="cranch-william">Judge Cranch</persRef> was also
							here. He has been visiting his own and <persRef ref="cranch-anna">his
								wife’s</persRef> relations at Boston, Portsmouth, Haverhill, and
							New-Bedford— Proposes to depart next Monday, upon his return to
							Washington— I lost my bath and swim; but towards Evening rode with
								<persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirke</persRef>, and took <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef> with me to <persRef
								ref="thayer-solomon">Solomon Thayer’s</persRef> at Braintree— Saw
							his field of Ray Wheat as he calls it—nearly ready to reap. He expects
							to have 150 bushels from 1 1/2 Acre. He sowed 1 1/2 bushel to the Acre—
							He had a field of Corn, looking uncommonly well, and from which he had
							cut Off Suckers— He shewed me two large button-wood trees, which he told
							me were 33 years old, and which he had stuck into the ground, when about
							the size of a walking Stick. Also a very large Apple tree which he
							called the Turnip Apple 40 years old, and grafted from a tree on
								<persRef ref="quincy-norton">Norton Quincy’s</persRef> farm, which
							tree no longer exists— I brought some slips from his tree, home with me,
							and in the Evening <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							budded one Stock in my Nursery from them.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="brooks-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								Brooks</persRef> of Hingham preached this morning from Revelations
							22.9. Worship God—and in the afternoon from Hebrews 13.8. [“]Jesus
							Christ, the same yesterday, and to day, and forever.” Both these Sermons
							were very pleasing to me; and they were exceedingly well delivered— But
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks is not a favourite with
							others— The argument of the morning discourse was that the duty of
							worshiping God, arises not from the command in the Scriptures, but from
							the necessities of man’s Nature— That of the afternoon Sermon, was the
							grandeur, the simplicity, the unalterable sublimity, and unchangeable
							perfection of the character of Jesus Christ— There were passages in
							both, that I thought eloquent and pathetic, and deep attention was paid
							to them by the Auditory— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks was
							engaged to dine with <persRef ref="cranch-william">Judge
								Cranch</persRef> at <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf’s</persRef>— I was
							anxiously desirous of devoting the whole day to religious meditations,
							and I feel that desire growing upon me, more earnestly from week to
							week, but I was deeply disappointed— I read the first Sermon of the
							fourth Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>—on the
							Study of Religion— I thought it worthy of being read over and over—
							There was a written note in the book importing that the former owner of
							it had read this Sermon the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July
							1783—yesterday was fifty years—and that he had read it a second time in
							October 1784— It might be profitably read by any sincere Christian three
							times over, and then profitably read again— It is an admirable discourse
							upon the duty of connecting practical moral purposes with all study of
							religion— I began also to read <persRef ref="milman-henry"
								>Milman’s</persRef> History of the Jews, of which I had read some
							chapters last Winter at Washington; but with so little attention that I
							now began it anew— I was interrupted by a visit from <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Degrand</persRef>, and <persRef ref="simmons-david">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Simmons</persRef> a lawyer of Roxbury,
							who took up the remainder of the day— Their object was to obtain from me
							some declaration or certificate which might contribute to secure the
							re-election of <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">Gen<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> H. A. S. Dearborn</persRef>, as a member of the House
							of Representatives of the United States— He has failed upon three
							successive trials, by the want of a very small number of votes—twice of
							less than one hundred of more than 4000— The opposition to General
							Dearborn is Anti-Masonic— He is not a Mason, but in his opinions is
							opposed to the Masonic Institution; but he has not been able to steer
							impartially between the two parties, who in the district <pb n="116"
								type="ms"/>which he lately represented, and in that for which he is
							now a Candidate, are nearly equally divided— The Anti-Masons are under
							the impression that he had deceived them, and there has been apparent
							inconsistency in his conduct on the occasion, at different times—
							Deception is not in his character, for he is candid and open-hearted.
							These gentlemen urged that my name was used to influence the election
							against General Dearborn, and they wished some document from me to
							counteract that influence— I told them that I had a very friendly regard
							for General Dearborn, and thought him a very valuable member of
							Congress— That I regretted the opposition to his re-election, and should
							be gratified if he should ultimately succeed— But I had made it a rule
							since I had occupied the Station of President of the United States, not
							to interfere in any political elections—that there was a peculiar
							delicacy which restrained me from any interference between the
							Anti-Masons and General Dearborn; but that I had in conversation with
							some of the leading Antimasons expressed my opinions and wishes as being
							favourable to him— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Simmons appeared to
							acquiesce in this determination— Degrand pressed me by various arguments
							but I persevered in refusal. They walked with me in my Garden and
							Nursery, and left me not long before nine in the Evening— We had much
							conversation upon the subjects of Masonry and Anti-Masonry, on which I
							hold it necessary to keep a perpetual guard upon myself, against falling
							into excess— The controversy is in itself so exciting to the Passions,
							that the curb can never be relaxed with impunity— I regret that I cannot
							consistently with my principles, lend a hand to secure the Election of
							Dearborn, who is an honest-hearted and fair-minded man, and whose
							indiscretion is visited upon him severely.</p>

							and human natures of Jesus Christ, and the influences of the Holy Spirit
							upon the Soul— Upon these topics he warmed himself, until he found it
							necessary to strip off his coat; but he had nothing new to say upon
							them— As usual his discourse consisted of a string of texts from
							Scripture, chiefly from the Epistles of Paul, and to which he could
							affix no precise meaning, and when I pressed him for definite ideas he
							said it was true, great was the mystery of godliness. He told me he had
							preached last Evening to the Orthodox Congregation of which <persRef

							is now the occasional Pastor; and that he had been preaching about the

							told him that was altogether proper, and that with regard to my creed,
							that my judgment was not wholly under my own controul— That my faith
							must be subject to my judgment, and that I could believe nothing
							contrary to my reason, and not intelligibly revealed— M<hi

						<p>This morning there was every appearance of copious rain, but it was a
							disappointment— There was a sprinkling of less than five minutes early
							this morning, and another this Evening; and in the interval a blazing
							Sun, a baking atmosphere and a sultry flat calm— I bathed and swam about
							Sunrise, and was caught in the shower. Visited my garden and Nursery,

							endeavoured to resume the biography of <persRef key="adams-john">my

							dinner I read the prefaces and notices of the latest Edition that I have
							of the Letters of <persRef ref="derabutin-marie">Madame de
								Sevigné</persRef>— This Lady never imagined the celebrity which she
							attained. Her Letters were all private— None of them published in her
							Lifetime— None of them intended for publication— <persRef
								ref="desevigne-henri">Her husband</persRef> was killed in a duel
							when she had been married only four or five years, and she lived nearly
							half a century a widow; and died in 1696 at the age of 70. She was of
							noble birth, nearly related to <persRef ref="degondi-jean">Cardinal de
								Retz</persRef>, and in affluence— But not much noticed at the
							magnificent Court of <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis the 14<hi

							publication of her Letters, would have speedily passed into total
							oblivion— Her Cousin <persRef ref="derabutin-roger"
								>Bussy-Rabutin</persRef>, a man of fatuitous pretensions to literary
							eminence, of vicious life, her slanderer because she rejected him as a
							lover, first published in his Memoirs her Letters to him, just after her
							death—and by a just retribution of public Sentiment raised her
							reputation at the expense of his own— So little was known of her that
								<persRef ref="bayle-pierre">Bayle</persRef>, who wished to put her
							into his Dictionary could not obtain facts relating to her sufficient to
							make an article of her life— Thirty years after her death, and twenty

							in 1726 a small portion of her Letters to her were first published by an
							act of treachery to <persRef ref="desimiane-pauline">Madame de

						<p>I bathed again at the wharf this morning before Breakfast; but with much

							planted there 3 [symbols] five more of which I also planted in a Pot. N.
							9. I cease to eradicate the weeds in the hope that they may save from
							the drought some of the seedling trees which yet survive— Many Oaks and
							Walnuts the Acorns and nuts of which were planted last Autumn, are just
							now coming up— They have not time to form stems before the frosts, which
							will bear the winter. Is not the time of planting most important? Nature
							plants the seed when the fruit is ripe, and its natural covering

						<p>Cool. Clear Easterly wind and continued drought. <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa Smith</persRef> dined with us, and gave me
							from <persRef ref="bracket-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lemuel
								Brackett’s</persRef> Garden a Cherry plum, of which I plant the
							Stone in Pot 10. with the seeds of several Black Mulberries and 5
							[symbols] She gave me also the seeds of 4 large gooseberries, from the
							same garden, which I propose in like manner to plant— This was the 36<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> anniversary of my Marriage. In the
							Evening I went to Boston with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef>, my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
								wife</persRef>; we took tea at <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s</persRef>, and
							then with <persRef ref="frothingham-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Frothingham</persRef> and her eldest Son <persRef
								ref="frothingham-thomas">Thomas</persRef> went to the Tremont
							Theatre where a French company from New-Orleans are performing— The Play
							was a new Melo-drama, operatized, called Zampa, or the Marble Bride— The
							old Story of <persRef ref="donjuan">Don Juan</persRef>, only
							metamorphosing the Statue into a woman and adapting a suitable and easy
							Story to the change— The author is named <persRef ref="herold-ferdinand"
								>Harold</persRef>, and it is said to have had 150 Representations at
							Paris— The Music was fashionable and dull; in the <persRef
								ref="rossini-gioachino">Rossini</persRef> Style, without harmony,
							without Sentiment, without humour, without passion; and like all the new
							music I have heard for the last ten years a general gargle for sore
							throats. There can be no clearer proof of the degeneracy of musical
							taste than the desertion of the Matrimonio Segreto, the Molinara,
							Theodore, Tulipano, <persRef ref="gretry-andre">Gretri</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="mehul-etienne">Mehul</persRef>
							<persRef ref="dalayrac-nicolas">d’Alayrac</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="boieldieu-francois">Boïeldieu</persRef>, for such trashy,
							warbling, trilling, insignificance as this— We yawned over it, till
							eleven O’Clock, and reached home a quarter of an hour after
							midnight.</p>

						<p>Continued drought— A clear Sun, the whole day, with an atmosphere not
							above Summer heat. I could make only a short visit to my Garden and
							Nursery; where the useful plants are perishing with heat and thirst, and
							parasite weeds are flourishing— The effect of this weather is to
							superinduce languor and listlessness and involuntary indolence— I
							attempted to write but could not succeed— I read the Eulogy upon
								<persRef ref="derabutin-marie">Madame de Sevigné</persRef> by
								<persRef ref="u">Madame de Brisson</persRef>, which in 1777 obtained
							the prize at the Academy of Marseilles, and worthy of the prize and of
							the subject. Who this Madame de Brisson was, I cannot ascertain— I read
							also the Correspondence between Madame de Sevigné and <persRef
								ref="derabutin-roger">Bussy-Rabutin</persRef> from 1647 to 1657.
							Seventeen Letters— They are very indelicate, but full of wit— The first
							written by her immediately after the birth of <persRef
								ref="desevigne-charles">her Son</persRef>, and in the 22<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> year of her own age is especially
							remarkable, as characteristic of the person, of her Country, and of the
							time in which she lived— She was a virtuous woman and maintained an
							unblemished reputation through a long widowhood, having lost <persRef
								ref="desevigne-henri">her husband</persRef> when she was under 26.
							Bussy himself and many others made love to her in vain— But it was a
							very profligate age in regard to the intercourse between the sexes, and
							this Letter shews how vicious manners infect the conversation even of
							those who resist their influence upon the conduct— A married woman of
							22. who at this time should write to a male cousin such a Letter as this
							could have little virtue to preserve— Bussy’s answer is in a
							corresponding tone, and such as a young married woman could not read
							without a blush—</p>

						<p><date>28. V. </date>Sunday.</p>
						<p>Heard <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitney</persRef> from Luke 12.48. “For unto whomsoever much is
							given, of him shall be much required.”—and from Matthew 5.8. [“]Blessed
							are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.”— In the morning
							discourse an earnest exhortation against intemperance found its place— I
							read the second Sermon of the fourth Volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>—upon the love of Country. He
							takes his text and his model of Patriotism from Nehemiah— This discourse
							is remarkable because Saurin himself was a French refugee from the Edict
							of Nantes’s revocation, and Pastor of a French Protestant Church at the
							Hague— Holland was not his native Country nor that of his French
							Auditors— His Patriot is <persRef ref="nehemiah">Nehemiah</persRef>—like
							them an exile from his own Country, but permitted to return to it; which
							they were not— Saurin analyses from the Story of Nehemiah the principles
							of Patriotism and separately discusses them—as composed of a Spirit of
							1. devotion 2. reformation 3. mortification 4. Prudence 5 Vigilance 6.
							Firmness 7. Disinterestedness— There are two distinct addresses, one to
							the natives of the Netherlands, and the other to his own Countrymen the
							French Refugees; who he says are deprived of the Privilege of exercising
							the virtue of Patriotism— This is a very curious example of the
							modifications with which time, place and circumstances affect the
							Sentiments of men in their social relations. I read also the remainder
							of Book 1. the Patriarchal Age, and Book 2. Israel in Egypt of <persRef
								ref="milman-henry">Milman’s</persRef> History of the Jews— He begins
							with <persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef>— There are two
							difficulties to all modernized Histories of the Jews— Neither the facts,
							nor the characters are subjects of free discussion or enquiry— All is
							marvellous—all is miraculous, and the attempt to account for the Events
							from natural causes and by natural means strikes at the root of the
							whole History— The Narrative is always at War with physical Nature, and
							the morality is all referable to the single principle of the Will of
							God. Depart but one hair’s breadth from that, and all moral principle in
							the Bible is extinct— What is the crime of eating an apple? disobedience
							to the Will of God— What is the virtue of butchering a man’s own beloved
							Son? Obedience to the Will of God. The consequence of which is that we
							must approve of vicious actions as virtuous, <pb n="120" type="ms"/>and
							censure good deeds as crimes— From this difficulty M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Milman does not escape— Nor does he
							exactly discern the line within which this rule must be restricted— The
							subversion of moral principle, is admissible only so far as the divine
							Will is clearly and distinctly ascertained. The only fair and almost
							blameless character among the Patriarchs is <persRef ref="joseph3"
								>Joseph</persRef>, and he perhaps cannot be fully justified for
							telling his two dreams— But I am wandering— I walked this Evening to
								<persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B.
								Adams’s</persRef>, and spent an hour there— <persRef
								ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="beale-george2">his son</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="beale-ann">eldest daughter</persRef>, <persRef

								<persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa Smith</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth Adams</persRef> was there— The Day
							was clear and cold with Clouds of dust— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney gave notice that the communion would be administered next
							Sunday.</p>

						<p>The Sun rose with a sky perfectly clear— Clouds were gathering all the
							Morning— There was a very light sprinkling in the afternoon, and again
							late in the Evening. I found the heat of the Sun too oppressive to
							remain long in the garden this Morning— After dinner I planted a third
							row of Ohio Walnuts, dry Mazzard Cherries and Stones, Black Mulberry and
							Red Currant seed all kneaded together in moistened Earth—at the cleared
							off Strawberry patch in the Garden, at the entrance of the Nursery— The
							effect of the drought upon my seedling plants is desolating— They perish
							like the Soldiers of <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
								>Napoleon</persRef> upon the retreat from Moscow; and I mourn them
							as if they were animated beings. Very few seedlings of the present year
							are left alive— Many of former years which I had hoped were beyond the
							reach of Sun or frost are withering, and all are drooping— The ground is
							mere dust, or covered with rank weeds.— Towards Evening I walked to
								<persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B.

						<p><persRef ref="field-william">William Field</persRef> came and settled

							the half year ending 31. March last. <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hardy</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark</persRef> came and
							announced themselves as members of the Anti-Masonic County Committee for
							the County of Middlesex, and their object was to consult me with regard
							to the Anti-Masonic nomination for the Offices of Governor and
							Lieutenant Governor of the Commonwealth, for the ensuing year. First to
							ascertain whether I would consent to be nominated by the Anti-Masonic
							Convention— I told them that I had explicitly declined, from a belief
							upon full deliberation that I can render more useful service to the
							Anti-Masonic Cause, and to the Public, as a member of the House of
							Representatives of the United States than I could as Governor of the
							Commonwealth— They then enquired whether I should approve of the
							nomination by that convention of <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward
								Everett</persRef>— I said that I entertained a high opinion of the
							talents and integrity of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett—that I
							believed he would do honour to the Office of Governor, and if he should
							be nominated, I should be much gratified by the success of the
							nomination. I said it would however be for the consideration of the
							Convention, whether after supporting two years in succession, <persRef
								ref="lathrop-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lathrop</persRef> against <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
								Lincoln</persRef>, it would be just and fair now to abandon him—
							They thought M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lathrop was not himself
							solicitous of a re-nomination, and they believed him to be so unpopular,
							that if nominated he could not succeed— They proposed to visit <persRef
								ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef>,
							and enquired what I should think of him as a Candidate for the Office of
								Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Governor— I said I had great
							regard and esteem for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey, who had
							been for many years an intimate and confidential friend of mine. It
							would give me great pleasure if he should obtain the Office of
							Lieutenant Governor. They said <persRef ref="fuller-timothy">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller</persRef> was their Candidate
							for Lieutenant Governor last year; but as he and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Everett were <pb n="121" type="ms"/>both Inhabitants of
							Middlesex County, there would be a difficulty in pressing them both for
							the first and second Offices of the State— They spoke of <persRef
								ref="ripley-ezra">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ripley’s</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="whitman-bernard">Bernard Whitman’s</persRef> Masonic
							Addresses— Ripley said he would sooner be cut in two than violate his
							Masonic Oaths and Whitman gave out that Anti-Masonry was nothing more
							than Orthodoxy in disguise.— I said that perhaps the Anti-Masons would
							do well to consider whether they might not much strengthen their vote
							for Governor, by taking up <persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Armstrong</persRef> as their candidate
							with him— Armstrong is now Lieutenant Governor, and was elected by the
							National Republicans for his Orthodoxy— Perhaps that party which is very
							numerous might be conciliated, by adopting him as their Candidate— They
							said this would deserve much consideration— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hardy said if Armstrong was not a Mason, he might vote for
							him; but not if he was— They asked me, if I would mention to them any
							other person whom I should prefer as Candidate for Governor, if there
							should be insuperable objections to taking up with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett— I said that was a matter of great
							delicacy— I did not immediately think of any person, unless it should be
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>— They thought he looked higher, and might perhaps
							be President of the United States— There was a gentle rain last Night,
							and copious Showers this Morning— The Sky cleared off again this
							Evening.</p>

								<persRef ref="boylston-ward2">Ward Nicholas Boylston</persRef>, that
							his, Ward’s absences are excessive; that he has been admonished on
							account of them, and that unless he change his conduct in this respect
							he must leave college— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston is very
							much distressed at this notice, and knows not what to do, to save this
							child from ruin— There was already a note of censure upon him last year,
							which then gave her and me much concern, and upon which I expostulated
							with him, and he promised well; but without effect— If he should be
							dismissed from the College he will be ruined— As however it appears
							extremely probable that this will be done I asked M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston what her intentions were in that
							event— She said she should depend altogether upon me— I said one of
							three things would be necessary— To put him into a merchant’s Counting
							house— To send him to his father at Princeton, to make a farmer out of
							him or to send him to Sea, and work him into a Mariner— She did not seem
							to relish either, but there will be not much choosing. She said she
							would send him over to me here next Monday, and asked me to talk with
							him, which I promised, though I am but too well assured, it will be
							preaching to the winds— <persRef ref="boylston-sally">The boys
								mother</persRef> is far gone in a consumption— His younger brother
								<persRef ref="boylston-thomas">Thomas</persRef> is to go to school
