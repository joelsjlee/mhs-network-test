							final departure for other letters which he promised me he would do— The
							weather was so bad that it confined me almost the whole day at home; and
							the Evening was entirely without Company— It was only this day that I
							finished a letter begun the day before yesterday; for I find myself
							writing more and more slow as I advance— In the Evening however I began
							another letter; and in the mean time this Journal falls continually in
							arrears— Whenever something urgent occurs to be done, I postpone the
							morning record of every preceding day which is my theoretical principle;
							and whenever the day has left behind it much to be recorded I am too apt
							to put off beginning it by a sort of instinctive aversion to the labour
							which I see must be performed—when both these incidents occur together
							the dilatory weakness increases, and the arrears accumulate, untill the
							occurrences which should be noted down have escaped from my memory— I am
							now writing the first day of October’s Journal on the sixth, and
							sometimes though not often run behind still more. But of a day past in
							writing there can be little to say— The writing itself might serve for a
							Journal.</p>

						<p><date>4. </date>Finished reading the second Volume
							of the Bibliothéque des Philosophes, containing the Commentary of
								<persRef ref="hieroclesofalexandria">Hierocles</persRef>, upon the
							golden verses, translated by <persRef ref="dacier-andre"
								>Dacier</persRef>, with his own reflections upon it. Hierocles lived
							in the fifth Century of the Christian AEra, and though not himself a
							Christian, his book contains unequivocal proof of the influence of
							Christian Doctrines and principles upon the moral and religious Spirit
							of his age— The perusal of these Volumes has given me a little further
							insight into the history, character and doctrines of <persRef
								ref="pythagoras">Pythagoras</persRef>.— His symbols were probably
							borrowed from Egypt, and may be considered as an intermediate stage
							between hieroglyphical and alphabetical writing. As maxims of morality,
							the advantage of symbols is that of impressing upon the memory the moral
							precept, by the association of ideas, and by bringing the sense of the
							duty frequently to the mind, through the instrumentality of sensible
							images— It was the principle of the Pythagoricians that the symbol was
							to be observed both in its literal and in its mystical meaning—but the
							literal precept was often frivolous; its connection with the moral duty,
							obscure, uncertain, or ambiguous; and the moral duty itself not always
							important.— The golden Verses contain the foundation of a system of
							Theology and of Morality, in the style of authoritative precepts, and
							without symbols.— It is refined and pure as theology, as far as was
							attainable by Heathens before the Christian Revelation— Its morality was
							founded upon the Cardinal virtues, which are fully set forth by
							Hierocles and the whole basis properly laid in <hi rend="italic"
								>Piety</hi>—the first and greatest of the Virtues is Justice, which
							includes in itself the three others, Prudence, Temperance and Fortitude—
							The doctrine of self-examination every Night, and self-preparation every
							morning is taught in these verses, and is doubtless highly useful— The
							Pythagoricians made a practice of repeating these verses themselves
							every Night, and morning— The necessity of prayer and action in
							concurrence, for the success of all undertakings, is also here forcibly
							inculcated, and of excellent use— I hope to have occasion to recur to
							this Book again.— We sent this day the first Boat-load of our furniture
							into the City. <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">We</persRef> dined
							with <persRef ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t:</hi> Julien</persRef> the Austrian Minister, at a great
							diplomatic dinner— The first he has given— <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>, the <persRef
								ref="naryshkin-alexander">Grand Master of the Ceremonies,
								Narishkin</persRef>, the two Masters of the Ceremonies, <persRef
								ref="u">Laval</persRef> and <persRef ref="demaisonneuve-joseph"
								>Maisonneuve</persRef>— The <persRef ref="law-jacques">French
								Ambassador</persRef>, his Aid, Secretaries and Consul, and all the
							other foreign Ministers and their Secretaries were there, excepting
							<persRef ref="demaistre-joseph">Count Maistre</persRef> the Sardinian, and the <persRef ref="bezerra-joao"
								>Chevalier Bezerra</persRef> the Portuguese Minister— The absence of
							these Gentlemen, with both of whom Count S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
							Julien is well acquainted, and who are always invited to Count
							Romanzoff’s parties, was evidence clear enough of Austrian policy, and
							how its pride cowers before the power of France— There was in the
							dinner, and in every thing connected with it, an effort of magnificence,
							seemingly to equal or outdo that of the French Ambassador— The Servants
							were nearly as numerous, and in the same various styles of liveries, and
							equally rich— But the Count had behind his own Chair two Chasseurs in
							hussar-dresses, bedizined with silver lace and tassels and sashes to
							such a degree that scarcely any part of the cloathing under them was
							visible— Their mantles bordered with furs, hung cross wise behind them
							from shoulder to shoulder, and both of them were tall handsome men, with
							persons well adapted to set off their garments. This is a very handsome
							dress; but not more convenient than suitable to a footman waiting at
							dinner behind a gentleman’s Chair— The Count’s house is also very
							magnificently furnished—he gives for it two thousand ducats a year rent—
							His table was handsomely ornamented, but not so superbly as is customary
							at the Chancellor’s, or at the Ambassador’s— His dinner was remarkable
							for a number of things, of studied rarity, such as pine-apple jelly
							served in cups of pine-apple rinds— There was a band of music performing
							during the dinner almost without intermission— The music was very good,
							but fit only for the field— The horns, and drums, and cymbals, made such
							a thundering harmony, that it was literally rending with tremendous
							noise our ears asunder— It was impossible to hold any Conversation with
							one’s next neighbour— <persRef ref="pardo-benito">General
								Pardo</persRef> told me after dinner that the only way he had been
							able to account for its not having been stop’d after the first three
							minutes by order of the master of the house was that his cartilages were
							ossified. The Count was indeed the only person at table who did not
							appear sensible at all that his orchestra was too powerful— The <persRef
								ref="francis-i">Emperor Francis’s</persRef> health was drank in
							Champaign, the company all rising from table according to the usage at
							the Chancellor’s and at the Ambassador’s— But it was curious that Count
							Romanzoff after going through the Ceremony of this toast, addressed
							himself before he sat down, across Count S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
							Julien to the Ambassador who sat on the other side of him, and toasted
							his Master, the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor
								Napoleon</persRef>— This was another act of homage to the Supremacy
							of France, demonstrative of Russian policy.— For this dinner was
							occasional—given on the Emperor Francis’s <hi rend="italic"
							>name</hi>-day; and the honour was intended exclusively for him— Count
							Romanzoff never thinks of the Emperor Francis, at his Alexander day
							dinners or at the Napoleon day fêtes at the Ambassador’s— The attendance
							of the Servants like every thing else at this dinner bespoke the
							stiffness and aukwardness of novelty, and even the seating of the
							Company was irregular and unusual— The <persRef
								ref="vonsturmer-bartholomaus">Chevalier de Sturmer</persRef> sat at
							the Ambassador’s left hand— Almost all the foreign Ministers sat on the
							opposite side of the table. I sat between <persRef ref="bussche-calmor"
								>Count Bussche</persRef> and the <persRef ref="bray-francois"
								>Chevalier de Bray</persRef>. <pb n="298" type="ms"/>I observed the
							rule of temperance better than usual at these great dinners, to which I
							believe the stunning noise of the music in some sort contributed— For by
							preventing all conversation it left my mind unoccupied by any thing
							which could lead me to forget my resolution, and by confusing the brain
							it roused me to an extraordinary exertion to preserve it in as rational
							a State as was possible. The company all retired immediately after
							dinner and I came home with a dull head-ache occasioned by the noise,
							but which subsided, as soon as I had enjoyed half an hour of quiet at
							home— In the Evening, I got engaged with a number of the Edinburgh
							Review, which insensibly carried me till between one and two in the
							morning, before I perceived it was bed-time— I had a morning visit from
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ecky</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="harris-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris
								junior</persRef>.</p>

						<p><date>7. </date>I retrieved at last all the arrears of my Journal; but it

								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
								>ladies</persRef> were the greater part of the morning in the City,
							to which it is our purpose to remove to-morrow— I walked before dinner
							over <persRef ref="stroganov-alexander">Count Strogonoff’s</persRef>
							Garden, of which I now take my leave, and which has afforded me a
							frequent and agreeable walk, the summer through— I examined again the
							antient tomb, said sometimes to be that of <persRef ref="homer"
								>Homer</persRef>, and sometimes that of Achilles.— It is of
							marble—eight feet long 44. inches high, and of the same width— The four
							sides are sculptured in Basso-relievo— At the East end is a Centaur,
							with a bow, and a young man naked; the two faces are directed each
							towards the other, and it seems intended to represent the training of
								<persRef ref="achilles">Achilles</persRef> by the Centaur <persRef
								ref="chiron">Chiron</persRef>— The long North side has four figures
							representing two Centaurs in battle one with a lion, and the other with
							a lioness or tyger— In the centre and behind the animals there is a
							tree. On the short West side is a female figure seated, playing upon a
							lyre, and two others standing, one on each side of her— The long South
							side has ten human figures of which two are women seated upon stools—in
							the centre is a young Man with a shield upon his arm, in an attitude of
							starting to force himself away, and a female on her knees before him as
							if imploring him to stay— I conjecture it to be Achilles discovered by
								<persRef ref="ulysses">Ulysses</persRef>, and summoned to attend the
							Greeks at the siege of Troy— The sculpture is in a style of very
							considerable refinement, but not of the most perfect period of the Art—
							The heads of the Centaurs, the form of the naked young-man, and of the
							Lions, and the draperies of all the attired figures are executed in a
							style of great improvement— There are mouldings and Cornices above and
							below the figures round three of the sides, but the long side with the
							two Centaurs and lions is plain— At three of the Corners are carved
							plain Doric Pilasters, but at the fourth the Eastern Corner is an image
							like a human figure with the head of an Ape— There is a marble lid or
							cover, originally of the same length and width as the tomb, but one end
							of which has been broken off; it still however nearly covers the
							whole—it is shaped like the roof of an American Barn, sharp pointed at
							the top, as if to shed with most ease the snow or rain— It is uniformly
							sculptured in a sort of regular leaves and is too feet in perpendicular
							height— On the face of its unbroken end there is a round medallion
							carved in the stone upon which there may have been an inscription— There
							is not however at present the trace of a letter— The sides of the
							monument themselves are not entire—they have been broken in several
							places, but are put <pb n="299" type="ms"/>together again with accurate
							adaptation— As I was returning home I met <persRef ref="nelson"
								>Nelson</persRef>, who told me that the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef> would return into the City for the winter
							to-morrow— Passing by the <persRef ref="law-jacques"
								>Ambassadors</persRef> I saw the people carrying furniture to a boat
							from his house; also for the purpose of removal— It was too late after
							dinner for my Evening walk— I employed the Evening in continuing my

							reading in the Bibliotheque des Philosophes, and the Edinburgh Review.—
							I quit with reluctance the house in the Country, which is convenient,
							and has a delightful situation, and where I have spent three Months very

							Rubles a year rent, including two hundred fathoms, or Sajenes of white
							birch wood, at ten Rubles the Sajene— This measure is seven feet long
							and as high, the wood being on the average eighteen inches long— It
							contains therefore 73 1/2 cubic feet, which is fifteen Sajenes to eight
							Cords— My calculation was that 200 Sajenes, being about 110 Cords would
							last us untill next June when I expect we shall leave this Country— But
							we have consumed forty Sajenes in three Months, two of which were Summer
							Months, and the third merely the Commencement of Autumn— My New land
							lord attempted to persuade me to engage for only 150 Sajenes—he said the
							house could not require more, or at the utmost 160— But I know that
							would be fallacious— If the 200 last us untill June it will be more than
							I now expect.</p>

							upon Prayer— <persRef ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire</persRef> says
							that Dacier was a mule loaded with all antiquity— There appears to be
							neither criticism nor philosophy in his own writings— I have not the

							high repute— It is strange that a man who had spent so much time and
							taken such pains to understand Plato himself, and to make him understood

							profound Admiration both of Plato and of <persRef ref="socrates"
								>Socrates</persRef>; but it is the admiration of a slave, or of an
							inferior being— His great anxiety seems to be, to make Saints of them—
							Yet I am under obligations to him for making me acquainted with Socrates
							and Plato;—whom I have either not Greek enough, or not leisure enough to
							read in the original— I read the first Alcibiades at Auteuil in 1784. or
							1785. and it has been useful to me— The second Alcibiades might be
							called the Vanity of Human Wishes— It lays down the same principles, and
							uses the same Arguments as <persRef ref="juvenal">Juvenal</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="johnson-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Johnson</persRef> have thrown into the poetical and satyrical form—
							The form of prayer recommended by Socrates is more comprehensive than
							that of Juvenal, and contains the substance of a part of the Lord’s
							prayer— The process of the Socratic reasoning is slow; sometimes too
							diffuse; and too uniform in the manner.— <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef> gives some importance to all the personages of his
							Dialogues— Plato has but one personage; all the rest are automata— I
							read also several Articles in the Edinburgh Review; and among the rest
							that upon the philosophical Essays of <persRef ref="stewart-dugald"
								>Dugald Stewart</persRef>, published at Edinburgh in 1810— The whole
							Article is curious and highly interesting; but there is one part of it
							which gave me a mingled sensation of surprize, pleasure and
							mortification— It is a train of reasoning on the subject of etymology,
							and figurative language so similar to that of my Lectures 30. 31. and
							32. that it would be difficult for a third person, reading both not to
							suspect one to be a plagiarism from the other—the whole page 198 of the
							Review (N. 33. for Nov<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> 1810) is so much
							like pages 274 and 275. of my second Volume that they seem almost copied

						<p><date>13. </date>Finished reading the fourth Volume of the Bibliotheque
							des Philosophes.— It contains the Theages, or on Wisdom— The Eutyphron,
							or on Holiness— An Abridgment by <persRef ref="dacier-andre"
								>Dacier</persRef> of the first and second Alcibiades, and of the
							Eutyphron— The Apology of <persRef ref="socrates">Socrates</persRef>,
							delivered upon his trial— The Crito, or upon the obligation of Duty—and
							the Phaedo, upon the immortality of the Soul; which I now read the
							second time— In the Theages, Socrates gives the account of his Demon or
							familiar Spirit— A Voice he says, which occasionally warned him what he
							was not to do, but which never gave him any advice to act— It is not
							easy to say, whether this was the effect of Superstition, or whether he
							spoke in figure— It is still more difficult to impute it to deliberate
							deception.— The instances which he gives of the occasions when he heard
							the voice, make it hardly possible to consider him, as having intended
							only Prudence, or Conscience— They are four: but they all relate to the
							conduct of others and not his own— The Eutyphron is a discussion whether
							it be consistent with holiness for a man to appear as the accuser of his
							father for murder— Socrates here mentions that he himself was accused by
								<persRef ref="meletus">Melitus</persRef> of disbelieving the
							established Gods, and attempting to introduce new ones—he certainly does
							ridicule the popular creed about the Gods then in repute, and shews that
							holiness cannot be defined that which pleases them.— The Apology is
							divided into three parts, what he said before the question upon the
							charge—after it when he was to name his own punishment—and after the
							sentence of death had been passed upon him—the mildness of his tone and
							manner—the firmness and intrepidity of his adherence to his principles,
							the sportive playfulness of his satire, and the exalted purity of his
							doctrines, are all but divine— He repeats here the assurance that he is
							accompanied by a demon; but there is no substantial defence against the
							accusation of Melitus— He had no defence to make— The charges were
							substantially true— The Crito, is the <pb n="301" type="ms"/>exposition
							of his motives for refusing to make his escape from prison when under
							sentence of death— Sublime Morality— <persRef ref="hume-david"
								>Hume</persRef> I think says it is the Doctrine of passive Obedience
							and Non-resistance— Socrates argues in this dialogue from a dream that
							he had had the Night before— So that he believed in dreams— He lays down
							however and demonstrates the position, that evil is never to be returned
							for evil, and it is from this that Juvenal quotes that sentiment in his
								13<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> Satire— I am better pleased with
							the Phaedo, at the second reading than I was at the first— Its argument
							is still unsatisfactory— One of his principal reasons is the Doctrine of
							the Metempsycosis—another the existence of the Soul before the
							body—which is attempting to prove a doubtful point; by data still more
							doubtful— We know them now to be false— The idea that Spirit is a simple
							and not a compound essence, and therefore not liable to decomposition
							like matter, is ingenious, and the strongest that he gives. He refutes
							with sufficient force the objection of <persRef ref="simmias"
								>Simmias</persRef> that the soul is only a <hi rend="italic"
								>harmony</hi>, and that of <persRef ref="cebes">Cebes</persRef> that
							although the Soul may last long enough for several bodies it must at
							last wear out— But one of the most remarkable things in this Treatise is
							the observation of Simmias, that to establish firmly the belief of the
							Soul’s immortality a special revelation from heaven is necessary.— I had
							visits this morning from <persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Fisher</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"

						<p><date>15. </date>Attended the funeral solemnities at the interment of the
							late <persRef ref="stroganov-alexander">Count Strogonoff</persRef>— We
							went to his house about half-past nine in the morning— He was lying in
							State, under a splendid canopy in an apartment hung entirely round with
							black cloth, and lighted with tapers— All the principal nobility of the
							Court were there, but none of the foreign Ministers, except <persRef
								ref="demaistre-joseph">Count Maistre</persRef>— But <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laval</persRef> the Master of
							the Ceremonies told me that it was considered as more of a Compliment to
							the family to go first to the house— The corpse was removed from the
							house in about half an hour— The procession to the Cazan Church was
							performed entirely on foot, and every body was bare-headed; the house
							being too near the Church to form a procession of Carriages— The crowd
							was so great that it was with great difficulty I made my way into the
							Church, and found it to the place of the foreign Ministers— The
							Ceremonies were similar to those I had seen at the interment of <persRef
								ref="beloselsky-alexander">Prince Beloselsky</persRef>, but longer,
							and with more magnificence— There was a funeral discourse, delivered by
							the <persRef ref="drozdov-vasily">Archimandrite Philaretus</persRef>,
							said to be the most distinguished Orator among the Russian Clergy— It
							had the merit of being short—about twenty minutes, but I could not
							understand him; and few of the assembly could hear him— His manner was
							temperate and his gestures graceful— He did not appear to attempt any
							excitement of the Passions— The Passport as it is commonly called is
							only a prayer for God’s mercy to the deceased, and a sort of Certificate
							of his character— It is roll’d up and put into the right hand before the
							closing of the Coffin— The body was clad in the uniform worn by the
							Count when alive, with the Star of the Order of <persRef ref="standrew"
								>Saint Andrew</persRef> upon the Coat— A number of Stools covered
							with Cushions of Crimson velvet were ranged on both sides of the stage
							on which the Coffin was placed, and on each stool was laid the mark of
							some distinction which the Count had enjoyed; such as the ribbands of
							the different orders; a gold medal struck by the assembly of the
							Nobility of the Province, of which he had been chosen eight or nine
							times successively the Marshall &amp;c— Before the Coffin was closed,
							his <persRef ref="stroganov-pavel">Son</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="stroganov-alexander2">Grand-son</persRef>, relations, friends,
							and servants went up and performed the usual ceremony of kissing his
							hand— The Son and Grand-son prostrated themselves three times at the
							lowest-step before they went up and as they descended— One of the women
							of the family remained prostrate with her face fixed down upon the first
							step, for a full space of five minutes, weeping and sobbing aloud as in
							extreme distress— <persRef ref="litta-ekaterina">Countess
								Litta</persRef>, who is a distant relation of the deceased, was much
							affected during part of the <hi rend="strikethrough">deceased</hi>
							ceremony.— She wept much, and <pb n="302" type="ms"/>sobbed heavily for
							some minutes, but recovered herself, before the ceremony was finished—
							It was past two O’Clock when the procession from the Church commenced;
							but I did not follow it— I returned home— I had some conversation at the
							house with <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>—
							I mentioned to him the appearance of French privateers at the passage of
							the Sound, concerning which I observed I knew that <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>
							had spoken to him— He said that <persRef ref="gurieff-dmitri">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gourieff</persRef> had laid the
							subject before the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>—that the
							Emperor had directed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gourieff to report
							the Statement to him the Chancellor, and had directed him to make
							representations concerning it to the Danish Government, and he had
							accordingly entered into Correspondence with the Danish Government
							through <persRef ref="vonblome-otto">Baron Blome</persRef>, about it—
							But what could be done? If France had no possessions upon the Baltic,
							the old ground might be taken that the Baltic was a <hi rend="italic"
								>mare clausum</hi>, but however it might be closed with regard to
							other Nations it could not be so to the powers bordering upon it; and
							consequently not now to France— I told him that such Considerations had
							induced me to spare him the trouble of a formal application upon the
							subject— I had not much expectation from what Denmark would do, though
							she would be the greatest sufferer by the Event— Our vessels would not
							go through the Sound to pay the toll, for the sake of being taken by
							French privateers— They would sooner come with English Convoys through
							the Belt— The Count said he hoped many of them would take their
							destination for Archangel, as he did not think they would be troubled by
							French Privateers in that Sea— And then he told me again, with an
							injunction to consider him as laying aside the character of Chancellor
							of the Empire, the Story about the enragés de terre and the enragés de
							mer, which he had told me before, last June— He asked me, if I had any
							late news from America; and particularly with reference to a prospect of
							War, between the United States, and England. I told him I had none— But
							if I could venture to give him my private opinion, it was that there
							would not be a War— That France was rendering us too many good Offices,
							like that of stationing these privateers at the passage of the Sound, to
							make us very hasty in coming to extremities with England— He smiled and
							said he thought so too— I told him I had Boston Newspapers to 10.
							August, by which I found that <persRef ref="vonderpahlen-friedrich"
								>Count Pahlen</persRef> was then there— He said he had no letters
							from him at that place— On returning home I found the Courier’s Passport
							for <persRef ref="wells-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wells</persRef>, and afterwards received the order for the horses— I
							carried them to the Hotel de l’Europe, but M<hi rend="superscript"

								ref="bentzon-adrian;bentzon-magdalena">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bentzon</persRef>—
							The lady only received me, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bentzon being
							unwell— I sat with her about an hour— At the Church door this morning I
							met <persRef ref="campenhausen-baltazar">Baron Campenhausen</persRef>,

							this Country, that I suppose it struck him as oddly to see a man with
							bare hands, as it would have been had he met me bare footed— In general
							the Emperor is extremely quick, and particular in observing slight

							said his private Affairs— Had he come as Master of a Merchant Vessel?—
							he had not— Merely as a traveller then?— As a traveller, upon business
							of his own, and with a permission from the Government.— Was it
							customary, under the Government of the United States, to allow their
							naval Officers, to go as Masters of Merchant Vessels?— Sometimes, when
							they were upon furlough— Most of our naval Officers had been taken, from
							among the Captains of Vessels in the merchant service— That, he said
							differed from the English practice— In England Officers of the Navy were
							some times allowed to sail in merchant Vessels, but he believed they
							were never taken from Merchant-men, to be Marine-Officers— I said they
							had an extensive system for the regular education of Officers to the
							service of the Navy; which on a smaller scale we now had also— But that
							our navy itself was a recent institution, and in the origin it was
							necessary to take its Officers, among the persons best qualified for the

							finished reading the <persRef ref="grou-jean">Abbé Grou’s</persRef>
							Translation of <persRef ref="plato">Plato’s</persRef> Republic; a work
							to which I must return again— I never before read it with so much
							attention, and it is full of so much excellent Instruction that it
							cannot be too deeply impressed <pb n="306" type="ms"/>impressed upon the
							mind— It is undoubtedly mixed with some gross absurdities, with some
							miserable sophistry, and with some whimsical oddities— The general
							defect of the Republic is, that as a theory of Government it undertakes
							to govern too much— It leaves too little to individual Will— Its
							features are too arbitrary— As a moral treatise upon Justice, it has not
							sufficient unity of subject— The first idea of constituting an imaginary
							Republic, in order to ascertain the nature of Justice, flows naturally
							enough from the subject; for Justice is the great <hi rend="italic"
								>social</hi> virtue, which should govern us in our Relations with
							other men— But after having erected his fabric, Plato, or <persRef
								ref="socrates">Socrates</persRef>, adheres too much to it, and does
							not enough remember the purpose for which he raised it— He returns
							indeed at the close of the tenth Book to the noble proposition with
							which he began, that <hi rend="italic">Justice</hi> is to be practiced,
							though it should be ever so unfortunate, and even in famous in the
							erring judgment of mankind, but he has not pointed the application of
							his political Institutions to his moral principle. Hence it is that this
							work is always considered as a theory of Government, and not as a mere
							moral Dissertation— His community of goods and of women, is a melancholy
							proof of the weakness of the human mind— His exclusion of the Poets, is
							founded upon a sophistical train of reasoning; and his calculation that
							a king is 729 times happier than a tyrant, is ridiculous— But with these
							errors the mixture of wise opinions, exalted sentiment, sublime morality
							is so predominant that it is scarcely proper to mention them— They are
							fit to be meditated upon more maturely, which I intend— The form of the
							work is pleasing, though it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> too long for a
							Dialogue— The Scenery is well laid— The Sophist <persRef
								ref="thrasymachus">Thrasymachus</persRef> rather too soon
							dispatched, for the violence with which he commences, and the two
							brothers <persRef ref="glaucon">Glaucon</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adeimantus">Adimantus</persRef> perhaps not sufficiently
							discriminated in their characters— Plato never represents himself to

						<p><date>31. </date>Morning visits from <persRef ref="u">M<hi

								ref="fisher-miers">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher</persRef>.
							The two first of these Gentlemen are going to Gothenburg and further,
							with <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> David</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="austin-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph
								Austin</persRef>— They came for Passports which I gave them. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Slade brought me a letter and packet of
							Newspapers from <persRef ref="smith-john2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> J. S. Smith</persRef> in London, with a packet for
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson</persRef>
							and several other letters— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher had
							been over to the Island to see <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Blodget</persRef> who is very dangerously ill with a
							fever— This was the first day that he could go over since Sunday; the
							river not having been passable before— I went with him to the
							Glass-Manufactory which is just beyond the Monastery of <persRef
								ref="nevsky-alexander">S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Alexander
								Newsky</persRef>— It was so late that we could see only a small part
							of the works which they carry on— The most curious part of them is the
							making of looking glasses—four of which had been cast this morning
							before we went there— They shewed us the manner of coating the glasses
							with Mercury and Tin, and they were at work in polishing a number of
							them which is performed with a Steam-engine; an invention of prodigious
							effect, in its application to manufactures— They also make here
							decanters, wine glasses, tumblers, and coloured-glass dishes and vases
							of various kinds— I saw the various works of blowing, colouring, cutting
							and gilding but we were obliged to go over the whole in the space of
							half an hour; and I know not how to describe even what I saw— I wish I
							could visit a manufacture once a week, and spent three hours at every
							visit— If I learnt nothing else by it, I should have a perpetual lesson
							of humility in the consciousness of my ignorance from which it would not
							suffer me to escape— This manufacture belongs to the Crown and I hope to
							see it again— We returned home <pb n="307" type="ms"/>about 6. O’Clock,
							but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher, could not stay to dine with
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>, being engaged to
							go over again to see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Blodget. We had no
							Company in the Evening, and I pass’d it reading English and American
							Newspapers.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> My course of occupation is now so regular
							that its principal variety results from the successive change of the
							Seasons. During the present month we have removed our residence from the
							Country, back into the City; but this has made very little difference in
							my mode of life— I now begin to read as soon as the morning light
							allows, and read about two hours before rising from bed— About 10. I
							rise and continue reading untill near eleven when we breakfast— From
							that time untill four in the afternoon, I receive visits, and write as I
							find opportunity— Walk an hour—dine—and pass the Evening untill midnight
							in writing and with visitors; or sometimes, though very rarely in paying
							visits— About midnight I go to bed— The Evening writing is involuntary,
							but necessary— The continual interruptions which I have then and the
							morning, make it indispensable to seize any moments that I can find.</p>
