							songs are seldom taken from Epic Poems— I question whether even the Odes
							of <persRef ref="horace">Horace</persRef> or of <persRef ref="pindar"
								>Pindar</persRef> were ever sung by Roman or Greek Cabin-boys— A
							keen eye may see here and there traces of vain glory, piercing through
							the veil of Christian humility—the author glories in his Country, in his
							religion, in his literary successes, and persecutions; and he studiously
							sets off his own courage, and patriotism and tender affections— His
							favourite association of ideas, is between himself and any thing or
							person illustrious in antiquity— He generally puts in a qualifying
							disavowal of comparison, for form-sake; but the next great man that
							occurs to his mind comes with the same company—himself— all this perhaps
							is inseparable from a Journal.</p>

							witnesses and in some sort participates—one moment <pb n="309" type="ms"
							/>upon the ocean, buffeting a Storm, or drifting to a rock or
							quicksand—the next entering a house of sickness or of mourning, and from
							that passing perhaps into another for a banquet or a Ball to the voice
							of feasting and of mirth— Of the Bridegroom and the Bride— This thought
							is at once so striking and so obvious that I was vexed at having never
							made it myself— He speaks of having met a number of American Officers at
							Tunis.— He blames Sparta for not having been sufficiently ambitious—and
							avows some sentiments in favour of domestic servitude, which savour much
							of the soil and the Season in which they originate. They are mingled
							with other sentiments of fervent Christianism, and attachment to

						<p><date>10. </date>I had only time this morning to finish reading the

								>Plato’s</persRef> Laws— As my acquaintance with Plato, becomes more
							intimate, my admiration of his genius, and my regret for his errors
							increases— I lament that I had not sought this intimacy sooner, and more
							assiduously— In reading him it is necessary to be always upon one’s
							guard—always winnowing the chaff from the wheat— His Laws, might with
							more propriety have been called the Republic, than the work which bears
							that name. The Laws, are professedly a project of a Constitution for a
							Cretan Colony, that was to issue from the City of Gnossus— As a project
							of Government it is if possible more absurd and impracticable than the
							Republic— He chuses to have 5040 families, and proposes laws to prevent
							their increase not less than their diminution— He makes laws for the
							most trivial domestic arrangements, and punishes with death more
							frequently than <persRef ref="draco">Draco</persRef>— But some of his
							regulations are excellent, and many of his principles are truly
							admirable. His argument upon the existence and nature of the Gods, upon
							the immortality of the Soul, and upon future rewards and punishments is
							inferior to nothing but Christianity; and stronger in Logic than the
							Phaedo— The doctrine upon <hi rend="italic">Love</hi>, peculiar to
							Plato, is fully set forth in this book, and in spite of all ridicule is
							both beautiful and sublime— The Doctrine about numbers, seems to me
							rather pedantic than profound— But the advice to study the mathematics
							and Astronomy is well reasoned— I hope to be yet, much better acquainted
							with Plato— At Noon I went with <persRef ref="smith-william-steuben"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> to the Winter

							Gatschina— I had some Conversation with the <persRef ref="law-jacques"
								>French Ambassador</persRef>, who hinted to me that with the help of
							about five thousand Frenchmen, we could easily take Canada— The Te Deum
							was finished about 1/2 past two— After I came home <persRef

							He said she was better— It was a bad cold she had taken, by having her

						<p><date>13. </date>Another clear cold day— I took my second morning bath
							with the walk of an hour and a half immediately afterwards. If however I
							persevere in the Resolution of following this practice of walking before
							breakfast, I must make a new arrangement, of daily occupations, and a
							new distribution of my time. I found that after my return home, I had
							not time for reading the five chapters in the German Bible, and the
							usual portion, I had assigned to myself of <persRef ref="plato"
								>Plato</persRef>, before Breakfast— Still less to write the journal
							of yesterday— The two last I adjourned untill after Breakfast. I then
							began the Protagoras, of <persRef ref="grou-jean">Grou’s</persRef>
							translation, occasionally comparing it with that of <persRef
								ref="dacier-andre">Dacier</persRef>— But I had not got half-through,
							when <persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fisher</persRef> called on me, and proposed paying a visit to
								<persRef ref="dubrowsky-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dubrowsky</persRef>, the librarian of the Imperial library.— While I
							was dressing to go with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher, <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>
							came in and sat with me nearly an hour— It was thus past 3 O’Clock
							before I went out with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher— I would
							have postponed the visit to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dubrowsky to
							another day but Fisher was anxious to go this day, and I accompanied
							him— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dubrowsky received us in an obliging
							manner, and shewed us a number of curious manuscripts— Principally
							curious on account of the persons to whom they had belonged— Among them
							were a Mass-Book, belonging to the unfortunate <persRef
								ref="maryqueenofscots">Mary Queen of Scots</persRef>, which she used
							while in prison in England, with many things written with her own hand
							upon the margins and blank pages— An English Chronicle, and some other
							books with the names of <persRef ref="james-i">James</persRef> (1)
								<persRef ref="charles-i">Charles</persRef> (1) and <persRef
								ref="cromwell-oliver">O. Cromwell</persRef> written on their first
							and last blank leaves— There was another name which I took to be <hi
								rend="italic">Eduardus</hi>, and supposed to be that of <persRef
								ref="edward-vi">Edward 6</persRef>. But M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Dubrowsky said it was <hi rend="italic">Ricardus</hi>, and
							upon my asking him which of the Richard’s, he answered Richard <hi
								rend="italic">the fourth</hi>—which gave me no very high opinion of
							his antiquarian knowledge— There was a small Latin Bible, written upon a
							soft and beautiful kind of vellum, which he pretended was of human skin—
							I asked him when and where the <hi rend="italic">manufactory</hi> of
							this material, in such a manner had existed, which however he could not
							tell me— He only said it was done by the monks of the middle ages, and
							must be the skins of infants who had died without baptism— I have yet
							some doubts with regard to the fact, though it is obviously a kind of
							vellum far more thin and delicate than that of a calf— There was a
							collection of letters written by Mary, Queen of Scots, <persRef
								ref="elizabeth-i">Elizabeth of England</persRef>, James 1. and
							others, which I had not time to examine— A manuscript collection of
							poetry addressed to <persRef ref="louis-xii">Louis 12</persRef>. of
							France, and <persRef ref="annedebretagne">Anne de Bretagne</persRef> his
							Queen, with illuminated pictures between many of the leaves; two of
							which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dubrowsky says, are by the hand of
								<persRef ref="sanzio-raffaello">Raphael Sancio</persRef>— They are
							allegories, and very beautifully done— There were many other curiosities
							of the same kind, but it grew late and dark and we were obliged to go
							away— I asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dubrowsky’s permission to
							call upon him again, to which he gave me an earnest invitation— He was
							an amateur of these curiosities, and formed a large collection of them,
							which the <persRef ref="paul-i">Emperor Paul</persRef> purchased of him
							entire for 70,000 Roubles, and appointed him the keeper of them, as
							librarian— I went home with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher and
							dined with him— We were eight or nine at table, and at six O’Clock went
							from thence to the English Chapel, where the funeral service was
							performed by <persRef ref="pitt-london">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pitt</persRef>, over the remains of <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Blodget</persRef>.— This was one of
							the most pleasing and amiable young men I ever knew— Modest, lively,
							sensible, with a handsome person, and manners universally agreeable— He
							came here early last Summer; had formed a commercial establishment, in
							partnership with <persRef ref="vonessen-christopher">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Christopher Von Essen</persRef>, and
							had a fair prospect of making an affluent fortune— He has been thus
							suddenly <pb n="311" type="ms"/>arrested in the midst of his career, and
							left another warning to those who survive him, not to lean upon Earth— I
							walked home, and afterwards went with the <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
								>Ladies</persRef> and paid a number of formal visits— To <persRef
								ref="gurieff-dmitri">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>Count Alexander Soltikoff</persRef> came in while we were there—
							The <persRef ref="serracapriola-anna">Duchess de

							that of <persRef ref="stroganov-alexander">Count Strogonoff</persRef>—
							Antique Busts and Statues— One particularly of a Cupid standing with his

							with tables laid in the center and round the sides for about two hundred
							persons.— All served in solid plate— Others halls with tables laid, and
							served in the same manner.— A Hall where part of the company were seated
							at Cards— Hung round with the finest gobelin Tapestry. Three small

							with most of the furniture of the <persRef ref="marieantoinette">late

							Coffee services and Vases— Bronzes of the most exquisite workmanship— A

							supper was served about 3. in the morning—260 persons sat down to it—
							About half the company had come away as we did— The Ball finished about
							6. in the morning— I was in bed about two.</p>

							changing the subject he made some remarks upon the weather, which is

						<p><date>22. </date>After the usual morning walk, and reading in the German
							Bible, I this day finished reading the second Volume of <persRef
								ref="plato">Plato’s</persRef> dialogues, translated by <persRef

							have thus completed the perusal of all the parts of Plato that have been

							more pleasure— But the doctrine of <persRef ref="socrates"
								>Socrates</persRef> that Virtue is not communicable by Instructions,
							which recurs in several of the Dialogues, is among the things which I
							would wish not to believe— Virtue, he says is a divine inspiration; a

							favourites—and therefore it cannot be taught— But he very often declares
							that he know not what Virtue is— The opinion that Virtue cannot be
							taught is a dangerous error— The Menon contains an argument for the
							immortality of the Soul; founded upon a supposed demonstration that all
							knowledge is nothing but reminiscence— Socrates examines a slave of
							Menon’s, and makes him prove that the square of the diagonal line of any
							given square will contain exactly the double of its superficies—
								<persRef ref="euclid">Euclid’s</persRef> 47<hi rend="superscript"

							him again. We had no visitors through the whole day and Evening; but I
							was absorbed by various domestic concerns, of a nature excessively
							irksome— Walked again about an hour before dinner upon the Quay, and met
							a numerous company of walkers— Among them was the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, who told me that he had made
							the acquaintance of a Countryman of mine—a <persRef ref="fisher-miers"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher</persRef>— I told him,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher had mentioned to me his having
							had the honour of seeing His Majesty— So—you know him then, said he—
							Yes, Sire! intimately— From what part of America does he come?— from
							Philadelphia— He speaks French very well— tolerably well, Sire— Is the
							French language very common in your Country?— Not very common—and not
							at-all so, except in the commercial Cities— In England, I have heard
							that French is scarcely ever spoken; and in Germany it is extremely rare
							among the common people— But you, I suppose have people of almost all
							nations mixed together— Of most European Nations, Sire—but chiefly
							Germans and Irish people— A few french—but altogether fewer than is
							generally supposed— And do they all amalgamate well together?— Very
							well, Sire, in a length of time— And does it not sometimes produce
							difficulties or confusion, at the elections for your assembly?— None
							that are of material consequence— And if they are elected, how do they
							express themselves?— They sometimes make speeches in English, and often
							speak very well—only their pronunciation is a little laughed at— But one
							of our <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">Ministers</persRef> for instance
							was a Genevan—and was many years a member of Congress; where he made
							speeches as well as any other member— He also asked me if M<hi

							here; and whether he succeeded prosperously in his business—which I

								ref="demonicus">Demonicus</persRef>, is a sort of moral
							dissertation, containing good advice for the conduct of life— It is
							indeed rather a letter than an Oration, and should have been included
							among the Epistles— The second, to <persRef ref="nicocles"
								>Nicocles</persRef>, is of the same kind—on the duties of a king—
							The third is supposed to be a discourse of Nicocles himself to his
							subjects—descanting upon the superior excellence of Monarchy as a form
							of Government—on his own merits as a sovereign, and on the duty of his
							subjects to pay him obedience— This last is a regular Oration— They are
							all in a very temperate style, and full of moral and political
							reflections— But the use of figures is very rare—the grammar is very
							incorrect, and the whole composition heavy and flat— I had a visit from
								<persRef ref="montreal-f">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="peter-the-great">Peter the Great</persRef>— The

							Russia, with which I allow him to amuse himself daily by looking over
							the prints; opened it to the prints of the Coins, turned to the leafe
							where that very Ruble was engraved, and covered the two sides of the
							Ruble as printed with the real Ruble— I mark this down as an
							extraordinary instance of observation and of memory in a child of less
							than four years and a half old— I intended to have read some pages of
							the Itinéraire this Evening, but was disappointed.</p>

							haut des Cieux, et paix sur la terre aux hommes de bonne volonté, chéris
							de Dieu— vol 2. p. 166. Such a mistake in a text so important to the

							rest often names <persRef ref="volney-constantin">Volney</persRef>—in a dry manner without approbation or
							censure a sort of silence by no means inexpressive— The national and
							personal Vanity travels along with him, the most faithful and
							inseparable of all his companions— But I love his religious enthusiasm,
							in which the mixture of superstition is not so copious as I had
							anticipated— As he was more deeply affected with the scenes of the
							Holy-Land than with the Classical ruins of antient Greece, so his
							narrative of them is infinitely more interesting to me, and his genius
							rises with the sublimity and awfulness of his subject— His observations
							of life and manners, are sometimes playful, and sometimes profound; and
							he sketches characters as he goes along, in broad strokes, but with a
							masterly hand— His parallel between Nature in America, and in Palestine,
							and that between the Arabian and the American Savage are strikingly
							beautiful, and carry in their very originality <pb n="316" type="ms"

						<p><date>29. </date>I rose about six, but found myself with a Cold, and sore
							throat, which disconcerts again my projected regimen— I walked and read

							to <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>— I read
							the tenth and eleventh Orations of <persRef ref="Isocrates"
								>Isocrates</persRef>, in praise of <persRef ref="helen"
								>Helen</persRef> and of <persRef ref="busiris">Busiris</persRef>—
							Read also a part of <persRef ref="manilius-marcus">Manilius’s</persRef>
							third <pb n="317" type="ms"/>Book in which the astrological mysteries
							are continued— In my walk before dinner I stop’d at the Shops, and

								>Charles</persRef> with me in the sledge, and brought home the books
							and prints I had bespoken yesterday— In the Evening I went to the French

								>Spontini</persRef>, much and justly celebrated— I judge of music

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> Since the close of the last
							month I have undertaken a great change in the arrangement and
							distribution of my time— I meet with many obstacles to the
							accomplishment of my purpose; from the course of Nature and my own
							infirmities— I pray that I may persevere, and settle my new Course as a
							permanent practice— I rise between five and seven O’Clock; hitherto I
							have not been able to bring the time to a more precise regularity—
							Immediately after rising I take a cold bath three times a week— Read
							five chapters in the German Bible, and walk an hour and a half— On
							returning home I read again untill the hour for Breakfast, which is
							eleven— The remainder of the day I employ as heretofore— Receiving or
							paying visits, and writing or reading as occasion calls— Between ten and
							eleven at Night I retire to Bed— The effect of this alteration hitherto
							has only been to increase the quantity of my exercise and reading—and at
							least in equal proportion to diminish that of my writing.</p>
