							much occupied, and being withal a little indolent, I did not dress to
							attend at the launching of the ships officially; but I walked out at the
							hour between eleven and twelve, went over the Bridge, and took a stand
							upon the Quay on the Wasili-Ostroff immediately opposite the ship which
							was to be launched from the upper Admiralty. I met there a number of the
							American Gentlemen now here— <persRef ref="consolat-maximin">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Consolat</persRef> informed me that the launching was
							postponed, the Easterly winds that have prevailed these two or three
							days having reduced the waters of the river so low, that the ships would
							be in danger of striking the bottom on entering the flood, and of
							receiving damage; an accident which has happened on a former occasion—
							After waiting about half an hour, and finding that the crowds of people
							assembled were thinning away I returned home— The <persRef

								>Ladies</persRef> had been to see the launch from the lower
							Admiralty; at <persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fisher’s</persRef> lodgings— I found them already returned— The
							remainder of the day untill dinner time, and an hour after dinner I
							spent in writing to the President of the United States— <persRef
								ref="woodward-c2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Woodward</persRef>
							was with me an hour in the Evening, and consulted me with regard to
							affairs of <persRef ref="gray-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Gray</persRef>. I walked to the Summer-Gardens and cross’d the
							Bridge from them to the Apothecaries island.— Home between ten and

						<p><date>2. </date>It was an hour or two more after going to bed that I laid
							before getting to sleep— So it almost always happens when I sit up late
							reading and yet I cannot entirely break myself of it— The next
							consequence is, as happened this Morning, that it is nine or ten O’Clock
							before I get up— I walked out immediately to the Parade; but it was so
							late that all the passages to the admiralty Boulevard were already
							forbidden— The <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> was just
							mounting his horse as I came to the Palace Square— I went and took my
							stand near <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff’s</persRef>
							House, at a spot where all the troops would file off before me, and
							waited the Emperor’s return, which was in less than ten minutes— There
							were ninety-six Companies of Infantry, each of sixty men rank and file,
							marching in plattoon’s of twenty in a rank, and three deep— They formed
							I think six regiments— One regiment of Cavalry— the Hulans— Twenty
							troops of sixteen in a rank and two deep— six-hundred and forty men— And
							sixteen pieces of Artillery— Each piece drawn upon a car with six
							horses, and each two pieces fronting together preceeded by a troop of
							twenty horsemen— There was a plattoon of Horse Guards and another of
							Infantry, between which the Emperor took his stand with his suite, and
							which did not file off with the rest— The whole number of men on the
							parade was about six thousand foot and one thousand horse— I returned
							home between eleven and twelve O’Clock, and wrote to the <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris</persRef>
							dined with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>— After
							dinner I went with him to the Whitsunday ride to Catherinenhoff— It is
							precisely like that of the first of May— The <persRef
								ref="elizabeth-alexeievna">Empress</persRef> was there with her
							Sister the <persRef ref="katharine-amalie">Princess Amelia</persRef>;
							but no other of the Imperial family— It is the <persRef
								ref="constantine3">Grand-Duke Constantine’s</persRef> name-day, and
							it is said there was a fête at Gatschina which the Emperor went to
							attend— There were about six hundred Carriages, at the ride— We returned
							home about 9. O’Clock; after which I went and walked on the river Quay—
							The <persRef ref="law-jacques">French Ambassador’s</persRef> House was
							illuminated with a transparent cypher N. F. J. C. for <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon2">Napoleon François Joseph Charles</persRef>
							the names of the king of Rome who was baptized this day at Notre-Dame—
							There were some public buildings on the Wasili-Ostroff likewise
							illuminated, but that was on account <pb n="254" type="ms"/>of the Grand
							Duke— There was too much day-light for any illumination to make much
							show. I came home about eleven at Night, and read <persRef

						<p><date>3. </date>I am labouring so much against arrears in this book, that
							my Correspondence moves along very slowly— If I have an urgent, and long
							letter to write I leave the last day’s Journal for the next; which of
							course then gives me the narrative of two days to write instead of one—
							If I give the morning to my Journal, the Correspondence falls in arrear—
							I seldom can duly attend to both— This morning the <persRef
								ref="brzozowksi-tadeusz">Father General of the Jesuit’s</persRef>
							called on me before Breakfast, with a letter to be transmitted to
							America; which I took— He sat and conversed with me I believe more than
							two hours— He enquired about the numbers and character of our religious
							Sects in America; and when I had told him of them he lamented the
							multitude of Sects which had separated from the Holy Church, and urged
							with great earnestness upon me the necessity of unity as well as Union
							in the Church— I indulged him in his remarks, and purposely stimulated
							him to controversy, by contesting his positions and hinting the answers
							to his arguments.— I found him not so keen and skilful a
							controversialist as I should have expected— The necessity of a church,
							and of a head to the Church; the certainty of the seven Sacraments—the
							express words of Jesus Christ to establish transubstantiation; and the
							duty of celibacy for the Priesthood; he dwelt upon all these points with
							an appearance of strong conviction upon his own mind; and with no small
							shew of a desire to produce it upon mine— He apologized for talking to
							me on religious subjects; because it was a Holiday of the Church, and
							told me that their metropolitan the <persRef
								ref="siestrzencewicz-stanislaw">Archbishop of Mohileff</persRef>
							would administer the sacrament of confirmation to several persons this
							day between 12 and 1 O’Clock at Noon— I went at that time and saw this
							Ceremony performed— It has nothing peculiar in it; but was remarkable by
							the great solemnity of its forms— The Archbishop wore the embroidered
							robe, the Mitre and the Crosier which after having finished the ceremony
							he laid aside within the sanctuary, and he was conducted to the front
							doors of the Church by seven or eight subordinate priests, with like
							solemnity.— It was over in less than half an hour and I walked home. Met
								<persRef ref="pardo-benito">General Pardo</persRef> on the
							Boulevard. After dinner I went with <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> to the Summer Garden— It was the day for the walk
							there— Always much crowded the second day of the Pentecost Solemnities—
							It was excessively thronged—far more than on the same occasion last
							year— The centre alley was scarcely passable for the multitude— There
							were bands of music at two or three different spots of the Garden— The
							horns at one of them. We met <persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher</persRef> there, and after
							walking about half an hour he rode with us to Kammenoi-Ostroff and
							Chrestoffsky Island— About 10 at Night we came home— M<hi

					<div type="docbody">
						<p><date>4. </date>I had written yesterday a note to <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>, requesting a
							conference with him, and this morning found on my table a note from him
							appointing this day at Noon, for that purpose. I went accordingly at
							that hour— The Count as I entered told me that he had just received a
							Courier, who had pass’d through Paris; but who came from Madrid. An aid
							de Camp of <persRef ref="repninvolkonsky-nickolay">Prince
								Repnin</persRef> the Minister appointed from Russia to reside near
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-joseph">king Joseph</persRef>, but who never
							went there— The aid-de-Camp had left Madrid after the king, who had now
							arrived at Paris, after having seen his brother the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef> at Rambouillet.—
							I thanked the Count for the packets which he had sent me brought by
							former Courier’s— He said he understood they were packets which he
							should be sorry for; as they were to occasion my return home— I told him
							that they contained notice of my appointment to an honourable Office in
							my own Country— But that there was some tie which attached me so
							strongly to this Country, that I should probably not go yet. I then
							mentioned the situation of <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef>, which would make it impossible for me to embark for
							America, certainly untill very late in the Season, and probably before
							the next year— He asked me if the Office was of a nature which would
							admit of being long vacant— I answered that I considered it would not—
							That it ought to be filled as soon as possible, and as I could not go
							immediately to assume the discharge of its duties, I had written to the
								<persRef ref="madison-james">President of the United
								States</persRef>, requesting him to excuse me from accepting it, and
							to appoint another person.— He then said that he should this Evening ask
							the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef> permission to
							dispatch a Courier to Paris, and should probably send him in the course
							of the day after to-morrow— If I wished to send any letter or packet to
							the <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">Chargé d’Affairs of the United
								States</persRef>, he would be happy to forward it for me— I accepted
							his offer— And I then observed that from the idea which since my
							residence here I had formed of the importance and mutual benefit of the
							Commercial Relations between the United States and Russia, from the
							signal manner in which Russia had distinguished herself from all the
							other belligerent powers of Europe, in her treatment of the fair
							Commerce and neutral rights of America, and from a wish to increase and
								<pb n="255" type="ms"/>render still more advantageous the Commerce
							between the two Countries, the idea and desire had occurred to me of
							cementing still further their amity, by a Treaty of Commerce— I had
							suggested this idea to the American Government, and was now authorized
							to propose the Negotiation of such a Treaty, if it should be agreeable
							to the Emperor— I had thought it most advisable to make to him at first
							this verbal communication, instead of sending him an official note upon
							the subject— I requested him to consider it as confidential, so that at
							least it should be made known only where he thought it advisable; as I
							had communicated the knowledge of it to no person whomsoever.— The Count
							then asserted his great and long settled attachment to the United
							States— The desire which he had so many years entertained of favouring
							the American Commerce— It was not only a thing to which he was attached
							by Sentiment; but it had been with him long a maxim of policy. It was
							the interest of Russia to encourage, and strengthen and multiply
							commercial powers which might be the rivals of England, to form a
							balance to her overbearing power— Russia herself had not the advantages
							for it— She could not be a great naval power— Nature had in a great
							measure denied her the means— She ought then to support and favour those
							who had them— The propriety of extending this Spirit to the United
							States had become more obvious and strong, by the decay and
							disappearance of the old Commercial States— Holland for instance; how
							great a commercial Power she had been even within our memory. These
							Sentiments he had often expressed, with a strong sense of conviction to
							the Emperor, who had always received them well, and appeared impressed
							with the justice of them.— He referred me to <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris</persRef>
							for the proof that such had always been his system; or indeed to some
							other person even in preference to him— I observed that I was fully
							sensible of it my self; that I had frequently had the demonstration of
							it; and that I could assure him the Government of the United States were
							by no means ignorant of it— He said that he would lay before the Emperor
							the proposition, which he presumed would meet with no difficulty
							whatsoever, unless indeed there was one; which he did foresee— Which
							was, that in the violent and convulsed State of Commerce and of the
							World at this time, he hardly conceived it possible to agree upon any
							thing, if he might be allowed the expression, that had common sense in
							it— But however, at any rate, this need not prevent him and me from
							debating the subjects which might be interesting to the Commerce of our
							Countries and coming to an agreement if we could— This is precisely the
							object of the American Government— He said he would make his report of
							this Conversation to the Emperor, and in a few days would send and ask
							me to call upon him again— Then he enquired how affairs stood between
							the United States and France on one part, and England on the other— I
							told him briefly the actual state of things— He asked if <persRef
								ref="erving-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Erving</persRef>
							was now our Minister in France— I said M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Russell was the Chargé d’Affairs— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Erving’s mission was to Denmark— He said he had understood that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Erving had some arrangements to make in
							France which would detain him still some time at Paris— How were we
							likely to come out with England? I told him that it would depend
							altogether upon England herself— That my letters from America did not
							appear to indicate an expectation of War there; but that the late
							Accounts from England seemed to manifest hostile dispositions— He said
							he thought that was very probable— England no doubt would decide
							according to the ministerial opinion of what was most for her interest,
							and that would now more than ever be of adherence to their system— Their
							recent successes were calculated to give great strength to the Ministry,
							and to repress the opposition far more than had been seen for many years
							in that Country— Indeed he must say that for many years England had not
							exhibited such talents, as those by which she was now governed— The
								<persRef ref="wellesley-henry;wellington-arthur">two brothers
								Wellesley</persRef> had certainly proved themselves extraordinary
							men— Not only by the greatness and perseverance of the plan which they
							had pursued, and which seemed now to have at hand a great result— The
								<hi rend="italic">Denouement</hi>, in Spain and Portugal was
							apparently not distant— But by the success with which it was likely to
							be attended— If to be sure it was only to begin over again, they would
							not appear to have done much; but if the issue should be as important as
							now appeared probable, it would certainly be much to their credit— They
							would also be much elated by their successes, and he did not consider
							them as men, who would be restrained by any principle from any
							enterprize that they might judge to be expedient— I told him I did not
							rely at all upon the expectation that principle would restrain them; but
							there might perhaps be an interest to restrain them— If Spain and
							Portugal should be entirely evacuated by the French, the people there
							would as much as ever need supplies of grain and other provisions, and
							the English could hardly resolve to intercept them without famishing
							their allies, and even their own armies— The Count asked whether they
							could not obtain the same supplies from other quarters—particularly from
							the Coast of Barbary— I said that they undoubtedly had part of their
							supplies from that quarter; but it did not suffice; and if they lost the
							American market, there was none that could take its place; unless it
							were that of the Baltic; from Dantzick to Riga— And that I believed <pb
								n="256" type="ms"/>had been to a certain extent always open to
							them.— He said that their supplies from thence had been very small
							indeed— At least there had been scarcely any exportation from thence.—
							That I replied was at least their only resource; and if they opened that
							it could only be by coming to terms of accommodation with Russia— And if
							they made Peace with Russia, in the name of Heaven what motive could
							they have for quarreling with America— The Count smiled and said that it
							reminded him of something that had been said by another person, and
							which therefore he could not give as his own— It was, that there were
							Sea madmen as well as land mad men (des enragés de mer, comme des
							enragés de terre) and the English were the Sea mad men— Here we rested
							the matter for the present— I mentioned the launching of the ships,
							which had failed last Saturday, and I had heard was intended for this
							day— He said he believed it would be to-morrow— That the <persRef
								ref="chichagov-pavel">Minister of the Marine</persRef> had told him
							he should have him waked at six in the morning to give him the notice—
							But he had authorized the Notification to be opened at the Department,
							so that the foreign Ministers might be notified in time, without his
							having the trouble of being roused at that hour— He said the lowness of
							the Water at the lower Admiralty was the Cause of the launch having been
							postponed on Saturday; and that great complaints had been made at the
							time of the selection of that spot for a navy-yard on account of its
							being exposed to such accidents— On leaving the Count I called at the
								<persRef ref="law-jacques">French Ambassador’s</persRef> but he did
							not receive me— I then went to <persRef ref="stedingk-kurt">Count
								Stedingk’s</persRef>, and sat half an hour with him— This is one of
							the most agreeable and respectable old men that I ever knew— I had much
							interesting conversation with him— He told me that he expected in a very
							few days the vessel that was to take him home; and he was resolved to
							stay no longer. He gave me some account of the revolution which
							dethroned the <persRef ref="gustav-iv">late king of Sweden</persRef>, in
							which he refused to take a part— He said that they had published his
							name as having signed the memorial of the Officers, but he had not
							signed it; he had positively refused; but he was the only one— He had
							afterwards been prevailed upon by dint of intreaties from the <persRef
								ref="charles-xiii">present king</persRef> to negotiate the Peace,
							and put his name to that ignominious Treaty which ceded Finland— He had
							consented to come here for one year— He had given them one year more;
							but now it was time it should finish— He must go home to his family—
							After leaving him I called on M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Harris,
							and while I was with him <persRef ref="dana-francis2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Dana</persRef> came in— I returned
							home and wrote untill the Evening— Then I took a walk and was overtaken
							by the rain— Met and walked with <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Prevost</persRef>, who explained to
							me the cause of the delay to the reception of <persRef
								ref="chateaubriand-francois">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> de

							But that all he can do is to abdicate and retire— That he left Madrid
							with an escort of three thousand Men, and that he was obliged to sell
							his plate to pay the expences of his Journey to Paris— Schladen tells me
							that he has the gout; and talks of asking a leave of absence on account
							of his health— General Uwaroff said he had just come from the <persRef

						<p><date>9. </date>This morning before breakfast, <persRef

							called upon me with the information that he had just received from

							were dispatches for me from the <persRef ref="monroe-james">Secretary of

								<persRef ref="smith-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> R.

								<persRef ref="sparrow-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							except the arrival of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith— It says
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R. Smith comes out as Minister to

							the amount of it would be, that the Duplicates of the Dispatches which I
							had received by <persRef ref="erving-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Erving</persRef> had arrived— Half an hour afterwards I
							received the Cronstadt list with a letter from M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Sparrow mentioning that the Experiment <persRef
								ref="vibbert-william">Captain Vibberts</persRef> had just arrived—
							That the Captain had despatches for me, with special orders to deliver

							Harris dined with our <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
								>Ladies</persRef>— I myself dined at <persRef ref="stedingk-kurt"
								>Count Stedingk’s</persRef>, with a small company, among whom were

								ref="labenski-franz">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Labensky</persRef>— Count Stedingk told us that he had been so
							mortified at the necessity of signing his name to the cession of
							Finland, that he had made a vow, never to set his foot in that Country
							again— Of course he must go home by water— And now the English fleet
							were masters of the Baltic, so that his Government in sending a frigate
							for him, had sent to Admiral Saumarez to ask an order from him that she
							might freely pass and repass to accomplish this object— <persRef
								ref="saumarez-james">Admiral Saumarez</persRef> had sent the order,
							to all the ships and Officers under his Command, which he Count Stedingk

								<hi rend="italic">permission</hi> from a British Admiral, that he
							did not know but he should break over his vow, and go by land, as the
							least mortifying of the two— After dinner I walked in the Summer
							Gardens, where there was a great crowd of people. On returning home in
							the Evening, I read two Discourses of <persRef ref="massillon-jean"
								>Massillon</persRef>— On the manner in which Ecclesiastics ought to
							converse with the World; and on the necessity for Ministers to renew
							themselves in the spirit of their Vocation— And also the sections 23 and

							Christ— I have for several days been troubled with a cold.</p>

							years old which he was then and a man of forty-five which he is now, is
							not surprizing; but on putting some questions to him I soon remembered
							him and a variety of particulars relating to him— He had an <persRef

							the children of French Parents then living in London— His brother is yet
							in England— He himself has been more than twenty years settled in
							America— He says he saw me in New-York in the year 1785. of which I have

						<p><date>21. </date>After more than two hours of restlessness, finding that
							I had no prospect of sleep, I rose, dress’d myself and walked out to see
							the Sun-Rise, on the day of the Summer Solstice. I took my stand on the
							Quay opposite the Winter Palace; at the spot where last year on the same

								<persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Droshka to the Mint— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Fosh</persRef> the Englishman whom I had met there last Summer,
							shewed us again the same process that I had then seen— Excepting that
							then they were coining silver, and now it was copper—two Copeek pieces—
							The Copper is sent to the mint in a kind of Cakes perhaps a foot long;
							eight inches wide, and three inches thick— It is heated in a furnace,
							and pass’d six times successively <pb n="261" type="ms"/>through a
							press, between steel rollers, in which process it is flattened into a
							long sheet of the thickness of the piece to be coined. It is afterwards
							annealed—heated red hot, and plunged into a cistern of water to cool.—
							Then the pieces are cut out from the sheet. They are cleansed by putting
							about a thousand of them loose into a long bag, partly filled with saw
							dust, and then shaking them up for a few minutes together— Then the
							edges are rounded, and finally they are stamped— The machinery is in
							almost all respects the same that I had seen used in coining the silver—
							The sight of the Steam-engines, as usual mortified me; for I do not yet
							thoroughly understand their Construction— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Fosh likewise shewed us the chamber containing the dies, of
							all the antient medals. He had an impression on a thin copper leaf of a
							head of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef>
							lately struck, and an extraordinary fine likeness— Far the best I had
							ever seen— He gave us also impressions on pewter of <persRef
								ref="peter-the-great">Peter the Great’s</persRef> Beard money— A
							Coin which was delivered to be exhibited by those who upon payment of
							his tax or tribute had the permission to wear their beards— It has on

							and lips with whiskers and a beard, and nothing more of a face— On the
							other side under the imperial eagle, the year АΨЕ ГОДУ— (1705) I had

						<p><date>22. </date>At 12 O’Clock, Noon I went to the House of <persRef
								ref="gurieff-dmitri">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gourieff</persRef> the Minister of the Finances, whom I found in his
							Cabinet.— I mentioned to him the object of my visit which related to the
							two American Vessels, the Horace and Superior which have arrived at
							Cronstadt with prohibited Articles— He told me that he had received a
							petition respecting only one of them—the Horace— That the directions of
							the Law were precise; requiring that all prohibited Articles, upon their
							arrival at the Ports should be destroyed— But that in Consideration of
							the circumstances, that these vessels were not originally destined for
							this place, but had come under a sort of compulsion, he should in his
							report to the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, which he
							expected to make this day, recommend that permission should be granted
							for the re-exportation of the Goods, in the same vessels in which they
							were brought— For he could not undertake to decide this upon his own
							authority— That as to the exportation by land, which had been requested
							in the petition of the commercial house, he did not think it could be
							granted— For as the prohibition formed part of the system which had been
							established, for the regulation of Commerce during the present year, a
							departure from it in one case, might be alledged as a precedent in
							others which would make the whole system a mere nullity— I told him that
							I had not expected it would be possible to obtain the leave for
							exportation by Land— That in the Note which I had written to <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> on the subject, I
							had not asked it; but that I had asked, as I did not know that it would
							be incompatible with the Law of the Country, that the permission of
							re-exportation might extend to the employment of other vessels than
							those in which the Goods were brought— I said that in one of the cases I
							knew this would be a convenience to the owner, who had some time since
							ordered purchases of Russian Merchandizes, to an Amount of seven or
							eight hundred thousand Rubles, to be made here, and to be paid for by
							Bills, drawn here on foreign Countries— That a considerable part of the
							purchases had been made, and some of them might be exported by this
							Ship, if he could send away the hides in another— The Minister said that
							he would suggest this consideration to the Emperor, though he could not
							promise that it would be successful— He then assured me of his own
							disposition to favour as much as possible the Commerce of the United
							States with this Country, and observed that he had this day dispatched
							orders to Riga, for the admission of an American vessel which had
							arrived there from Lisbon— She having sailed from that Port in the month
							of April of the last year— I said I had addressed a note to Count
							Romanzoff also upon this case, which I presumed had been referred to
							him— He said he believed not— He did not recollect that Count Romanzoff
							had referred to him any note concerning this affair from me— And indeed,
							said he, excuse me for giving you the hint; but in any of these cases,
							if there is any facility which I can afford your Country men, and in
							which you take an interest, if you will apply directly to me, the
							business will be more expeditiously settled than by a Note, to Count
							Romanzoff— Because if it goes to him you know, it must be treated <hi
								rend="italic">diplomatically</hi>, and then the affair takes quite
							another course. Even now respecting this vessel at Riga, perhaps it may
							occasion further questions in future; but that is a matter all
							settled—the orders are dispatched— I told him that as officially, I
							could as a matter of right correspond only with Count Romanzoff, I had
							addressed my notes <pb n="262" type="ms"/>of course to him, and had
							forborn to call upon him M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gourieff, from
							the apprehension of being importunate— But that having now his
							permission, I should certainly take the liberty of applying directly to
							him, and thanked him for the assurance of his good dispositions in
							regard to the American Commerce— After this we entered upon general
							Conversation, and the Minister manifested an earnest curiosity to be
							informed of the State of our Relations with Great-Britain and with
							France— I told him much the same as I had said to Count Romanzoff and to
							the Emperor— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gourieff expressed a very
							high opinion of the present British Ministry; and particularly of their
							energy.— I acknowledged that they had lately been favoured with an
							extraordinary career of success; and I could not deny that they appeared
							entitled to the credit of energy— But there was some part of that energy
							which I believed would ultimately prove very calamitous to their
							Country— They were abusing the power of making paper money, untill its
							depretiation had already run down to 30 per Cent— They were accumulating
							the load of paper to support the burthen of the War, and the Ministers
							in Parliament had frankly avowed that the War could not be carried on
							without it— He said that the Bank appeared to have issued not more than
							twenty-two millions sterling— That they were already sensible of its
							dangers and seeking a remedy for it; which he believed they would find—
							I said that in addition to the Bank paper, there was the enormous mass
							of the debt, to be considered as paper too— He thought not—a Paper which
							bore interest he said never weighed upon the Circulation— It was private
							Capital, like lands or houses— Paper could be oppressive only as it was
							a representative without a Constituent— A representative of Specie when
							there was no Specie to represent— As to the English funding system, he
							admired it as one of the most extraordinary inventions of the human
							Understanding— There was not one of the mechanical Inventions for which
							the English were famed, and which he thought more deserving of
							admiration than that.— Recurring to our affairs with France he said he
							had heard our vessels were now admitted there—and that a more friendly
							disposition to us had been lately professed than before— I told him I
							had heard so; but that to be candid I placed as little dependence upon
							the French Government as upon the English— He smiled and appeared to be
							of the same opinion— On leaving M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gourieff
							I called at the <persRef ref="law-jacques">French
							Ambassador’s</persRef>, but found he was removed to his Summer residence
							at Kammenoi-Ostroff— After dinner I rode out with the <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
								>Ladies</persRef> and <persRef ref="gray-francis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gray</persRef>— We went over to the

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Krehmer</persRef> on going out
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Krehmer as we returned but did not

								Everett</persRef> for the use of his shower Bath this Evening; but
							on returning home I found myself so unwell that I postponed it untill

							Gourieff told me that he had received a copy of my note to <persRef

								>r</hi> Harris at the Summer-Gardens— Met <persRef
								ref="pardo-benito">General Pardo</persRef>, returning home from the
							Theatre where he had been to see, he did not know what— He had paid so

							just from Riga pass’d by us, and turned back to tell me some of his

							landed below all the Bridges and at the End of the Quay, just above the
							lower Admiralty. In returning we had floated down part of the time,
							while the boatmen were singing in concert the National Airs; with a pipe
							resembling a Clarinet— a tambourine, and a pair of cymbals— There were
							eleven of the rowers; and when they sang they sat in two lines face to
							face crosswise of the boat, each upon an oar, and their feet resting on
							the benches. They are all in uniform and wear plumes in their hats.
							Their song is always the same, and appears to consist only of three or
							four Notes. It was about ten in the Evening when we returned— I had
							received in the morning a number of letters and newspapers from Boston,
							brought by the Henry, <persRef ref="u">Captain Harris</persRef>, who was
							himself here— And I had not had time to read them all— I was up <pb
