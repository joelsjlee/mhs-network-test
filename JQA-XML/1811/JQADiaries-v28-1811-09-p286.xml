						<p><date>1. </date>I began this morning the first of a series of letters
							which I intend to write to my Son <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef>, upon subjects of serious import. I have had this
							project in contemplation several Months, and have hitherto done Nothing—
							My intention is extensive, but not well defined in my own mind. I
							reflected upon it so much this morning that I wrote but little. I had an
							arrear of this Journal too to fill up, which I did not accomplish
							entirely— Walked an hour before dinner round <persRef
								ref="stroganov-alexander">Count Stroganoff’s</persRef> garden— And
							as long after dinner, in the botanical garden— Evening visits from
								<persRef ref="jenison-franz">Count Jenison-Walworth</persRef>,
							Bavarian Secretary of legation, and <persRef ref="vongremp-anton">Baron
								Gremp de Freudenstein</persRef> Counsellor of the Legations of the
								<persRef ref="frederick-i-wurttemburg">king of Wurtemberg</persRef>.
							I was not at home— I read Sections 40 and 41. of <persRef
								ref="robinson-thomas">Robinson’s</persRef> character of Christ, and
							two Sermons in the British Preacher— On hearing the word of God, and on
							the folly of mocking at Sin.— I also read a Tale by <persRef
								ref="demontolieu-isabelle">Madame de Montolieu</persRef>; from the
							German of Musens; called Melechsala, or the language of flowers.</p>

							two or three days for England.— He asked me to procure for him a
							Courier’s Passport; but having no despatches to send, I could not comply
							with his request— As there are great advantages of convenience in
							travelling with Courier’s Passes, all the Americans who go away by land
							are extremely desirous of obtaining them— But considering that it would
							be an abuse to apply for this special Pass, with out having any
							despatches to send, and merely for the private accommodation of
							individuals, I have always refused it unless when I had occasion for a
							messenger, and was therefore obliged to deny M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Moses.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ashton is going
							immediately to Riga— I found from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Plummer
							that by a mistake my letters and despatches which I sent for him on
							Saturday were delivered not to him, <pb n="287" type="ms"/>but to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher, who afterwards wrote me a note,
							saying that he had sent them down to Cronstadt— <persRef ref="u">Captain

								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> dined below; the first time since her Confinement—
							After dinner I paid a visit at <persRef ref="laval-jean">M<hi

								ref="demaistre-joseph">Count Maistre</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="brancia-francesco">Chevalier Brancia</persRef> there; and
								<persRef ref="labenski-franz">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Labensky</persRef>—but a company smaller than usual— <persRef
								ref="laval-ekaterina">Madame de Laval</persRef> was absent—went
							yesterday to Pavlofsky, and had not returned— She came home while I was
							there— I asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laval some questions about
							the two institutions of Cadets— One of them is to educate Officers for
							the army, and the other, Officers for the Navy— The army Cadets are
							under the direction and management of the <persRef ref="constantine3"
								>Grand Duke Constantine</persRef>— They are taught the manual
							exercise in great perfection, and little or nothing else— The Marine
							Cadets are under the inspection of <persRef ref="krusentern-adam"
								>Captain Krusenstern</persRef> and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Laval— Of the Captain for the practical part, and of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Laval, for the part of Instruction— They
							enter from nine to eleven years of age, and remain there six years,
							after which they are obliged to serve as marine Officers, with the
							appointment of Midshipmen— The three last years of their attendance at
							the school, they are <hi rend="italic">bas-officiers</hi>, and <hi
								rend="italic">gardes-marines</hi>, and when the sea is open and free
							to them, are sent out on board frigates to cruize in the Baltic to learn
							the practice of Navigation— This part of their duty now is confined to
							the Navigation, between this City and Cronstadt.— They are taught the
							mathematics with great assiduity, and many of them make great and
							surprizing proficiency in them. They are also taught the French, and
							English languages, and some of them German— But the greatest attention
							is paid to the French— There are thirteen teachers of that language
							alone— But then there are seven hundred pupils, belonging to the
							Institution— Their numbers occasion the greatest inconvenience— And
							another heavy misfortune is the depretiation of the paper money— The
							funds remain the same as they were in the time of the <persRef
								ref="catherinethegreat">Empress Catherine</persRef>; while the money
							has depretiated to the rate of four for one— The masters have salaries
							of two hundred roubles a year, when they ought to have two thousand—
							Good Masters therefore are not to be had— Notwithstanding which this is
							the best naval school in the Country— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Laval promised me that he would some day accompany me, and shew me the
							buildings and arrangements of the Institution— While I was there a heavy
							thunder-shower came up— I returned home in the midst of it— After it was
							over <persRef ref="gray-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									>r</hi> Fisher</persRef> and <persRef ref="jones-thomas3">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones</persRef> came out from the
							City— Jones and Fisher pass’d the rest of the Evening with us untill
							Midnight— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray stayed to lodge here—
							Jones is soon going away, and asked me for a Courier’s Pass, or a letter
							to <persRef ref="smith-john2">J. S. Smith</persRef>— I promised him the
							letter; and the pass, if at the time of his departure I should have
							occasion to send despatches.</p>

						<p><date>4. </date>I sent home the papers which the <persRef
								ref="law-jacques">French Ambassador</persRef> had lent me yesterday,
							with enquiries whether he could see me this day and at what hour? He
							sent me word he should be at home the whole day, and would receive me
							when I pleased— I called upon him about one in the afternoon, and
							thanked him for the loan of the papers— I had then some Conversation
							with him upon general subjects— His papers came by a Russian Courier to
								<persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>—his own
							Courier, whom he has for some time expected has not yet arrived— He
							complained that his Courier’s were all dispatched to him late. I asked
							him if he was still as confident of Peace as the last week— He said
							yes—at least there could be no War now—it was too late— He had heard
							indeed that the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor
								Napoleon</persRef> had made a promotion upon his birth day, 15.
							August of fifty brigadier-generals, and several Generals of division at
							once; which could hardly be true— There had very probably been however a
							promotion, and it might be unusually numerous; for there had been none,
							since the last Campaign against Austria— It was said too that the
							Emperor Napoleon had had a conversation with the Russian Ambassador,
								<persRef ref="kurakin-aleksandri">Prince Kurakin</persRef>— That was
							very probable; but as the substance of it had been reported to this
							Government by Prince Kurakin; and as neither the Emperor nor Count
							Romanzoff, had told the substance of it to any body, it was evident
							there could have been nothing in it of an <pb n="288" type="ms"
							/>unfavourable nature; for if there had been they certainly would have
							spoken of it— The Ambassador’s reasoning must go upon the principle that
							by any thing of an unfavourable nature, he means express War— He said
							that when the Russian Courier came from Paris the Emperor Napoleon was
							going to Compiéque, and perhaps to Holland; which would further increase
							the suspicions and alarms here. But he would be returned so soon after
							his departure that they would not have time to be alarmed long— He had
							heard too that <hi rend="italic">the Generals</hi> had been appointed
							here; but this was merely a rumour— On the whole I saw that the General
							himself was not perfectly sure how affairs actually stood, and that
							although he really believes the Peace will continue, he is not
							altogether without his doubts— I asked him to forward by his next
							Courier a letter for <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell</persRef> at Paris, which he
							promised, requesting me to have it ready and sent it to him by to-morrow
							Evening— I returned home and began the letter, but was obliged to go
							into the City to dine with <persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher</persRef> at 5. O’Clock— I
							therefore left the letter unfinished— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Fisher had a Company of about twenty persons; mostly Americans; but
							among them were <persRef ref="kosloff-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Kosloff</persRef> the Consul-General, and <persRef
								ref="svininpavel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Swienin</persRef>
							the adjoint Consul, who are going out to Philadelph<unclear>ia</unclear>
							in the Dorothea— <persRef ref="sverchkov-aleksei">M<hi

								ref="ellisen-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Eliesen</persRef> were to have been there; but were prevented by the
							preparations for their departure. The vessel is to be ready to go
							to-morrow four or five days sooner than they had expected— In the
							Evening I stop’d to see <persRef ref="pitt-london">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pitt</persRef>, the Chaplain of the
							English Church, but he was not at home— I called on <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>,
							with whom I found <persRef ref="bainbridge-william">Commodore

								<persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> came into my Cabinet about one, and asked me to look

							Jones and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray.— My eldest Son, and my

								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> were baptized at Boston, by
							my worthy friend <persRef ref="emerson-william">Emerson</persRef> now
							deceased— I think the ceremony of baptism as performed in our
							Congregational Churches, much more proper and rational than that of the
							English Church— I have both in this instance and in that of my Son
							George recurred to the ceremony in this form, only because I thought the
							rite itself essential, and because the forms of the English Church, are
							the most like to those which I have considered as the best, and to which
							I myself was born, that I could have access to— The motives for my
							preference of our own form of baptism are 1— Because it is done in
							Church, a place devoted to Divine worship, and in the presence of the
							Congregation— It is therefore more solemn and more public than a private
							baptism can be; both of which are characters peculiarly well suited to
							this act. 2. Because it is much more simple, performed only with a
							previous and a succeeding prayer of the Clergyman, without any
							entanglement of creeds and controversial doctrines. 3. Because the
							father of the Child is the only Sponsor, and solemnly undertakes, what
							it is his duty to perform; that is to educate the Child to virtuous and
							Christian Principles.— While the Sponsors of an English Christening, are
							often Strangers, who are never likely to have any controul over the
							child, and therefore rashly enter into solemn engagements, the
							performance of which will never depend upon themselves.— But the rite
							itself, the solemn dedication of the child to God, I prize so highly,
							that I think it ought never to be deferred beyond a time of urgent
							necessity.</p>

							upon European Courts, and into the Company of Nobility, is a very
							ridiculous and not very proud feature of their character— There is
							nothing in my estimate of things meaner than Courting Society where if
							admitted, it is only to be despised— Yet such is this vicious Appetite
							for great acquaintance, and so little delicacy has it that an American
							Minister abroad can preserve himself from sharing in the scorn which it
							excites, only by adopting some such general rules as these— I gave M<hi

							Cronstadt, and one from a Sailor, claiming assistance— M<hi

						<p><date>26. </date>I called again at eleven O’Clock this morning upon

							found him at home— He had some musicians with him, and violins and a
							base-viol, and music Stands, so that he was preparing for a family
							Concert— I invited him and all his family to dine with us next Monday—
							They agreed to come— I asked permission to send a letter to <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef> by his next Courier— He said he should send one on
							Sunday— He spoke of the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor
								Napoleon’s</persRef> being at Compiegne, where he said it was
							probable he would stay longer than had been expected— That he would
							perhaps go to Holland, but probably not to Hamburg— He mentioned
							paragraphs in the English papers saying that he was trying to keep
								<persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> in
							Office here, but that he would certainly be turned out— He also
							mentioned the English Sloop of War, and the Store-ships at Revel— I
							asked him if they were gone— He said they were gone out of the harbour;
							but were still anchored below— And the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor Alexander</persRef> had told him his naval force had not a
							superiority adequate to drive them from thence— He asked me if I had any
							late Accounts from the United States— I told him, none— That scarcely
							any American vessels had arrived here within the last Month. And that
							his countrymen I believed were in part the cause of it— How so?— A
							number of privateers under french Colours had taken stand at the passage
							of the Sound, which was now not blockaded by the English; one of those
							privateers had taken to my knowledge two American vessels coming here,
							and those which were going from here were considered as in great danger
							of being taken by them also— He said it was the difficulty of
							discriminating between our vessels, and the English which made ours
							liable to capture— And the English themselves boasted of the use they
							made of our flag— He had but a few days ago, seen a paragraph stating
							that <persRef ref="saumarez-james">Admiral Saumarez</persRef> had
							permitted two hundred vessels to come under <hi rend="italic">American
								Colours</hi> from Gothenburg into the Baltic— I told him undoubtedly
							the English favoured this deception as much as they could, for the sake
							of exposing our vessels to be taken for theirs and exposed to the same
							capture— It was their interest to prevent the discrimination, but it was
							the interest of France, as well as ours to make it. I then repeated to
							him the means by which it is so easy to make the discrimination,
							wherever there is an American Minister or Consul— He asked me if I would
							furnish me with a list of those which had sailed from here this Season,
							and which I considered as unquestionably American— That he would
							transmit it to Paris; and then if any of them should be taken they might
							be more speedily liberated. I promised to furnish him such a list, and
							he said I had better send another copy of the same list to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell— I mentioned to him that among the
							American Vessels, arrived at Cronstadt, there were three with false
							papers, which we had detected, and which had been seized and would be
							confiscated— But said he—I do not mean to speak of it by way of
							complaint— I do not wish to trouble any body— But between us two there
							must be many more than three vessels under American Colours, which have
							come with false papers, or which at least have come from England— Well,
							between us two said I, and speaking with the same confidence as you
							express, there are many American vessels, which I believe came from
							England; but they all came in Ballast— Of loaded vessels, I assure you:
							not that there have been <hi rend="italic">none</hi>; but to my full
							perswasion scarcely any— As to vessels coming in Ballast, the Government
							here hardly ask any questions—they come to export Russian produce and
							manufactures; which is an object of so much importance here, that they
							do not trouble themselves about the flag.— I understood him to say that
							he had seen a list of fifty-five American vessels that had arrived with
							Cargoes, and of thirty-three, in Ballast— He also said here had been
							within a few days a seizure of one or more loaded vessels which came
							under the Pappenburg flag— I have no doubt that in asking me for the
							list, besides the motive which he avowed to me he had that of collecting
							information upon the subject, according to instructions lately received—
							I know that <persRef ref="lesseps-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lesseps</persRef> has received such instructions— <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Longuerue</persRef> walked with
							me, as far as my door.— Soon after returning home I went out again to
							see the annual exhibition at the Academy of Arts— It is much inferior to
							that of the last year— The paintings are all very bad— There was a
							subject of National History the Czar <persRef ref="wasilievitz-john">John Wasilievitz</persRef> giving a poor soldier to drink from a
							helmet, treated by several of the Students at the Academy of what they
							call the 4<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> age, or Class— The four prize
							pieces in painting, and the four in basso-relievo were exhibited— There
							were a few historical and fancy pieces exposed by persons to obtain the
							rank of Academician; and a few Portraits— One of the best pictures there
							was a repose of <persRef ref="suvorov-alexander">Suworow</persRef>; by
								<persRef ref="svininpavel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Swienin</persRef> the Gentleman who is gone to America, as adjoint
							Consul, and with whom I dined at <persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher’s</persRef>— A visit to this
							place is however always interesting and agreeable, on account <hi
								rend="italic">of</hi>
							<pb n="294" type="ms"/>of the models from Antique Statues, which are
							always exhibited— They are numerous, and many of them well executed— But
							the Print-shop, and particularly the very bad prints exposed for sale in
							one of the halls seems an incongruity— The indifferent Pictures hanging
							in the Halls is another— I observed again the full-length Portrait of
							the <persRef ref="paul-i">Emperor Paul</persRef>, which I had noticed
							last year— It is well painted—but the air of dignity attempted to be
							given him, with his countenance and person, is as incongruous as his
							purple tunic, and Imperial Crown and Robe, with an enormous pair of
							Jack-Boots, armed with Spurs.— I met <persRef ref="schladen-friedrich"
								>Baron Schladen</persRef>, <persRef ref="jouffroy-georg">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jouffroy</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="krehmer-benedict">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> B.
								Cramer</persRef> at the Academy. The Baron has a leave of absence
							for six months, on Account of his health, and told me he should go in
							about three weeks— I went from the Academy to <persRef
								ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Julien’s</persRef>, but he was not at home— I called on <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>,
							and found <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ecky</persRef>
							with him— He arrived last Evening with <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson</persRef> from Archangel— He
							shewed me a letter from <persRef ref="dimon-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dimond</persRef> at Gothenburg
							mentioning that <persRef ref="colvin-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Colvin</persRef> had published a piece in America,
							claiming to be the author of the letters to <persRef
								ref="armstrong-john">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Armstrong</persRef> and <persRef ref="turreau-louis">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l:</hi> Turreau</persRef>, which <persRef
								ref="smith-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R. Smith</persRef>
							in his pamphlet had published as his own— I requested M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris to have a list of vessels made out,
							which I had promised to the French Ambassador, and told him for what
							purpose— He promised to have it done immediately— I then called upon the
								<persRef ref="bray-francois">Chevalier de Bray</persRef>, and
							invited him and Count Jenison to dine with us on Monday, which they
							promised—the Chevalier told me that there was a verbal invitation to the
							Corps Diplomatique, to attend at the Consecration of the new Church of
							our Lady of Kazan, to-morrow morning at ten O’Clock— On returning home I
							found that one of the Aids of the <persRef ref="demaisonneuve-joseph"
								>Master of Ceremonies</persRef> had been to give us the same Notice—
							I sent word of it to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris, and walked
							home— I asked the Chevalier de Bray whether he knew what were the
							particulars of the Conversation held on the 15<hi rend="superscript"
								>th:</hi> of August between the 567, and <persRef
								ref="kurakin-aleksandri">Prince Kurakin</persRef>— He said the
							Emperor began by speaking of the Accounts from the Russian army, and
							told the Prince, that although General Kutuzoff had claimed the Victory
							at the late affair of Rustshuk it was evident by the result that he was
							not entitled to it, since he had been since obliged to abandon Rustshuk
							itself, to repass the Danube, and to give up every thing that the
							Russians had gained in the last Campaign. That the reason why he,
							Napoleon had claimed the victory at the Battle of Essling was because he
							had maintained his position upon the Island, and the head of the Bridge
							on the opposite shore, so that he was enabled to rebuild his Bridge and
							pass again, as soon as he was in force— That he could not help being
							surprized and somewhat uneasy, at seeing the Emperor of Russia, of whose
							Judgment and honour he had the highest sense, weaken so excessively his
							army where he was actually at War, to increase his armaments in Poland
							where there was no danger of his being attacked— That with regard to the
							Duchy of Oldenburg, that was included in the Confederation of the Rhine—
							That the Duke had not fulfilled the Obligations resting upon him in that
							capacity— That he Napoleon might therefore have put him to the Ban of
							the Empire, and considered it as an affair of internal concern, in which
							no foreign power had a right to interfere— But out of regard and
							consideration for the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor of
								Russia</persRef> he had offered, and was still ready to give ample
							indemnity to the <persRef ref="peter-frederick-louis">Duke of
								Oldenburg</persRef>, and he asked Prince Kurakin if he had powers to
							conclude a Convention upon the subject—the Prince said he had not, upon
							which the Emperor said that he was ready to make the arrangement
							whenever it should please the Emperor of Russia. But if he had not the
							highest Confidence in that Prince’s Justice and honour he should have
							been suspicious that he meant to attack him, and in such a War he did
							not know upon what ally Russia could depend. This discourse naturally
							struck the Russian Ambassador with surprize, and alarm; but the <persRef
								ref="maret-hugues">Duke of Bassano</persRef> immediately afterwards
							gave the Ambassador the strongest assurances that it was not intended to
							indicate any hostile intentions; the substance of it was again repeated
							in a Circular despatch from him, which has been sent to the French
							Ministers at all the Courts where the Russian protestation of last
							Spring had been sent.— I employed the whole Evening in writing to
							anticipate the loss of to-morrow, which I saw would be unavoidable.</p>

							Stair-carpet for the Priests to pass over; upon which we had frequent
							and earnest notices not to encroach.— We were placed, after sundry
							removals to and fro by <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>, and the <persRef
								ref="naryshkin-alexander">Grand Master of Ceremonies

							At one stage of it the Priests, followed by the Emperor and Imperial
							family, went in procession out of the Church, and marched round it,

							to whom the Church is dedicated— At another the four ends of the Church
							at the East one of which hung a full length image of the Virgin, and the

							brush at the end of a long pole—the kneeling was twice repeated, and

								Russell</persRef> to go by the <persRef ref="law-jacques"
								>Ambassador’s</persRef> Courier on Monday— Walked before dinner, and
							dined in the City with <persRef ref="bussche-calmor">Count
								Bussche</persRef>, the Westphalian Minister— There was a Company of
							about twenty-five persons— The Ambassador, <persRef
								ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Julien</persRef> and most of the other foreign Ministers— In the
							Evening I paid a visit, to <persRef ref="lesseps-jean;delesseps-rose"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Lesseps</persRef>— The Consul was very busy, preparing
							dispatches to go by the Ambassador’s Courier— He told me he had dined a
							few days since in a Company where there were a great number of
							Americans, and said he was convinced there were a great number of real
							Americans from the United States here, though there were people enough
							here, ready to say they were all English— I entered into details of
							Conversation with him to convince him that almost all the American
							vessels that came here loaded were Bona-Fide from America, and with
							Cargoes of American property; he said he gave full credit to my
							Statement, and should report accordingly to his Government— He shewed me
							his account of the vessels arrived at Cronstadt of which there were 88
							Americans with Cargoes and 33. in Ballast—there were only 11. with
							Cargoes, under other Colours, all of which he told me he held
							unquestionably for English property— Every vessel loaded at Gothenburg
							he considered as English property— I noticed the State of the Exchange
							between this Country and England, and the fact that no Insurance could
							be obtained in England upon goods shiped for this Country, as proof that
							very little English property was really imported here, which he
							allowed—this last fact he said he had not known before, and that he
							should not fail to avail himself of it— After I came home I passed the
							Evening idly</p>

						<p><date>29. </date>I continue to read an hour or two in the morning before
							rising from bed— This morning I finished the first volume of the
							Bibliothéque des Philosophes— Containing 1. A preliminary discourse, by
							the anonymous editor of the Book. 2. A Discourse upon <persRef
								ref="plato">Plato</persRef>, by the <persRef ref="fleury-claude"
								>Abbé Fleury</persRef>. 3. Reflections upon <persRef
								ref="dacier-andre">Daciers</persRef> Discourse upon Plato, and his
							Doctrine of Plato— It is anonymous and seems to be the work of a
							theologian alarmed at the excess of Dacier’s admiration for Plato; for
							fear it should encroach upon Faith— 4. A Dedication to <persRef
								ref="louis-xiv">Louis 14</persRef>. by Dacier. 5. A preface to his
								<persRef ref="pythagoras">Pythagoras</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hieroclesofalexandria">Hierocles</persRef>— 6. Life of
							Pythagoras— 7. His Symbols and an explanation of them. 8. Life of
							Hierocles. 9. The golden verses of Pythagoras, in Greek with a French
							Translation— The golden verses are the work of <persRef
								ref="lysisoftaras">Lysis</persRef> a disciple of Pythagoras—
							Excepting them and the symbols, both of which do not take 30 pages, the
							whole of this volume is preliminary— I find here a good deal of what I
							was looking for—the ideas of the Grecian philosophers on the Supreme
							being and the immortality of the Soul— As <persRef ref="harris-levett"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef> has not sent me
							the list which he had promised, and I was obliged to send my packet for
							the <persRef ref="law-jacques">Ambassador’s</persRef> Courier this
							Evening, I was obliged to employ a great part of the day in making out
							the list from my own papers— I could therefore only begin a letter to
								<persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>— I read <persRef
								ref="robinson-thomas">Robinson’s</persRef> character of <persRef
								ref="judas-iscariot">Judas Iscariot</persRef>, and a Sermon in the
							English preacher, on the difference between the characters of a good,
							and of a righteous man. It rained a great part of the day, but I walked
							on the Mall from my door to the Karpoffka.</p>

							reduction of the quantity of my writing— In this month however I have
							commenced two new undertakings, the one indeed dependent upon the other,

							second is the investigation of mythologies— The last fortnight I have
							observed the practice of reading two or three hours in the morning
							before I rise from Bed— But there is too much indolence and luxury in
							it— I have therefore seldom risen, untill between nine and ten—the rest
							of the day employed as before— Since the cold and foul weather has
							become common, our visitors have been less numerous— The Evenings are
