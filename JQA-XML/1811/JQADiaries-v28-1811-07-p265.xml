									>r:</hi> Plincke</persRef>, my Land lord, called upon me, and
							informed me that on Saturday last he had concluded his contract for the
							sale of the house, and came now from the <persRef ref="kozodavlev-osip"
								>Minister of the interior</persRef> to enquire whether it would be
							convenient for the tenants to quit the house on the first day of July
							Old-Stile; that being the time when it would be wanted; as at that time
							the lease of the house in the stead of which this one was purchased,
							would expire— I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Plincke to
							present my compliments to the Minister of the interior, and inform him
							that unless he sent me a Police Officer to turn me out, I could not
							engage to go at so short notice. I reminded him of the lease which I had
							untill the first of June of next year; and that I had sent to him two
							months ago when there had already been some talk about the sale of the
							house, and when I had an opportunity of engaging another— That he had
							then told me the contract was broken off, and that the house would not
							be sold— He admitted the fact and had no very good apology to offer for
							himself— He asked whether he might answer that I would take the subject
							into consideration— I told him that if he had sold the house I did not
							know that I had any thing more to discuss with him about it. That I was
							ready and had been from the first of the month to pay him the
							half-year’s Rent in advance— That to accommodate the service of the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> I would quit the house
							as soon as possible; but that I claimed the benefit of whatever the laws
							of the Country would allow me upon my lease— He said he did not suppose
							it would be expected that we should go out; and that they had only sent
							to enquire whether it would be convenient. As however it is necessary to
							provide as soon as possible for this contingency, I sent <persRef
								ref="u">Waldstein</persRef> immediately to <persRef
								ref="tatischeff-dimitry">Count Tatischeff</persRef>, the owner of
							the house I had seen in April on the S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
							Petersburg or Apothecary’s island, and which is still untenanted— From
							the answer he brought I sent to engage the house for the remainder of
							the Summer; four months from the 1<hi rend="superscript">st:</hi> of
							July Old-Stile— <persRef ref="welsh-william">Captain Welsh</persRef> was

									>r</hi> Laval’s</persRef> in the Country; with a company of
							about forty persons, Ladies and Gentlemen— The <persRef

								ref="derayneval-maximilien">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

						<p><date>25. </date>I was waked about 2. O’Clock this morning, and from that
							time untill seven had no repose— I then slept between one and two hours
							longer— The weather, the unceasing day-light; a disordered stomach, and
							nervous agitations arising from the pressure of many deep anxieties upon
							my mind, all contribute to break my rest, depress my Spirits, and
							dissipate my time— When shall I recover even my ordinary assiduity?—
								<persRef ref="montreal-f">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Montreal</persRef> was here this morning, and brought some samples
							of Cambricks— <persRef ref="hazard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hazard</persRef> came as I had requested at half past
							ten— I went and introduced him at <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai"
								>Count Romanzoff’s</persRef>— He had taken with him his Commission,
							and a French Translation of it, but the Count did not look at them. He
							said he thought it would be sufficient for me to write him a note,
							mentioning the appointment, and the necessary document would be
							expedited, he believed from the Department of foreign Affairs—certainly
							not from the Chancellor’s Office— But as <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Borel</persRef> was at the head of the
							Department of the Consulates, if there were any other formalities
							necessary, he would send him to me to give me notice of them— For
							between you and me said the Count there can happen nothing but what will
							be rightly done— As M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hazard speaks
							scarcely any French, and the Count no English, he did not hold much
							conversation with him— He said turning to me, “Je crois que nous allons
							vous enlever le <persRef ref="vonderpahlen-friedrich">Comte
								Pahlen</persRef>, mais ce sera pour le remplacement <pb n="270"
								type="ms"/>Then laughing he added that it seemed to be a kind of
							destiny for Count Pahlen to visit all the Sovereigns of America, and if
							another such a power should arise in that Hemisphere, he did not know
							but that they should charge him with commencing the diplomatic relations
							of Russia with it— But Count Pahlen himself seemed to be much afraid of
							this mission to Brezil, for he had accepted it on the condition, or with
							the earnest sollicitation that it might be limited to two years— The
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> had read his
							letter; and had been diverted at his concern— It was however determined
							in the course of two years to provide some place for him here at home,
							and so the commission would be sent him according to his own
							inclination.— And hereafter he was persuaded the Count would thank him
							for having given him the means of becoming so extensively acquainted
							with both the American Continents— As to such places as Cassel, or
							Stutgard, what could a Russian get by an appointment to them— It was
							easy to visit them, and great numbers did visit them without having
							diplomatic missions— But Count Pahlen on his return will have seen, what
							scarcely any Russian can have seen, and none to the same advantage— I
							said I hoped he would at least have occasion to remember the Country
							with pleasure— He said that with regard to our part of it he certainly
							would; as all his letters very fully testified— They were strongly
							expressive of his satisfaction with his situation there.— The Count then
							enquired whether I had any recent intelligence of the state of our
							affairs with England— I said I had received the Official Account of the
							American Captain, of the action between the two ships of which he had
							doubtless heard— I had not seen the Account of the English Captain— If
							it should give a statement materially different from the other in regard
							to the facts, I could not say what would be the consequence; but if the
							facts were as stated by <persRef ref="rogers-john">Commodore
								Rogers</persRef>, the British Government I supposed would disavow
							their officer’s conduct, as they have done in so many cases before— In
							the present case however there was the difference, that their ship and
							men had been the greatest sufferers— He said he had seen Accounts from
							England, with the Gazettes down to 28 June— That there appeared to be
							great agitation in the public mind there; on account of that Event, and
							it was said a Squadron commanded by an Admiral York had been ordered to
							sail for America.— But then it appeared the struggle in Spain was all to
							be gone over again— Very differently from what had been so lately
							expected— It had been thought that if the War in that Country was not
							entirely at an end, at least the English had obtained a decisive
							preponderancy— But now the French army under <persRef
								ref="soult-nicolas">Marshal Soult</persRef> was reinforced and
							concentrated, and <persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Lord
								Wellington</persRef> had been obliged to raise the Siege of Badajos,
							in order to draw all his forces together for another Battle— Now the
							Event of another general action was to be waited for— I said that from
							the late Speeches of the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor
								Napoleon</persRef>, and of his <persRef ref="bachasson-jean"
								>Minister of the Interior</persRef>, it appeared that France did not
							give up the game for lost in Spain— But that it remained to be seen
							whether the French armies there would be reinforced— He said that
							reinforcements had certainly been ordered— That troops had marched from
							Toulon and Marseilles, and he was informed by despatches from the
							Ambassador at Paris, <persRef ref="kurakin-aleksandri">Prince
								Kurakin</persRef>, that after a review lately of several Regiments
							at Paris, by the Emperor Napoleon, they immediately received marching
							orders; and were gone to Spain— The Count told me that he had taken this
							place in the Country, in order to be near the Emperor; but he found it
							so inconvenient for the transmission to and fro, of all the papers, that
							must pass under his inspection, that he should give it up after next
							week— On returning home, I gave M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Hazard
							the papers I have received from <persRef ref="mumford-david">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Mumford</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wolcott-oliver">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Wolcott</persRef> of New-York, respecting the Fox, a vessel which
							they wish to get admitted at Archangel— I wrote and sent the Note to
							Count Romanzoff requesting an exequatur for M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hazard— After dinner we had a visit from <persRef
								ref="demaistre-joseph">Count Maistre</persRef>— I walked round by
							the lower bridge, and up the opposite shore over the upper Bridges— When
							I got home I found the <persRef ref="law-jacques">French

								ref="fisher-miers">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

						<p><date>26. </date>I have this day been married fourteen years, during
							which I have to bless God, for the enjoyment of a portion of felicity
							resulting from this relation in Society, greater than falls to the

							of <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife’s</persRef>
							Constitution, the ill health which has afflicted her much of the time,
							and the misfortunes she has suffered from it— Our Union has not been
							without its trials; nor invariably without dissensions between us— There
							are many differences of Sentiment, of tastes and of opinions in regard
							to domestic economy, and to the education of children between us— There
							are natural frailties of temper in both of us; both being quick, and
							irascible, and mine being sometimes harsh— But she has always been a
							faithful and affectionate wife, and a careful, tender, indulgent and
							watchful mother to our children, all of whom she nursed herself— I have
							found in this Connection from decisive experience the superior happiness
							of the marriage state over that of celibacy, and a full conviction that
							my lot in marriage has been highly favoured— I completed this day a

							Hazard</persRef>, should be immediately recognized as Consul at

							answered one of these Notes, and left the other for to-morrow— The whole
							morning was engrossed by one of those occasional occupations which so
							often divert me from business of more urgency— I found in an American
							Newspaper, a return of the whole population of the United States, by the
							last Census of 1810. and I engaged myself in calculations, resulting
							from a comparison of it with the returns of 1790. and 1800. The
							proportion of increase between the second and third Census, is exactly
							the same as that between the first and second— It is between 36 and 37
							per Cent in ten years; rather more than three per Cent, and very nearly
							31 per 1000. annually.— I do not think it possible that this proportion
							should continue even for the next ten years— It is a phenomenon which
							the world never witnessed before, and which probably will never be seen
							again— The state in which we have been the last twenty years is too
							happy a Condition for human nature long to endure— Blessed be God for
							it; and may he still protract it, notwithstanding the ingratitude and
							other vices by which we have forfeited almost the right to ask his
							favour— May he also protract the portion of virtue in the people, which
							has hitherto contributed to preserve the blessings they have enjoyed.
							May he continue to build up a State, which shall exhibit a clear and
							permanent improvement in the existence of social man. When I reflect
							upon the capabilities of that people, and that Territory, I have no curb
							to enthusiastic hope, but in the recollection of the follies and vices
							which have proved so fatal to mankind in all former ages, and which
							threaten to destroy all the glorious prospects of my Country— Let me
							implore the aid of Heaven to meditate further, and to some useful
							purpose on this subject. so that this may not be a day lost.— I walked
							over the Bridge’s and Kammenoi Ostroff to the opposite Bank of the
