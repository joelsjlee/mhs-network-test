						<p><date>3. </date>The <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">french
								Ambassador</persRef> sent this morning to enquire whether I was at
							home, and afterwards paid me a visit— His object was to talk with me
							about these American vessels, the papers of which are still detained. He
							began by some general observations on the considerable Commerce by
							American vessels during the last Season in the Ports of this Country— I
							told him that it had been very considerable; greater than in any former
							year; and that the principal increase had been at the Port of Archangel
							the Navigation to which had been much less interrupted than that to the
							Ports in the Baltic.— And then, said he I suppose your vessels have done
							a great deal of business here on English Account— I told him that was a
							mistake— That the American vessels which had come here were directly
							from America, and returned directly thither— But how happens it then
							said he, that several of them have been sequestered, or at least that
							their admission has been suspended—why, said I, smiling, the credit of
							that is attributed to you— That is to say, said he, that we are supposed
							to have required that a strict examination should be had.— I assured him
							that I had sent to the Government here a list of the vessels, which I
							knew to be American, and the Cargoes of which I had no doubt were
							American property, and on American Account— That of some of these
							vessels I knew the Captains, Owners, or Supercargoes, personally—that by
							others I had received late Letters from the United States, and that as
							to them all, I had such Evidence of their American character, as left no
							doubt upon my mind. As to the vessels which had arrived here about the
							same time under other than American Colours, I had nothing to do with
							them, and knew nothing about them; but that there were no English
							vessels which came now here under false American Colours, for the plain
							reason that they knew they would immediately be detected, seized and
							confiscated— I then mentioned to him the cases which had occurred here
							last Winter, and the effect which had been produced by them in England—
							He asked where the American vessels could get such quantities of sugar
							as these had brought— I told him that our own Country produced sugar;
							particularly Louisiana and parts of the State of Georgia— Besides which
							we had sugar from S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Domingo, from
							Brazil—from the Spanish West-India Islands and from South-America— This
							led us into a conversation upon the Antient Colonial System of the
							European Powers, in which I gave him my opinion, that the issue of this
							War must eventually demolish it— He asked me what the state of our
							Affairs now was with England— Whether in case the orders in Council were
							not revoked before the 2<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi> of February, it
							would not be a state of War; and said he was glad to perceive that the
							desire of the french Government manifestly was to harmonize with us. He
							expressed much concern at the distress with which Commerce in general is
							afflicted, and his Hope that England would at last come to some terms,
							from which it would find relief— There was however nothing material said
							in this Conversation but what had in substance been repeatedly observed
							between us in former Conversations— For which reason I abridge most of
							the particulars— As he took leave he repeated his invitation for my
								<persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson;smith-william-steuben;everett-alexander;gray-francis"
								>family</persRef> to his Ball for next Friday Evening— Early this
							Evening the Ladies had a visit from <persRef ref="betancourt-anna"
								>Madame de Betancour</persRef> and her <persRef
								ref="betancourt-adelina;betancourt-carolina">two
							daughters</persRef>— They took Catherine with them to supper at our
							neighbour the <persRef ref="stroganov-anna">Baroness
								Strogonoff’s</persRef>. I read <persRef ref="massillon-jean"
								>Massillon’s</persRef> Sermon upon the day of the Epiphany; the last
							in the volume of the Advent Sermons— Far inferior to that which
							immediately precedes it, and altogether in the Bishop’s usual style—
							There is as much of imagination as of argument in his exposition of the
							Star in the East, the emblem of Truth, upon the excellence of the wise
							men, who came to worship Jesus at Bethlehem, and upon the wickedness of
							the Priests of Jerusalem who rejected him— I also read <persRef

								ref="shadrach">Shadrach</persRef>, <persRef ref="meshach">Meshech</persRef> and <persRef

						<p><date>8. </date>I wrote an answer to the letter from the <persRef

								Ambassador’s</persRef>— A great part of the Company assembled late,
							and retired very early— The children danced Polish dances, Country
							dances and French Dances— But there appeared a coldness and reserve
							about the party which I had never observed on like occasions before— The
							Chinese Shadows were duller than usual— I saw <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> there and
							delivered <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

							of communication to him.— The children had their supper between 11. and

							leaving the remnant of the company still dancing, but the Ball moving on
							heavily— It seemed as if the Adventure of <persRef ref="u">General

							appeared to enjoy it the most, and who was in the highest Spirits was
							<persRef ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t:</hi> Julien</persRef> the Austrian Envoy, an old Rake, whose
							desire has long outlived his performance— He told me that he wanted a
							chair upon rollers, to be moved round the room from lady to lady, and to
							coquette with them all— He said he delighted above all things in
							Company, and was very fond of amusing himself with making People
							ridiculous.— I said that was an amusement more agreeable to <pb n="208"
								type="ms"/>to the giver than to the receiver— He said that it was
							generally returned, and the laughers were sufficiently laughed at
							themselves— That he liked as well to be the subject of ridicule himself
							as to make others so, especially when it was done with wit; but that
							this disposition had once cost him a thrust through his arm— In his
							youth he used to draw, and was fond of making caricatures; he had made
							one of a friend, which was very striking, and he must do himself the
							justice to say very ingenious— He had given it to another friend in
							great secrecy, to shew to nobody; but he had shewn it to others, untill
							it came to the person himself who was caricatured— He thought proper to
							take it amiss et il avoit raison— He challenged me to fight et il avoit
							raison—he ran his sword through my arm et il avoit raison— We embraced
							each other et nous avions tous deux raison— But I told him that as soon
							as my arm was well I would set about making another Caricature of him—
							Such, said the Count by a grave conclusion—are the follies of <hi
								rend="strikethrough">the</hi> Youth. The Count very honestly and
							sincerely exaggerates a little to himself more than to others the
							keenness of his own wit— He brags of every thing that a Courtier and a
							soldier is vain of; and has not yet discovered that the levities which
							in youth may be graceful, are at his years the best of subjects for
							Caricature— I told him that with his tastes he would not want materials
							to work with here— He said no—that every where— At S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg, at Vienna, and no doubt at
							Washington there were objects enough for this amusement— But here it was
							true there were des ridicules trés saillans; and then pointed me to one
							of an officer, notre chevalier là, qui danse les Allemandes sans les
							savoir. The Counts Spirits were probably the gayer, for the coldness
							which appeared between the Ambassador and his Russian guests.</p>

						<p><date>15. </date>I called at 12 O’Clock this day upon the <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">french Ambassador</persRef>, according to
							our appointment, and found <persRef ref="fagnani-federigo">Count
								Fagnani</persRef> with him— He was giving an account of his journey
							yesterday to Gatschina— I presume he is a traveller for publication. He
							soon went away, and I mentioned to the Ambassador the case of the
							American vessels, and the difficulties in the way of their admission,
							concerning which he had questioned me when he last visited me, and which
							I had then told him were ascribed to him. I then observed to him that
							some of our American vessels, though not of this last list had met with
							objections for having been provided with Certificates of origin given by
							the French Consuls in America, as I was informed an official declaration
							had been made by the <persRef ref="champagny-jean">Duke de
								Cadore</persRef>, the french Minister of foreign Affairs that all
							such papers must be forgeries, and that the french Consuls in the United
							States gave no such Certificates— He said he recollected that I had
							mentioned the same thing to him some Months ago; but that he had even
							since then received again from his Government, a formal declaration, and
							had in fact communicated it to the Government here, that the french
							Consuls in America issued no such documents, and that all such papers
							were therefore forgeries— I told him that this was certainly a mistake—
							That I had within a few days received the copy of a paper, of which I
							expected shortly to receive also the original; which with his permission
							I would read to him— It was a certificate of origin, signed by <persRef
								ref="geraud-alexis">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Geraud</persRef>
							the French Consul at Boston, dated the 31<hi rend="superscript">st:</hi>
							of October last, and to which was added a Certificate from <pb n="210"
								type="ms"/>the same person that he had been in the constant practice
							of delivering Certificates of Origin when required, and upon
							satisfactory proof, excepting during the time of the Embargo— The
							Ambassador took minutes of this paper, which I told him I had brought to
							shew him, not officially, because it was only a copy, nor from the
							expectation that any others of my Countrymen here would be injured by
							producing any such paper in future; for after the warning they have had
							I supposed those who had them would be careful to keep them in their
							desks; but from the expectation that his own Government, when informed
							of its mistake, would take measures, which its own credit and dignity,
							as well as the honour of its public Officers would seem in such a case
							to require— But, said he— suppose our Consuls have given these
							Certificates in disobedience of their Orders?— I said I thought it more
							probable as well as more liberal to the character of those public
							Officers, to suppose, that if such orders had been dispatched to them,
							they had not been received, or that they were expressed in terms to
							which the Consuls had not given the Construction intended by them, than
							that they had violated their duty by acting in direct violation of their
							orders— But that even were this the case, it became a question between
							the Officer and his Government, which could not affect the rights,
							reputation or property of persons who had received their certificates—
							If they had violated their duty, their Government might say so to the
							world—might recall and punish them—might disavow their acts, and
							discredit them after due notice— But this was a very different thing
							from declaring their real signatures to be forgeries— It was merely a
							question of fact—did they, or did they not give the Certificates— If
							they did, and you declare they did not, it is precisely the case of an
							individual, who should deny his own hand-writing to a promissory Note—
							And said I, the dishonour of such a procedure must fall ultimately upon
							the Officer himself, whose Government falsifies his acts, or upon the
							Government which thus gratuitously discredits its own Officer— I could
							not suppose such an intention in the Government of France— He said that
							to be sure, there could not be two opinions upon a case so clear
							considered as a question of <hi rend="italic">law</hi> or of <hi
								rend="italic">morality</hi>— Consider it Monsieur l’Ambassadeur said
							I as a question of <hi rend="italic">honour</hi>— As a question between
							men of <hi rend="italic">honour</hi>—what would be the answer then?— He
							smiled and said, precisely the same— He added that as by the late
							measures in France, it appeared that the Government was inclined to come
							upon good terms with the United States, he was persuaded that they would
							do Justice in this case— I told him that I thought this was a case which
							his Government would consider as altogether distinct from any
							consideration of good or bad terms between the two Nations— That it
							implicated the honour of his Government itself, and that even if we were
							in the midst of a War, the falsification of a french Officer’s signature
							by his own Government, knowing it to be true, would not be justifiable,
							but an act of injustice which France would disdain— He said it was very
							true, and that as the credit due to the Consul’s signatures was
							conferred by those who appointed them, it was properly not just that
							others should suffer if they were guilty of a disobedience of orders—
							But said he; it seems you are great favorites here— You have found
							powerful protection; for most of your vessels have been admitted— I told
							him that they had; but that it was after a delay of three months, and
							after their papers had been taken from the Commission of neutral
							Navigation, and had undergone a very strict examination before the
							Imperial Council. After this Circumstance had occurr’d, I had written to
								<persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>, and
							sent him a list of the vessels, for which I undertook to answer that
							they came from the United States, and of which I had no doubt but that
							their Cargoes were American property— All of these, had now been
							admitted excepting four, which I expected would soon be, as their cases
							were equally clear with the rest.— I then added, that in the first
							Audience that I had of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor
								Alexander</persRef>, he had expressed a determination to favour the
							Commerce between the United States and Russia; which he well knew was a
							Commerce highly advantageous to Russia— And that he had at the same time
							manifested to me his strong desire to harmonize with France, and his
							attachment to his alliance with her— That ever since that time Count
							Romanzoff, had uniformly and invariably assured me that such was his own
							system of policy—to adhere to the French alliance, and to favour the
							Commerce with America— That with regard to <pb n="211" type="ms"/>the
							French Alliance, this was a subject with which as an American it was not
							my business to meddle; but that it was my duty to support to the utmost
							of my powers the rights and interests of our Commerce with this Country,
							and I hoped therefore that the Emperor would persist in his favorable
							Sentiments towards it— In fact I considered the two things as perfectly
							reconcileable, together— I hope they will be more reconcileable still,
							said he, as France and the United States will come to a better
							understanding with each other— But after all, you have had a very
							advantageous commerce this last year— I am told you have had more than a
							hundred vessels at Archangel— As great a number here— And now between
							twenty and thirty of these last arrived— But, said I, you are to
							consider, that, thanks to you, we have had scarcely any part of the
							Continent of Europe open to us— We have had only the Ports of Spain and
							Portugal where you are not the masters, and Russia— For you made Denmark
							and Prussia shut their doors against us, without a shadow of reason for
							it— You could not however have much Commerce with Denmark, said he— I
							replied that it was considerable, as long as goods were allowed to be
							introduced from Holstein into Holland and France, through Hamburg by
							land— He finally said that it appeared further measures were to be taken
							in France after the 2<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi> of February, and he
							hoped they would lead to the relief of Commerce generally, which was now
							so excessively oppressed.— I left the Ambassador after a conversation of
							about an hour, and went to <persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher’s</persRef> with the two
							Passports which I received yesterday— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Fisher not being at home I left them at his house and walked on the
							Quay, the Fontanka, and through the Newsky Perspective home—the
								thermometer—<persRef ref="reaumur-rene">Reaumur’s</persRef>, being
							at 20. degrees below 0.— I felt the effects of this cold more by
							rheumatic pains in the Evening, than while I was walking— The leisure of
							this Evening I employed in finishing the perusal of <persRef
								ref="levesque-pierre">L’Evesque’s</persRef> History of Russia, and
							in beginning that of <persRef ref="bossuet-jacques">Bossuet’s</persRef>

							the public examination of the Studies of the young ladies, who are about
							to leave the School, which is called the Institute of the Order of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Catherine— These Cards were brought by
							the Aide des Cérémonies who brings the Notices for the Courts. the
							invitations are given by order of the <persRef ref="mariafeodorovna"
								>Empress Mother</persRef> who is the patroness of the institution—
							The examination was fixed for two days successively; the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> and 9<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of
							February at 9. in the morning— But we did not receive our Cards; untill
							late yesterday, to attend this day, at 10. O’Clock— We went at that
							hour, in full dress, as to a Court— The Building of the Institution is
							on the Fontanka— We were introduced to a very large Hall, which we found
							crowded with Company— Convenient seats, in the most distinguished places
							were assigned to the foreign Ministers— The <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">Ambassador</persRef>, Counts <persRef
								ref="bussche-calmor">Bussche</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="schenck-hans">Schenk</persRef>, <persRef ref="vonblome-otto"
								>Baron Blome</persRef>, and <persRef ref="watzdorf-carl">General
								Watzdorf</persRef> were there— <persRef ref="luxbourg-charles">Count
								Lüxbourg</persRef>, and most of the Secretary’s— <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Everett</persRef>, and <persRef ref="gray-francis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gray</persRef>, attended. <persRef
								ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Smith</persRef> did not. None of the Imperial family were there— But
							almost all the Ministers of State; and principal nobility of the
							Empire.— The Examination of this day had just begun when we arrived— A
							printed Synopsis or Programme, of the examination was distributed among
							the persons attending, with a list of the young ladies who have finished
							their education, and are going out. The objects upon which the
							examination turned on the first day were 1. Religion; Sacred History of
							the old and new Testament, and Moral Philosophy— 2. Universal Geography,
							preceded by an abridged Course of mathematical Geography. 3. Universal
							History, Antient &amp; Modern, and the History of Russia in particular—
							4. Russian Literature.— On the second, that is this day 5. Arithmetic.
							6. The <pb n="213" type="ms"/>German language 7. French literature 8.
							Experimental Philosophy. 9. Singing and Music. 10. Dancing— Besides
							which were to be presented some essays of Compositions and of
							Translations, and a variety of Specimens of drawing, embroidery and
							other works of the young Ladies— The Examination of Arithmetic was in
							the Russian language, and I could not understand it— The instructor
							however put the questions, and the young ladies answered by making
							cyphered figures with chalk on a large black board standing in a frame
							like a looking-glass, and which could be seen by all the Audience; and
							by explaining the cyphers as they made them— The Examination of the
							French and German Language was made by Books in French German, and
							Russian, which the young Ladies brought to persons of the
							Company—requesting them to open the book to any passage which they
							pleased— The Lady then took the book, at the passage indicated to her,
							and read three or four sentences from the Book, translating it as she
							went along, into French, German, or Russian, according to the Language
							of each Book— For this examination it is obvious there could be no
							special previous preparation, and it was one of those of which they
							appeared to acquit themselves the most indifferently— One of the Ladies
							brought me a French Book, and translated into a Russian a passage at
							which I opened it for her— But I was not qualified to be her judge— Not
							understanding a work of her translation— But it is an excellent mode of
							examination to ascertain proficiency. The Examination of French
							Literature was in Logic and Rhetoric— The whole of this was the
							repetition of a lesson by heart, and it had been well learnt by them
							all— The instructor put all the questions, and the Ladies answered
							verbatim from their books— They were chiefly logical and rhetorical
							definitions; with examples of syllogisms—enthymems—epicherema’s, and the
							principal rhetorical figures— Most of the Specimens were in verse, from
							the french Poets; and the young Ladies generally, excepting that they
							spoke not quite loud enough recited remarkably well— Then followed
							experimental philosophy; the examination of which was likewise in
							French, and managed by the Instructor— An Air-pump and an electrical
							machine were brought in, and a table with a Leyden jar, and vials of gaz
							with several other of the instruments used in courses of Lectures upon
							this Science. the Instructor who in appearance and manners was something
							of a caricature, asked questions upon the properties of
							matter—extension, cohesion, divisibility, mobility, porosity &amp;c—and
							as the young Ladies answered, desired them to shew the proof of the
							answer by an experiment.— the gravity and elasticity of the air, with
							samples of oxygen, hydrogen, and muriatic acids and gazes were thus
							proved, and an account and description of the barometer and thermometer
							were given: but many of the experiments were unsuccessful— one of them
							consisted in inflaming some Spirits of wine and making them spout up
							from a glass fountain— The young lady and her teacher both burnt their
							fingers in making this experiment, and he spilt some of the burning
							fluid on the floor, which he undertook to extinguish with an empty
							decanter, and which burnt for two or three minutes— He extracted the Air
							by the pump from the two hollow hemispheres of brass, to shew the
							gravity of the atmosphere by their adhesion— He gave them to the young
							lady, to shew that they could not be pulled asunder— She gave one end of
							them to Count Luxbourg and held the other herself— At the first and
							slightest pull the hemispheres parted.— The young Lady without being
							disconcerted, put the two parts of the Ball together again; placed it
							upon the pump; extracted the air effectually, and then shewed that the
							hemispheres could not be pulled asunder— So that the failure of the
							experiment at first afforded the strongest proof that she knew how to
							make it. But the teacher who seemed quite as much inclined to exhibit
							his own skill as that of the young Ladies, had taken so much time with
							his chemistry and Air, that there was none left for Electrical
							experiments— After this the select part of the Auditory pass’d from the
							great Hall into an adjoining room, where the drawings, paintings,
							embroidery and other works were exposed— The drawings were in crayons,
							indian ink, or water Colours—most of them framed and copied from
							handsome Prints— The name of each young Lady was marked by a ticket,
							upon her performance, and all the names of the workers to the large
							pieces of embroidery which had occupied several hands— All these samples
							were extremely well done— The specimens of writing and composition were
							numerous but I accidentally did not see any of them— In another
							adjoining room there were tables laid and a cold Collation served—
							Cordials were also carried round to the Company by Servants— After about
							half an hour pass’d in these rooms we returned to the great Hall; where
							a new arrangement of the Seats became necessary as a larger area was
							indispensible for the exhibitions— A Piano forte was placed in the
							middle of the Hall, but the performer upon this was a man; as were the
							whole band of accompaniment— The young Ladies sung— Airs— Duets—
							Recitative, and Choruses— The best singers were of course chosen for the
							solitary performances, which were in a high style of excellence— The
							whole was <pb n="214" type="ms"/>uncommonly good— The whole examination
							was concluded with dancing— The Russian dance— the Spanish Fandango with
							Castagnets— A Polish dance— the Shawl and Garland Dances, by three or
							four, and the whole number joined in Choirs— The Walse, was not danced—
							The number of young ladies who leave the school, is eighty one— There
							are four Classes each of an equal number— They are all very accomplished
							and graceful, but almost all not handsome to say the least— The
							prettiest and most accomplished of them all is a <persRef ref="u"
								>Countess Chaillot</persRef> an orphan daughter of a french
							emigrant— We came home between three and four O’Clock, and in the
							Evening amused ourselves with Cards—retiring very early, and very weary
							to bed.</p>

						<p><date>22. </date>Visit this morning from <persRef ref="plumer-ernestus"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Plummer</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Weeks</persRef> of Portland—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Weeks came in one of the vessels
							whose Cargoes have been admitted in part, and he wants to procure
							admission for the rest. I told him I expected to see <persRef
								ref="campenhausen-baltazar">Baron Campenhausen</persRef>, who had
							promised to call upon me this morning, and that I would speak to him
							upon the subject— I waited for the Baron however untill half past four
							O’Clock, and he did not come— This is the fashion of doing business
							here— As I have experienced on many occasions— In my application to the
								<persRef ref="balashov-alexander">Minister of Police</persRef>, in
							behalf of <persRef ref="u">Waldstein</persRef>, he promised me that the
							matter should be settled to my satisfaction, and that he would inform me
							of it— To refresh his memory, I sent Waldstein himself to him with a
							written Note; and he renewed his promise. The last time I dined at
								<persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff’s</persRef>, I
							reminded him of the matter; which he said he recollected very well; and
							that he would write to me about it in one or two days— I have not heard
							from him since— Baron Campenhausen proceeds exactly in the same manner—
							Every time I see him he gives me the fairest promises; which according
							to the doctrine of <persRef ref="hudibras">Hudibras</persRef> are
							words—[“]wind, too feeble instruments to bind.” It is useless to
							complain of this fashion— To promise and not perform is their polite
							mode of refusal— In my walk before dinner, I met a crowd of People upon
							the Quay of the Neva opposite the Winter Palace, and a very large
							procession of Sleighs and Carriages. The Ice-Hills on the river were
							also very much thronged— At 11 at Night we all went to a Ball at Count
							Romanzoff’s, given on the occasion of <persRef ref="volkonskaya-zinaida"
								>Princess Zénéïde Beloselsky’s</persRef> marriage with <persRef
								ref="volkonski-nikita">Prince Volkonsky</persRef>. All the Corps
							Diplomatique was there; but the company was otherwise not numerous— Less
							than a hundred persons in all— I walked a Polonaise with <persRef
								ref="laval-alexandra">Madame de Laval</persRef>; and on my
							mentioning to her that I had been at the examination of the S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Catherine School, she asked me whether I
							was there the day, that <persRef ref="rumiantsev-serge">Count Serge
								Romanzoff</persRef> (brother of the <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Chancellor</persRef>) had gone up and
							offered himself in marriage to one of the young Ladies— It was not the
							day when we were there— The Count was all last Winter in a state of
							total insanity; and though now so much recovered as to be out again in
							Company, still has occasional fits of mental disorder— The invitation
							this Evening was only to <hi rend="italic">supper</hi>; and being a full
							dress Ball was solemn and dull as they always are— The supper was served
							about 3 in the morning. We came home about four. The <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">Ambassador</persRef> did not stay to
							Supper; which was as usual a subject of remark.</p>

						<p><date>24. </date>This instead of yesterday is the day which closes the
							butter-week: the name of which indicates its difference from the Roman
							Catholic Carnaval. It is a sort of prelude to lent, for by the Greek
							Church they are allowed to eat butter, and every thing else during this
							week, excepting flesh. It is also a week of popular festivity, which
							increases as the week draws to an end— The weather this day being
							extremely fine the crowds of People in the processions of Sleighs and
							Carriages, on the Quay of the River, and at the Ice-hills was immense.
							There were three Mascarades given; one of which began at 11. in the
							morning, and finished at 2. P.M. the two others began at 9. in the
							Evening, and the music ceased precisely at Midnight. There was a French
							Play, which began at Noon, and another at 6. in the Evening. The full
							rigour of the Russian lent commences from this Midnight— The Roman
							Catholics have two days more of Carnaval, and begin their lent on
							Wednesday-morning— Which is Ash-Wednesday. The whole System is reckoned
							from Christmas to Easter— It is all a fortnight earlier this year than
							it was the last. <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Boucher</persRef>
							<pb n="215" type="ms"/>called to see me this morning, but I had not
							risen, and did not see him— I read <persRef ref="massillon-jean"
								>Massillon’s</persRef> Sermon upon the Ambition of Clergymen which
							is very good, but in which there are some singular ideas— I have often
							heard of the resistance which it was understood the Romish clergy were
							bound to make to their elevation to the episcopal dignity— The nolo
							episcopari is proverbial to express a resistance of form which is always
							to end with compliance— But Massillon very strenuously urges that it
							ought to be a serious resistance, founded upon a deep &amp; sincere
							conviction of unworthiness— This is a hard saying, and I find nothing to
							warrant it in the scriptures— If indeed a man is to measure his
							qualifications by a standard of ideal perfection his estimation of
							himself will always be, and ought to be humble— If a man compares
							himself with others who might be his competitors, the greatest danger
							doubtless is that he will overrate himself; and against this error he is
							certainly bound to be upon his guard— But as to an absolute duty to
							underrate himself; to think himself the most unworthy of a dignity of
							which he is really the most worthy, I neither understand it as a
							principle nor believe it as a fact— Clerical Ambition is indeed a deadly
							sin; but a Roman Catholic Bishop could not easily consider it in its
							deepest Colours— He therefore views it only in the light of individual
							ambition; desires of selfish aggrandizement; without reference to that
							of the Church— I read also <persRef ref="robinson-thomas"
								>Robinson’s</persRef> characters of <persRef ref="esther"
								>Esther</persRef>, <persRef ref="haman">Haman</persRef> &amp;
								<persRef ref="mordecai">Mordecai</persRef>, with the Conclusion of

						<p><date>27. </date>I called upon <persRef ref="campenhausen-baltazar">Baron
								Campenhausen</persRef> this morning according to his appointment,
							and had a conversation with him of nearly two hours; which began upon
							the subject of the American vessels, whose admission has not yet been
							ordered, but which soon extended over the whole field of European
							Politicks— As to the vessels he made me many apologies, all very lame,
							for not having finished the business before, which he hinted to me was
							not owing to him but to some other person— He made me as many promises
							that the business should be finished in a very few days; which promises
							being precisely the same as those that he has made me more than ten
							times for these three months I am at no loss to estimate how much they
							are worth— He has a manner of talking which I have learnt to understand,
							and which by the help of a translation conveys his meaning clearly
							enough— It is to promise and to apologize in vague and general terms;
							with obscure hints to excite the idea of difficulties in other quarters
							which proceed altogether from himself— “I was for taking these cases
							separately from all the rest—and it is very strange— it is a great
							mortification to me that they have been so long delayed— I cannot
							conceive why they could not have been decided by themselves.— But then
							on the other hand, they say cases under similar Circumstances not
							American ought to be treated in the same manner— And then the false
							papers—and then the sort of <hi rend="italic">ménagement</hi> . . . and
							then the caution that was to be observed to shew that there was no
							change of system; and then all the clamour about this great convoy from
							Gothenburg—and then all these things put together—and the different
							opinions—and the different interests. . . But as for every thing that
								<pb n="216" type="ms"/>depends upon me that has been done; and I
							will see if I cannot have the matter brought on from another quarter— I
							urged to him that the vessels had now been kept nearly four months
							without a decision; that the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef> himself and <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai"
								>Count Romanzoff</persRef> continually had assured me of the
							determination of this Government to favour the American Commerce, and I
							had made it an invariable principle to meddle with no other— That I
							considered it my duty to respect the Laws of the Country; but it was
							also my duty to maintain the rights of my Country, and the lawful
							Commerce of my Countrymen. That I knew the <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">French Ambassador</persRef> had interfered
							against us in these cases, and before the admission of the greatest
							number of these vessels, I had supposed that political considerations
							might have some influence in the business— But now, after the principal
							step had been taken— “Between ourselves,[”] said he, [“]I can tell you
							that that difficulty is entirely subdued—there is no question of that
							kind left.[”]— I mentioned to him the case of the Eliza, at Archangel,
							belonging to <persRef ref="thorndike-israel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Thorndike</persRef>, and concerning which <persRef
								ref="dana-francis2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Dana</persRef>
							made application to me— She actually came directly from the Island of
							Teneriff; and part of her Cargo has been sentenced to be confiscated by
							the Commission of neutral Navigation, because some of her papers bore
							the same signatures, with those which had been found to be false on
							board the vessels which were condemned last Summer, and which were
							English vessels, from English Ports, but pretended to have cleared from
							Teneriffe— I said I had not seen the Papers; but that from my personal
							knowledge of the owner, and of his agent, now here, and from the solemn
							assurances which I had received from him, I had no doubt but that the
							vessel came from Teneriff; that she had not been in England, and that
							the Cargo was entirely American property— The Baron said that he did not
							know why the Commission at Archangel, had felt itself bound by the
							decisions of the Commission here, in cases the Circumstances of which if
							similar in one or two particulars were different in many others— The
							Teneriffe vessels condemned here, had Cargoes, not at-all suited to the
							place from which they pretended to come— There were declarations of the
							Sailors, that they came from elsewhere— Some of their papers had
							signatures which were known to be false—those which were produced in the
							case of the Eliza, were indeed the same, as two of those which had been
							suspected in the papers of the condemned vessels, but that was only one
							of a variety of grounds upon which the condemnation had ensued— He took
							a minute of this case, and said he would see what he could do about it.—
							I asked him whether it would be expedient for me to write a Note to
							Count Romanzoff on the subject, and he said he thought it would. There
							was the case of the Rapid too, about which <persRef
								ref="stieglitz-ludwig">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Stieglitz</persRef> was talking with the Baron, when I went in— He
							said that if in the course of two or three days, the Commission should
							not get through, and admit the remainder of that Cargo, he would thank
							me to send him a short note with a statement of the case, and he would
							see to it— I told him it was a great hardship that genuine Americans
							should be put to so much embarrassment to defend themselves against the
							charge of producing false Papers— That men of honour and integrity found
							both their reputation and their property jeopardized by such
							proceedings— I then referred him to the Declaration of the French
							Government concerning the Certificates of Origin of the French Consuls
							in the United States; which Declaration I had repeatedly assured him was
							altogether contrary to the fact— I could now shew him documents to prove
							my assertions; upon which I shewed him the Copy of <persRef
								ref="geraud-alexis">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Geraud’s</persRef> Certificate which I received from <persRef
								ref="joy-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Joy</persRef>, and
							the original certificate itself of the whole Cargo of the Brig Syren
								<persRef ref="u">Capt<hi rend="superscript">n:</hi>
								Howland</persRef>, given by <persRef ref="felix-louis">Louis
								Felix</persRef>, the French Consul at New-York, and dated 28. July
							1810.— The Baron expressed great astonishment at the sight of these
							Papers; the first of which I told him I had shewn to the Ambassador— He
							asked me what the Ambassador had said to it— I told him that he had
							shrugged his shoulders and acknowledged that he knew not what to say—
							The Ambassador had no more doubt than I had that those were authentic
							papers— But he had orders to declare the contrary, and what was it for
							him to say?— The Baron then put me many questions respecting the present
							State of our affairs with France, and the conduct of France towards the
							United States— He enquired why the measures on both sides had been
							calculated upon the dates of 2. Nov<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> and 2.
								Feb<hi rend="superscript">y:</hi> which I explained to him from the
							Law of Congress of the last Session— He then entered upon the general
							consideration of the policy of France, and asked me, if I had read an
							Article in the last Moniteur, concerning the Continental System— I had
							not seen the Moniteur; but I had just received the Hamburg
							Correspondent, and had read the Article in a German translation— The
							substance of the argument was that although the Continent suffered very
							much by the Continental System, the Government’s did not lose their
							revenues, and the People could live through it, but that it must lead to
							the total ruin of England, because England had a depretiated paper
							Currency which already lost fifteen or sixteen per Cent in the market—
							As to the Continental System I said, that would undoubtedly last just as
							long as the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>
							<pb n="217" type="ms"/>should choose to continue his experiment, and as
							long as such articles as this should appear in the Moniteur— If there
							was a change of Ministry in England, the orders of Council, which I
							certainly abhorred as much as the Emperor Napoleon would certainly be
							revoked, and then he might exult with triumph as much as if his
							Continental System had extorted the revocation— They would be revoked,
							because the new Ministry would be composed of men, who from the
							beginning had pledged themselves against the measure, and who had
							already made several attempts to obtain their repeal— But it would not
							be the effect of the Continental system; and if the present ministry
							should be continued they would undoubtedly adhere to them— I said that
							when the Moniteur, and the other French political writers argued against
							the British Orders in Council, they could not miss being right— Those
							orders were in such utter defiance and contempt of every principle of
							the law of Nations, that nothing too severe could be said against them,
							but when the French writers extolled the effects of the Continental
							System, as counteraction to the Orders in Council, I thought as little
							of their reasoning, as I confided in their facts— The Moniteur for
							instance now insisted that England was upon the verge of total ruin,
							because she had a paper currency that lost 15 or 16 per Cent— It
							contended that the Continent was in a flourishing Condition because
							France lost none of her revenues; and because France had nothing but
							gold and silver— I did believe that a national bankruptcy, partial or
							total would be inevitable in England— But what of that? France had
							committed bankruptcy three or four times since her Revolution— And in
							annexing Holland to the French Empire, she had made her commit a
							bankruptcy no longer ago than last Summer— France considered it as the
							simplest operation in the world to reduce a public debt to one third of
							its amount, and tell the creditors, they must esteem themselves very
							happy to receive their interest upon that— With what face then could
							France pretend that England was at the point of dissolution because she
							had a paper that lost 15 or 16 per Cent— As to France’s losing none of
							her revenues; and having nothing but gold and silver; that might be
							true— And it might satisfy her too to consider her own condition as
							answering for that of the whole Continent— She could throw all the
							burthens of this state of things upon Austria, upon Prussia, upon
							Denmark, upon Sweden, upon Russia, and reckon their sufferings for
							nothing at all; but they suffered never the less for that— As to a
							depretiated paper, I hoped that was not to be considered as a signal of
							National Ruin; for if it was the whole Continent, excepting France was
							in a far more ruinous Condition than England, having paper much more
							deeply depretiated— The Baron then asked me what I thought of the
							probability of a Negotiation for Peace; which I told him I had long been
							of opinion would not take place untill the English have evacuated Spain
							and Portugal— I considered that as the only question yet remaining to
							contend about seriously— He said he was afraid that would yet be for a
							long time undecided— That it did not appear as if they would soon be
							expelled from Portugal— That if they should be compelled to embark at
							Lisbon they might immediately afterwards disembark again in some part of
							Spain— That the war seemed to be raging in almost all the Spanish
							Provinces, and that the <persRef ref="bonaparte-joseph">king,
								Joseph</persRef>, as well as the <persRef ref="joachim-i">king of
								Naples</persRef> talked of <hi rend="italic">abdication</hi>— I said
							I did not think this last Circumstance of much consequence as to the
							negotiation for Peace— Spain was to be under french domination under one
							shape or another, and it mattered little who was to be its nominal
							Governor— But the Spanish Colonies were to be forever separated from
							their Metropolis, and they would not come under french domination— The
							Emperor Napoleon’s Marriage had manifestly effected a total revolution
							in his political system— He had formerly been inclined to form a system
							of federative monarchies, placing his <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-jerome2;bonaparte-louis">brothers</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="murat-caroline;baciocchi-maria">Sisters</persRef> at
							their head— But since he had a prospect of posterity himself, the
							royalties of all his brothers would probably meet a similar fate to that
							of the kingdom of Holland— The Baron appeared to coincide in these
							opinions, but he was not so free as I was to express his opinions upon
							general <hi rend="strikethrough">opinio</hi> politicks— I told him that
							the Emperor Napoleon very often wanted such a Monition as was once given
							to <persRef ref="peter-the-great">Peter the Great</persRef>— In one of
							his fits of Passion, he threatened violence against one of his Officers,
							who simply said, Your Majesty will do as you please, but your History
							will tell of it; and Peter immediately checked his hand— Napoleon had
							been in great want of somebody to say to him, your History will tell of
							it; throughout the whole series of these Spanish transactions, and
							especially for the Scenes at Bayonne— The Baron said that <persRef
								ref="tallyrand-charles">Talleyrand</persRef> had undoubtedly
							rendered him that service, though without success.— After leaving the
							Baron, I called upon <persRef ref="pardo-benito">General
							Pardo</persRef>, to invite him and <persRef ref="pardo-clementina">his
								daughter</persRef> to dine with us next Saturday— I found the
							General unwell, confined to his chamber, and Miss Pardo, he told me was
							still more unwell— But they will come if sufficiently recovered— I also
							called at the French Ambassador’s but he was not at home— I then left my
							sleigh and walked round the Quay and the line, home— I dined at <pb

						<p><date>28. </date>I went again to the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand"

								Krabbe</persRef> his Secretary of Legation— The Baron was just going

								>r:</hi> Krabbe was out, and I left a message for them both— They
							afterwards sent me word they would come— I returned home, wrote a couple
							of hours, and went out again to walk— In the Evening I read some pages

							drowsy read to <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams</persRef> the new Comedy of

								<persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">Catherine</persRef> pass’d
							the Evening at <persRef ref="stroganov-anna">Baroness
								Strogonoff’s</persRef>.— The General of the <persRef

							upon me this morning with a letter for the <persRef ref="neale-francis"
									>Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Neale</persRef>, the Roman Catholic Priest at
							Georgetown which he requested me to forward. I made many enquiries of
							him concerning the school which they have here— They have now forty two
							scholars, which is the full number that they can take— There is under
							the father General a Provincial father—then a Rector, five Professors
							and six Regents— Each Student has his separate chamber where he studies—
							But the door remains open, and the duty of the Regents is to watch and
							pass occasionally from chamber to chamber to see that the boys are
							really at their studies— They are in the Classes five hours a day.
							Whenever the boys walk out they are accompanied by one of the Regents—
							The pupils are taken not under 6 and not over 12 years of age— Their
							course of Study employs six years— Three for the antient languages— One
							of Rhetoric, and two of Philosophy— The Mathematics commence with the
							first year, by common Arithmetic, and close with the last by Conic
							Sections, and the sublimest parts of the Science. They have two half
							holidays in the week— The Church Holidays, and a few hours of every week
							are allowed for the teachers of elegant
							accomplishments—fencing—dancing—drawing—and music— Their discipline is
							indulgent—their punishments light and adapted to the moral feelings of
							the children. They have also a Seminary for the education of
							Priests—their term of Study is fifteen years— The six above mentioned,
							then a second year of Rhetoric, which they are required to go over
							again—three years of <hi rend="italic">Regency</hi>, to form them to the
							Art of Instruction, and five years study of Theology— With regard to
							Rhetoric, the good father told me that he thought nothing could be added
							after <persRef ref="quintilian-marcus">Quinctilian</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="rollin-charles">Rollin</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="dejouvency-joseph">father Jouvency</persRef>, who he observed
							was a member of their order— He spoke with great commendation of the
							rule of <persRef ref="stignatiusloyola">S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Ignatius</persRef>, as a perfect model of discipline, and said that
								<persRef ref="frederick-ii">Frederick 2</persRef>. of Prussia had
							declared, that it would alone be competent to the good Government of a
							kingdom— I asked him if they had any public exhibitions at their school—
							He said there was one in December— And a public examination in May; to
							the next of which he would send me an invitation— He said that the
								<persRef ref="tolstoy-pyotr">Grand Marshal Count Tolstoi</persRef>
							had now placed <persRef ref="tolstoy-yegor">his second son</persRef>
							with them. His eldest, was now closing his year of Rhetoric— He was
							remarkable for his docility, and goodness of temper. But they had a
							young <persRef ref="u">Prince Galitzin</persRef>, who though not of a
							genius uncommonly bright surpass’d all the others by his indefatigable
							application— He said that from his experience in the Education of
							children, he always formed better hopes from moderate natural capacities
							with assiduous study, than from brilliant parts, which were almost
							always too eccentric to turn steadily to good— It is every where the
							same.</p>
