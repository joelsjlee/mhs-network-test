							Panathenaic—which he says he commenced writing at the age of
							ninety-four— In the Evening I read the Sermons 11 and 12. Vol. 2. of the
							English Preacher—the former on Religious Retirement, by <persRef
								ref="atterbury-francis">Bishop Atterbury</persRef>, the best I have
							yet met with in this Collection— The latter is <persRef
								ref="butler-joseph">Butler’s</persRef> character of <persRef
								ref="balaam">Balaam</persRef>, which I have read more than once
							before— The greatest merit of this Sermon, is the sagacity of analysis
							in explaining and unfolding the mysterious Scripture accounts of this
							personage—and the ingenuity of application in bringing it home to the
							preacher’s auditory— Immediately before going to bed this Night, I tried
							the experiment of a warm bath.</p>

						<p><date>4. </date>I rose this morning just at the dawn of day, that is,
							about 8 O’Clock, and the weather being mild and fine, after sun-rise
							took a walk before breakfast— On returning home, as I pass’d before the
							Corner of the Palace, I saw the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef> come out from his apartments, mount his horse,
							and go round, followed by five Officers his Aid de Camps, and enter the
							inner Court of the Palace, where he holds almost Every Morning a private
							review of the Guards— I met <persRef ref="nelson">Nelson</persRef>
							walking; who looked and complained of being very unwell— I had a morning
							visit from <persRef ref="watzdorf-carl">General Watzdorf</persRef>,
							whose conversation was pleasant; mine to him was not prudent. I know not
							whether the Vanity of other men, draws upon them such frequent
							self-reproach and mortification as mine does upon me; but my reflections
							upon my own indiscretions cost me many uneasy hours, which seldom
							produce amendment— General Watzdorf is a man of perhaps
							fifty-five—grave, sentimental, polite and somewhat formal— Very
							punctilious in giving the title of Excellency to his Colleagues, though
							it is entirely out of use in the familiar conversation of all the rest,
							and sounds to me so ridiculous, that I cannot prevail upon myself even
							to return it to him in his own way— The General is a cool, judicious
							man, sometimes much addicted to yawning in Company, and occasionally to
							dose— A good latin Scholar—occasionally quoting <persRef ref="horace"
								>Horace</persRef>; but having no keen relish for literature of any
							kind. He attends the Emperor on Sundays at the parade, by his own
							desire, where his horse trots while all the rest of the Cavalcade are
							upon the Canter— The General is intimate with the <persRef
								ref="tolstoy-pyotr">Grand-Marshal Count Tolstoy</persRef>, and
							visits at <persRef ref="gurieff-dmitri">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gourieff’s</persRef> and <persRef ref="dolorukay-elena">Princess
								Dolgorucky’s</persRef>— He gets like <persRef ref="vonblome-otto"
								>Baron Blome</persRef> such information as is to be obtained from
							this Company, very quick and very correctly— That is to say, every thing
							that the Government here chuse they should know— Of the secret
							information he has not such good sources— On the whole he is a man much
							like his Sovereign the <persRef ref="frederickaugustus-i">king of
								Saxony</persRef>— He lives here without his family, and in an
							unassuming and economical style. He was at the battle of Wagram, and had
							been in the military Career, untill his Mission to this Country— I
							walked again before dinner, and met young <persRef ref="u">Baron
								Löwenstern</persRef>; with whom I walked— He accompanied the
								<persRef ref="bray-francois">Chevalier de Bray</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="bray-sophie">Madame</persRef> on their Journey to
							Italy— <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Galloway</persRef> was here this Evening— I read the Oration of
								<persRef ref="Isocrates">Isocrates</persRef> for the Plataeans, and
							finished the third Book of <persRef ref="manilius-marcus"
								>Manilius</persRef>— In the Evening I read the Itinéraire— The
							Oration, was to implore the protection of the Athenians against the
							Thebans— It characterises the manners of that Age and Country— Manilius
							continues a profound and incomprehensible Astrologer— This book
							laboriously prepares the student of the Stars, for the Art of drawing
							the <hi rend="italic">horoscope</hi>.— As it depends on the state of the
							Zodiac, he gives rules for ascertaining the time and period of the
							rising and setting of every sign, throughout the year— <persRef
								ref="chateaubriand-francois">Chateaubriand</persRef> was dubb’d by
							the Guardian Father of the Holy Land, a knight of the holy
							sepulchre—then left Jerusalem and went to Egypt— He saw the pyramids
							only at a distance— The Nile being too high for him to go by land, and
							too low to go by Water— He gives an account of five French Soldiers,
							relicts of the army of <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
								>Bonaparte</persRef>, whom he found as Mammeluke chiefs at Cairo.
							The principal of them was <persRef ref="menou-abdallah"
								>Abdallah</persRef>, the son of a Shoemaker at Toulouse— But the
							author takes great pride in them as Frenchmen— He found too a rich
							turkish merchant, who knew Son cher Atala, et sa chere Réné— It almost
							reconciled him to the Turks.</p>

							had commenced the custom of taking before breakfast— The weather has
							been so long moderate that the river has the appearance of threatening

							damp and dark, and there can scarcely be said to be any daylight,

								>Hollins</persRef>, <persRef ref="harris-levett">Harris</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="saltus-nicholas">Saltus</persRef> and <persRef

								>Madame de Betancourt</persRef>, and her <persRef

							spent part of the Evening here. I read the Oration of <persRef
								ref="Isocrates">Isocrates</persRef> on the permutation, or Exchange
							of Estates— This is in his own Cause. He says it was written when he was
							eighty-four year old— There is no lack of egotism in this orator’s
							discourses— This Oration is entirely about himself, and produces as
							proofs of his patriotism long extracts from three of the former
							Orations— Began the fourth Book of <persRef ref="manilius-marcus"
								>Manilius</persRef>— It is a beautiful poetical exordium about Fate—
							And then it contains further rules concerning the influence of the
							Celestial sign upon human destinies— In the Evening I finished the
							Itinèraire, which I have read with much pleasure— It finishes with the
							Account of the <persRef ref="chateaubriand-francois">Author’s</persRef>
							Voyage from Egypt to Tunis, and an account of antient Carthage, and its
							History— There is perhaps too much of this, and of extracts from antient
							Historians in the Book; but altogether I have found it entertaining—
							From Tunis, he went to Spain in an American Schooner— Of Spain he says
							but a few words; <pb n="319" type="ms"/>and concludes the narrative at
							Bayonne. He announces his intention if he should enjoy in future a
							tranquility which he has never had, to raise in Silence a Monument that
							may do honour to his Country; but observes he has at all Events written
							enough if his name is to last; and too much if not. In this last Volume
							he pays two or three Compliments to <persRef ref="volney-constantin"
								>Volney’s</persRef> travels— So that the Silence I had before
							observed was not so significant as I had thought.</p>

							however my six miles walk, before Breakfast— As I was returning I met
								<persRef ref="bezerra-joao">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Oration of <persRef ref="Isocrates">Isocrates</persRef>—on the Chariot
							Horses— It is in the person of a <persRef ref="alcibiadestheyounger"

							upon a suit of Tisias to recover the horses, as having been <hi
								rend="italic">extorted</hi> from him by Alcibiades— The Son, (whose
							name does not appear in the Speech) says that his father bought the
							horses of the Argives; and that this suit was brought against him, only
							to increase the odium against his father who had been banished, and had
							perished— The whole Oration is a defence of the Character of
							Alcibiades.— It seems to be an address to the People, and against a
							public accusation— But why was the Cause tried before the people? and
							what is meant by the pretence that Alcibiades had <hi rend="italic"
								>extorted</hi> the horses?— The <persRef ref="dinsdale-joshua"
								>English Translator</persRef> tells us nothing about this. The
							Oration is peculiarly interesting, as it exhibits a man obviously
							innocent, struggling against the oppression of popular Odium brought
							upon him by his father; yet exerting his best faculties to extricate his
							fathers fame, from that Odium— It contains many particulars about
							Alcibiades, and sets out with filial affection and piety all the fair
							parts of his character— I also finished reading the fourth Book of
								<persRef ref="manilius-marcus">Manilius</persRef> which contains an
							account of the influence of each sign of the Zodiac, upon the character
							of those born under it, and also upon the different parts of the Earth—
							There is a tolerably minute geographical description of the world then
							known— But as none of the Signs are reserved for the superintendence of
							the Terrae incognitae, the American Hemisphere has no patrons or foes
							among the Constellations— In the Evening I read a little in the Appendix
							to the Itinéraire, and began <persRef ref="danville-jean"
								>d’Anville’s</persRef> dissertation upon antient Jerusalem.— This
							was the festival of <persRef ref="stcatherineofalexandria">S<hi

							it has been customary for a diplomatic Circle to be held at Court— This

							regularly composed, with the formal partitions— They are all in the calm

							possible to fancy the fate of the world depending upon the doubt whether
							the Athenians shall raise two thousand men of infantry, two hundred of
							Cavalry, and send them out with ten gallies, and levy 50,000 dollars to

								<persRef ref="philip-ii-macedonia">Philip</persRef>, I admire as

								>Philip</persRef> as a member of the amphictyonic Council—the Orator
							advises acquiescence, to avoid the danger of a general War against
							Athens, which he thinks not to be hazarded for a mere shadow at Delphi—
							The sixth, or second of the four Philippics exclusively so called, is
							one of those which do not indicate the question in debate— It is a
							general invective against Philip— Auger’s Summary says it was to urge an
							alliance with Sparta against him— It appears rather to be an argument
							for an impeachment of those who had advised the Peace with Philip; and
							especially one man (they, he says, know who) and Auger says it was
								<persRef ref="aeschines">Eschines</persRef>.— In this Oration is the
							fine repetition of what <persRef ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef>
							had said to the Messenians—advising them to <hi rend="italic"
								>Distrust</hi>, as a protection to their liberties— Here too he
							urges the natural hatred <pb n="323" type="ms"/>of kings for Republics;
							and here he speaks of himself as a Water-drinker— Auger says that Philip
							on reading this Oration said, I should have voted for a Declaration of
							War against myself and for appointing Demosthenes the General— The
							seventh, is upon the Halonesus, and several other points mentioned in a
							letter from Philip to the Athenians, which however has not been
							preserved. This Oration is thought spurious, and Auger says is
							attributed to <persRef ref="hegesippus">Hegesippus</persRef>— One reason
							for rejecting it is that he says, if his hearers have their brains in
							their heads and not in their heels they will totally ruin Philip’s

							means delicate irony <hi rend="strikethrough">too</hi> in many passages
							of this Oration, which are not in the manner of the great Orator; whose

							compositions—the greatness of his powers, nor the fastidious delicacy of
							an Athenian Audience— But they give rise to another scruple in my mind—
							Is it an indication of perfect compositions, that whole pages may be
							transported from one discourse to another, and be equally suitable for
							either.— <persRef ref="blair-hugh">Blair</persRef> says that <persRef
								ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef> never recurred to the loci
							communes— But the usurpations of <persRef ref="philip-ii-macedonia"
								>Philip</persRef>, are the perpetual common place of all the
							Philippics, and you scarcely ever can discover the precise object of the
							deliberation on any one of the specific occasions of the discourses— In
							the tenth Philippic he argues in favour of the theatrical distributions,
							which in the third and fourth he had urged to have appropriated to
							maintain the troops— A remarkable example of compliance with popular
							prejudices and passions— Philip’s letter to the Senate and people of
							Athens is well written— With much moderation and dignity of
							expression—and with provoking coolness— He details all his causes of
							complaint against them; and in many particulars he appears to have
							reason and justice on his side— In all great human controversies the
							better side may be liable to the reproach of subordinate wrongs, more
							than their adversary. The Athenians were not altogether blameless in
							their proceedings towards Philip— But their faults were all of petty
							extent, and in the nature of defence— Philip’s wrong was enormous; it
							was the design of subjugating to himself all Greece— He winds his web
							round them like a spider round a fly— When I read those noble sentiments
							of Demosthenes, in which he compares the fortune of Athens with that of
							Philip, and prefers it upon the principle that truth and Justice, <hi
								rend="italic">must</hi> be favoured by Heaven, when he contends that
							success and prosperity founded on fraud and treachery <hi rend="italic"
								>must</hi> be short-lived, I cannot avoid a feeling of sorrow, that
							these maxims were not sanctioned by the Event— That the triumph of fraud
							and treachery was complete, and that liberty sunk under the Genius and
							Industry of the tyrant— I remark as an item in estimating the oratorical
							powers of Demosthenes, that there is nothing like learning in his
							Orations— There is nothing that discovers a cultivated mind— There is
							little philosophy—<pb n="324" type="ms"/>no indulgence to the
							imagination— No wit or humour— No attempt at ridicule; he is
							sufficiently figurative but all his figures are taken from familiar
							objects. His eloquence is characteristic of democracy as that of
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> is to Aristocracy. It
							is as the Doric to the Corinthian Pillar.</p>

						<p><date>24. </date>The <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor

							<persRef ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef>, I read the Orations,
							for the liberty of the Rhodians and on the Treaty of <persRef

							Exordiums— The Oration for the Rhodians is among the best. But there is
							some inconsistency with himself in the principles of political morality
							that he lays down in it. That on the Treaty of Alexander, is allowed to
							be spurious. The style is not that of Demosthenes— There is nothing of
							his magnanimity of Sentiment in it; and the invective unlike his against
							Philip is coarse and heavy— Some of the Exordiums are the same that
							appear at the beginning of the Orations— It appears that Demosthenes was
							accustomed to have an assortment of Exordium’s on hand—ready to be
							tacked to any harangue for which there might be a sudden occasion— They
							are short, and couched in such general expressions as may apply equally
							well to any subject of discourse— He seems to have considered an
							exordium, as we look upon a prologue to a Play—as entirely distinct from
							the discourse itself— <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>
							followed the same practice for his philosophical Treatises.— The Court
							was announced as usual, for Noon— I went a little before one; entering
							at the Hermitage as had been requested— The Imperial family were already
							at the Mass and the Corps Diplomatique had gone into the Hall of the
							Throne— It was however near two before the Emperor came in, as there is
							always a Te Deum on this day as well as a Mass.— Both the Empresses were
							dress’d with extraordinary magnificence, and an <pb n="325" type="ms"
							/>unusual profusion of diamonds and other precious stones. The Empress
							Mother especially— The Circle was as short as ever—if any thing,
							shorter— The Emperor and two Empresses, said very few words to the
								<persRef ref="law-jacques">Ambassador</persRef> and each of the
							Ministers. The Emperor noticed that I had at last left off my wig.— I
							said I had considered his Majesty’s example as a permission, and
							accordingly followed it— He said it was not so showy, but more
							convenient to go without it— The <persRef ref="elizabeth-alexeievna"
								>Empress</persRef> asked me about <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>; whether she had
							recovered from her lying-in, and whether we had now got a comfortable
							house— The <persRef ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress Mother</persRef>
							enquired how we had our health in this Country. I said very well,
							excepting Colds—in which we had at least the advantage of following her
							example— She said that for a few days she had been seriously unwell; but
							was now entirely recovered— About two O’Clock I returned home— <persRef
								ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef>, was confined to his chamber with a Cold, cough and
							fever.— Between 8 and 9. in the Evening I went with the Ladies again to
							the Palace, and attended the Ball given by the Empress-Mother— It was
							similar to those of the last two years on the same occasion; but the
							Supper was more magnificent; being served in one of the largest Halls of
							the Palace— The Empress mother, who does the honours of her own house,
							was as usual remarkably attentive to her guests, and spoke several times
							to all the foreign Ministers— Before— At— and after supper— The Emperor
							asked me whether dancing was not practiced in America— Very much Sir—
							Well! why do you not dance here?— Because I have given it up. I am too
							old for dancing. Does your Majesty dance?— No! I say like you, I am too
							old— The Empress was unwell, and obliged to retire immediately after
							supper— About half-past-one, the Emperor came up, and said je crois
							qu’il est tems de sonner la retraite—and with his mother left the
							Ball-Room— We got home a little after two.</p>

						<p><date>26. </date>I called this morning at nine O’Clock on the <persRef

							gone to the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, but I saw
								<persRef ref="gorgoli-ivan">Colonel Gorgoly</persRef>, who performs
							the functions of Master of the Police, and by whom the order was issued
							to <persRef ref="u">Plincke</persRef> to pay the money for the fine— I
							explained the Circumstances to him and urged the hardship of the case of
							levying a fine upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Plincke, for a
							Circumstance of which he and I were perfectly ignorant— And of which I
							conceived myself ignorant without blame; having understood that here as
							well as in other Countries the house of a foreign Minister was not
							subject to the Jurisdiction of the Police— The Colonel, was extremely
							complaisant, and polite in form, and assured me that the Police, had the
							most perfect respect for the mansion of all foreign Ministers, and never
							presumed to intrude upon them— But that this <hi rend="italic"
								>ticket</hi>, was required to be taken out at the <hi rend="italic"
								>Address-Comtoir</hi>, by every Russian <pb n="326" type="ms"
							/>serving as a domestic, and must be renewed every year, or whenever the
							person changed his Master— A capitation tax, of three Rubles for a

							be paid on taking out this certificate, and to secure the collection of
							the tax, the owner of the house where every servant lived was
							responsible upon a penalty of two Rubles a day for any delay in taking
							it out— That the Police could have no claim whatsoever upon foreign
							Ministers; but must look to the owners of Houses, whose business it was
							to make their agreements with foreign Ministers, to indemnify
							themselves— And that as it was a revenue to the Crown; neither he nor
							the Minister of Police, could provide any remedy for the case— I shewed
							him my Contract with Plincke, which I told him Plincke had himself
							annulled by selling his house to the Crown, and turning me out of doors—
							I shewed him that even my stipulation in the Contract had reference to
							nothing but the <hi rend="italic">Passports</hi> of my Servants; and
							made no mention of these Address-Comtoir Certificates— That if the
							Police thought proper to levy upon Plincke, a fine for a neglect or
							ignorance of my Servant, of which I knew nothing and could be expected
							to know nothing, I could only regret the circumstance, but felt my self
							under no Obligation to pay the money— He said that the Certificate was a
							thing entirely distinct and separate from the Passport—that as it was
							not mentioned in my Contract, it was M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Plincke’s business to have seen to it, and that if I had written him a
							line stating these Circumstances, I should have had no further trouble
							in the business; but he requested me to leave the contract and his order
							with him, and to ask Plincke to call upon him, and he would arrange the
							matter.— I left the Papers accordingly, and called immediately at the
							English Magazine, and left word for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Plincke to call upon Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Gorgoli.— I dined
							at <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff’s</persRef>, with a

								Bray</persRef> a letter I received this morning for him, in answer
							to one I had forwarded for him by <persRef ref="anderson-james2">M<hi

							sat next to <persRef ref="bussche-calmor">Count Bussche</persRef>, who
							told me that his Landlord, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Severin</persRef> had made a demand of him, on account
							of a fine levied on him for some irregularity in the Passport of a
							Mooshik in his service; but he had refused to pay it— Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l:</hi> Gorgoli who called upon me before dinner,
							had told me that Bussche had paid it— He said also that <persRef

							and paid to <persRef ref="vonrall-alexander">Baron Rall</persRef>— And

								>Navarro</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Plincke told me
							he had been fined for him, and that he must look to him for it
							hereafter.— I dined very moderately, having felt the whole day a cough

							indolence and charges of corruption against other Orators. Several

							finally the Orator did not speak, or his discourse has not been

							payment for a fine imposed upon him, for the whole time we were at his
							house in the Country—two Rubles a day on account of the same Mooshik
								<persRef ref="tita">Tita</persRef>— In my lease from Tatischeff,
							drawn by himself, and signed by me as drawn, there was no stipulation
							whatsoever respecting the Servants, their Passports or their
							Certificates— I sent him word that I was utterly ignorant of this whole
							affair— That I had expostulated with the Master of the Police, against a
							fine’s being levied in such a manner upon him; but that I could do
							nothing further.— There came to me two American Sailors, belonging to
							the Monticello, <persRef ref="u">Captain Sall</persRef>, a vessel that
							has been condemned for coming with false papers— The Captain refuses to
							pay the men their wages, or to support them— I sent them with a Note to
								<persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Harris</persRef>, the only person who has the means of relieving
							them, or obtaining Justice for them.— I finished reading the second
							Volume of <persRef ref="auger-athanase">Auger’s</persRef> Translation—
							It concludes with the Oration of <persRef ref="aeschines"
								>Eschines</persRef> against <persRef ref="timarchus"
								>Timarchus</persRef>.— This person had engaged himself in
							conjunction with <persRef ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef>, as an
							accuser of Eschines; who retorted upon him, by accusing him of having
							forfeited by infamous vices the right of speaking in public— Part of
							this Harangue is omitted by Auger, as containing details of infamy too
							shocking for the modesty of french ears— It has some very eloquent
							passages, and particularly one, in which the violent Passions, are said
							to be the only torturers of the Furies, which <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> copied into his Oration for
								<persRef ref="roscius-sextus">Roscius of Ameria</persRef>— It always
							struck me there as one of the most beautiful strokes in that Harangue— I
							did not know that it belonged to Eschines.— There are also in this
							Discourse many quotations from the Poets— <persRef ref="homer"
								>Homer</persRef> and <persRef ref="euripides">Euripides</persRef>—
							Some of them long, and not much to the purpose— There is not a little
							invective against Demosthenes, and among others, the reproach that he
							had been called by the nick-name of Batalus; and that he was foppish and
							effeminate in his dress.— In this accusation Eschines succeeded—
							Timarchus was condemned and his name became proverbial for infamy.</p>

							through the preliminary reflections, and the Summary of the two Orations

						<p><date>30. </date>Third day of Confinement to the house— I rose after
							day-light; between 8 and 9. O’Clock— All the family still sick— <persRef
								ref="smith-catherine-johnson">Catherine</persRef>, however, left her
							chamber and sat down with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>us</persRef> at dinner; but after sitting a few minutes was obliged
							to leave the table, and return to her chamber— The <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa2">infant</persRef> was quite unwell this Evening—
							The ladies had an evening visit from <persRef ref="bentzon-magdalena"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bentzon</persRef>— I have now
							with my cough and Cold, a sore throat. I wrote however during the
							greatest part of the daylight of this day— Recovered however only a part
							of my lapses— I read the Oration of Eschines against Ctesiphon; and
							began the answer of Demosthenes. The Oration of <persRef ref="aeschines"
								>Eschines</persRef> was a master-piece of Eloquence, and proves him
							to have been a very superior Man— The question was, whether <persRef
								ref="ctesiphon">Ctesiphon</persRef> had violated the laws by
							proposing a decree to present a crown of gold to <persRef
								ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef>, for his long and faithful
							services, past and still continuing, and for his <hi rend="italic"
								>virtue and courageous firmness</hi>—and that the decree should be
							proclaimed at the theatre at the feasts of <persRef ref="bacchus"
								>Bacchus</persRef>, at the time of the new Tragedies. The decree had
							been adopted by the Senate, and the Cause was to decide whether it
							should be confirmed by the People— A difficulty occurs which <persRef
								ref="auger-athanase">Auger</persRef> does not entirely remove— How
							could a decree sanctioned by the Senate and the People, be contrary to
							the Laws?— It seems extraordinary that the only way to prevent the
							adoption by the People of a decree already sanctioned by the Senate,
							should have been by an accusation against the first proposer of the
							decree—the penalty laid against Ctesiphon is fifty talents—about 30,000
							dollars— There is however scarcely any thing about Ctesiphon in the
							Harangue— The Orator treats him contemptuously; says that Demosthenes
							had bribed him to propose the decree; and that he and Demosthenes, were
							each abusive upon the other in relation to this Cause— But he very
							injudiciously manifests his terror of Demosthenes, by demanding what he
							must have known would not be granted—first that Ctesiphon should defend
							himself, and Demosthenes not be allowed to speak for him at-all—or,
							secondly that Demosthenes should be compelled to follow the same course
							in the defence, that he had followed in the attack— But this Oration has
							suggested to me so many reflections, that I must record them
							elsewhere.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> My Resolution of early rising,
							through the Winter Months has been so constantly traversed by a
							succession of bad Colds &amp; Coughs, that it has partly failed; I have
							continued to rise with great irregularity—several mornings not untill
							broad day-light, which is now not before nine O’Clock— As often however
							between 5 and 6. and upon the average between 6. and 7.— My practice, as
							steady as sickness and interruptions would allow, has been to read five

						<p>I offer to the Supreme disposer of Events at the close of this year the

							to enlighten me in the path of my duty towards himself and towards all
							my fellow-Creatures in my various relations with them— If it be his
							will, I pray that before the expiration of another year we may once more
							restored in safety and health to our Country, and rejoyce in a complete
							reunion with my Parents, Children, and dearest friends. That this
							restoration, may be for the greatest good of us-all, and of others—
							Finally that whatever his Sovereign power and wisdom may destine for us,
