								Smith</persRef> dined abroad. We closed the Evening with Cards; but
							I had been reading and writing untill ten O’Clock— I finished the
							Original Discourse upon Universal History— There is to the Edition which
								<persRef ref="navarro-rodrigo">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Navarro</persRef> has lent me a Continuation, said to have been
							written by <persRef ref="bossuet-jacques">Bossuet</persRef>; but never
							published untill the year 1806.— This work which I had never read untill
							now, has been and still is so excessively extolled by the French
							writers, that as usually happens to overrated things it has not answered
							my expectations— Bossuet was a party writer (in regard to religion) and
							the reputation of all such authors is exaggerated and partly factitious—
							Faction of every kind can find wit in dulness and supernatural powers in
							ordinary genius— The discourse however is not an ordinary work. It is a
							bold and vigorous outline of Universal History; chiefly founded upon the
							Bible— The succession of Empires is marked out by a series of remarkable
							epochs, and the Fortunes of the People of God, and their Successors the
							Christian Church are compressed into a small but interesting abridgment.
							There are some Chronological discussions not very clearly elucidated—a
							review of the prophecies, equally profound and ingenious— An exposition
							of the arguments of the Jews who deny the application of the prophecies
							to Jesus Christ and an argumentation against the Protestants derived
							from the novelty of their Sects. The Bishop’s tone whenever he enters
							upon Controversy, has nothing in it of Christian humility or charity— He
							is arrogant and insulting; as when he speaks of <persRef ref="louis-xiv"
								>Louis 14</persRef>. he is a base and servile flatterer. He
							concludes with a rapid view of the Roman History in which he recognizes
							the love of Liberty and the Spirit of Patriotism, as the sources of all
							their greatness— This Book was written for <persRef ref="louisdauphin"
								>the Dauphin the Son of Louis</persRef>, the author having been one
							of his Instructors.</p>

						<p><date>8. </date>A <persRef ref="sontag-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Sonntag</persRef> an American Citizen, and who has been
							a naval Officer (sailing Master) in the service of the United States,
							called upon me this morning and informed me that he had the intention of
							entering the Russian service.— He went from this City two or three
							months ago; intending then as he told me to go to Odessa; upon
							commercial pursuits— He went however no farther than Moscow, and has now
							returned here with this new project. I mentioned to him the case of
								<persRef ref="jewett-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Jewett</persRef>, who was here the last Summer with a similar
							intention; but failed of success in his application— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Sonntag said he had no apprehension of
							any difficulty in his application— That they wanted Officers for their
							vessels on the Black Sea, and that the English Officers whom they had
							would not serve— I asked if he had already had any encouragement from
							the Government— He said he had yesterday seen the <persRef
								ref="detraversay-ivan">Marquis de Traversey</persRef> the Minister
							of the Marine, and had no doubt of success— Perhaps the Marquis might
							apply to me to certify that he was an American, and had been in the
							Service of the United States; for which reason he had brought me his
							Commission, which he shewed me— It is signed by <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">President Jefferson</persRef>, and dated in
							August 1807. I asked him if he considered himself authorized to enter a
							foreign service without first having his discharge from that of the
							United States— He said that he could shew me his furlough, which was for
							as long a time as he pleased, and authorized him to dispose of himself
							as he pleased— That he had already once lost his claim to promotion in
							the Navy by a furlough, and had been obliged to re-enter the service in
							the rank at which he had left it, while officers below him had been
							advanced; and that he had lately received a letter from <persRef ref="u"
								>his father</persRef> which informed him that he was considered as
							no longer in the service. He had told me when he was here before that
							his furlough was unlimited in regard to time; but that it left him his
							rank in the service, and the obligation to return to it whenever the
							Government might call upon him— I reminded him of this; but he said he
							had since received the letter from his father stating that he was no
							longer in the service— I asked him if he was aware of the Article of
							Amendment to the Constitution which had duly pass’d by a sufficient
							majority of both <pb n="221" type="ms"/>Houses of Congress, and which
							may now have become a part of the Constitution; by force of which any
							Citizen of the United States would forfeit his rights and character as
							such by accepting a Commission in the service of any foreign sovereign,
							without first obtaining the consent of Congress— He said he had not seen
							it; but at any rate he did not think it could apply to him, as he could
							have no notice of it as part of the Constitution at the time of his
							engaging in the service of Russia— I offered to shew it to him; but he
							said that it would not alter his determination— I then observed that I
							mentioned it to him, because I might be obliged to consider it as a rule
							of conduct for myself— The Marquis de Traversey had required of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jewett that he should produce a sort of
							recommendatory certificate from me— If he should require nothing of that
							kind now from him, I should have no occasion to interfere in the case,
							and of course should have nothing to do with it— But if he should ask
							for such a certificate, I should be desirous of rendering him M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Sonntag any service in my power to
							promote his views, as far as was consistent with my own duty— That I did
							not personally approve of the principle of the proposed Amendment to the
							Constitution, but if adopted it would be a law which I should be bound
							to observe, and must conduct myself conformably to it. If I was to
							certify that he was discharged from the service of the United States, I
							must have some Evidence to warrant the Certificate— I could otherwise
							only certify that he considered himself as discharged— He said he did
							not suppose that any thing more would be desired of me than to attest
							that he was an American Citizen, which I assured him I would do with
							pleasure— At 12. O’Clock, I went to the Office of the Department of
							foreign Affairs on the Quay of the Neva, which I supposed to be the
							place where <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>
							had appointed to meet me; but he was not there— I then went to his own
							house on the Quay; but did not find him— I finally went to the House
							where he resides and was admitted— On apologizing to him for being so
							late, and telling him that I had first gone to the Office of the
							Department, which I thought his note had indicated to me, he said that
							the house in which he lives was the Hotel des Affaires Etrangères— I
							then told him the subject upon which I had requested to see him— The
							vessels which were still waiting for a decision respecting the whole, or
							parts of their Cargoes— He expressed some surprize; and said he thought
							that business had already been settled some time ago. I said it had been
							in part; but that there remained a number concerning which it had been
							delayed— That not wishing to importune him more than was absolutely
							necessary, I had applied several times directly to <persRef
								ref="campenhausen-baltazar">Baron Campenhausen</persRef> concerning
							it— That he had repeatedly assured me, that the business should be
							immediately settled in their favour, but it was not yet done— I then
							told him how long this decision had been delayed, and how important it
							was to those concerned that they should have time to transact their
							business, and be able to get away immediately on the opening of the
							Navigation in the Spring— I added that I had made a minute in writing of
							all the cases, not in official form, but merely as a Memorandum, which
							with his permission I would give him— He said he was very glad I had
							brought it, as it would serve him to draw up his official note to Baron
							Campenhausen, which he would immediately send— He would not call this
							delay a caprice of the Baron’s, but he did not know what was the reason
							of it.— I accordingly delivered the minute to him, and mentioned
							particularly the case of the Eliza at Archangel, repeating to him the
							observations which I made concerning her last week to Baron
							Campenhausen— I asked the Count’s permission to send him a packet to be
							forwarded by the first Courier that would go to Paris— He said that he
							would send it with pleasure; that he had already received notice of a
							Courier from Paris, whom he expected immediately, and shortly after his
							arrival he should dispatch one.— He asked me if I had any news from
							England— I had none— He said it appeared <persRef
								ref="labouchere-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Labouchère</persRef> the same person who had been sent to London
							last Winter from Holland was gone again; but as there had been no change
							of Ministry, probably he would be as little listened to as he was
							before— Perhaps he had been sent upon the expectation that with the
							establishment of the Regency there would have been a new set of
							Ministers.— I said that I should have supposed the subject upon which
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Labouchère went last Winter was now
							no longer a matter for Negotiation, as Holland had been so formally
							annexed to the French Empire— Pourquoi pas? said the Count; such things
							are not irrevocable; and at least the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
								>Emperor Napoleon</persRef> may be willing to offer terms which may
							be favorable to England— I said that as to the restoration of the
							kingdom of Holland, I did not think that was an object in which the
							English Government would take much interest—they would be indifferent as
							to the form of a Government which must essentially be under the absolute
							controul of France— He said he thought so too, and although it might not
							be an agreeable consideration for the Hollanders, it was impossible to
							conceal that they were no longer to be <hi rend="italic">prized</hi> as
							they formerly had been, considered as a Nation— I asked the Count if
							this was a special <pb n="222" type="ms"/>Holiday, having seen a great
							number of Carriages and Sledges in the <persRef ref="stisaac">S<hi
									rend="superscript">t:</hi> Isaac’s</persRef> Square, before the
							Church, and several Soldiers at the Church door— He said it was no
							Holiday; but as the nobility of the Province had been this week making
							their Elections, perhaps it was some religious ceremony which they
							attended at the close of the business. He had heard that <persRef
								ref="stroganov-alexander">Count Strogonoff</persRef> had been
							re-elected the first marshall— It was the eighth time that he had been
							elected—that is he had held the Office ever since the establishment of
							the system; which was an Institution of the <persRef
								ref="catherinethegreat">Empress Catherine</persRef>— But as it was
							not to be disguised that Count Strogonoff was growing old, they had now
							elected a Candidate, who he heard was <persRef ref="orlov-vladimir"
								>Count Orloff</persRef>, as a substitute in case of a vacancy— He
							had not attended, and had never attended these meetings himself, because
							he did not consider himself as having a right to attend them— There were
							indeed many persons who attended them merely because they were owners of
							a House in S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg; but that was not
							the Construction which he gave to the law— At the first Election, the
							Empress Catherine to avoid every appearance or even suspicion of
							exercising any influence had purposely left the City and gone upon a
							Journey while the Elections were held. At present, our Masters, said the
							Count, do not absent themselves at these times, but as to this Province,
							the Institution itself has not answered the expectations that had been
							entertained from it— The object was to assemble in a body and make a
							representation of the principal land holders— But from the situation of
							the Capital, and of the property in its neighbourhood it turns out that
							all the owners of the petty gardens and Country seats on the Peterhof
							road claimed the right of attending the meetings here; and upon such a
							title, one of the Marshals elected was a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bille</persRef>, the <persRef ref="u"
								>brother of a Merchant</persRef> in this City— A man who to be sure
							as a merchant had a very respectable occupation, and was wealthy; but
							who had begun lower in life than that.— The Count therefore is not much
							satisfied with the Institution, which is indeed a singular anomaly in a
							Government like this— The Elections are held once every three years; and
							the Merchants have an Election separate from that of the nobility.— The
							Officers elected constitute the judicial tribunals of the Province, from
							which there is an appeal to the Senate— My conference with the Count was
							short, and I left him about 1. O’Clock— In the Evening we had visits
							from <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Rumigny</persRef>,
							and afterwards from <persRef ref="hollins-john2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Hollins</persRef> and <persRef ref="saltus-nicholas"

									>r:</hi> Montréal</persRef> came again this morning, and gave me
							an Account of an hour’s conversation, which he had just been having with
							the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">Ambassador</persRef>, who he says
							is all mildness and moderation, and utterly averse to a War with Russia—
							He told him that he had heard a week ago of this intended petition from
							the merchants— He should have a copy of it, and would shew it to him
							when it came. That he did not see what objection they could make against
							it, as its intention was to propose merely to follow the example of
							France— He dwelt with great earnestness on the evils and the dangers of
							a War with Russia; which he said would prove a second Spanish War— Spoke
							of the Spanish War, as of a most exhausting and ruinous thing— Remarked
							how exasperated the Russian nobility and Nation were against France; and
							said that the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor
								Napoleon</persRef> had been deceived, about the decree for burning
							the English merchandizes— That decree had not done any harm to the
							English; but it had been the cause of the great number of heavy
							bankruptcies upon the Continent which have been incessantly succeeding
							one another since its adoption— He spoke about the American vessels
							here—asked Montréal whether some of those which came under American
							Colours had not been confiscated, and said he had heard that two or
							three of those, which I strongly claimed, were in doubtful
							circumstances: Montréal assured him that not one American vessel had
							been confiscated, and that he was convinced every one that I had claimed
							was a genuine American— He said nothing to Montréal about his own
							recall, whence he concludes that he is not much gratified by it. He says
							the Ambassador is a man of most violent temper, and sometimes loses all
							controul over it—of which he gave me an instance in a transaction with
							which he himself had <pb n="223" type="ms"/>some concern— I never saw
							any manifestation of this sort in him— I had afterwards a visit from the
								<persRef ref="lebzeltern-ludwig">Chevalier Lebzeltern</persRef> the
							Austrian Counsellor of Legation, who lately arrived— He came to make
							some enquiries concerning a certain <persRef ref="lubomirska-rozalia"
								>Countess Lubomirska</persRef>, a Polish lady, who was guillotined
							during the most atrocious period of the French Revolution, but of whom
							it had lately been pretended that she had escaped; had married an
							American Minister who was then in France, and was now in America. This
							tale had excited the anxiety of her family— He had written to Paris to
							enquire the name of the American Minister alluded to, and on receiving
							the answer he should write me a note requesting me to obtain decisive
							information as to the facts— I promised him to make any enquiry that he
							should desire, and told him that the Minister at that <hi
								rend="strikethrough">in</hi> time in France was <persRef
								ref="morris-gouverneur">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Morris</persRef>, but that he had not married a Polish Lady; and
							untill very lately had not been married at-all— He told me that he was
							born in Portugal, and mentioned a number of Americans with whom he had
							been acquainted— <persRef ref="smith-william-loughton">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith</persRef> of S. Carolina, while
							he was Minister in Portugal— <persRef ref="temple-elizabeth">Lady
								Temple</persRef>— and <persRef ref="armstrong-john">Genl
								Armstrong</persRef>—who he said was very much respected at Paris,
							and had entirely fixed the public opinion.— He had seen him at Court
							last September, just before he left France to return home— That he had
							always lived in a very retired manner, and scarcely ever appeared at
							Court— That time however he had been, and was treated with very marked
							and particular distinction by the Emperor Napoleon; and it was the more
							noticed because it was immediately after the excellent Note which he had
							written to <persRef ref="champagny-jean">Monsieur de
							Champagny</persRef>, which had been universally admired for its Spirit
							and Independence, had been published.— I told him that I had reason to
							think that the Emperor Napoleon had by no means felt himself flattered
							by that Note— He said that was well known, and was the very reason why
							his distinction of Gen<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Armstrong was so
							remarkable— He then said that we were about to lose one of the members
							of the Corps Diplomatique here— The Ambassador was recalled. I asked him
							if he thought he was going, to be Minister of Foreign Affairs— No—he did
							not believe it— What then could be the motive for his recall?— perhaps a
							change in the state of the relations between the two Countries—a change
							of tone in the Negotiations— A new organ of Communication was sometimes
							convenient— A person after residing in a place some time formed
							connections, which made him less fit to hold a particular language. I
							told him I had heard that of late there was a softening in the
							discussions between France and Russia— That they were approaching to a
							better understanding with each other— He shook his head, and said that
							he sincerely wished it might be so—but intimated he had his doubts as to
							the fact. These visits occupied almost all the morning— The rest of the
							day I walked, read and wrote as usual. Read <persRef
								ref="massillon-jean">Massillon’s</persRef> Sermon upon the zeal
							incumbent upon the priesthood against vices— He enumerates the causes
							which contribute to slacken this zeal, and prompt them to blameable
							indulgence— their own corruptions— respect of persons— diffidence of
							themselves &amp;c— The passage in which he warns them against flattery
							&amp; obsequiousness to the great is excellent— I also read two Sections
							of <persRef ref="robinson-thomas">Robinson’s</persRef> Character of
							Jesus-Christ— It is strictly trinitarian; and refers to several books in
							defence of the Nicene Creed. I question whether there is any thing more
							powerful than Massillon’s Sermon.</p>

							and informed me that <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Lohman</persRef> had concluded not to go untill the opening of the
							Navigation. In walking my usual round this morning I met the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> upon the Fontanka— He stop’d,
							and talked about the weather— Said it was very windy, and that I was in
							the direction to have it shortly afterwards in the face— I told him that
							as it was not cold, and I had already been walking long enough to
							quicken the circulations, I should scarcely perceive the wind— I asked
							him whether this very warm weather which has now continued nearly a
							fortnight would not break up the river.— He said that it would be a very
							extraordinary instance if it did— That the river had never been known to
							break up before the middle of March; and sometimes not untill May— I
							observed that the last year it had waited untill the 30<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of April; but I thought it could not
							stand so long this Season— But, said he, we shall be paid for all this
							moderate weather before the winter ends— The Spring never begins before
							its time, without relapsing afterwards into winter— Even last year, on
							the 31<hi rend="superscript">st:</hi> of May, our Style, think of that,
							our Style, I was going to Twer, and had on the road a very considerable
							flight of Snow. We gain nothing by having mild weather too soon— While
							he was in the midst of these remarks, a Carriage and four pass’d us in
							the Street— He step’d aside from before me—put up his glass to see who
							was in the Carriage; bowed and took off his hat, and then step’d back to
							me, and finished the sentence which he had broken off in the middle— I
							continued my walk and soon afterwards met <persRef
								ref="luxbourg-charles">Count Lüxbourg</persRef>, who walked with me
							to the Corner of the Winter-Palace.— He spoke to me of the <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">Ambassador’s</persRef> recall, and said he
							had pass’d an hour with him yesterday conversing with him on the
							subject. From his language to Lüxbourg, is to be inferred exactly the
							same as from his Conversation with <persRef ref="montreal-f"
								>Montréal</persRef>— It is precisely in the same Spirit. He did not
							tell Lüxbourg that he had requested his own <pb n="224" type="ms"
							/>recall; but insinuated, that the climate was too severe for his
							health— That he had written of the attack he had of illness on the
							New-Year’s day— That it was necessary for him not to be too long absent
							from a new Court at home; so that he might have an opportunity to find
							and keep a suitable station at it. That <persRef ref="law-jacques"
								>General Lauriston</persRef> his successor, was a very good and very
							moderate man— That the dispositions of the French Government towards
							that of Russia were altogether friendly and pacific— That his recall was
							in terms of entire satisfaction with him; that he was left at liberty to
							take his leave immediately or to wait untill General Lauriston should
							arrive— That no particular Instructions would be given to the General,
							as the Duke would be best able to give him on his arrival every
							necessary direction. I told Lüxbourg that I was very glad to hear this,
							as the first appearance of so sudden recall of an Ambassador who was so
							much in favour here, at a time when some sharp discussions between the
							two Governments had been taking placed looked as if a new person was
							chosen to assume a different tone; and that this event had occasioned a
							great sensation here in the public.— He said it was true; and he thought
							the Ambassador would do well to give out explicitly that he had
							solicited his own recall— He added that he had heard from another
							quarter that the Emperor had had a long Conversation with the Ambassador
							since his recall; and had desired him on his return to France to
							represent the distress which Russia and all the Continent were suffering
							by the War; the impossibility for Russia to support it much longer; and
							to intimate the expediency of undertaking in concert a serious
							negotiation for a Peace— I asked Lüxbourg whether the Ambassador himself
							had told this— He said he had not— From what quarter then, said I, can
							it come, unless from the Emperor himself— He said he had it from
								<persRef ref="stedingk-kurt">Count Stedingk</persRef>— It is certain
							that the Ambassador takes pains to circulate the opinion that the views
							of France are entirely pacific— The Emperor and <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> appear not to be
							alarmed or uneasy at the Ambassador’s recall— Let us wait for the
							arrival of his successor.— In the Evening and read the Continuation of
								<persRef ref="bossuet-jacques">Bossuet</persRef>— A mere collection
							of materials for a Continuation— A Chronological index—dry, tedious, and
							in some places ridiculous.</p>

							1809. granting him leave of absence from the service, without limitation
							of time, and observing that he would not be entitled to pay untill
							called into actual service again— I told him I could not consider that
							as a discharge— He said that he had once before had a furlough for
							twelve months, and because he did not return untill three months after
							the time limited, which was impossible as he had been to the
							East-Indies, he found himself obliged when he went back to enter the
							service a new, with only his old rank; while in his absence many
							Officers had been promoted over him. He said he did not chuse to return
							again to the service, unless he could have advancement as if he had not

							myself bound to take any measure to prevent his admission into the
							Russian service; but to give him a certificate to obtain it I must be
							satisfied that he was discharged from that of the United States.— He
							said he must then endeavour to get along with the papers that he had.—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Navarro mentioned to me the arrival

							favour to the English, and was so much opposed to France— Nesselrode had
							answered that by the Treaties each of the two Governments had reserved
							to itself the right of making such Tariff and commercial prohibitions as
							it should see fit. That France had set the example, by prohibiting the
							importation of Russia leather, and loading Potash with excessive duties—
							And that there was in the Tariff no favour to the English— As to the
							remonstrances in favour of the <persRef ref="peter-friedrich">Duke of
								Oldenburg</persRef>, the Duke of Cadore said that <persRef
								ref="law-jacques">General Lauriston</persRef> would be instructed,

							day before yesterday; by whom he received a positive order to stay,
							untill the arrival of <persRef ref="law-jacques">Count

							that the Ambassador’s recall was at his own repeated solicitations, and

							For the current news of the day, such as is picked up by visits, and

							is the best informed man at this Court: But he gets no secret
							information: is often misinformed, and as to the History and

							trouble to make inquiries.— I read this day, <persRef
								ref="massillon-jean">Massillon’s</persRef> Sermon upon the <hi
								rend="italic">Vocation</hi> to the Clerical Office, which contains
							many curious particulars— His plan and divisions of the Discourse are as
							usual very ingenious, and applied with great address to the text— The
							signs of Vocation should be similar to those manifested by Jesus
							himself. The testimony of the Church—of the Public—and of the person’s
							own Conscience— All the arguments on the second head tend to prove that
							ordination ought to be founded upon popular election— Though the Bishop
							acknowledges that this is a heresy. There is a citation from <persRef
								ref="stgregorythegreat">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Gregory</persRef> which is almost ludicrous— It accounts for the

							of oil, <pb n="226" type="ms"/>and for the permanent establishment of
							David and his family upon the throne, because for the purpose of
							anointing him the prophet was ordered to fill a whole horn with oil.
							This is one of those quaint conceits, which are such blemishes to many
							of Massillon’s compositions. I continued to read <persRef
								ref="robinson-thomas">Robinson’s</persRef> character of Jesus; which
							containing more than a one volume of itself is a larger work, than any

							writing, and has admitted nobody.— In the mean time both parties

							or the day before 180 heavy Cannon were sent off from this City, in
							addition to all those that had been sent before— On the other hand
							France has just sent a large quantity of fire-arms to Dantzick and to

							from fifty to sixty thousand men.— I pass’d the Evening in my

						<p><date>21. </date>A Diplomatic dinner of about sixty persons at the
								<persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">French Ambassador’s</persRef>.—
							The <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Chancellor</persRef>, great
							Crown-Officers, Generals and foreign Ministers were there; all in full
							dress. Immediately after I went in <persRef ref="campenhausen-baltazar"
								>Baron Campenhausen</persRef> came to me and told me that it was
							better late than never; that he had been upwards of a fortnight upon
							pins, untill yesterday which had been the first day that he had been
							able to make his report to the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef>— That he was happy now to say that the cases of
							all the American vessels (excepting that of the Eliza at Archangel) were
							definitively decided— That the Cargoes and parts of Cargoes, which had
							not the necessary certificates should be admitted, on the engagement of
							the persons interested in them to produce the Certificates hereafter—
							That as to all the other small parcels, which were under other
							circumstances of irregularity, the Emperor had also ordered that they
							also should be admitted, and that thus every thing recognized as
							American should be cleared— With regard to the case of the Eliza, there
							might be some further delay— A Gentleman who had some interest in it,
							had called upon him once or twice; but could speak nothing but English;
							which he the Baron could not speak; and therefore they had found some
							difficulty in understanding one another.— That however he had already
							written his opinion, that the case was very strongly distinguishable
							from those of the pretended Teneriff vessels which were condemned and
							confiscated here last Summer—and the business would be eventually
							terminated to my satisfaction.— I thanked the Baron for his information,
							and especially for the final decision upon the cases which had been in
							suspense— And I asked him whether the Custom-House had received the
							orders for the admission of the merchandizes— He said that they would be
							expedited from the Commission for neutral Navigation to-morrow or the
							next day, and that he had told <persRef ref="stieglitz-ludwig">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Stieglitz</persRef> eight or ten days
							ago, that he might freely make advances upon the goods as much as if
							they were already admitted.— At table I sat between <persRef
								ref="bussche-calmor">Count Bussche</persRef>, and the French Consul
								<persRef ref="lesseps-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Lesseps</persRef>, and had conversation with both of them. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lesseps was in affliction; he had left an
								<persRef ref="lesseps-celeste">infant child</persRef> at home, at
							the point of death; by convulsions which had been followed by a violent
							fever— He did not expect it would live through the day— He had sent the
							Ambassador an excuse this morning, and had concluded to come only as the
							child had two or three hours of sleep which continued when he left
							home.— Count Bussche told me that A Courier was gone the day before
							yesterday to recall <persRef ref="kamensky-nikolay">General
								Kamensky</persRef> from the command of the army in Turkey, and that
								<persRef ref="u">General Kutusoff the Master of the Police</persRef>
							was appointed to go and take his place. I asked him what was the cause
							of this change—he said he did not know— Perhaps to employ Kamensky upon
							a more important command. He said that <persRef
								ref="chernyshyov-alexander">Chernicheff</persRef>, who was himself
							present at the dinner had brought a letter from the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef> to the Emperor
							Alexander, expressed in terms of friendship and kindness stronger than
							any that he had ever written before— But that there were other things
							which did not so well correspond to these professions— He also remarked
							that there were many of the Ministers and Generals here whom he did not
							know— That they were never seen only upon these great dinners, or at
							Court, and that if you asked who they were you seldom found any body who
							could tell you.— He said that his <persRef ref="bonaparte-jerome2">king
								(Jerom)</persRef> had a curiosity to know characters, and had given
							him instructions to report particulars respecting the most distinguished
							persons at this Court— But he had excused himself from executing this
							Commission— It was too difficult; and too dangerous.— The king had
							beaucoup d’esprit—but he was a young man, and perhaps had not altogether
							reflected upon the possible consequences of things— For his part he made
							it a principle to write nothing but what he might be prepared in the
							vicissitudes of this world to have all reported back here again— We
							talked also of the apparent avowal in the late French official Gazettes
							of the intention to annex all Spain to the French Empire— <persRef
								ref="u">Prince Dolgoruki</persRef>, who has just been appointed
							Minister to Naples, and who sat on the other side of Count Bussche took
							part in this Conversation, which he observed must be spoken in such a
							tone of voice that the Ambassador should not hear it. <persRef
								ref="dalopeus-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								d’Alopeus</persRef> sat next to the Prince. He too is appointed
							Minister to the <persRef ref="frederick-i-wurttemburg">king of
								Wurtemberg</persRef>; but with a permission to visit all the Courts
							of the Rhenish Confederation— <persRef ref="luxbourg-charles"
								>Luxbourg</persRef> supposes, to be a spy upon all their movements
							in these critical times— After dinner I conversed with <persRef
								ref="ouvarov-fedor">General Ouvaroff</persRef>, who has just
							returned from the Turkish army, and with <persRef
								ref="saltykov-aleksandr">Count Alexander Soltykoff</persRef>, who
							told me that the last census, or as they call it here Revision of the
							Empire was in the year 1795 or 1796; which was taken, before the regular
							period, which is at intervals of twenty years, on account of the final
							division of Poland, with the annexation of the Polish Provinces to the
							Empire— The Ambassador was apparently in a good humour, and his guests
							seemed more at his ease than they have appeared at some of his late
							parties; but the extraordinary attention paid by them to <persRef
								ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Julien</persRef>, the Austrian Envoy was remarkable— Excepting the
							Chancellor, Count Romanzoff, whom the Ambassador himself attended, all
							the other principal Ministers and Generals made a <pb n="228" type="ms"
							/>stand at the door untill the Count passed to go in to dinner. The
							Count was quite irradiated with this politeness; and bowed himself
							almost into a hoop as he step’d from the Circle to precede them— He sat
							at the Ambassador’s left hand at table. The <persRef
								ref="naryshkin-alexander">Grand Chamberlain Narishkin</persRef> told
							me that he had come last week from Moscow, where he had seen <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Harris</persRef>— I told Count Romanzoff that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Harris was very much pleased with Moscow, on which he said
							cela ne me contrarie point du tout, d’entendre qu’on s’amuse à Moscow—
							Cela ne me contrarie point du tout is a phrase of the Counts to signify
							that it gives him great pleasure— I came home quite early this Evening,
							and pass’d the remainder of it in conversation, and at Cards.</p>

							called upon <persRef ref="navarro-rodrigo">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Navarro</persRef>, and had half an hour’s conversation
							with him. He seems to expect that Russia will commence an offensive War
							against France; in which I believe him to be mistaken.— I rose this
							morning very early and in the course of the day wrote one or two short
							letters— Read also much in the newspapers; which I consider as time
							lost— It was a day of <hi rend="italic">leisure</hi>, which I seldom
							have at present— Letter-writing and Journalizing occupies almost all my
							time. The Evening was divided between Short-hand, <persRef

							to have written a page— But the Gazettes came in, and a letter from
								<persRef ref="hazard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Hazard</persRef> at Copenhagen, which employed the Evening hours
							untill eleven, and I gave up the writing for this day; or in other words
							procrastinated.— We have now the first Supplement to the Winter— My

							the Academy’s Register— The coldest exposition is that of the
