						<p><date>1. </date>Morning visit from <persRef ref="navarro-rodrigo">M<hi

							Treaty as published by <persRef ref="martens-georg">Martens</persRef> in

							dinner, and a long one after, in which I was overtaken by Rain— It gave
							me a Cold in the midst of my regimen— <persRef
								ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Smith</persRef> dined abroad. In the Evening I read a number of
								<persRef ref="porter-robert">Porter’s</persRef> letters; which I
							still find amusing; and they are remarkably easy to read.— The
							descriptions of the objects which he saw in this Country are generally
							accurate, and from a hand still more accustomed to paint than to write—
							Difficile est communia proprie dicere, says <persRef ref="horace"
								>Horace</persRef>, if I remember right— In my family letters I often
							feel the embarrassment of telling with propriety trivial things: and in
							these letters of Porter, I find myself forestalled upon many subjects
							upon which I intended to write. I have however given to my <persRef

							Easter-Holidays.</p>

									>r:</hi> Benedict Cramer</persRef> paid me a visit this morning,
							for the purpose of explaining to me the Circumstances, under which he
							was induced the last Autumn to give his opinion in the case of the
							sugars imported from the Havanna— He complained that he had been in the
							first instance misled by <persRef ref="campenhausen-baltazar">Baron
								Campenhausen</persRef>— That his opinion had afterwards been
							misrepresented, and finally that artifice had been used to suppress the
							explanation and apology for his conduct which he had given— Baron
							Campenhausen had sent for him; and on his going he had found with him
								<persRef ref="severin-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> P.
								Severin</persRef>, the foreman of his sugar refinery, and a Clerk of
							the Custom-house— The Baron had shewn him some specimens of sugars,
							saying that they had been imported in a vessel called Die Freundschaft,
							a German name, and that they came from England— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Heimburger</persRef>, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Severin’s foreman holding up some of the
							Sugar said there was not a boy in the Streets of Hamburg, but could
							pronounce <pb n="242" type="ms"/>them on bare inspection to be crushed
							lumps. All the other persons present agreed to this opinion, and as it
							appeared to be the Baron’s determination so to consider them, it was
							dangerous to express a doubt upon the subject— Nevertheless that he M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Cramer, with regard to one or two of the
							specimens not only had his doubts, but both from the Appearance and
							smell of the sugar had taken it to be white Havanna, and had said so at
							the time.— Afterwards <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Andrews</persRef> had spoken and complained to him of the opinion he
							had given— He had offered to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Andrews to
							do every thing in his power to rectify the mistake, and to remove the
							difficulties with the Government here, which had been occasioned by it;
							but M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Andrews had been exasperated, and
							refused his assistance— Since then, <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wallis</persRef>, Super Cargo of a
							vessel at Archangel had written to him that he had been directed to
							consign his Cargo to the House of Cramer, but having been informed that
							he had taken part against the Americans upon the question concerning the
							sugars, he had felt it his duty to address himself to another house— He
							had written a long letter of explanation, and to justify himself to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wallis, to which that Gentleman had not
							thought proper to give any answer— And as by the reports which had been
							circulated against him the house had thus already been injured and might
							be still more so, he had called upon Baron Campenhausen, and requested
							him to certify to me his M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cramer’s opinion
							as he had really given it— The Baron had asked him what he could do for
							him? It was impossible to expect he would write any thing contrary to
							the opinion he had heretofore given; but he finally promised, when he
							should see me to speak to me upon the subject, and to tell me what
							opinion M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Cramer had really given; and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Cramer’s request to me was, that if
							Baron Campenhausen should perform this promise, of which he would take
							care to have him again reminded, and any occasion should occur when I
							could correct the misrepresentations which had gone abroad against him,
							I would so far befriend him; which I readily promised— I told him that I
							had heard much of this business at the time when it was in discussion,
							and had been under the necessity of speaking to <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> about it— But I
							had never said any thing of it to Baron Campenhausen, and the
							Correspondence had all been managed by <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris</persRef>— I had indeed been
							surprized and mortified on hearing that he and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Severin had concurred in giving an opinion which might have
							occasioned the confiscation of a large property belonging to Countrymen
							of mine, upon suspicions which I had no doubt were groundless, but M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Severin had never mentioned the subject
							to me, nor I to him. I was glad however to hear his explanation, and
							should be happy to contradict any misstatement of his conduct if any
							proper occasion for it should present itself— He told me that he had
							given an explanation entirely satisfactory to <persRef
								ref="dana-francis2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Dana</persRef>,
							who had formed a commercial connection with his house— This Circumstance
							had been mentioned to me by M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris, who
							had been not a little chagrined at it; though I believe he must impute
							it to himself.— I dined at <persRef ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi
									rend="superscript">t:</hi> Julien’s</persRef>; with a small
							Company— <persRef ref="ouvarov-fedor">General Ouvaroff</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="pardo-benito">General Pardo</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="laval-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Laval</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Ribaupierre</persRef>—with <persRef ref="schubert-friedrich">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Schubert</persRef> the Director of
							the Academy of Sciences, and the <persRef ref="lebzeltern-ludwig"
								>Count’s Secretaries Lebzaltern</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
								>Berks</persRef>— The Count apologized for a departure from
							etiquette in having sent Cards of invitation for an unceremonious
							dinner— His other guests had been as much perplexed as General Pardo and
							myself, to know how they should go dressed— At dinner the Count
							mentioned his having been last Evening at <persRef ref="stroganov-anna"
								>Countess Strogonoff’s</persRef>, and suddenly having found out that
							the <persRef ref="katharine-amalie">Princess Amelia of Baden</persRef> was there— Upon which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Laval told an anecdote, of a person who
							once met the same Princess at the same house— While they were there the
							Princess asked if <persRef ref="elizabeth-alexeievna"><hi rend="italic"
									>her Sister</hi> (the Empress)</persRef> had not pass’d by in a
							Carriage; and the Gentleman had answered, “I dont know, but if you will
							tell me her name I will go and see.”— Ah! said Count S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Julien that must have been a stranger
							like one of us.— No said M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Laval—very far
							from it—quite another person—but he did not name him— So that it was not
							explained whether it was an instance of ignorance or of insolence— But
							at any rate it marks the tone of treatment which both the Empress and
							her Sister meet at this Court.— I had after dinner much conversation
							with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Laval, who says that the War is not
							so near as is pretended, and confirmed me in the opinion I had that many
							of the current war rumours are invented by the party who are labouring
							to plunge the Emperor into the War, offensively.— Laval says the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> sees this as clearly as
							he or I do, and that he will not be guided by that party— In the Evening
							I paid a visit to <persRef ref="betancourt-anna">Madame de
								Betancourt</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="betancourt-adelina;betancourt-carolina">her
							daughters</persRef>— The <persRef ref="betancourt-august"
								>General</persRef> was not at home— While I was there M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris came in— Closed the Evening at
							home, without reading or writing.</p>

								>Chevalier Brancia</persRef>, the Neapolitan Chargé des Affaires— He

						<p><date>6. </date>Morning visit from <persRef ref="raimbert-francois">M<hi

									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Rodde</persRef> of Revel, upon
								<persRef ref="gray-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Gray’s</persRef> vessels that have wintered there and are coming to
							Cronstadt— He told me also that he had just come from the <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">Ambassador’s</persRef>: that he hoped
							there would be no War— That they were afraid here— I afterwards paid a
							visit to the Ambassador myself and found him at home— He enquired if I
							had any recent accounts of the State of our affairs with France or
							England— I told him all I had heard—and said that after the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon’s</persRef> declaration in
							the answer to the deputation from Hamburg, Lubeck and Bremen, all we
							could do would be to wait with patience— The Emperor said that the
							decrees of Berlin and Milan for all Nations that did not support their
							flag, against the British Orders in Council— The British would not
							revoke them— We had nothing left to maintain our flag but War— And in a
							War with England, we should have no flag— When we have two hundred ships
							of the line, and a navy in proportion we may talk of maintaining our
							flag by War— Now, it would be ridiculous— He said he wished it were
							possible to see a prospect of Peace— I observed that according to
							general opinion it was more remote than ever— Though I understood the
							hope of preserving Peace between France and Russia was now stronger than
							some time ago— Oh! Oui! said he— J’espere que tout cela <hi
								rend="italic">se civilisera</hi>— I do not see any great interests
							upon which the two Countries need to quarrel; nor even any small
							interests which may not easily be arranged to their mutual satisfaction.
							And then he repeated j’espere que tout cela se civilisera— I asked him
							if he expected <persRef ref="law-jacques">General Lauriston</persRef>
							soon to arrive—he answered to day, or to-morrow.— Indeed he might have
							been here before this— A Courier who arrived three days ago left him at
							Dantzick.— I said [“]I had heard that there had been a change in the
							Department of Foreign Affairs in France—that the <persRef
								ref="champagny-jean">Duke de Cadore</persRef> was no longer the
							Minister”— “It was true— The Minister appointed in his place was the
								<persRef ref="maret-hugues">Duke de Bassano</persRef>[”]— I remarked
							that he had been long and constantly engaged in public Affairs, and
							Secretary, I believe ever since the Executive Council— The Ambassador
							said I was mistaken— That the Secretary under the Directory was <persRef
								ref="u">La Garde</persRef>, and Maret came in only at the time of
							the Consulate— He did not know what was the occasion of the Duke de
							Cadore’s going out— It was only mentioned to him in a private letter of
							16. April, the day when it happened, and when the Courier was to have
							left Paris— I asked if it would probably produce any material change in
							the political system— No— The Emperor governs so much by himself, that a
							Minister is nothing more than the pen, and not the hand that guides it—
							I asked if the <persRef ref="tallyrand-charles">Prince of
								Benevento</persRef> had not still some Superintendance over the
							department of foreign affairs— No— He had no hand in the public affairs
							at present; but was altogether in retirement— His capacity as a
							Grand-Dignitaire was that of Vice-Grand-Elector, the <hi rend="italic"
								>double</hi>, of the <persRef ref="bonaparte-joseph">king of
								Spain</persRef>, who was Grand-Elector. This was a place not of <pb
								n="244" type="ms"/>business, but merely of Representation— Its only
							duty was to present to the Emperor the Senators, and members of the
							Legislative Body. The only Office of a diplomatic Nature, in Rank above
							that of the Minister of Exterior Relations was the Arch-Chancellor of
							State; which was held by the <persRef ref="debeauharnais-eugene"
								>Vice-Roy of Italy</persRef>.— I asked him whether he expected to
							go, soon after the arrival of his Successor— He said in three or four
							days— That he had had full time to be prepared, and should be impatient
							to get home— I asked him if he would do me the favour to take a small
							packet of letters for <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Russell</persRef>, which he promised
							to do with pleasure— He said that shortly before his departure he would
							give me notice, and call to take leave of <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef>— From his house I went to visit <persRef
								ref="laval-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laval</persRef>, but
							did not find him at home.— I then called upon <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wiggers</persRef> heretofore the
							Agent from the Hanseatic Cities, and returned him the French History of
							that League which he lent me last Summer, and which I have kept from
							that time— I had a long conversation with him— He does not believe in a
							War with France for the present year. After this visit I dismissed my
							Carriage, and walked round by the Fontanka home— I met the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> who stop’d and conversed with
							me: at first as usual about the weather, which he remarked was warmer
							and finer he said than he remembered ever to have known it, so early in
							the season— But he was afraid we should have it balanced by foul weather
							hereafter— Snow, it was at least certain we should have—for he had never
							known, and there never had been known here an instance of a month of May
							passing entirely without Snow— I said that now the weather was rather
							that of an Italian Spring— He remarked that it was very long since he
							had seen me, and asked if I had abandoned my habit of walking— I
							answered that I had not, but I believed that it was the hour at which I
							usually walked that deprived me of the happiness of meeting his Majesty—
							He said that he had often of late been so engaged in business that he
							could not take his usual walks; and sometimes he had gone out of the
							usual track, which might also have contributed to the length of time
							since he had met me— He then said the Ice from the Ladoga was passing
							down, (he was coming from the river—I was going towards it) but that
							there was not much of it, and the weather was so moderate he thought
							there would not be so much as usual— He then made a movement as if to
							leave me, and I was about to bow and turn from him, when he step’d back
							to me and leaning on the iron-railing of the Canal asked me if I had any
							late accounts from home— I told him I had letters to the 20<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of February— He asked if they contained
							information of any particular importance?— I said they did not— That the
							occurrence of principal note of which I had heard was the arrival of the
							new <persRef ref="serurier-louis">French Minister, Serrurier</persRef>,
							to replace the former one <persRef ref="turreau-louis">General
								Turreau</persRef>— He asked me what the state of our Affairs with
							England was— I— answered that they remained in an unsettled state— That
								<persRef ref="armstrong-john">our Minister</persRef> there had taken
							leave and was gone; but he had left a <persRef ref="russell-jonathan"
								>Chargé des Affaires</persRef> there; and that the English
							Government had sent out a <persRef ref="foster-augustus">new Minister to
								the United States,</persRef> who as <persRef ref="perceval-spencer"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Perceval</persRef> had said in
							Parliament carried out some new propositions from England— I added that
							I had heard <persRef ref="smith-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Smith</persRef>, a Gentleman who had been with me, and had had the
							honour of being presented to his Majesty, would be chargé d’Affaires in
							England— But, said the Emperor, did not he go from here to Vienna? I
							said he did; and was now at Paris— But I had heard he was to be the
							Chargé d’Affaires in England— It is a place of some importance, said His
							Majesty, is it not?— I said of very considerable importance—especially
							in the present state of the relations between the United States, and
							England— And, said he, I hear you have lately made an acquisition— I
							observed, I supposed his Majesty meant in Florida—he said that was what
							he meant— But said he, it appears to have been a spontaneous movement of
							the People themselves, who were desirous of joining themselves to the
							United States— I said, so it appeared from the accounts which I had
							seen, but that I had received no Communication from my Government upon
							this subject— I added that this was a part of the Territory which had
							been ceded by France to the United-States in the Louisiana Treaty— That
							Spain however had entered into a controversy with us about it, upon
							which Negotiations were pending at the time when the great changes in
							the Government of Spain itself had taken place— That since then the
							People of that Country had been left in a sort of abandonment by Spain,
							and must naturally be very desirous of being annexed to the
							United-States—under these Circumstances the United States have taken
							possession of the Country— The Emperor smiled and said “on s’aggrandit
							toujours un peu, dans ce Monde”—and bowed; upon which I quitted him and
							continued my walk.— We had been standing so long that numbers of People
							between the two Bridges had observed us, and from the time when I left
							him, untill I had got beyond the distance where we could be seen

							me about a poor merchant, one <persRef ref="krehmer-benedict">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Cramer</persRef>, whom he had sent
							for to take his opinion last Autumn about some sugars at Archangel, and
							who together with other persons whom he had also called to give their
							opinions had taken them for refined sugars, powdered— That he had lately
							been to him and complained that this affair had injured him exceedingly—
							That <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Harris</persRef> had written to America charging him with having
							taken part against the Americans, and it had affected him very seriously
							in his business— That M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Cramer had
							requested him to speak to me about it; and he could assure me that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Cramer had no knowledge whatsoever that
							it was sugar imported by Americans; which must acquit him of any
							intention to injure Americans in their trade— I told the Baron that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cramer had spoken to me on this subject
							and that I had heard a great deal of it, at the time while the character
							of the sugars was in question— That several Americans had indeed at the
							time been much alarmed on finding themselves suspected and inculpated of
							an intended fraud upon the Government; and when they found such charges
							and suspicions countenanced by an opinion said to have been delivered by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Cramer, when consulted by the
							Government, it was natural that they should feel resentment against him,
							and that it should have affected him in his business— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Cramer had told me however not only that
							he had not known the sugars to be the property of Americans, but that he
							had been of a different opinion from that of the other persons
							consulted, with respect to a part of the Samples. This fact was more
							material to his justification, than whether he did or did not know to
							whom the property belonged, and this was what he had told me the Baron
							would attest for him— The Baron said it was true M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cramer had at first expressed a doubt with regard to one of
							the samples, but he as well as the other Gentlemen had finally assented
							to the opinion of the sugar-refiner, who came from Hamburg— That, I said
							was the misfortune, as it was now ascertained that they were all
							mistaken, and the sugar refiner as much as all the rest— The sugars were
							raw white Havanna, and not refined sugar powdered— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Cramer with the other Gentlemen had made
							a mistake unfortunate now for himself, but with regard to the intention
							I believed he was not to blame, and if the <pb n="247" type="ms"
							/>occasion should offer I would say as much in his favour.— Upon this I
							left the Baron and continued my walk.— The whole of this transaction has
							proved to me the evil and the danger of excessive jealousy and suspicion
							in the management of public business— The Baron himself was the dupe of
							his own suspicions— He endeavoured in a cunning way to get the opinions
							of merchants to sanction his suspicions. He succeeded to get the
							opinion, but it was an error; its effect was almost to ruin one of the
							merchants from whom he had drawn an incautious and mistaken opinion, and
							now he is reduced to exculpate the man, whom he injured by a captious
							and insidious consultation— He says he refused to tell them to whom the
							sugars belonged— Cramer says he deceived them by using German names to
							designate American vessels— Under the semblance of an impartial
							examination, it was an unfair snare laid for the merchants whom he
							consulted, as well as for the importers whose property was at stake— And
							all to indulge suspicions— Give me, in every station of life, and every
							crisis of affairs an open and a candid mind— At the new Exchange I saw
							the progress of the square and the semi-circular quay in its front; and
							for the first time the Colossal figures to be placed at the sides of the
							rostral columns— They are not yet finished— On returning home I found a
							Card from the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">Duke of
								Vicence</persRef> to take leave; and one from the <persRef
								ref="law-jacques">Comte de Lauriston</persRef> announcing himself,
							as Ambassador Extraordinary from France.— <persRef ref="woodward-c2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Woodward</persRef> called upon

							left Count Schenk’s the new french Ambassador drove up to the door in
							his Carriage and left a Card without getting out— He pass’d me

								n="248" type="ms"/>and called at <persRef ref="stedingk-kurt">Count
								Stedingk’s</persRef>, but he was not at home— I walked round upon
							the river Quay, and through the Summer-Gardens, where I found some
							elegant Company— The Bridge to Kammenoi-Ostroff is just putting up for
							the summer— On returning home, I found the Ambassador’s Cards— He had
							been going through one of the most inconvenient and absurd, but best
							established usages of this place— That of going a round of visits in
							full Court dress; and leaving Cards at every house, without enquiring
							whether the persons visited are at home, or ever getting out of the
							Carriage— There is so much punctilio in this usage, that it admits of no
							substitute— It is not sufficient to send a servant with a Card, nor even
							to send round your Carriage— Nay, if you go yourself, unless it be in
							full dress, the visit is not duly paid— You must be seen in full dress
							by all the Porters; but it is understood that you are only to leave a
							Card— This is called a diplomatic visit paid in person— I walked again
							in the Evening— Met and walked with <persRef ref="pardo-benito">General
								Pardo</persRef>, a phenomenon of human character— An excellent
							classical scholar; a profound Connoisseur in the Arts— A Spaniard the
							proudest of his Nation that I ever knew; a most impassioned Spanish
							Patriot, in their present struggle against France, and yet, appearing
							here as the Minister of <persRef ref="bonaparte-joseph">King
								Joseph</persRef>. a Lieutenant General by his appointment; and
							wearing a great “blushing ribband” of his order— He is of all the men
							that I was ever acquainted the one whose discourse is the most
							constantly in hostility with his situation and conduct— Yet his
							conversation is agreeable— His great intellectual deficiency is
							judgment— His characteristic want is energy— Such a composition is rare—
							Taste, Learning, and a brilliant imagination, without steadiness of
							brain or firmness of heart.— He told me the Duke de Vicence would go
							to-morrow night.</p>

								Harris</persRef>, who came to tell me that he should call with the
								<persRef ref="richelieu-armand">Duke de Richelieu</persRef>, which
							he did about an hour after— The Duke is Governor of Odessa, and now here
							upon a visit, as he has been about six weeks— He is of the antient and
							high nobility of the french monarchy, and was an emigrant; but has been
							many years in the Russian service.— He told me that he had an army list
							of France for the year 1790—in which the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="law-jacques">Count Lauriston</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="savary-anne">Savary</persRef> were all down, as second
							lieutenants in the regiment of La Fere— He spoke to me also of the
							American trade to the Black Sea, and wished that the admission of
							American vessels to it might be stipulated in the Treaty of Peace
							between Russia and the Porte; to which he supposed the Turks would
							readily agree, and which he was only afraid would be forgotten— After a
							short morning walk I went and dined at <persRef ref="vonblome-otto"
								>Baron Blome’s</persRef> with a Company of fifty persons— It was a
							great diplomatic dinner in full state; given to the New Ambassador; and
							attended by the usual company of Generals and Ministers— There was a
							band of music which performed during the whole dinner time— <persRef
								ref="pardo-benito">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Pardo</persRef>
							told me that he did not like music at dinner— It was too heating— The
								<persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">Duke de Vicence</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="derayneval-maximilien">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Rayneval</persRef> were not there. The Duke was too much engaged in
							his preparations for departure— I spoke to <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris’s request; desiring him to urge
							the publication by the Senate of the Ukaze, recognizing <persRef
								ref="dana-francis2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Dana</persRef>,
							as American Vice-Consul at Archangel— The Count said he would bear it in
							mind and do what he could; but there was a routine in these publications
							of the Senate, which moved very slow, and was not easy to quicken. He
							had known it in several instances, and particularly in the case of a
							French Consul.— The dinner was short and I came home about seven in the
							Evening. I was from that time employed untill near midnight, in
							preparing a packet to send by the Duke de Vicence to <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Russell</persRef> the American Chargé d’Affairs at Paris— The Duke

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith</persRef> was out, and as

						<p><date>19. </date>The morning being fine, and as on rising I heard the

							<persRef ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript"

							was a mixture of Infantry, Cavalry and Artillery— I marked the Hulon
							Regiment, every man of whom carries a little red and white pennant at
							the top of his pike.— The arrangement of baggage appears well adapted
							for marches, and to diminish the incumbrances of a large train— The
							Emperor’s review is not long— It consists in his galloping from one end
							to the other of the line, and back again— After which the troops file
							off on the palace Square before him— I came home about 11. O’Clock, much
							fatigued— <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Harris</persRef> soon after called upon me with some very important
							and mysterious news from America contained in the English Newspapers,
							which <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> has
							received— But as I laughed a little at what he first told me, he
							reserved the rest which had more probability— He afterwards came &amp;
							dined with us.— After dinner we rode with the <persRef

								>Ladies</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> to Kammenoi Ostroff, and saw the earliest

								>Massillon’s</persRef> discourse on the Zeal of the Ministers of God
							against Vice— It is a sequel to that which I had read last Sunday— The

							not come, with Post-Horses, having lost all the money furnished him for
							his Journey, at play— He found there was a vessel in the harbour of
							Stockholm ready to sail for Cronstadt; went on board at a hazard, and in
							forty two hours landed at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg—
							The shortest time in which a Courier can possibly come by land is six or
							seven days— Pahlen therefore was rewarded by an advancement in the
							service, for his good luck in a favourable wind— This was the
							commencement of his fortune— But his conduct to <persRef ref="paul-i"
								>Paul</persRef> was not to be justified, and he lost the favour of
							the present <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> immediately
							after his accession; by going to Revel and staying there six weeks
							without necessity, and spending his time in nothing but drinking
							champaign Wine and playing Pharaoh.— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Schenbom loves to talk thus of distinguished persons— He is a good
							scandalous chronicle— I took a short walk before dinner, and went
							through the Summer Gardens— Met and walked with <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Prevost</persRef>, who told me that
							the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">Duke de Vicence</persRef> had
							left this City on Sunday, about Noon; and expected to lodge this Night
							at <persRef ref="lowenstern-vladimir">Baron Löwenstern’s</persRef>, near
							Riga.— On Saturday morning he had an interview with the Emperor, who had
							given him a box with his picture, with his own hand, saying it was a
							great likeness, and that he gave it not as to the Ambassador, but as a
							token of his particular friendship— He embraced him several times; bade
							him Adieu in the most affectionate manner, and even shed tears— Prevost
							said the Duke was much affected by the numerous marks of esteem and
							regret shewn him at his departure. and they were well merited— He lived
							here in a style of princely magnificence; and he was one of the most
							accomplished gentlemen in his manners that I ever knew— His civilities
							and attentions were always obliging, and without pretension or
							affectation— His personal disposition was moderate, and pacific— He had
							perhaps made himself too agreeable here for the purposes of his own
							Government— In his family it is said he was passionate and violent, and
							he had connections of gallantry in which he indulged <pb n="250"
								type="ms"/>himself too much without reserve— It engrossed too much
							of his time— It laid him open too much to the Government here; and it
							occasioned scandal in a Country by no means scrupulous for the purity of
							their Morals— The Emperor’s presents to him at his departure are upwards
							of a hundred thousand rubles in value—three or four times as much as is
							customary to give. The more I see of this usage, the more I approve the
							principle adopted by the Government of the United States to prohibit
							altogether the acceptance by their Ministers, of any such presents— I

							account of this examination in a letter to one of my friends— I am sorry
							I cannot introduce it here— But I have not the time— The performances
							were in French, Latin and Russian, the last of which I of course did not
							understand— The young men and boys, maintained Theses of Philosophy and
							Mathematics in the syllogistic form against the objections of several of
							the Auditory— One of the objectors was <persRef ref="demaistre-joseph"
								>Count Maistre</persRef>— The students are not always effectually
							prepared to answer the arguments urged against them; and they were
							sometimes assisted and even prompted by their instructors— This form of
							examination is however a very strong test of their progress. They also
							explained, analysed and translated passages of <persRef ref="virgil"
								>Virgil</persRef>, recited some rules of Russian Grammar, and
							answered various questions relative to the use of the Globes— The Hall
							was about the size of the Philosophy chamber at Cambridge— The company
							about 70 or 80 persons; ladies and Gentlemen— The students about forty
							from 12 to 19 or 20 years of age.— <persRef ref="u">Countess
								Tolstoy</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">her Daughter</persRef>, and

								ref="smith-william-steuben;everett-alexander;gray-francis">Gentlemen
								of my family</persRef>— After dinner I attended the second day’s
							examination of the students at the Jesuits College. It lasted nearly
							four hours and turned altogether upon Mathematics and Arithmetic— The
							first Classes answered upon Algebra, Trigonometry, Conic Sections;
							calculation of eclipses and Geometry—the smaller boys upon
							multiplication division, and the rule of three— The exhibition was
							tedious to the extreme, and intelligible scarcely to a person of the
							auditory— But it indicates a much greater attention to mathematical
							studies than is paid in our Country, which is natural, where the
							military profession is almost the only one for which the young men are
							educated— The company was nearly the same as before— I walk’d home, by
							my usual grand tour round the Fontanka and by the river Quay— It was
							almost eleven at Night when I reached home— I received this morning the
							notice of a launch for Saturday Morning.</p>

						<p><date>31. </date>The loss of one Night’s rest commonly occasions a large
							encroachment upon the studious hours of the next morning— I rose late
							this day, and from Breakfast time had scarcely leisure enough to bring
							up the arrears of my journal— I had visits from <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Harris</persRef>, <persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Fisher</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Captain
								Hayes</persRef>, and I took my usual morning’s walk— On the
							Fontanka, near the Bridge through which the Canal joins the river I met
							the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> walking— As he
							approached me, he said; Monsieur Adams, il y a cent ans que je ne vous
							ai vu, and coming up took and shook me with great cordiality by the
							hand— After some common observations upon the weather which has been
							very fine, which this day was cold and autumnal, and which he thought
							would yet come to snow, before the end of the month, Russian style, he
							asked me whether I intended to take a house in the Country this Summer—
							I said no— That I had for some time had such an intention but had given
							it up— And why so, said he?— I was hesitating upon an answer, when he
							relieved me from embarrassment by saying [“]Peut-être sont ce des
							considerations de Finance”— As he said it in perfect good humour, and
							with a smile, I replied in the same manner— Mais— Sire— Elles y sont
							pour une bonne part— Fort bien; said he—vous avez raison— Il faut
							toujours proportionner la dépense à la recette— A maxim worthy of an
							Emperor, though few Emperors practice upon it— He then asked me if I had
							received any late news from America— I said I had— He replied that he
							also had lately received some very interesting despatches from <persRef
								ref="vonderpahlen-friedrich">Count Pahlen</persRef>, which had given
							him much pleasure— He asked how our affairs stood with England— I said
							they had a very hostile appearance, and that the English Journals were
							threatening us with the last extremities; but that my own letters from
							America did not appear to expect that a War would ensue— It has however
							said he very much that appearance—at least if we believe the French
							Journals— But, au reste—he added, we know how much the Moniteur is to be
							believed; and that certain deductions are to be made from whatever that
							contains— I said to be sure— People were very apt to publish as fact,
							what they had an interest and a wish to believe— On this he made me his
							usual parting bow, or rather military salute by raising his hand to his
							hat and pursued his walk— I continued mine and returned home to dinner—
							Soon after 6 in the Evening, I went and attended the third and last
							day’s examination of the pupils at the Jesuit’s school— The Examination
							was of the four Classes, and being upon subjects more easily
							comprehended than the sublimer mathematics of last Evening I was much
							better entertained with it— French and latin Grammar— Geography,
							Mythology— Prosody— Passages from <persRef ref="virgil"
								>Virgil’s</persRef> Eclogues, and from <persRef ref="gresset-jean"
								>Gresset’s</persRef> French translation of them— Rhetoric; with a
							recitation and illustration by analysis of <persRef ref="massillon-jean"
								>Massillon’s</persRef> funeral eulogy upon <persRef
								ref="delatourauvergne-henri">Turenne</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> Oration pro Rege Dejotara,
							furnished the materials for the examination— The exercises closed by
							what we should call at our Colleges a Conference, upon the respective
							merit of the Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, and light troops for military
							service— Four of the young men delivered discourses on the superior
							merit, which each of these modes of service might claim; and a fifth
							opened the subject to the Auditory, and sat as umpire of the contest— He
							adjudged the palm of utility to the Infantry, assigned the next place to
							the Cavalry—the third to the Artillery, and regretted that he had not a
							fourth prize to bestow, upon the Cossacks, the Hulons, and the Hussars—
							The controversy was very well supported, and each of the young men
							delivered his part, as well as would be done by most of our College
							Speakers— Oratory however is less cultivated here than with us, and in
							that respect the <pb n="253" type="ms"/>performances are inferior to
							ours; as in the mathematics they are much superior— The printed notice
							of the exercises says that the discourses of the young martial
							disputants were composed by themselves; but this must be taken as the
							Emperor takes the news in the Moniteur— After the performances were
							finished the prizes, (books handsomely bound) were distributed, to the
							Students who had excelled, by application and success—two to each Class—
							Their names were publicly proclaimed by one of the fathers; and the
							Minister of public Instruction gave them the books.— It was about 10 at
							Night when all was finished. On returning home I found M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris and <persRef ref="jones-thomas3"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jones</persRef> with the
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
