						<p><date>3. </date><persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
								Romanzoff</persRef> had appointed me to call upon him this morning
							at 11. O’Clock, which I accordingly did— I found an Officer with him,
							who immediately retired—the Count told me he had been at their
							settlement on the North-West Coast of America, and gave him an
							indifferent account of it— He was afraid they would never be able to
							make much of it— He then enquired upon what business I had desired to
							see him— I told him it was on the same subject concerning which I had
							seen him and written to him already; the American vessels, for the
							admission of whose Cargoes the permission had not yet been obtained—
							That <persRef ref="campenhausen-baltazar">Baron Campenhausen</persRef>,
							after requesting me to detain my Courier several days had written me,
							yesterday was a week that the business might be considered as settled
							with regard to a list which included almost all the American vessels—
							But that last Evening the Commission for neutral Navigation had received
							no orders for their admission—that I had understood nothing was now
							wanting but the signature of the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef>, and that the papers had been sent to the <persRef ref="speransky-mikhail">Secretary General
								Speransky</persRef> to lay them before his Majesty— That my
							Countrymen here interested in this affair were anxious and uneasy, and
							naturally resorted to me to give them all the assistance in my power—
							That I must of course resort in the same manner to him, and came to ask
							him whether the business could not be expedited— He said that the
							Circumstances being as I had mentioned to him, there was no reason for
							the persons interested to be alarmed; (de s’effaroucher) that according
							to the course of business here it was much easier to obtain a <hi
								rend="italic">decision</hi> than a <hi rend="italic">signature</hi>;
							as he had often found by his own experience; and that the delay
							necessarily arose from the multiplicity of business and the great
							multitude of signatures which were to be given— That however he would
							pay immediate attention to the subject, and speak to the Emperor about
							it <hi rend="italic">dés demain</hi>—even to-morrow— He then generalized
							the Conversation— And after according to his custom desired me to take
							what he should say as from a private individual and to answer him
							equally divested of all official character, he assured me that when he
							was Minister of Commerce, he had been extremely desirous of giving every
							encouragement and facility to the Commerce of the United-States with
							this Country—that since he was no longer in that situation he still
							retained the same ardent desire, and it led him to reflect upon the
							expedients, by which in the present embarrassed state of commercial
							affairs in Europe, it might be benefited— The idea had occurr’d to him
							to enquire whether by the encouragement of some premium, or some
							preference for admission, American vessels might not be employed to
							bring money, for the Cargoes, which they should take in return.— For
							that said he, is what M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Campenhausen
							wants— I told him that he knew the United-States produced no gold or
							silver of their own; and all the money that our merchants could export,
							must therefore previously be drawn from other Countries—which were
							South-America, the West-Indies or Spain and Portugal. That the nature of
							our Commerce, the length of the voyages, and the expences of all
							commercial undertakings between America and Russia, made it an essential
							object to the merchant to make a profit upon both parts of the
							voyage—outward and homeward. That he could not afford to send a vessel
							out in ballast, and depend only upon the profit of a Cargo in return—
							But that if the Government should think proper to give a benefit or
							premium upon the importation of silver adequate to a reasonable profit
							upon a Cargo of merchandize, I had no doubt but that our merchants would
							send money here, as they were accustomed to do to China, and to India—
							He said I had taken up the subject in a more extensive view than he had
							intended— It was true, that by making it the interest of the merchant to
							send money, money would no doubt be sent— But his idea was whether it
							might not be confined to American vessels—to secure for them peculiar
							facilities of admission— I told him that hitherto they had found no
							difficulty in obtaining admission— The Government had given all sorts of
							facility for the mere admission of all vessels— Their papers were now
							not even subject to examination by the neutral <pb n="196" type="ms"
							/>neutral Commission, provided they came in ballast— I could not
							therefore perceive what favour could be extended to them for bringing a
							cargo of silver unless it was in the nature of a premium or a profit
							upon the value of the money— He asked me whether I could say what
							premium would be sufficient to operate as an inducement— I said I could
							not tell, but could easily ascertain if it was an object with him to
							know— He said it was only one of those things which had pass’d in his
							mind, as a possible means of assisting the American Commerce, in the
							state of obstruction which the Circumstances of the times occasioned— He
							did not believe however notwithstanding every thing that was taking
							place Commerce would be arrested— It was founded upon such necessities
							that no regulations could entirely controul them— I said I was fully
							convinced of this and had often taken the liberty of expressing my
							opinions upon the subject to him— But according to all present
							appearances the experiment was to have its full trial— The <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef> seemed to think
							that he was going to blow up the Island of Great-Britain, because his
							measures had produced a number of bankruptcies among the
							merchants—undoubtedly there was some commercial distress in England—but
							how was it on the Continent— Since I had seen him last the first, or at
							least the second house in Amsterdam, the house that had done all the
							business of the Government for years, had stop’d payment— At Hamburg,
							Gothenburg, Paris, Königsberg and even Riga, houses of the first
							importance, had done the same thing— There was one universal cry of
							commercial distress all over the Continent— I had observed to him when I
							last saw him, that there was a sympathy among Merchants in their
							affairs, paramount to all political hostility, and it seemed to me that
							this fact alone was conclusive against the policy of attempting to
							operate upon the National Councils of England, by mere commercial
							distress— The Count has never contested these ideas, and appeared now as
							he always has to assent to them— He said the house of <persRef ref="u"
								>de Smets</persRef> at Amsterdam, had recommenced their payments and
							would probably get through their difficulties— So I told him would the
							house of <persRef ref="u">Goldsmid</persRef> in London— They would make
							their payments for some time, and perhaps eventually pay all their
							debts— But when once such houses had stop’d their payments it was
							comparatively speaking of little consequence whether they ever paid
							their debts or not— A commercial house of this class was a sort of
							little kingdom, and when it once stop’d payment, the establishment was
							demolished beyond all recovery—the machine was destroyed, the credit by
							which every thing important could alone be accomplished, was
							irretrievably gone, and whether the house finally paid its debts or not
							was only a question of concern to a few individuals.— The Count said
							these observations were just and they confirmed him in a principle which
							he had very often asserted, and in which he had seldom found others to
							concur; which was that the commercial year was not composed of twelve
							months—or in other words that the scale upon which objects relating to
							commerce were to be considered was too extensive and complicated to be
							judged of from any short or given period of time— In this Country for
							instance the laws of Nature themselves had crowded into five or six
							months all the possible business of a year, and in like manner political
							considerations might occasionally require similar pauses and suspensions
							from business— In the long run it would come to the same thing— The
							English had often threatened this Country, with the loss of its
							Commerce, but the productions of this Country were unfortunately
							possessed of a peculiar advantage; they were of indispensable necessity
							to those who took them, and were not worth the trouble and cost of
							raising them elsewhere— He spoke of it therefore as an unfortunate
							advantage— The proportion of manufactured goods which could be exported
							from this Country was comparatively very small, and surely it was no
							subject for exultation to a great Empire that the choicest of its
							productions for exportation were hemp and tallow, and bees-wax, and
							iron— Such as they were however, their purchasers could not do without
							them, and whatever events might occur, he had no doubt but that the
							exportations from this Country would always prove ultimately the same— I
							said that however correct this reasoning might be, as taking into
							account the result of a series of years, it was certainly an object of
							material interest to the Russian Commerce of the present moment that the
							vessels of which I was speaking should leave the Cargoes which they had
							brought—since if compelled to reload them and carry them away <pb
								n="197" type="ms"/>they could not at the same time carry away
							Russian goods— He said that was very true, but he considered this matter
							as scarcely amounting to a quarter of an hour, according to his estimate
							of commercial time— He then enquired whether I had heard any news, and
							on my answering in the negative, he said there was a report in
							circulation, which he understood to be mentioned in some commercial
							letters— That the Emperor Napoleon had determined to annex the hanseatic
							cities to the french empire, and that he had sent them notice of this
							determination— I smiled and said the Emperor Napoleon was remarkably
							fond of annexations—for here within six months, was Holland—the Valais,
							and now the Hanseatic Cities— But I thought they lay more conveniently
							to the kingdom of Westphalia— The Count said the Emperor Napoleon was
							certainly a man of great qualities, but he certainly had very erroneous
							ideas on the subject of Commerce. He asked if I had heard any thing from
							England— Only what was brought by the newspapers last Evening— He said
							it appeared probable they would be obliged to have recourse to a
							regency— I thought so; but I said there was not much to be expected from
							a Regency—the <persRef ref="george-iv">Regent</persRef> would live under
							the continual prospect of seeing the <persRef ref="george-iii"
								>king</persRef> from one day to another recover his health, and
							resume the reins of Government— He would not dare to strike out any new
							line of policy— But if the king should die, and the Prince of Wales come
							to the throne, I believed he would form a ministry whose first step
							would be to commence a negotiation for Peace— Otherwise the prospect of
							Peace appeared rather receding than approaching; I had never expected it
							untill the contest in Spain and Portugal should be determined, which did
							not appear now to be at hand, since it was unquestionable that <persRef ref="massena-andre">General
							Massena</persRef> and his army had retreated— The Count took little notice of the
							observation respecting Massena’s retreat, but he said that all regencies were in their nature feeble
							Governments, because their heads were always liable to be called to
							account; and that an English regency under the present circumstances
							would doubtless be peculiarly feeble, from the chance of the king’s
							recovery— He therefore with me thought it doubtful whether a regency in
							England would produce a change of policy. The Count then said he had
							presented <persRef ref="rush-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Rush’s</persRef> book to the Emperor, who had accepted it very
							graciously; and he (the Count) would write me about it.— I then took my
							leave and called on the <persRef ref="balashov-alexander">Minister of
								the Police Balascheff</persRef>, but he was not at home— I returned
							the visit of <persRef ref="u">Count Bose</persRef>, whom I found at
								<persRef ref="watzdorf-carl">General Watzdorf’s</persRef>—the
							General himself was not at home— Immediately after dinner, at six
							O’Clock I called on the Minister of the Police, to intercede with him in
							behalf of <persRef ref="u">Waldstein</persRef>; who having forgotten to
							report himself anew at the police, on the day when we came to this
							house, as residing here has been condemned to a fine of two Rubles a day
							from that time, untill he discovered his omission; which was only a few
							days ago; when he went to get his Passport renewed at the police for the
							ensuing year— The Minister said that these matters belonged generally to
							the Master of the Police, and he seldom interfered with them; but in
							consequence of my intercession he would make inquiry into this business
							and see what he could do for the man— He said perhaps it might be
							necessary to confine him a day or two for the transgression of the law;
							and that would serve instead of the fine— But Waldstein before he
							mentioned the matter to me had paid the fine; which I fear he will find
							it hard to get back. I went with the <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
								>ladies</persRef> to the Concert at the Phil-harmonic Society, where
							we heard performed the Creation, by <persRef ref="haydn-joseph"

						<p><date>13. </date>At twelve O’Clock I attended with <persRef

								<persRef ref="elizabeth-alexeievna;mariafeodorovna"
								>Empresses</persRef> came to the Diplomatic Circle— The fire of the

							spoke to me as usual of <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-john2;adams-charles2;adams-george">children</persRef>—
							The Emperor said to me, j’apprends que vous nous quittez— I said
							j’espere, Sire, que je n’aurai pas encore ce malheur— He replied
							j’espere que cela ne sera pas de sitôt.— <persRef
								ref="demaisonneuve-joseph">Monsieur de Maisonneuve</persRef> gave me

								M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams &amp; <persRef
								ref="smith-catherine-johnson">Catherine Johnson</persRef>—the Grand
							Marshall of the Court, <persRef ref="tolstoy-pyotr">Count
								Tolstoy</persRef> asked me if the Ladies would come, and on my
							telling him that they so intended, he desired me to recommend to them to
							come to the entrance at the Hermitage, where he would give orders that
							they should be admitted— This is considered as a very extraordinary
							distinction, which M. de Maisonneuve specially noticed— The Court as
							usual was soon over, and I came home, after going and writing my name at
							the <persRef ref="constantine3">Grand-Duke Constantine’s</persRef>, and
							paying visits in person at <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
								Romanzoff’s</persRef> and at the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand"
								>French Ambassador’s</persRef>—neither of whom was at home.— I read
								<persRef ref="massillon-jean">Massillon’s</persRef> sermon for the
							fourth Sunday of advent, upon the dispositions for the Communion, and
								<persRef ref="robinson-thomas">Robinson’s</persRef> Character of
								<persRef ref="manasseh">Manasseh</persRef>— The dissipations of the
							day, and some occupations also which intervened, diverted too much of my
							attention from these Books— I endeavoured in the Evening by writing a
							devotional exercise to recall and fix my mind upon suitable sentiments.
							It is in the midst of splendours and magnificence, that the heart most
							needs to be reminded of its vanities; and that the aid of Heaven is most
							earnestly to be invoked— Between 8 and 9 in the Evening we went to the
							Palace, and were admitted at the entrance of the Hermitage; we pass’d
							through that Palace into the Hall of S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
							George, where there was yet nobody, but some of the Ladies of Honour,
							the French Ambassador and <persRef ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Julien</persRef>— The Ambassador very
							soon after went away, being seized with a swimming in the head, so that
							he could not stay— The Emperor and Empresses came in about 9—from the
							white Hall, and immediately afterwards the Hall of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> George was crowded with People— The
							Polonaise immediately began, and the Empress Mother sat down to her Card
							Table— I found it impossible to make my way to it, and having secured
							chairs for the ladies I elbowed with the crowd, untill about 11.
							O’Clock. We then went into the Hermitage, and about a quarter of an hour
							afterwards the Imperial Family came in to supper— The tables were laid
							in the Hall of the Theatre which was illuminated with great
							magnificence— The Emperor went round the diplomatic table, and spoke to
							every guest seated at it; with one or two exceptions— He asked me
							whether I was in the habit of supping— I told him I was not— He asked
							whether it was a common practice in America— I said it was; but that we
							dined at an earlier hour— He said he thought five O’Clock was too
							late—but four was a very good hour— In England, however he had heard
							that they dine yet later— <persRef ref="demaistre-joseph">Count
								Maistre</persRef> who sat next me, said that a Frenchman had
							remarked upon these late dining hours, that people would before they had
							done get to dining to’morrow; upon which His Majesty had a hearty laugh—
							The supper lasted about an hour— On returning to the Hall of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> George, we found the crowd greater than
							ever— M. de Maisonneuve made his way with the ladies up to the front of
							the circle before the Empresses table— The Empresses after half an hour
							went away; but the Emperor continued to walk the Polonaise; when we came
							away it was about 2. in the morning— M. de Maisonneuve told me in the
							morning that the Empress considered Miss Johnson as having been
							presented at the same time with M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams;
							and therefore she might in future attend at all the Court parties to
							which she would be invited, without scruple— He paid this Evening every
							possible attention to the ladies, by the express order of the Emperor—
							The weather was unusually moderate, and the Halls excessively warm.</p>

							The <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">French Ambassador</persRef> and
							<persRef ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t:</hi> Julien</persRef> were there with him— The other foreign

							among whom were <persRef ref="bagration-peter">Prince

							Army, and <persRef ref="kamensky-sergei">Count Kamensky</persRef> the
							elder brother of the present <persRef ref="kamensky-nikolay">commander

							to me <persRef ref="vonderpahlen-peter">Count Pahlen</persRef>, the
							brother of the <persRef ref="vonderpahlen-friedrich">Minister now in
								America</persRef>.— The Emperor was for full half an hour in
							Conversation with the Ambassador—which delayed the marching of the
							procession— I had asked the Ambassador at the New-Year’s day Court leave
							to send by the first Courier that he should dispatch a small packet to
								<persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Russell</persRef>, our Chargé des Affairs at Paris— He said he
							should send a Courier in a few days; but would let me know the precise
							time a day before hand, that I might have time to make up my packet.
							yesterday Morning he sent me his Valet de Chambre to say that his
							Courier would go off in the Night, and that I could have untill eleven
							O’Clock in the Evening to send my packet— I had it however all ready and
							gave it to the Valet de Chambre— I asked <persRef
								ref="saintgenest-louis">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> S<hi
									rend="superscript">t:</hi> Genest</persRef> whether the Courier
							was gone; and he said not yet— He doubted even whether he would go this
							day; for as the Emperor was in earnest conversation with the Ambassador,
							he supposed this would make some alterations or at least some additions
							necessary to the dispatch. About half past twelve the procession
							marched—the Consecration was performed at the temple below the
							Admiralty. The procession returned in about three quarters of an hour—
							The <persRef ref="elizabeth-alexeievna;mariafeodorovna">Empresses</persRef> came up into the White Hall and went upon the
							balcony, to see the troops file off— The Ambassador and Count S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Julien came up at the same time, but the
							Emperor did not appear in the Palace— The Empresses were a full hour
							upon the balcony. The number of troops that pass’d was about
							twenty-eight thousand— The Ambassador told me that he supposed his
							Courier by the time when he was speaking to me was gone— But I think
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
							Genest’s information was most correct. The Ambassador also told me that
							there was fresh and important information from England— Where the
							Regency was established, under restrictions against which the <persRef
								ref="george-iv;frederickaugustus;william;edward"
								>Princes</persRef> of the Royal Family had protested. He also said
							he had some Moniteur’s containing orders from the <persRef

								type="ms"/>the sequester upon the American vessels in France in
							consequence of the proclamation of the <persRef ref="madison-james"
								>President of the United</persRef> States of 2. November last.— The
							Ceremony of this day was precisely the same as that of the last year—
							Each of the Empresses spoke a few words to all the foreign Ministers—
							There was a light Collation of Cakes, Wine, and Cordials; and about
							three O’Clock the Empresses retired.— We returned as we had entered by
							the way of the Hermitage, and I had time for my usual daily walk. Spent
							the Evening at home—reading the Memoirs of the American, and S<hi

							turn to sign them; which Count Romanzoff had hinted was not necessary—
							The Baron said he could not suppose that this delay was intentional on
							the part of Count Romanzoff, but he could not explain it upon any other
							supposition— Perhaps he might have motives of a political nature for
							postponing the determination. He mentioned to me the letter of the

							in consequence of the Proclamation of the <persRef ref="madison-james"

							were put into their hands, two of them from the sides of the vases,
							round which they marched three times preceded by the Priest— He then
							with a pair of scissors cut off three locks of the child’s hair, which
							with wax he roll’d up into a little ball, and threw into the water, in
							which the child was baptized; and finally after a little more chanting
							from the book the ceremony was concluded— During the first part of the
							Ceremony, the Priest turned his back to the vessel of water, and the
							Sponsors with the Nurse and child to the Priest— Another singularity was
							that at one part of the ceremony they were all required to spit on the
							floor— The Priest received five Roubles from the Godfather, and the
							Nurse the same from the Godmother— The Priest took away with him the
							napkin that he had used; and would have taken the table-cloth which
							covered the table— Paul himself carried round the wine, and received the
							five or ten rouble presents on the waiter. I had a morning visit from
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Boucher</persRef>—
							All our <persRef ref="everett-alexander;smith-william-steuben"

								<persRef ref="massillon-jean">Massillon’s</persRef> Christmas
							Sermon, and <persRef ref="robinson-thomas">Robinson’s</persRef>
							Character of <persRef ref="josiah">Josiah</persRef>. The Sermon is not
							equal to its subject, nor to the fame of the author— The division into
							the considerations of glory to God—and Peace on Earth is excellent; but
							the execution is not equally so— The preacher cannot forbear scolding,
							and most of his discourse is applied to shew that by the corruption of
							mankind the gospel has not redounded to the glory of God, nor produced
							Peace on Earth.</p>

						<p><date>23. </date>At 11. O’Clock this morning, I called upon <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>, and found with
							him a <persRef ref="dokhturov-dmitry">General Doctoroff</persRef> who
							immediately retired. I told the Count I was sorry to be importunate with
							him; but I came to him again on the subject of the vessels and Cargoes
							of my Countrymen who had been so long waiting here— He said he had been
							afraid that this was the subject upon which I had asked the conference;
							because he was informed that at present the papers were before the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, and depended upon his
							personal pleasure— I said that this being the case; it was unnecessary
							for me to urge the matter to him— He said that although it was a more
							difficult matter to him to press his Master for a decision than his
							Ministers, yet he would see what he could do in the case— He then spoke
							of the State of our affairs with France and England, and made several
							enquiries concerning it— Of South-America which always appears to
							interest him much. I said I thought it hardly possible that this War
							should finish without demolishing the antient Colonial systems of
							Europe; which would indeed be at present only a loss to England— France
							having already lost her Colonies; and Spain having now lost hers— But
							then said the Count, what will Spain herself be— I answered, what she
							must at all Events be—a dependence upon France. This she would be if
							England should succeed in the present War, and could restore <persRef
								ref="ferdinand-vii">Ferdinand 7.</persRef> in Spain and the House of
							Braganza in Portugal. In the present State of Europe it is inevitable— I
							mentioned to the Count that the <persRef ref="madison-james">President
								of the United States</persRef>, in consideration of circumstances
							relating to my private affairs had given me permission to return to the
							United States, and that I had received a letter to take leave of the
							Emperor, with a discretionary power to deliver it when I should be ready
							for my departure— I presumed it would be proper for me to keep it untill
							that time— He said certainly; or even to suppress it altogether, if I
							was not under the necessity of going— And he could assure me that when I
							should go, I should be much regretted here— That they had a very great
							and sincere esteem for me, and would be happy that my stay should be
							prolonged— I assured him that I was strongly sensible of the kindness
							and friendly reception that I had experienced here, and should be
							desirous of remaining here as long as I could— At any rate I could not
							take my leave untill the approach of Summer, and perhaps I might stay
							untill the appointment of a successor. I asked the favour of the Count
							to permit me to send a small packet to our <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">Chargé d’Affairs in Paris</persRef>; which he
							promised; and he apologized to me for not having given me notice of a
							Courier who was dispatched a few days ago.— But he said it was probable
							there would be a Courier sent again in a few days, of which he would
							give me notice in time— He mentioned to me again the Emperor’s
							acceptance of <persRef ref="rush-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Rush’s</persRef> book, and that he had written to me on
							the subject— I told him I had received his letter, and the Ring for D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Rush, which I should transmit to him, and
							presumed he would obtain the consent of Congress to accept his Majesty’s
							gracious present to him— An Officer whom I did not know was now
							announced and came in; upon which I left the Count and came home— In the
							Evening we had visits from <persRef ref="u">Count Bose</persRef>, and
							from <persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Fisher</persRef>

							and what I thought of it?— She knew very well that I had seen it, having

							appear affable, this is one of her common practices—to ask questions

							personage in <persRef ref="moliere">Moliere</persRef> who upon being
							asked whether he understands Latin, answers, oui, mais faites comme si
							je ne le savois pas— <persRef ref="pardo-benito">General
							Pardo</persRef>, a Spaniard and <persRef ref="demaistre-joseph">Count
								Maistre</persRef>, a Savoyard, are the only two persons of the Corps
							Diplomatique who have any interesting literary Conversation; and they
							are always amusing—the General had seen a New Opera called <hi
								rend="italic">Helena</hi>, which he said was very indifferent. the
							music wretched—without force or <hi rend="italic">colour</hi>— I asked
							him what he understood by the <hi rend="italic">Colour</hi> of Music? He
							said he did not see why Colour should not be applied to music, as well
							as Harmony to painting.— I told him I thought it was something like the
							blind-man, who said he knew very well what colours were—that scarlet for
							instance, was like the sound of a Cannon— He said there was a man named
								<persRef ref="castel-louis">Castel</persRef>, who had constructed a
							harpsichord of Colours, each note of which was to correspond with every
							shade of the rainbow.— Pardo, was musing I suppose upon his Greek
							Translation of <persRef ref="horace">Horace’s</persRef> Odes, for he
							suddenly broke out as we entered the Salle du Trone where the Circle was
							to be held “et la palme d’Horace</p>
						<lg>
							<l>“Croit et fleurit toujours, au Sommet du Parnasse.”</l>
						</lg>
						<p>the General spoke it with enthusiasm and in uttering the second line
							flourished his hand upwards higher than his head. The lines are from
								<persRef ref="piron-alexis">Piron’s</persRef> Métromanie, which he
							said, nothing but prejudice could prevent him from placing on a par with
							Moliere— After some common place observations of comparison between the
							two Poets Count Maistre repeated two other lines from the Métromanie,
							about which he told us an anecdote— The lines are spoken by the old-man
							who suddenly found himself a Poet at 50 years of age.</p>
						<lg>
							<l>Un beau jour ce talent en moi se trouva</l>
							<l>Et j’avois cinquante ans quand cela m’arriva.</l>
						</lg>
						<p>He said the Empress mother was one day in conversation with <persRef
								ref="kurakin-aleksandri">Prince Kurakin</persRef>, now the Russian
							Ambassador at Paris, and a young Officer; and upon some occasion
							repeated the first of these lines; and then seemed to be trying to
							recollect the second— The young Officer looked as if he was going to
							assist her Memory, and Prince Kurakin trod two or three times on his
							toes— When the Empress left them, the Officer asked Prince Kurakin why
							he had trod upon his toes?— I was afraid said the Prince that you was
							going to help the Empress to the second line of her quotation, and only
							meant to give you a hint qu’il ne faut jamais parler de cinquante ans à
							la Cour— So! said the Officer— Voila ce que c’est que d’être Courtisan—
							It was lucky for me that I did not know what the second line was; for I
							should certainly have repeated it without thinking at all of its
							application.— The Count asked me if we had any theatres or Dramatic
							Poets in America; and we talked about <persRef ref="shakespeare-william"
								>Shakespear</persRef>, and <persRef ref="milton-john"
								>Milton</persRef>, and <persRef ref="pope-alexander">Pope</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="virgil">Virgil</persRef> and <persRef

							and writing.— I read <persRef ref="massillon-jean">Massillon’s</persRef>
							Sermon for the day of Christ’s Circumcision; which is kept by the Roman
							Catholics the day of the new-year— It is upon the Divinity of our
							Saviour; very long, and without exception in my judgment the most
							eloquent and most logical discourse of the Bishop that I have yet read—
							His arguments are not indeed all of equal force, and some of them, as is
							always the case with this writer, seem fitter for a parody than for
							serious discussion— Of these however, there are here very few— The main
							arguments raised upon the extraordinary splendour and peculiar Spirits
							of Christs Ministry are urged with great power— The Countenance given by
							Christ himself to the idea of his own divinity, is press’d with such
							force, from such a variety of passages in his History as well as in the
							letter of the New Testament, and is so strongly contrasted with the
							extreme care taken by the prophets of the old Testament and the Apostles
							of the new, to disclaim all miraculous power of their own, and all
							pretence to a more than human Nature, that I hardly know how to escape
							from the conclusion drawn from it— Some of the particular texts I know
							are controverted; but they may all be fairly taken away and yet leave
							the argument almost unshaken. The impression of this Sermon upon my mind
							is perhaps the greater, because I never had read before any elaborate
							argument on that side of the question. The division is more easy and
							natural than common, and equally judicious and ingenious— The
							composition is in the Bishop’s best manner, without any of the fanciful
							and quaint applications of scriptural passages, or any of the affected
							repetitions of latin texts of which he is sometimes so liberal— The
							Divinity of Christ is one of the controverted doctrines of the Christian
							Churches, upon which my faith has never been settled, because as a
							layman, I have never had the time or opportunity to examine it with that
							research which would be necessary to make my understanding acquiesce in
							a belief so incomprehensible to it— But I shall recur again to this
							Sermon, if my life is spared— It is to be observed that the preacher
							apologizes for this masterly defence of an Article of the creed, as
							making it before a believing Prince, and auditory— There is a little
							bitterness of invective against <persRef ref="socinus-faustus"
								>Socinus</persRef>, which perhaps he thought unavoidable but which I
							wished away— I wanted some of <persRef ref="priestley-joseph">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Priestley’s</persRef> works to
							consult them on this occasion— I read also this Evening <persRef

							called to see <persRef ref="pardo-benito">General Pardo</persRef>, with

							and he should transmit them to the neutral Commission, with orders to
							carry into Execution their first decision, respecting them; which had
							been that the papers were in regular order— I have therefore told ces
							Messieurs, said he, that this business was finished, and that they might
