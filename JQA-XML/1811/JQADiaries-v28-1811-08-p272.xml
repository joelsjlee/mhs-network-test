						<p><date>1. </date>I sent <persRef ref="u">Waldstein</persRef> this morning
							over the Bridge to hire a Droshky to be kept by the day untill we shall
							have occasion to send for <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs.</hi> Reinike</persRef>— At the same time I sent to <persRef
								ref="gurieff-dmitri">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gourieff</persRef> the Minister of the finances requesting to see
							him this day; for which he appointed one O’Clock afternoon— I found
								<persRef ref="labouchere-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Labouchere</persRef> with him, but he went immediately away— I spoke
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gourieff concerning the ship Fox of
							New-York, and gave him the Document which I had received from New-York
							respecting it— I mentioned also the cases of the John Adams, from
							Savannah, which had been long waiting for admission, on account of an
							alteration or erasure in the register; and that of the Alexander,
								<persRef ref="u">Captain Davis</persRef>, a vessel of <persRef
								ref="gray-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray’s</persRef>,
							from Algiers; delayed because he had no certificate of Origin from the
							Magistrates of the Place— Both these vessels M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gourieff told me were admitted— The law he said, had
							provided an exception respecting the Certificates of Origin, for vessels
							coming from the Asiatic Ports, and it was well known the Barbary States
							would not comply with these European regulations— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Gourieff added that he made it a
							principle to give every facility to the admission of American vessels,
							and intimated that he did not much care where the vessel came from, if
							it came to export the Russian Productions— He gave me the papers of a
							vessel, from New-York, which was taken into an English Port, last
							Winter, and came from thence in the Spring; requesting me to look over
							them, and inform him whether I had any knowledge of the vessel, or
							considered the Captain’s protest as correct— I then went and called upon
								<persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Harris</persRef>; and gave him the letter to <persRef
								ref="hazard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Hazard</persRef>— I also gave him a letter from several Sailors at
							Cronstadt, complaining against their Captain; with a request that he
							would make enquiry concerning the facts— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Harris read me part of a letter from <persRef ref="dashkov-andrei">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Daschkoff</persRef> to him—in which
							Daschkoff insinuates that <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jefferson</persRef> is not in harmony
							with <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Madison</persRef>, and conveys the idea, that Jefferson is
							intriguing to come in again as President at the next Election— I called
							upon the <persRef ref="bezerra-joao">Chevalier Bezerra</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="navarro-rodrigo">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Navarro</persRef>, neither of whom was at home— On returning to my
							house I found that the papers M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gourieff
							had given me were those of the Matilda <persRef ref="u">Captain
								Ashley</persRef>, arrived at Riga; concerning which the Supercargo
							had written to me more than a month since, and about which I had then
							spoken to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gourieff— I thought the
							business had then been settled.— I immediately wrote him a Note, and
							sent it to him with the papers back, requesting the vessel might be
							admitted without further delay— <persRef ref="u">Madame
								Bezerra</persRef> visited our <persRef

								M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams cannot go, but Catherine
							engaged to go, and accompany Madam Bezerra— I walked to <persRef

								<persRef ref="u;u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and Madam

						<p><date>3. </date>Peterhoff Fête. At eleven this morning I went into my
							Carriage and at a quarter before two alighted at Peterhoff at the small
							building opposite the palace where the foreign Ministers are received on
							this occasion— The distance from my house is 35 Versts or 25 Miles— I
							went with four horses in front, and without stopping once on the road— I
							was alone— <persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Smith</persRef> and <persRef ref="gray-francis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray</persRef> having gone in another
							Chariot, with six horses. I took with me the Message to Congress at the
							Commencement of the last Winter’s Session, and read part of the
							Documents—that is the whole of <persRef ref="pinkney-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pinkney’s</persRef> Correspondence—
							The road was crowded with Carriages of all kinds from the City gate to
							the Palace at Peterhoff— The invitation to the Corps Diplomatique was to
							a masked Ball, supper, fire-works, illumination &amp;c— They were
							requested to alight and to dine at the <hi rend="italic">Pavillon</hi>,
							destined to receive them— On arriving there I found one of the Aids of
							the <persRef ref="demaisonneuve-joseph">Master of Ceremonies</persRef>,
							and one of the running footmen of the Court who shewed me to a chamber
							where I could dress— I went immediately to the Apartment of <persRef
								ref="bezerra-joao;u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> &amp; Madam
								Bezerra</persRef>, and gave her the Card from <persRef
								ref="smith-catherine-johnson">Catherine</persRef>, excusing herself
							for not going— They were to be presented to the <persRef
								ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress Mother</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="annapavlovna;catherinepavlovna">Grand Duchesses</persRef>. I
							then walked about an hour round the Garden— The principal water-works
							were playing, but as they form only one of the various exhibitions of
							this day, I did not see them so well, as at the visit we made to this
							palace the 24<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of last September.— The
							preparations for the illumination of the Evening were all made excepting
							the placing of the lamps.— They were erected scaffoldings of Planks in
							various forms, with rows of wire stuck on them in lines adapted to the
							figures to be represented, each wire stuck into the plank and rounded
							into a circle distant about six inches from the plank— The lamps were
							glass tumblers filled with tallow: a wick passing through the centre and
							the wick and surface of the tallow, brushed over with spirits of
							turpentine. Each of the wire circles was to hold one of these tumblers.
							On the gulph, about a quarter of a mile distant from the shore there
							were seventeen imperial Yachts, under full sail and dress’d out in a
							full suit of Colours— I saw <persRef ref="gabriel-claude">Claud
								Gabriel</persRef>, and <persRef ref="nelson">Nelson</persRef> in the
							Garden— Nelson appeared to be unwell— I returned to the Lodge where I
							now found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray— We dress’d for dinner— M. de
							Maisonneuve the Master of Ceremonies came into the parlour where we were
							assembled, with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> and Madam Bezerra, whom
							he presented to <persRef ref="law-jacques">Count Lauriston</persRef>,
							inviting him to lead her into dinner— A Portuguese Minister’s Lady
							escorted by the French Ambassador, was in the present state of the world
							a singular curiosity, and excited a smile throughout the Company. The
							dinner ought regularly to have been presided by <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>, but on account
							of <persRef ref="rumiantsev-michael">his brothers</persRef> death he did
							not attend on this occasion. <persRef ref="weydemeyer-ivan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Weydemeyer</persRef> a member of the
							Council attached to the department of foreign Affairs, and M. de
							Maisonneuve the Master of the Ceremonies, presided and did the honours
							of the table. The dinner was excellent, and the fruits of all climates
							in profusion— Cherries, Strawberries, raspberries. Apricots, plums,
							peaches, Oranges, grapes and pine-apples, were served in abundance— The
							members of the Corps Diplomatique present were about twenty-five— After
							dinner we rode round the gardens, in Carriages provided by the Court—
							They are called <hi rend="italic">Lines</hi>, and resemble a double
							Sopha with a seat on each side for four persons— They were on four
							wheels and tackled with two horses— We rode about an hour; returned to
							the Lodge, and lounged or played away the time untill eight O’Clock— We
							then went in Dominos and Venitians to the Palace, on the same Lines; and
							assembled in the central chamber painted all over the wainscoting with
							female portraits. There were already the nobility of both sexes who
							attend the Court; and within a quarter of an hour the imperial family
							appeared— The <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="constantine3">Grand Duke Constantine</persRef> first pass’d
							through the chamber to the dancing Hall; and about five minutes
							afterwards the <persRef ref="elizabeth-alexeievna">Empress</persRef>
							&amp; Empress Mother; followed by the Grand Duchesses Catherine and
							Ann—the Grand Dukes <persRef ref="nicholas-i">Nicholas</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="michael2">Michael</persRef>, and the <persRef
									ref="katharine-amalie">Princess Amelia of Baden</persRef>; and the
								<persRef ref="peter-friedrich">Duke</persRef> and two Princes of
							Oldenburg— The Court and Diplomatic Corps followed them into the Ball
							Room, which was excessively crowded with people of all Classes and
							descriptions.— The Imperial family and Court Nobility walked a number of
							Polish dances; there was no room for any others— The Empress with her
							Sisters took Seats at the head of the Hall— The Empress Mother played at
							piquet, in an adjoining chamber— She played with the principal nobility
							and with the French Ambassador. Both Empresses spoke to most of the
							foreign Ministers— They asked me the same questions; whether <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> was there? why she
							was not there?— where we now resided? whether we had a comfortable
							house? and whether M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams would be
							conveniently situated for her confinement— Between 9 and 10 O’Clock the
							illumination commenced— <persRef ref="litta-giulio">Count
								Litta</persRef> said that the whole garden was lighted up in ten
							minutes—there were three hundred thousand lamps, and sixteen hundred
							persons employed to light them.— Just after ten, the Emperor pass’d back
							in to the Hall of Portraits, and upon the Balcony fronting the
							back-garden— The fire-works were then played off— They were not upon the
							whole equal to those of 26. October last—they were over in a quarter of
							an hour— We then pass’d through several of the Halls, to a very long
							gallery over which was a sort of canvass roof, and in which was a long
							table on which the Supper was served— There were about three hundred
							persons sat down to this table— Among whom were the Court Circle and the
							foreign Ministers— The Supper was equally excellent, and the fruit as
							plentiful and as various as at the dinner— It was over in about an hour—
								<persRef ref="nesselrode-marya">Miss Gourieff</persRef> told me that
							if I returned home this Night, I should find the Bridges raised, but I
							thought she was joking.— After Supper we went down, and rode round again
							for an hour and a half upon the lines— Madam Bezerra, though the only
							lady of the Corps, and an entire Stranger, presented this day for the
							first time at the Court, went through the whole with perfect propriety,
								<pb n="274" type="ms"/>and without embarrassment— About a quarter
							past one we returned to the Lodge—to separate, and retire for the Night;
							or undress to return home— The day-light was already beginning to
							return, and many of the lamps were already extinct.— <persRef
								ref="jones-thomas3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones</persRef>
							who returned the last Evening from Moscow without having been able to
							reach Makarieff, came spontaneously to the Lodge about 7. in the
							Evening, and from that time introduced himself every where, as in the
							suite of the Corps Diplomatique— <persRef ref="pardo-benito">General
								Pardo</persRef> was the only foreign Minister absent— <persRef
								ref="navarro-rodrigo">Navarro</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="luxbourg-charles">Luxbourg</persRef> were not there; but they
							have taken leave at Court. <persRef ref="vonarnim-friedrich">Baron’s
								d’Arnim</persRef>, <persRef ref="vongremp-anton">Gremp</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="mareschal-wenzel">Marechal</persRef> were also absent.
							<persRef ref="betancourt-august">General Betancourt</persRef> received the red ribband of the Order of <persRef ref="nevsky-alexander">S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Alexander Nefsky</persRef>, while there, at the
							Ball— A curious part of the show was the Circassian deputies in their
							National dresses, when presented to and spoken to by the Empress.</p>

						<p><date>4. </date>At half past one in the morning, I entered my Carriage
							again and returned home.— I reached the lower Bridge across the Neva,
							just as the Sun was rising at a quarter before four— The lines of
							Carriages on the road were almost uninterrupted from Peterhoff to the
							City Gate; and they were often two or three in front— I pass’d upwards
							of two thousand as I presume on the road; and during the first half of
							the way great multitudes of people returning on foot.— The numbers of
							People who attend at this celebration, are asserted to be at least fifty
							thousand. It has been usual to keep such a day here ever since Peter the
							first’s time, but the day has occasionally been changed— I was present
							at this fête in the year 1782—but it was then kept on the festival of
								<persRef ref="peter">S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Peter</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Paul</persRef>.
							the 29<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of June Old Stile; being the then
								<persRef ref="constantine3">Grand Duke Paul’s</persRef> name day. He
							was not present however, being then upon his travels— The day is now
							changed to that of <persRef ref="marymagdalen">S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t</hi> Mary Magdalen</persRef>, which is the <persRef
								ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress-Mother’s</persRef>, and her daughter
								<persRef ref="mariapavlovna">Mary’s</persRef> name day.— the 22. of
							July old Stile— The time is much better for an illumination, as there
							are now two hours in the Night, of darkness sufficient for the effect of
							the Lamps—on the 29<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of June there is no
							darkness at-all— Accordingly the effect of the illumination this time
							was far more brilliant than from my recollection it was when I saw it
							before— There were then I think no fire-works— The Company then was I
							think more numerous, and from my impressions more splendid in dress—
							Perhaps however it was because then magnificence of dress was not so
							familiar and common an object to me as it now is— I saw the Court then
							only at a distance and as a stranger.— At present I knew all the
							principal individuals— The <persRef ref="elizabeth-alexeievna"
								>Empresses</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="annapavlovna;catherinepavlovna">Grand Duchesses</persRef> were
							attired with great splendor of jewels— The Empress Mother wore an
							imperial Diadem entirely set in Diamonds and of immense Cost— The men
							were all plainly dress’d; with the uniforms slightly embroidered.— The
							Ball finished much earlier now, than formerly. The <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> abridges all these tedious
							festivities— On arriving at the lower Bridge I found, as <persRef
								ref="nesselrode-marya">Miss Gourieff</persRef> had told me, that it
							was raised— I went to the upper Bridge and found it in the same
							situation— I now learnt, and not without concern that they raise both
							the Bridges every morning at two O’Clock, to let the vessels pass
							through, and that they are kept raised from two to three hours— I was
							detained at them about an hour; and reached my house about a quarter
							before five O’Clock in the Morning— The weather had been fine the whole
							day and Night. But I found a surtout convenient in the Carriage, as I
							returned— As soon as I got home I went to bed, and rose again about
							eleven. The day was not very industriously employed— I wrote two or
							three short letters, and read one of <persRef ref="massillon-jean"
								>Massillon’s</persRef> Synodial Discourses— <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris</persRef>

						<p><date>5. </date>I had a visit this morning from <persRef
								ref="luxbourg-charles">Count Lüxbourg</persRef>, who is going away
							in a few days— He waits only for the arrival of his successor, a
								<persRef ref="jenison-franz">Count Jennison</persRef>, who was
							coming from Berlin; but was stop’d at Polangen, and not allowed to
							proceed untill a Passport from <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
								Romanzoff</persRef> could be sent to him— Lüxbourg took leave of the
							Court, yesterday week; and he says that the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef> after charging him with his compliments to the
								<persRef ref="maximilian-i">king of Bavaria</persRef>, said to
							him—J’espere que la paix du Nord de l’Europe ne sera pas troublée— Il y
							a beaucoup de discours dans le public; mais tout cela ne signifie rien—
							A quoi bon feroit on la guerre— Il est tems qu’on commence a se tenir
							tranquille— On ne croit pas, sans doute faire des conquetes ici—à quoi
							cela pourroit il mener— Au reste nous sommes prêts— Lüxbourg says that
							he was quite surprized and embarrassed at hearing the Emperor speak to
							him in this manner, and hardly knew how to answer him— He told him
							however that the Sentiments so worthy of a great Monarch, he presumed
							were also shared by the other side (de l’autre part) and that peace was
							undoubtedly the object most desirable for suffering humanity.— He says
							too that he has written an account of this conversation to his
							Government, leaving out however the expressions which import a readiness
							for war— I should have thought them by far the most important part of
							the report.— <persRef ref="u">Captain Woodberry</persRef> also called
							upon me to ask my opinion whether it would be safe for him to sail for
							America— He says there are letters from <persRef ref="williams-samuel2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams</persRef> in London,
							saying that War between Great-Britain and the United States, is
							inevitable, and that he expects an order for capturing and detaining all
							American vessels will very shortly be issued from the British Admiralty.
							I told him that I could not undertake to advise him without more
							particular and direct information than I have yet received— After dinner
							I took a walk of two hours to the island of Jelagin— While I was gone,
								<persRef ref="u">Count Bose</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="fisher-miers">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="dugan-a">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Moses</persRef> had been, and

							requesting to see him, and received his answer appointing to-morrow half

						<p><date>6. </date>According to appointment I went at half past twelve
							O’Clock to <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
							Romanzoff’s</persRef>— I reminded him of a Note which soon after my
							arrival here I had written him respecting the Commerce, and the Hector,
							and mentioned that I had lately received a letter from one of the owners
							making enquiries what was done with those cases— He asked me if I had
							never received from him any Answer relating to them— I said I had not—
							He said he would immediately attend to it— That it had been referred to
							the <persRef ref="chichagov-pavel">Minister of Marine</persRef>, and no
							report had yet been made by him.— I spoke of a packet which I sent him
							in the beginning of June, for <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Russell</persRef> at Paris, which was
							to go by a Courier, and as I had just received from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Russell a letter, by which it appeared
							that packet had not come to his hands, I was afraid that by some
							accident, or perhaps some mistake of my Servant, the Count had not
							received it— He said that he had; but the delay in its transmission to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Russell had arisen from another
							accident— An extraordinary length of time during which his Courier had
							been detained before he had dispatched him— It was full two months after
							the time he had intended— <persRef ref="kurakin-aleksandri">Prince
								Kurakin</persRef> complained of it very much, but after <hi
								rend="italic">all those</hi> discussions had arisen the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> had positively determined that
							he would not come to any definitive Resolution to be communicated by
							Courier, untill he should know of the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand"
								>Duke of Vicence’s</persRef> arrival at Paris, and what effect would
							be produced by his return— The Courier therefore had not been dispatched
							untill the day of the Te Deum, and probably has but just now arrived at
							Paris.— I said that with regard to the preparation of a Treaty of
							Commerce, I had made no further Communication to him, owing to the
							uncertainty both in the state of public affairs and of my own situation
							here; not knowing what the ultimate disposition of my Government with
							regard to this mission had been or would be— He said that from this
							uncertainty in the State of every thing it seemed really impossible to
							enter upon any discussion relative to Commerce— We could not know from
							day to day whether there would be any Commerce— It was impossible to do
							any thing more than provide for the day that was passing over our heads—
							What would come to-morrow, was beyond all human foresight. What for
							instance would be the consequence of a War between the United States and
							England, which I had told him I thought probable, and which he thought
							so himself— However amicably disposed they were here to favour our
							Commerce, and they continued as much so as they ever had been, it would
							obviously upon that contingency be totally stop’d by the English— He was
							therefore sorry to see this prospect of that War; for it protracted all
							the hopes of Peace, and menaced a longer and more extensive War— Did not
							I think so?— What was my opinion of the chances for <hi rend="italic">a
								Peace</hi>? (This fashion of Consultation is one of the Count’s
							forms of Civility— He supposes that I feel flattered by having my
							Opinion asked, and that it will make me talk as much as he pleases— I
							always do give him my opinions as freely as he asks them; not that I
							fancy he attaches so much importance to them, as he imagines I do, but
							because I consider it as civility returned for civility, and because as
							long as my talk is not tiresome to him, I suppose it to be agreeable) I
							asked him if he meant a general Peace?— Ay, or at least a Peace between
							France and England?— That was the same thing; I saw nothing like a
							prospect of it, or a disposition to it on either side; there never was
							less reason to expect it— he said he was extremely sorry to be so nearly
							of my opinion— And I was extremely sorry to hear His Excellency
							acknowledge it; for it confirmed me in a belief, which I should have
							been most happy to have had him shake— But it was too clear— The
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>, and
							his <persRef ref="bachasson-jean">Minister Montalivet</persRef> spoke of
							the War in Spain as likely still to occupy several campaigns— They
							talked of ten years more of War, as of a matter for which France was
							prepared— No symptom of relaxation or yielding could be discovered
							there— In England such symptoms must come first from the People; as long
							as their Spirits could be kept up their Government would not flinch; and
							as long as they had any successes to boast of the Spirits of the people
							would not flag.— There was no appearance of that kind yet— No petitions
							for Peace— No talk of a change of Ministry— There was indeed great
							anxiety for the issue of affairs in Spain and Portugal; and untill that
							affair was finished the English Nation would not begin to look round
							them and think of Peace— The Count said that France was certainly now
							making another great effort there— Besides the success of their arms in
							taking Tarragona, and the junction of the two Marshals <persRef
								ref="soult-nicolas">Soult</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="demarmont-auguste">Marmont</persRef>, he knew that the Emperor
							Napoleon had determined to send eighty thousand more men into Spain— The
							English army would probably be obliged to resume its old position near
							Lisbon, and there, time again might be gained— For it was remarkable
							that the Emperor Napoleon who was always accustomed to announce quick
							dispatch, and to threaten with thunderbolt’s, had in this case admitted
							that the subjugation of Spain would still be an affair of time— He then
							asked me whether I knew, if <persRef ref="bezerra-joao">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bezerra</persRef> had any late news;
							and what his opinion was of the present state of things— I said that I
							had not seen M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bezerra since the Peterhoff
							day, when he did not know of <persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Lord
								Wellington’s</persRef> retreat— The Count then told me that the
								<persRef ref="law-jacques">Ambassador</persRef> had just been with
							him— He had received a Courier who brought him the account that the
							Ecclesiastical Council, assembled at Paris had been dissolved; and three
							of the Bishops arrested. He was <pb n="276" type="ms"/>a little
							surprized at this instance of resistance to the will of the Emperor
							Napoleon; but he did not expect it would be followed by any serious
							consequences— He believed there was very little religion in France— When
							he was last there he had made it a particular object of his personal
							observation— He had supposed before he went there that the result of the
							horrible Revolution through which they had pass’d would have been to
							awaken religious ideas in the people, and have given their minds a
							peculiar direction that way— He saw no such thing— He saw no disposition
							with regard to religion but that of profound indifference— It was not a
							fashion of infidelity such as had been known in France thirty or forty
							years ago— Not a sectarian Atheism, courting martyrdom; but total
							indifference—a total absence of all thought concerning religion. He had
							mentioned it to the Emperor Napoleon, and had perceived that the remark
							had displeased him— He had asked him on what he founded his opinion—the
							Count answered that as he had before going to France entertained the
							theoretic idea that he should find strong symptoms of religious
							propensities, he had made it a point to observe, and had repeatedly gone
							into the principal churches of Paris on Sundays and Holidays in service
							time— They were all absolutely deserted. Scarcely a Soul to be seen;
							except here and there an occasional straggler, who looked as if he had
							been sent upon an errand, and had come into the Church and taken a chair
							to rest himself on the way.— The Emperor had replied—Perhaps it may be
							so, but I assure you it is not my fault— On the contrary I know the
							importance of religious sentiments, and encourage the propagation of
							them as much as I can— There are even five or six popular writers to
							whom I give pensions for this purpose, and among them are <persRef
								ref="chateaubriand-francois">Chateaubriant</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="degenlis-stephanie">Madame de Genlis</persRef>— Now said the
							Count, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> considers these people as drugs of the
							imperial pharmacopaea—ingredients to be mixed up in the chemical mass of
							an Emperor’s Government— His own idea is political and not at-all
							religious— And as to his Pensioners, for aught I know, Chateaubriand may
							be honest, but Madame de Sillery would preach any religion for which she
							could get paid— I know something of her, and I know her to be as false
							and unprincipled a woman as breathes.— I said that Chateaubriant himself
							had lately shewn some resistance against the Emperor’s will, as I had
							heard, on a religious topic—that he had written a discourse for his
							reception as a member of the National Institute which he had not been
							suffered to pronounce, and which he had refused to alter— The Count said
							it was not a matter of religion— It related to the death of the king—
							Chateaubriant was received at the Academy in the place of Chénier—
							Chenier had voted in the Convention for the <persRef ref="louis-xvi"
								>king’s</persRef> Death, and Chateaubriant instead of pronouncing a
							panegyric upon <persRef ref="chenier-mariejoseph">Chénier</persRef>,
							according to custom, had written a violent philippic against him, and
							criminated him especially for his vote on the king’s trial— The Emperor
							had forbidden its being delivered; because he Napoleon <hi rend="italic"
								>had pardoned</hi>, all those who had voted for the king’s Death,
							and had among them several of his highest imperial Officers— <persRef
								ref="decambaceres-jean">Cambacérès</persRef> was one— <persRef
								ref="regnault-michel">Regnaud de S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Jean d’Angely</persRef> was another— He did not chuse therefore that
							any such allusion to that Event should be made in a public Oration;
							especially by a man whom he patronized, and to whom he had been a
							benefactor— The Count added that he did think there was something very
							indecent in the manner in which they managed some of these Academical
							receptions in France— He had attended one of them, where a man, whose
							name he did not recollect was received in the place of a certain
							physician named <persRef ref="cabanis-pierre">Cabanis</persRef>, who had
							written an Atheistical Book— The new member had observed the custom of
							eulogizing his predecessor, but the President, in answering the
							discourse had severely censured him for praising such a Book—for the
							recipiendary had included the book in his panegyric— The Count added,
							laughing, that these reception speeches and Answers had been well
							ridiculed by <persRef ref="piron-alexis">Piron</persRef>, who said that
							they all amounted exactly to this that the member said “Messieurs, je
							vous remercie,” and the President answered “Monsieur, il n’y a pas de
							quoi”— This Academy had occasioned him to make another indiscreet
							observation in conversing with the Emperor Napoleon— They had on some
							occasion, while he was at Paris, perhaps some affair of the Spanish
							business, sent a deputation to the Emperor, and the orator of the
							deputation had said among other things that “they were an invisible
							militia surrounding his throne”— The speech was published in the next
							morning’s Moniteur, where the Count read it— Seeing afterwards the
							Emperor the same day, he had told him that there had been to him a
							deputation from the Academy, and that he encouraged and countenanced <hi
								rend="italic">those people</hi>— I am not said the Count remarkable
							for being incautious in what I say; but that day somehow it happened
							that all my caution forsook me— For, I said, yes, Sire, and I have read
							something as a speech of that deputation which struck me oddly, and gave
							me some pain— And what is that, said the Emperor?— Why, Sire, they said
							they were an invisible militia surrounding your throne— The meaning of
							which is that your throne derives support and assistance from a club of
							atheists— Now I think in the first place this is not true; and in the
							next, if it were, that it is not becoming that it should be thus
							publicly announced— The Emperor made little reply, but I saw said the
							Count, that what I had said was not agreeable to him— The next day
							however the Orator’s Speech was published again in another Gazette, and
							the <pb n="277" type="ms"/>passage upon which I had animadverted, was
							omitted— I have no doubt that my remarks to the Emperor had occasioned
							its being struck out.— Ever since my return from France at that time I
							have been persuaded that there was very little religion there— Now
							indeed, this incident in the Council disconcerts a little my ideas
							(“dérange un peu mes idées”) and we shall see what it comes to—but again
							I have considered that the Council consisting principally of old men,
							may naturally have an extraordinary proportion of members more stubborn
							than the Spirit of the times will be found to bear them out.— The
							characteristic of the great mass was indifference; and it was not
							confined to France— It pervaded the great Body of the Roman Catholics
							throughout Europe.— Consider, said he what the <hi rend="italic"
								>Pope</hi> is, in the principles of that sect— You know the
							situation in which he has long been kept— How but from this immovable
							indifference can we account for it, that not the slightest manifestation
							of interest, or of sensibility to his condition has appeared in any part
							of the Catholic world— Yet the mass of population in several important
							European States were roman Catholics— To instance only <hi rend="italic"
								>Austria</hi>— I said I did not know whether I could without
							indiscretion tell him what I thought of Austria— But he must be aware,
							Austria had made her effort—she had struggled—she had motives of policy
							which would induce her to restrain the expression of Sentiments among
							her Subjects which might impair her good-understanding with France.— He
							replied that the Sentiments to which he alluded were precisely of a
							Nature which the Government could not controul— If they were felt they
							would burst through all such restraints— He did not know however that
							any such restraint had been used, or attempted— There certainly had been
							none here— Several provinces of the Russian Empire were inhabited by
							Roman Catholics; and the Emperor Napoleon knew; he had long since been
							informed that if any difference between him and the Pope should arise,
							by which the Consciences of that Class of the Russian Subjects might be
							affected, the Russian Government would not side with him against them.—
							I mentioned to the Count that I had some time since seen a letter from
							the Roman Catholic Bishops in America to those in Ireland, concerning
							the situation of the Pope— He had never heard of it, and requested me if
							it should again fall in my way, to send it to him; which I promised.— In
							the part of the conversation respecting the prospects of Peace, I told
							him that besides the War between the United States and England, which
							with him I feared &amp; lamented would be inevitable, the State of
							affairs between France and Russia, with the discussions they were
							agitating, (at least as they were represented in the public opinion) had
							also a strong appearance of protracting the period when Peace might be
							expected.— He said that with regard to the relations between Russia and
							France, there were undoubtedly many unfounded reports in public
							circulation; but thus much he could say that if the whole budget could
							be turned inside out ( si on pouvait tourner le fond du sac en dehors)
							and exposed to the view of every body it would not at-all promote any
							other conclusion than is already drawn from what is known.— From Count
							Romanzoff’s I went and called upon <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>, and returned home
							between 4 and 5. O’Clock— I dined at <persRef ref="vonblome-otto">Baron
								Blome’s</persRef>; but arrived so late, that I found the Company
							already at table— The <persRef ref="law-jacques">French
								Ambassador</persRef> and all his Legation were there— He told me
							that he should dispatch a Courier to-morrow or the day after, and
							offered to send by him any letter that I might wish— He asked us not to
							engage ourselves for next Saturday, for that he should then give his
							Grand Diner Diplomatique; and should send his Cards to-morrow— He must
							give a party too the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and he did not
							mean to kill two birds with one stone— Afterwards too he should have the
								<hi rend="italic">Nôce</hi>—meaning <persRef
								ref="derayneval-maximilien">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rayneval’s</persRef> Marriage— After dinner I took a long walk to
							and round the island of Jelagin— On returning home I found <persRef
								ref="jones-thomas3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones</persRef>
							on an Evening visit— <persRef ref="colombi-maria">Madame

						<p><date>10. </date>The Summer has been hitherto remarkably fine; but the
							symptoms of its close begin to shew themselves— “The sear and yellow
							leaf” begins to appear upon the trees, and the rains are setting in to
							announce the autumn. I dined at the <persRef ref="law-jacques">French
								Ambassador’s</persRef>—his first great diplomatic dinner— <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> asked me to send
							him the three latest English Newspaper’s; being later than any that he
							had seen— I accordingly sent them immediately on my return home in the
							Evening.— At table I sat between the Minister of War, <persRef
								ref="barclay-michal">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Barclay de
								Tolly</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> Aid de Camp, <persRef ref="ozarowski-adam"
								>Count Ozarowsky</persRef>— My only Conversation was with the
							latter— I mentioned to him, that the late <persRef ref="gustav-iv">king
								of Sweden</persRef> had returned from Heligoland into Holstein,
							greatly incensed, against the English Governor &amp; Officers of the
							island— The Count said he was the most difficult man to deal with, that
							he had ever met in the course of his life.— When he came into Russia
							last Autumn, the Emperor sent him Count Ozarowsky to meet and compliment
							him— His orders were to do every thing that the king pleased, and to
							facilitate any thing upon which he should determine— Whether he chose to
							stay at Riga, or to come to S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg,
							or to go into the interior of Russia, or to embark for England, his
							pleasure was to be the rule for Ozarowsky’s conduct— But he was scarcely
							ever six hours together of the same intention— At one time he was for
							staying at Riga— Then for going to Sarepta a Herrnhuth establishment—
							Then for going to Bender; because Charles 12 had been there; and lastly
							for going to England, and then to Spain— He did actually go to England,
							but did not stay there long— He came thence to Heligoland, and now has
							returned to the Continent—the Count says that he is disordered in the
							Intellect; to such a degree that he sometimes fancies himself to be
								<persRef ref="charles-xii">Charles 12</persRef> in person— And that
							was his motive for intending to go to Bender— A project which he carried
							so far that the horses and Carriage were already tackled for his
							departure before he changed his mind— He has a sort of Bible, or rather
							a Herrnhuth Calendar, with a text from the Bible for every day in the
							year— He consults this Book every day as an oracle, and considers the
							text for the day as prescribing to him his rule of conduct for that day—
							But as he gives a sort of mystical construction to these texts, he makes
							out of them a meaning of his own, which instead of inspiring wisdom, as
							the natural operation of the Bible would be, leads him into a multitude
							of absurdities— Yet he has withal many good qualities— A proud Spirit of
							honour, and generous sentiments. <pb n="279" type="ms"/>Immediately
							after dinner I left the Ambassador’s and after calling at <persRef

							he came now to ask assistance of me to get him out of his difficulty— I
							stated to him explicitly that I had been informed that he came with a
							forged register—that I had heard of it before there was any allegation
							of the loss of his papers— He said if his Register was forged it was not
							to his knowledge— That he received it from <persRef ref="maury-james"

							that the ship was his own, and he had purchased it of a <persRef ref="u"

							at London— He answered however concerning the forged Register with so
							much hesitation, and with so much stammering about the loss of his
							papers, as confirmed the information given me by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Fisher.— He told me that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Fisher had a letter giving it as a reason why the vessel had been

								>r.</hi> Harris the Consul, to whose province this business belongs;
							assuring him that however inclined and bound I was to give all my

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Patterson</persRef> came and
							mentioned that he found himself in an unpleasant situation—having the
							charge of two vessels at Archangel, laden with Coffee, upon which eighty

						<p><date>16. </date>I received a note from <persRef ref="demaistre-joseph"
								>Count Maistre</persRef> the Sardinian Minister, requesting me to
							return him his manuscript Translation of <persRef ref="plutarch"
								>Plutarch’s</persRef> Treatise on the delays of divine Justice;
							which he lent me some weeks ago— I have <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>been</hi> read it, and been pleased with his preface and Notes— The
							translation is too much dilated— The argument against Wittenbach to
							prove that the Christian Scriptures were known to Plutarch is weak— He
							commends <persRef ref="wittenbach-d">Wittenbach’s</persRef> learning,
							and ingenuity, but censures his infidelity.— There are two points in the
							character of Plutarch’s style, which the french denominate <hi
								rend="italic">bonhommie</hi> and <hi rend="italic">naïveté</hi>—they
							are well represented in the old Translation of <persRef
								ref="amyot-jacques">Amyot</persRef>, but I do not find them in that
							of Count Maistre. He has doubtless corrected some mistakes, and
							elucidated some obscure passages— Plutarch reasons well but leaves much
							of the mysterious veil over his subject which nothing but Christian
							Doctrine can remove— If the existence of Man was limited to this
							life,—it would be impossible for me to believe the Universe under any
							moral Government. Prudence would be the only God, and <persRef
								ref="jupiter">Jupiter</persRef> according to the pagan Doctrine,
							would be subject to Fate.— It is not the affliction of the righteous,
							but the prosperity of the wicked, which would contribute most to stagger
							my faith in divine Justice— I cannot reconcile it to my own mind to see
							the Crimes of a successful Conqueror, punished in the person of his
							innocent great-grand child, and to take it for Justice.— There is one
							more idea which I think not unimportant— Taking a future state of
							retribution for granted, the imperfection of divine Justice in the
							present life, necessarily follows— If it were complete here, there would
							be nothing to compensate hereafter— If the righteous were rewarded, and
							the wicked punished in this world, to the full extent of Justice, there
							would be neither merit nor demerit left, upon which Justice could
							operate hereafter— Now, let it once be admitted that there is a balance
							of virtue and of vice to be accounted for and settled in another state
							of existence, and there will be no question left with regard to the
							delays of divine Justice— Because however defective the measure may be
							found here, the principle supposes that it will be filled up elsewhere—

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Labouchère</persRef>, who read me a
							passage from a letter he had received from Amsterdam, which shocked me
							exceedingly— It related that <persRef ref="six-willem">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> William Six</persRef>, who was the
							last Minister from Holland here, and with whom I was while he resided
							here on such friendly terms, had been found one morning at four O’Clock,
							drowned in a Canal near his house at Amsterdam— That he had gone out
							from his house at half past 9 O’Clock the Evening before— That he had
							not been robb’d, and that for some weeks before it had been remarked
							that he had an appearance of gloom and discontent— The letter and
							Labouchere both intimated the belief that he had voluntarily done this
							act, which I am unwilling to credit— Labouchere says that he was poor—
							That he was supposed to have saved something by his mission here; but
							that he <pb n="282" type="ms"/>had nothing else— That he had only 12000
							livres a year by the place that had been given him, of <hi rend="italic"
								>Intendant des Domaines</hi>, which was a very subordinate
							Office—merely as a Clerk to <persRef ref="daru-pierre">Daru</persRef>—
							And that perhaps Daru might have found fault with something in his
							management of the Domaines— Labouchere is no friend to Six and I hope
							that his conjectures are unfounded— He was not a man from whose
							character such an act of desperation could be expected— He was not so
							poor as Labouchere supposes, and being a bachelor, had no family to bear
							as a burden upon his estate or his spirits— He was undoubtedly much
							reduced from the situation in which he had been here, and in his own
							Country before; and he had set his heart perhaps too much upon personal
							distinctions— But he was as the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">Duke
								de Vicence</persRef> once said of him to me un peu Optimiste— He had
							the peculiar faculty of looking at the fair side of things; and was one
							of the last men, of all whom I ever knew, of whom I should have expected
							self-violence or despondency— It is in every point of view more
							probable, that in the darkness of the Night he fell by accident into the
							Canal, than that he rushed wilfully upon his own fate— At all events it
							is a catastrophe that I deplore.— I saw <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Plincke</persRef> my late land lord,
							and asked him if he had finished his bargain for his house. He said no;
							nor was he likely to finish it at-all— He apologized to me for the short
							Notice he had given me to quit the house, which he declared was in
							consequence of an express message sent him by <persRef
								ref="kozodavlev-osip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kosodawleff</persRef> the Minister of the Interior to give such
							notice to all his tenants, which that Minister had since denied— That he
							had been to him with the very person by whom the message was sent, who
							attested the fact in his presence to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Kosodawleff himself, which produced another explanation between that
							Minister and the Messenger— That he, Plincke considered himself as
							excessively ill-used, and if M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Kosodawleff
							did not immediately come to some arrangement, he should make a statement
							of the facts, and request it might be laid before the Emperor himself.—
							I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Plincke that after the first
							moment of displeasure that I had felt and expressed without disguise to
							him, on receiving so short notice to quit, and in the then condition of
							my family; when I found the house which I now occupy empty, and that I
							could remove into it, I had got over all resentment— That if he should
							finally not sell the house, I would return to it under my lease,
							deducting of course the rent which would have accrued during the time
							that we are not in the house— He said that he should be extremely happy
							to have me return upon these terms— I called upon <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>,
							but he was gone to Cronstadt. I took at his house my letters and papers;
							among which was a letter from <persRef ref="erving-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Erving</persRef> of the 9<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of this month from Copenhagen notifying
							me of the capture of two American vessels by a privateer under French
							Colours— The vessels carried into Copenhagen; and the papers sent to
							Paris— He supposes the same privateer, will carry in vessels bound from
							this Country to America— I immediately went to <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Webb</persRef> and read the letter to
							him—he is going in the John Adams; and I advised him if he could help it
							not to suffer himself to be taken by this privateer— I returned home and
							wrote a letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris enclosing an
							extract of almost the whole of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Erving’s
							letter, and requesting him to communicate the information to the masters
							of the American vessels at Cronstadt, and other persons interested, and
							also if he thinks proper to the <persRef ref="rodde-c;rodde-diedrich"
								>Consular Agents</persRef> at Riga and Revel— I walked from the
								<persRef ref="stisaac">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>

							value every day— Their expences, especially in Spain and Portugal
							increasing— Their merchants all turning to bankrupts— He had seen in the
							Statesman a list of Bankrupts— It took up half the paper— And so the
							ministers spread abroad one absurd falsehood after another merely to
							maintain themselves— One day it was a victory in Spain— The next it was
							a naval victory, and the destruction of a French fleet in the
							Mediterranean—the third it was the taking of Genoa— Now they were trying
							to coax America, and he saw they were beginning to hint that <persRef
								ref="bingham-arthur">Captain Bingham’s</persRef> account of the
							attack upon the little-Belt was not fully confirmed— Then again they
							were coaxing Russia, and were sending frigates and Store-ships with
							powder and Salt-petre which no sooner arrived than they were ordered
							away.— I asked him if he was sure of that—he said the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor</persRef> himself had told him so—
							It was a foolish attempt at a separate negotiation, which they had tried
							twice before and failed; once with the frigate that brought the
							prisoners, and once <hi rend="italic">on another occasion</hi>. (He
							meant the frigate that brought the <persRef ref="bezerra-joao"
								>Portuguese Minister</persRef>[)] They were now not more successful
							than before—though it was said they were here in great want of
							gun-powder— If they wanted it, he could not conceive why they wasted it—
							Every third day they had some fête or manoeuvre here at Cronstadt, when
							they burnt as much powder as would serve for one day of battle— But at
							least he was sure they did not intend War with France, and therefore
							that they would have no separate negotiation with England— It was to be
							sure an aukward way of doing business if this was it— Russia had
								<persRef ref="vorontsov-semen">Woronzoff</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="u">Smirnoff</persRef> in England; if they wanted to negotiate
							it was very easy, but then they would not take such a ridiculous course
							as this— I told him I rejoyced to hear him say that there should be no
							War between this Country and France, for I had for a long time been
							afraid there would— He said he came here with the same apprehension— He
							knew that France did not intend to begin; but he heard so much before he
							came, and saw so much on his way, that he really feared they would begin
							here.— The preparations were in themselves great and menacing. five
							divisions ordered away from the Turkish army to Poland—(I never heard of
							more than four) and then the paper about Oldenburg, looked so much like
							a Manifesto— But that had been explained— It was merely a reservation of
							rights, and would be got over. There were points about which Russia was
							obstinate; she must shew a little flexibility and give them up— The
							return of the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">Duke of
								Vicence</persRef>
							<pb n="285" type="ms"/>had done much good— It was so much easier to
							explain and prove intentions, verbally and in person than at a distance
							of eight-hundred leagues— Besides, if it was thought that long residence
							in the Country, and personal favours received had made something of a
							Russian of him, when the reports of the new comer perfectly agreed with
							those that he carried they must be convincing. I might rely upon it
							therefore with the most perfect certainty that there would be no War,
							for any thing <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> in discussion between the
							parties— And now, said he, we have sent eighty thousand more men into
							Spain, and are going to form a Camp at Boulogne, and along the Coast of
							the North Sea opposite to England— We shall see, if they do not think of
							calling their troops home to defend themselves. I said that it seemed as
							if there would not be a very active Campaign in Portugal— The Emperor,
							he replied, intended first to sweep all clear in Spain— To wear out all
							the Guerillas, and take Valencia and Carthagena, which would not cost so
							much trouble as Tarragona— Cadix would be left, and that was a strong
							place— Probably it would be the last Hold; but the Emperor had given
							great means (de grands moyens) to <persRef ref="bonaparte-joseph">king
								Joseph</persRef>, and all must before long be settled there— As to
							Portugal, the English would always have the position of Terres Vedras
							which could not be forced. Probably the War would not be much pushed
							there— But if the English stayed where they were, at Portalegre encamped
							in the marshes of Alentejo, the pestilence would do among them the work
							of a french army.— Besides which, there were Generals quite competent to
							keep the field on a day of Battle, but not qualified to plan
							successfully a whole Campaign— (He must have alluded to Soult)— The
							result of the Campaign was the only important object in War, and therein
							lay the great talent of the Emperor—(Napoleon.) A Battle was to him only
							a secondary object of consideration— It might almost be said it was
							unimportant— If he lost a Battle to day, he knew that in three weeks
							time he would be ready to win the next— He was sure of the effect of an
							entire Campaign—that was every thing— And that, happily (heureusement)
							was what they wanted here— They had not got a single General, fit to be
							named— Oh! if they had, with such soldiers as they have, he should be
							very much afraid of them— But how they went on with this War in Turkey!—
							This year, nothing done at all, but to return back, to where they were
							two years ago— The year before last <persRef ref="bagration-peter"
								>Prince Bagration</persRef> sends a pompous account of a victory;
							gets the blue ribband, and the day after is recalled because it turns
							out that his victory was a defeat— Last year, what did they?— lost
							thousands upon ten thousands of men, in storming two or three paltry
							fortresses, which after having got they could not hold. Why the Emperor
							Napoleon would not ask more than one Campaign to go to Constantinople.—
							As to the English, if we could but take away from them their Scotch
							soldiers, and their Irish Sailors, we should have cheap and easy work
							with the rest— The Irish are most excellent Sailors, and the Scotch are
							equally good for the land service; but then they have a National feeling
							very distinct from that of the English— They claim me as a Countryman to
							this day— I asked him whether he was directly descended from the
							celebrated <persRef ref="law-john2">John Law</persRef>— No!— But from
							his <persRef ref="law-william">elder brother</persRef> who was my
							Grand-father— John Law left no children— But I am his heir, and that of
							the family, and am still the proprietor of the Estate of Lauriston in
							Scotland.— When I was in England on a mission, there was a great
							entertainment given in Scotland, at which they toasted me as a
							Scotchman— And what is more curious still, they did the same for
								<persRef ref="lawdelauriston-auguste">my Son</persRef>, when for
							having distinguished himself at the Battle of Wagram he was promoted on
							the field of Battle.— The General then told me how the Emperor had sent
							after him into Italy, where he had been employed upon a particular
							mission, to make him Ambassador here— He had never before been upon any
							but short and easy missions; always used to have it soon over, and
							receive nothing but testimonies of satisfaction— But now it was
							altogether different— I dont know how your Government does with you,
							said he, but from mine I can scarcely ever get so much, as a cold
							approbation— If you yield any thing, if you seem even to set forth what
							is alledged on the other side in all its strength, they seem to think
							you are biased, by the people where you are, and coaxed into their
							influence— I foresaw this, and told them so before I came away— I said I
							knew I should get more scoldings than compliments— However I determined
							to accept and here I am— It must come to what it can— He now took his
							leave, and about two hours afterwards I had a visit from <persRef
								ref="bussche-calmor">Count Bussche</persRef> the Westphalian
							Minister— He is of opinion that there is a separate negotiation between
							Russia and England— That the sending of these Store-ships was a
							concerted thing— And that <persRef ref="u">Prince Lubomirski</persRef>,
							whom he says he knows to be much in favour with the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef>, was charged with a
							secret mission— It is certainly possible, and the suspicion is
							countenanced by the manner in which the Prince went from hence (see my
							Journal of 11. 12. 18. and 24 June last) but the reception, or rather
							the rejection of the Store ships upon their arrival is strong evidence,
							either that he was not, or that he has not executed his errand with
							sufficient address, or that since he went there have been changes of
							affairs, which have operated a new change of policy.— Count Bussche is
							much concerned for his <persRef ref="u">eldest daughter</persRef>, who
							he fears has a dysentery— And he is the more alarmed, because he lately
							quarreled with and dismissed his family physician in whose skill he had
							great confidence. <pb n="286" type="ms"/>The Count spoke to me with
							feeling about the miserable fate of our poor friend <persRef
								ref="six-willem">Six</persRef>— He is the only man whom I have heard
							mention it, with any profession of sensibility— <persRef
								ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Julien</persRef> mentioned it to me yesterday— Neither of them
							believes that it was suicide— But each of them accounts for it in his
							own characteristic manner. S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Julien thinks
							it was the issue of some Night Adventure with women of the town— Bussche
							thinks that somebody pushed him into the Amstel, for spite against him
							because he was a french partizan. This is the least unlikely explanation
							of the three.— <persRef ref="bentzon-adrian;bentzon-magdalena">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Bentzon</persRef> paid us a visit this Evening but we could not
							receive them— We were all too much indisposed— I was so unwell that I
							could not go out the whole day, and part of it was prevented from
							writing— <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> was not so well as for several of the
							last days— <persRef ref="smith-catherine-johnson">Catherine</persRef>
							who has had a cough for some time was this Evening so ill with a fever,

							bed.</p>
