							filled, but not crowded— Most of the foreign Ministers were there, and
							generally in full or half-uniform— Some of them however were in frock
							dresses, and all wore pelisses— The Church was excessively cold— The
							service lasted nearly two hours. The Coffin was placed in the Centre of
							the Church, and surrounded with three rows of large wax tapers which
							were lighted.— The hat and sword of the deceased were laid upon the
							Coffin— The service was a Mass, and the requiem was sung by the quire of
							boys belonging to the Church, accompanied by the Organ— After the
							ceremony was over the Coffin was carried out of the Church placed upon a
							herse, and followed by a procession of Carriages taken to the place of
							interment— We did not go to the procession but returned home— <persRef

						<p><date>2. </date>I received this morning from <persRef ref="u">M<hi

								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tilden</persRef>

							desired to be informed some days before hand, when they should fix the
							day for their departure— I paid a visit first to the <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">French Ambassador</persRef> who received
							me— I found him in the midst of a room full of <persRef
								ref="orlowski-alexander">Orlowsky’s</persRef> pictures, which he has
							packed up to send to Paris— He told me that <persRef ref="law-jacques"
								>Count Lauriston</persRef> his successor was to leave Paris the
								20<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of March, and that he expected him
							here in about ten days. He promised to send me a copy of the Petition
							from the merchants here for the admission of vessels with licences to be
							granted by this Government, and which the Emperor had refused— He also
							told me that the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> would dine
							this day with the <persRef ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress
								mother</persRef> at Gatschina, and return this Evening to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg.— I went from the Ambassador’s
							to <persRef ref="grammann-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Grammann’s</persRef> house and left the papers for M<hi

							where I bespoke a draft upon Amsterdam; and then went and pass’d an hour
							at <persRef ref="stedingk-kurt">Count Stedingk’s</persRef>; with whom I

							He gave me several copies of the late Swedish Ordinance respecting the

							to come and dine with him, and to bring <persRef

							spent part of the Evening with us— The General gave me some information
							concerning the school which he is establishing here, which is properly a
							school for Engineers— They have now forty pupils from 15 to 18 years old
							and four teachers; three of whom are Frenchmen, and one a Russian— The
							objects of instruction are Mathematics—Geometry—Drawing, and
							Architecture. It is formed on the model as an imitation in Miniature of
							the Ecole Polytechnique at Paris— This he says was one of the good
							Institutions which sprung out of the worst period of the French
							Revolution— It was a sort of Asylum suggested by some men of Science;
							for a refuge from the popular fury to which they found themselves
							exposed. The term of Instruction is for two years, the scholars are
							taken from 15 to 16 years of age. 150 every year, and for which five or
							six hundred candidates present themselves— They select only the best
							informed— They are required to study ten hours every day, and if a pupil
							absents himself three days together he is excluded from the school.
							After coming out they have to go through two years more at the school
							for the Marine, for the Bridges &amp; High ways, or Fortifications
							according to their several destinations—and on issuing from these
							schools, the young men are immediately appointed officers in the army,
							or Navy. I enquired of the General what was the instruction given here
							at the school of the Cadets— Very little more he said than reading and
							writing; and for many of them hardly that— It is impossible in this
							Country to make either the teachers or the pupils labour—they must be
							idle— He requires at his school that the pupils should understand
							French, because he could get neither teachers nor Books that were
							Russian— The Books that they study are by <persRef ref="bossut-charles"

						<p><date>7. </date>Palm-Sunday. At 10 in the morning
							I went to the Roman Catholic Church, and heard Mass performed— The
							Church was crowded. The only part of the Ceremony which I had not seen
							before was the distribution of the holy palm-branches— But while the
							mass was performing, there were in the Confessionals on each side of the
							altar in the left wing of the Church a Priest who confess’d a number of
							the people, men and women as they successively presented themselves. The
							Confessional is in the form of a sentry box, open at the upper part and
							with a low door reaching about 2 1/2 feet from the floor to let the
							Confessor in and out— It is barely large enough to hold one person, has
							a bench to set down upon, and a small lattice window on each side at
							which the penitent kneeling on the outside applies his lips while the
							Priest listens to it from within— Each confession lasted from five to
							ten minutes— The Priest applied himself alternately to the lattice on
							each side and muffled himself up entirely in his Cloak— When the
							confession was finished he threw aside the Cloak from his face, locked
							his fingers together and holding his hands up thus joined, with his eyes
							cast upwards muttered a short prayer— Then separating his hands with the
							right one cross’d his own breast and with the knuckles of the two first
							fingers gave two gentle knocks at the side of the lattice where the
							penitent was kneeling, as the signal of absolution. The persons who went
							to confession were of the lower Classes of the People— Common Soldiers—
							footmen in livery and women of apparently the like rank— I observed
							their countenances on going to and returning from Confession— They were
							generally and evidently anxious as they approached and joyous or at
							least relieved as they retired from the box— Some of them before
							Confession kneeled and prayed with great apparent earnestness on the
							steps of the altar.— There was a young woman whose confession told
							itself in her shape— Her previous earnest anxiousness was greater, her
							confession longer, and her subsequent satisfaction less unmingled than
							was discernible in any of the other cases. Some of them after confessing
							went and received the Communion— After the mass was finished I walked
							untill 2. O’Clock— At 4. I went with the <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
								>Ladies</persRef> and dined at <persRef ref="stedingk-kurt">Count
								Stedingk’s</persRef>. There were about fifteen persons of the

								>Catherine Johnson</persRef> to the Roman Catholic Church, where we
							saw the performances of the day. We went before 10. in the morning, but
							the ceremonies had commenced at 9. The Church was crowded, and it was
							with difficulty that Catherine, and <persRef ref="godfrey-martha"
								>Martha</persRef>, whom she took with her found seats— I stood the
							whole time— Besides the Mass there is a procession and representation of
							a sort of religious pantomime, exhibiting the Death and burial of
							Christ. A crucifix with a figure of Christ is carried round, under a
							canopy, laid out on Cushions in the Chancel, and then transported in
							solemn procession into a chapel to the left of the great Altar.— In this
							Chapel there is a scenical representation of the Sepulchre, with a
							remote view of Mount Calvary upon which stand the three Crosses—and of
							the Temple of Jerusalem— There is a transparent Coffin with the image of
							a dead body within it, large as human figures, and painted images, of
							the <persRef ref="mary;marymagdalen">two Maries</persRef> on one side of
							the Coffin, and two Angels on the other— The figures of two Roman
							Soldiers appear as guards at the entrance of the Sepulchre, which is
							lighted by sepulchral lamps—the small crucifix which had been carried in
							the procession was laid on cushions upon a table, barr’d off in front of
							this scene, and there were two large brazen Canisters on the table for
							the reception of alms— I saw numbers of men and women successively go up
							to this table, kiss, the feet, the side and the hand of the image on the
							cross, and then drop a piece of silver in one of the alms-boxes— There
							was a Sermon upon the Passion, delivered in the German language; by a
							person who by his pronunciation appeared to be a pole— He spoke the
							Discourse from memory, but appeared not remarkably fluent. The Style of
							his Oratory was moderate, and rather cold than vehement— The division
							was conformable to the french school, and all the Circumstances of the
							Passion were introduced into it with ease and propriety— The Morning

							the <persRef ref="regnault-michel">Comte Regnault de Saint Jean
								d’Angely</persRef>, one of the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
								>Emperor Napoleon’s</persRef> Secretaries of State— <persRef
								ref="regnault-laure">His wife</persRef>, with the assistance of a
							Russian Prince, who had a kindness for her, had prevailed upon her
							husband to purchase for 18000 livres, on account of its extreme
							cheapness a diamond necklace, which the jeweller sold for 30,000, but
							the Russian Prince, unknown to the Count paid the balance of 12000
							livres— But the Count some time after finding that the necklace was
							really worth much more than he had given for it, began to think that he
							could make a good bargain, and upon enquiry of another jeweller who
							offered him 30,000 livres for it, took him at his word, and sold the
							necklace again.— <persRef ref="preuss-augustus">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Preuss</persRef> called on me, and informed me that he
							should be ready to go next Monday week; thinking it not advisable to
							leave the City during the Easter Holidays— Having heard much of the
							religious ceremony performed at the Imperial chapel on Easter eve, I was
							desirous of being a witness of it— But as it is a Ceremony to which the
							foreign Ministers are not invited, I followed the Directions of <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris</persRef>
							who had already attended it two or three times— He called on me about
							ten in the Evening, and we went together to the Palace, just at eleven.
							We were however a full half hour too soon; the apartments not being yet
							lighted— We sat down during that time in the guard room of the Chevalier
							Gardes, and then went into the Hall next to that of the throne, where
							the company was assembling.— The <persRef ref="naryshkin-alexander"
								>Grand Master of the Ceremonies Narishkin</persRef> soon after came
							in, and told us that we must fall in with the crowd, after the Imperial
							family should pass into the Chapel; but the <persRef ref="tolstoy-pyotr"
								>Grand Marshal Count Tolstoi</persRef> coming into the Hall
							afterwards, came up to me; said that he was very glad to have met
							me—that he would take care to get us introduced into the chapel, for
							that if we should follow the crowd we should not get a place where we
							could see any thing— He left us and soon after returned, and as the
							Imperial family were now just ready to go into the chapel he requested
								<persRef ref="u">Prince Galitzin</persRef> to accompany us which he
							did, and introduced us by a side door from the same guard room, where we
							had first been seated into the chapel, where the Priests and the Quire
							of singers were all ready; but the Imperial family had not come in.— He
							placed us at the left side of the chapel close to the iron-railing which
							parts the chancel from the Church, and exactly where the foreign
							Ministers are placed when invited to the celebration of a Te Deum— On
							the other side of it, within the Chancel were the Chancellor, <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>, and two or three
							other Ministers— Prince Galitzin, and <persRef ref="gurieff-dmitri">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gourieff</persRef> who came with us
							also went in there. <persRef ref="watzdorf-carl">General
								Watzdorf</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Count
								Bose</persRef> were already in the chapel, and we all stood
							together— About five minutes after the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef>, <persRef ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress
								Mother</persRef>, Grand Dukes <persRef ref="constantine3"
									>Constantine</persRef> and <persRef ref="nicholas-i">Nicholas</persRef>, and the <persRef
								ref="annafeodorovna">Grand Duchess Ann</persRef> came in, followed
							by the whole Court. The crowd was excessive, and if we had been left to
							follow the Directions of the Grand Master of the Ceremonies Narishkin,
							we should hardly have got within the chapel— The <persRef
								ref="elizabeth-alexeievna">Empress</persRef> was not there having
							lately met with an accident in falling over a trunk, and receiving a
							hurt in her forehead which confines her to her Apartment. The <persRef
								ref="catherinepavlovna">Grand Duchess Catherine</persRef> is gone
								<persRef ref="peter-friedrich">with her husband</persRef> to meet
							the <persRef ref="peter-frederick-louis">Duke of Oldenburg</persRef> his
							father— The <persRef ref="michael2">Grand Duke Michael</persRef> was
							also absent— The Emperor and Empress Mother went and stood within the
							Chancel at the right hand.— A Gun from the fortress, at Midnight had
							been the signal of their entering the chapel— One of the Priests went
							and presented to each of them a lighted taper, which they took into
							their hands; and a lighted taper was in like manner given to every
							person in the chapel. This custom is observed at almost all the
							religious Ceremonies of the Greek Church— The Quire of singers then came
							out from their stations marching two and two in procession, followed by
							the Priests; then by the Emperor and Empress Mother, and after them by
							the Grand Dukes and Grand Duchess, and a small number of the Court Lords
							and Ladies, all with lighted tapers in their hands; the Quire consisting
							of singers of all ages from boys of eight or nine years old to men of
							forty, all in a dark red, and laced Imperial uniform dress, sung as they
							marched a solemn hymn—&amp; minute guns were firing at the same time
							from the fortress— The procession went in this manner out of the chapel,
							and round several of the Palace Halls, and then returned into the Chapel
							in the same order, the Quire continuing all the time their Chant— The
							Emperor &amp; Imperial family resumed their stands, and a religious
							ceremony by the Priests began— It was long, and to me altogether
							unintelligible— The Principal performing Priest was not as I have
							usually seen at Court <persRef ref="podobedov-amvrosy">the
								Metropolitan, and Archbishop of S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Petersburg Ambrose</persRef>; for he was engaged upon a like
							ceremony at his Monastery of S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
							<persRef ref="nevsky-alexander">Alexander Newsky</persRef>— It was not
							even a Bishop; but the Emperor’s Confessor, who as such is entitled to
							wear the mitre— He performs the service with much less dignity than the
							Metropolitan, and his voice could scarcely be <pb n="235" type="ms"
							/>heard— During one part of the ceremony, one of the Priests presented
							to the Emperor two images to kiss, which Count Romanzoff told me were
							sacred relics procured by the <persRef ref="paul-i">Emperor
								Paul</persRef> from Malta— One of them was a picture of the <persRef
								ref="mary">Virgin Mary</persRef>, said to have been painted by
								<persRef ref="luke">Saint Luke</persRef>, and the other was a head
							of <persRef ref="john">S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								John</persRef>— And these, said the Count are all the benefit we
							have derived from our relations with Malta— Some time after the Priests
							ranged themselves all in a line, each of them bearing a sacred image—
							The Emperor went up to them and kiss’d the images and then embraced each
							of the Priests who bore them— The Empress Mother followed him and went
							through the same ceremony, only, instead of her embracing the Priests,
							they all kiss’d her hand— Count Romanzoff told me before, that she would
							kiss them all on the lips; but observing that she did not, said that it
							was always thus done heretofore; and that the kissing of the hand was a
							very late innovation— The Emperor then embraced his Mother; the Grand
							Duke’s followed, and embraced the Emperor and Empress— The Grand Duchess
							came next and went through the process.— Then the Chancellor of the
							Empire, the Grand Chamberlain’s <persRef ref="stroganov-pavel">Count
								Strogonoff</persRef>, and Narishkin kiss’d the relics and Priests,
							and the Emperor, &amp; finally the Empresses hand— A promiscuous crowd
							of Officers followed during more than an hour, going through the same
							formality, the quire of singers continuing all the time to chant. At the
							same time all these Noblemen and Officers, as soon as they had finished
							the operation with the imperial family turned to one another, and such a
							scene of kissing and embracing ensued as I never saw before— As they
							passed from one to the other it was a continual motion like a bee-hive—
							It reminded me of the Descriptions in <persRef ref="ariosto-ludovico"
								>Ariosto</persRef> and <persRef ref="wieland-christoph"
								>Wieland</persRef> of a Sultan and his Court, falling suddenly into
							a fit of involuntary dancing— Before the embracing commenced the tapers
							which had been distributed round among the company were put out, and
							returned to a Servant who went round with a waiter to receive and take
							them away— After the embracements were concluded a new religious
							ceremony commenced a Mass, celebrated by the principal Priest, within
							the Sanctuary, the Doors of which by the Russian rites are opened only
							upon this occasion. In the course of this performance was introduced
							what they call the reading the four Gospels to the four winds of Heaven—
							One of them was read by the principal Priest at the Altar, which is at
							the east— Three desks were brought and placed fronting the west, North
							and South— A large folio volume containing one of the Gospels was placed
							upon each of them— A Priest came and took his stand before each of them,
							and read about a chapter of each gospel; each priest reading two or
							three verses at a time; and following one another successively.— The
							confessor read in so low a tone that his voice could scarcely be heard;
							but the other read in a very strong base voice, between speaking and
							chanting, a fashion of reading peculiar to this Church. The ceremony
							concluded by the principal Priest’s taking the Communion at the Altar;
							but in which neither the Imperial family, nor any of the other Priests
							participated— The whole was finished soon after three in the morning— It
							was about half-past three when I got home. M<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="pardo-benito">General Pardo</persRef>, who told me
							that he considered an immediate War between Russia and France as
							inevitable— The <persRef ref="peter-frederick-louis">Duke of
								Oldenburg</persRef>, and the commercial system were the causes— He
							said that as to the complaints and protest of Russia against the seizure
							of the Duke of Oldenburg’s territories, <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef> had answered according
							to his custom <hi rend="italic">par une sottise</hi>—that the thing was
							sanctioned by a Senatus-consult— As if his Senate consulted any thing
							but by his command— The General said there would soon be a great
							dispersion of all the Corps Diplomatique; and that he himself he
							supposed would also be expected to go— But I can tell you, said he, that
							on account of my own concerns, I shall not go— I shall stay here.— As to
								<persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Romanzoff</persRef>, said he; the
							only thing that still keeps him in, is that <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">Caulaincourt</persRef> is yet here— When

							succeed him— He said there was talk of <persRef ref="panin-nikita"

								>Markoff</persRef>, whom the Emperor personally disliked.— <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris</persRef>

							information which he had recently received concerning the prospect of
							War, and he now urged the expedient of making a sort of provisional
							treaty to be finished if the U.S. Government should send powers— He has
							renewed this subject to me many times— But I think it best to wait for
							authority to act.— It is true that if Count Romanzoff goes out there
							will be little chance of doing any thing afterwards— But in that case
							any provisional arrangement would avail us nothing.— We had this day a
							succession of Easter-compliments and eggs of all kinds—glass,
							porcellain, wood, marble and sugar—besides the real eggs— I lost my

							of a Court at Noon this day; and we went in usual form.— The Diplomatic
							Circle was held about two O’Clock— The <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef> was particular in his attentions to the <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">French Ambassador</persRef>, and to all

								<persRef ref="peter-friedrich">her husband the Prince of
								Oldenburg</persRef>, and <persRef ref="peter-frederick-louis">his

							he had taken <persRef ref="bergien-johann">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Bergien’s</persRef> Country Seat again for the ensuing
							Summer— He said he had neither signed the contract, nor paid the money;
							and he should wait— He expected not to pass the Summer here, and did not
							believe <persRef ref="law-jacques">Count Lauriston</persRef> would come
							here at-all. <persRef ref="vonblome-otto">Baron Blome</persRef> spoke
							much in the same style; lamenting the state of affairs which he said was
							going from bad to worse, and God knew where it would end. I asked
								<persRef ref="stedingk-kurt">Count Stedingk</persRef> how the
								<persRef ref="charles-xiii">king of Sweden’s</persRef> health was—he
							said, that by the last Accounts he was better— But that as he had
							transferred to the <persRef ref="charles-xivjohn">Crown-Prince</persRef>
							as much of his authority as he could, he would protract as long as he
							could the reassumption of power— The king had very reluctantly taken
							upon him the burden of royalty— He was tired of it, and anxiously
							desirous of withdrawing himself from it— The business was too irksome to
							him; not only on account of his age, but of his infirmity; for he was
							more broken than he was old— The Count would have gone on but we were
							interrupted— I was talking with <persRef ref="derayneval-maximilien"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Rayneval</persRef>, when the
								<persRef ref="naryshkin-alexander">Grand Master of the
								Ceremonies</persRef> came up and said that on Saturday there was a
							report that Count Lauriston was arrived; and then mentioned who he had
							heard it from, and how it had turned out to be a mistake— He left us,
							and I observed to Rayneval that it must have been an April day’s report—
							Yes said Rayneval, and M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Narischkin had
							the bonhommie to spread it all over the City— The news rung through the
							Court like a peal, and when the truth came to be known the enquiry was
							from whom the report came, and it all went back not a little at the
							expence of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Narishkin— The Grand-Maitre
							was still so near us that he heard Rayneval name him, and turned again
							to us to hear the sequel of what Rayneval was saying— I thought he would
							have been embarrassed; but he instantly adapted his speech to the
							hearing of the new interlocutor—“and so, said he, it turned out to be an
							erroneous report.” It was a great inquiry, whether we were to go and
							write our names at the Palace of the Grand Duchess Catherine, as is
							customary at the <persRef ref="constantine3">Grand Duke
								Constantine’s</persRef>— At first M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Narishkin said no; it was not necessary— But the inquiry was so often
							repeated that at last he said yes; it would be very proper. The Emperor
							asked me, if I had heard from <persRef ref="smith-john2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> J. S. Smith</persRef>— I said I had;
							that he was gone from Vienna.— He said that he had heard of his arrival

								>Baron Mareschal</persRef> a Secretary to <persRef

								Julien</persRef> who has just returned from Vienna, and who was at
							Court had told me that M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith had left
							Vienna.— As soon as the Court, was over; which lasted as usual not more
							than ten minutes, we went to the marble palace, and wrote our names in
							the antichamber of the Grand-Duke Constantine. Then we went to the
							Palace of Annitschkoff; but there was no preparation of pens ink and

							afternoon to receive the Corps Diplomatique at her Palace. We
							accordingly went at the appointed hour— As I was going up the stairs at
							the Annitschkoff Palace, I met the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef> coming down; alone— He stopp’d and said he
							supposed I was come to see his Sister— I said I was going to pay my
							respects to her Imperial Highness— He asked me if I had seen the house
							before— I told him I had—that it was very magnificent;— He said the
							house was now appropriated to its proper use— Untill lately it had been
							turned into a sort of Magazine.— I found most of the foreign Ministers
							already assembled there— Several of them came in after us—and among the
							rest the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">Ambassador</persRef>.— When
							we were all assembled we were introduced into the apartment next to the
							Bed-chamber; and soon afterwards the Grand-Duchess came in, accompanied
							by the <persRef ref="peter-friedrich">Prince her husband</persRef>— The
							Grand Master of the Ceremonies, Narishkin made the presentations There
							were with the Grand Duchess in Attendance only the <persRef ref="u">old
								Princess Volkonsky</persRef> and <persRef ref="gargarin-nikolai"
								>Prince Gargarin</persRef> the Grand Duchesses Equerry. The Circle
							was held altogether in the same Style as at the Imperial Palace— The
							Grand-Duchess spoke to the Ambassador and to all the Ministers, and was
							followed by the Prince, and the <persRef
								ref="elizabeth-alexeievna;mariafeodorovna">Empresses</persRef>
							follow the Emperor— She stood much longer, talking to each person, and
							after going through all the Circle returned again, and resumed a
							conversation with the Ambassador; after which she and the Prince retired
							and we all came home— I walked before dinner, and in the Evening.</p>

						<p><date>20. </date>At half-past ten this morning I went to the Roman

							There was a bishop or at least a person with the episcopal mitre, and

							was so much of a crowd that I could neither see nor hear distinctly much

							introduced leaning upon the arm of the Priest, up to the Nave. There was
							anointed with Oil, and had a white fillet tied round his head, and a
							white robe over his garments. At the conclusion the Communion was

							proved to be the tight-rope dancers, and he was frightened instead of
							being pleased— After seeing them four or five minutes, he said he wanted
							to come away, and I <pb n="238" type="ms"/>could not prevail upon him to

							attempted to take him into another, but he was so reluctant that I sent
							<persRef ref="paul-servant">Paul</persRef> home with him— We went into two others of the Booths where we saw
							the Chinese Shadows, and an exhibition of transparencies similar to
							those of the last year.— The only novelty of the Chinese Shadows was a
							Representation of <persRef ref="noah">Noah’s</persRef> Ark, and the
							flood— As it was cold, and 4. O’Clock was approaching, and especially as

							the Secretary of the Saxon Legation was in agony of distress between the

							silent, and almost deserted. The Square was entirely clear, and the
							Guard of Soldiers on the square was dismiss’d— The weather which untill

							remarkably fine— I have been this day and last Sunday interrupted in my
							usual Sunday reading, and only finished the first volume of <persRef
								ref="massillon-jean">Massillon’s</persRef> Conferences— It closes
							with several of his Pastoral letters, or Mandemens—which give me the

								>Dauphin</persRef>, son of <persRef ref="louis-xv">Lewis
								15</persRef>. the Bishop, considers it as a special blessing of

							frequently pass’d from one family of Sovereigns to another— Oh! blind to
							fate— That dauphin was never to wear the crown, and <persRef
								ref="louis-xvi">his Son</persRef> was to be the last king of the
							Capet line. In all the orders for a Te Deum on account of Victories, he
							speaks of them as disasters to be deprecated, and only to be celebrated
							as approximations to peace— These are truly Christian Sentiments, but in
							the triumphant days of <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis 14</persRef>. and
							now in those of <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef>, a
							Bishop would hardly be found who would dare in public proclamation to
							express them— They are the popular Sentiments only of pacific times, and
							would meet little favour in ages of glory.</p>

							were however one or two small open passages in the channel of the river,
							above and below the Bridge— We returned about three O’Clock and the
							Bridge was already loosened from the abutments on both sides— There was
							a crowd of People waiting to see the breaking up of the river, and the
							passage for Carriages over the river was barr’d— We descended from the
							Carriage and cross’d the Bridge on foot— The bars were opened and our
							Carriage was allowed to come over after us— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs:</hi> Adams then returned in it home, and I walked round the
							Boulevard to the Hermitage Bridge on the Quay, and back, untill five
							O’Clock, to observe the progress of the Water, encroaching upon the ice,
							and to see if the Bridge of Boats should be carried away. At five I went
							home and dined, and about seven in the Evening returned taking <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> with me to walk. I found the
							Bridge still in the same condition, though carriages were no longer
							allowed to pass, and the open passages in the Channel above the Bridge
							were so enlarged that they had almost reached the road from the Palace
							Corner over to the Island.— That however stood yet firm, entirely across
							the river— I walked round the Boulevard again and back, untill after
							Sunset— Just then I met <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi

							thought the Bridge would not go for three or four hours.— Returning I

							it press’d about fifteen feet wide of its wonted place— And thus it
							remained untill the road itself had floated down to the mass of ice
							around the boats— Its weight and pressure then parted the floating part
							of the Bridge entirely from the abutments, and the boats were urged
							partly by the ice, and partly drawn by cords towards the Island side of
							the river— Nothing was broken nor was there any apparent violence in the
							operation. I walked back to the Palace Quay, and found the Channel of
							the river open all the way along, and up above the Palace. I then
							returned to where the Bridge had been, and the passage there was not yet

							about 1. O’Clock to his house, and had a conversation with him— He told
							me that it had never been his intention that bonds should be required
							for the production of the Russian Consular Certificates upon the last
							admitted American Cargoes— That a mere engagement of the Consignees
							without any penalty was all that he had required, and that was merely to
							save the appearances in regard to the obligations of this Country— That
							the custom-houses had misunderstood his instructions, but he had written
							yesterday a new order to explain his former direction, and had given
							facilities, to take the engagements of the Consignees immediately here,
							without requiring any at the out-ports where the vessels are— He said
							that he had sent to <persRef ref="gurieff-dmitri">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gourieff</persRef> some weeks ago,
							his protestation against the decision of the Commission at Archangel in
							the case of the Eliza, and he did not know why M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Gourieff had not finished the business in the Counsel— That
							he had ordered the papers of the American vessel at Abo to be dispatched
							that she might come to Cronstadt— That in the case of the Venus at Riga,
							he would give orders that the engagement to produce the papers (from
							Cadix) should be taken, as in the others, or that the petition of
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Kennedy</persRef>
							the Super-cargo should be granted—the Cargo sold, and the proceeds
							deposited untill he shall himself produce the papers.— He believed that
							he had not one case of an American vessel left upon hand.— As to the <hi
								rend="italic">time</hi>, which had been given for producing the
							papers, a year and day, that had been fixed on the proposition of
								<persRef ref="meyer-jc">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Meyer</persRef> and <persRef ref="stieglitz-ludwig">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Stieglitz</persRef> themselves; but
							if longer time was wanting, he was as willing that they should have two
							or three years as one— I spoke to him of the Correspondence between the
								<persRef ref="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="turreau-louis">General Turreau</persRef>, respecting
							the french Consular Certificates— He said there was one Hamburg vessel,
							that had produced a french Certificate of a Consul in America, and they
							were embarrassed what to do with it, but the most extraordinary case
							they had was of a house at Rotterdam, which had made a solemn
							declaration before <pb n="240" type="ms"/>the Russian Consul that they
							had expedited a certain vessel and Cargo, to a Russian commercial house
							at Archangel, and a declaration equally solemn before the french
							Authorities, that they never had expedited any such vessel— The Baron as

							Cleon— But the scandal of the double-dealer is so keen, and the goodness

							brilliant of the two. The moral is amiable and just— The versification
							elegant, harmonious and easy. The language and manners decent without

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> The General distribution of my daily

							begin the day by reading five chapters in the Bible— A practice which I
							have followed for many years, and which brings me through the Book once
							a year, allowing for an occasional interruption of one day in four— As I
							have not had any such interruption since the commencement of the last
							year, I finished the English Bible before the end of September, and
							began the French Bible as translated by the Pastors and Professors of
							the Church of Geneva, with the Arguments to the Chapters and Reflections
							by <persRef ref="osterwald-jean">Ostervald</persRef>, Pastor of a Church
							at Neufchatel, and a Preface to the Apocryphal Books, by <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Martin</persRef>— I finished
							the Old Testament <hi rend="strikethrough">yesterda</hi> the 29<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> of March, and the Apocrypha yesterday—
							But this Apocrypha contains neither of the two Books of Esdras, which
							are in the English Bibles. Nor are there any reflections of Ostervald
							upon the Apocryphal Books— After this morning exercise I usually write
							my journal of the preceding day— Breakfast from 10 to 11.— Write Letters
							and pay or receive visits untill 3 or 4. P.M— Walk an hour— Dine at 5.
							Walk another hour, and close the Evening in conversation, with Company
							at home, occasional visits abroad, or reading— As the Evenings shorten I
							have drop’d the custom of writing a page in short-hand which I pursued
							for about four months— My letters for America engross the largest
							portion of my time; which I do not yet employ in a manner satisfactory
							to myself.</p>
