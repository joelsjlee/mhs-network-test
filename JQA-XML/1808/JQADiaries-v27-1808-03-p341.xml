								Nicholas</persRef> asked for some conversation with me, in the
							Committee-Room of the Senate; to which we accordingly retired— He then
							express’d much anxiety respecting the present State of Affairs, and

							refuted; declared they were entirely destitute of truth; and requested
							me to ask the <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">President</persRef>
							himself, who would be pleased to give me a direct Answer on the subject—
							I told him that the jealousies and suspicions among my friends and
							neighbours were founded on a variety of circumstances, which gave them
							colour, and which were not easily susceptible of refutation— I then told
							him of a letter I had seen early last Summer from the <persRef
								ref="wentworth-john">Governor of Nova-Scotia</persRef>, asserting
							that the British Government were inform’d of a plan determined upon by
							France, to conquer the British Provinces on this Continent, and form a
							Monarchy of them under <persRef ref="moreau-jean">General
								Moreau</persRef>— And at the same time to introduce a more
							monarchical Government in these States— All which was to be effected by
							means of a War between this Country and Great Britain— This Story,
							combined with many recent occurrences was a source of distrust which
							could not without difficulty be removed— He disclaimed all knowledge or
							belief of such a plan, and supposed its object to be merely a British
							device to divide and distract us— We had a conversation of perhaps a
							couple of hours; he asked me whether he might make use of the
							information I had given him; to which I assented, so far as that no
							names might be implicated. Sometime afterwards <persRef ref="pope-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pope</persRef> came to me, and
							asked me to introduce a Bill to continue the Act of 3. March 1805, and
							the President’s Proclamation under it— He said the House would not pass
							the Bill which we had pass’d early in the Session, to reinforce that
							Act— For they would not arm the frigates, and agree to the <hi
								rend="italic">Torpedo</hi> system; but they wanted the remainder of
							the Bill— I told him that the house might strike out then what they
							disliked; or introduce a Bill themselves to continue the Act— It would
							be inconsistent in us, and particularly in me, to bring forward such a
							Bill, while the other was before the House— To which he assented—
								<persRef ref="boyd-george;boyd-harriet">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Boyd</persRef>

							first importance— It will not be without importance to the Nation— It
							was taken from a strong sense of duty— That it will increase the
							difficulties and dangers of my situation I am fully aware— That it will
							bring upon me the fury of all my former enemies and a host of new ones,
							I perceive— I ask aid from above to support and pass through this
							ordeal— As my act has been deliberate, and will probably involve further
							controversy I pray for Intrepidity—Perseverance—Temperance—Justice, and
							Fortitude.</p>
