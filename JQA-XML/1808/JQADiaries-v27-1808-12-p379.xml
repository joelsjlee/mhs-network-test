							earnestness to decide otherwise— At his request, I left with him the
							paper I had drawn up, with the condition agreed between us that it
							should be for his use alone; and to be returned to me, when sufficiently
							considered by him— I shewed it yesterday to <persRef key="adams-john">my

							counsel would be prudent to take, I asked his advice— He declined
							however giving me any decided opinion— Between the magnitude of the
							prize, in the view of Ambition, and the magnitude of the Stake, in that
							of personal Independence, he was at a loss to decide for me, and left me
							to the operation of my own mind— For my own part, in this as in other
							cases, I set my ambition aside— The question is whether I shall assume
							an agency in this transaction, which shall make me the Candidate of the
							party, for the Governor’s Office at the next Election— By declining to
							act, I shall certainly not be taken up— By acting, in all probability I
							should— But my occupation, my support, the comfort of my family, and my
							father’s quiet, in his declining life, must be ventured upon the die;
							and after all, the public benefit, which might result from my decision,
							is quite uncertain— My only regard is to the public, and my own opinion,
							with that of my friend G. and the hesitation of my father, all concur to
							the same point in my final decision— <persRef
