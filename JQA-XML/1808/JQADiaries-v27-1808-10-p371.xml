									>r:</hi> Benjamin Austin</persRef> this morning called at my
							Office, and in a long conversation urged me again to permit my name to
							be held up as the candidate for this district at the approaching
							election— Two other members of the Committee also called at my house
							this afternoon for the same purpose— I think a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Rhodes</persRef> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi><space/>I persevered however in my
							determination to the last.— In proportion as the anxious importunities
							of these persons have been repeated, my own anxiety, to discharge
							faithfully <hi rend="italic">all</hi> my duties has encreased upon me.
							The first and the last impression upon my mind has been, that I ought
							not to sacrifice the obligations of private friendship, by suffering
							myself to be put up in opposition to <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Quincy</persRef>. The other
							considerations, which in the first instance would have disinclined me to
							consent, I should have given up to the earnestness, and the propriety
							with which I have been entreated, merely not to decline an election, if
							my name should be announced. I believe the election would be carried.—
							At any rate; I should carry all but a majority, if not a complete one.
							At any rate my personal feelings would be gratified by the strength of
							the support I should receive. My personal importance would be raised, in
							the estimation of both parties, and I am not unaware that my resolution
							on this occasion, will have the contrary effect upon both— All this
							however I must be willing to endure— I can find no difficulty in
							disposing of arguments the power of which centres in myself— The subject
							has been presented to me by my own feelings and by others in a more
							fascinating form— That the moment is critical— That a patriotic Citizen
							ought not to withhold himself from the public Service, and the wishes of
							his fellow-citizens— That private friendship must be made subordinate to
							the public welfare— And that by merely being inactive, and doing nothing
							either to encourage or to discountenance the nomination, I should not
								<pb n="373" type="ms"/>violate any duty of friendship, since rival
							candidates may still remain cordial friends— This reasoning I have found
							it most arduous to resist— I do believe my services to be a right of my
							Country to claim— But so are Quincy’s—and I cannot bring myself to that
							pitch of self-imagined importance, as to suppose that I am bound to seek
							the means of public service, by acceding to an attempt at edging him out
							of it— The representation of this District is not the hinge upon which
							the destinies of this Nation will turn, nor is Quincy a man who will
							lend himself to the destructive projects of the present leaders of the
							federal party.— Upon the whole, I feel satisfied with my own decision in
							this case— Its event is in wiser hands than mine— I read this day
								<persRef ref="davis-john">Judge Davis’s</persRef> opinion upon the
							embargo question— Returned it this Evening to <persRef
