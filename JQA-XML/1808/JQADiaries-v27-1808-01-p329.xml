						<p><date>2. </date>I called this morning upon the <persRef

							turn— But he said that there was now no vacancy, and a numerous list of
							applicants.— I agreed to enclose the letter, that he might get his
							chance— The Sec<hi rend="superscript">y:</hi> also spoke to me about a
							bill, which we have pass’d in Senate to increase the Military Peace
							Establishment, and which he seemed very much averse to having pass’d— I
							went up to the Capitol, upon a note received last Evening from <persRef
								ref="smith-john6">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith</persRef> of
							Ohio, mentioning that he should be ready with his answer, corrected this
							morning— He brought it accordingly, having expunged not only the parts
							objected to, but some others which he mentioned to me, and one of a very
							extraordinary nature, which he said nothing about, but which I
							discovered on reading it over— He also brought me a short letter,
							intimating that there was a strong point to prove his innocence, which
							he could not now disclose, but which might hereafter be his
							justification to the Nation.— His idea is that he can prove something
							against the <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">President</persRef>, which
							will intimidate his friends, so that they will not dare to expel him;
							and this I suppose is the key to that confidence with which he has come
							here, and defied investigation.— I sent his Answers to the press— My
							Report was sent up printed, and was in some demand among several of the
							members— But <persRef ref="white-samuel2">M<hi rend="superscript"

							Evening I went with the <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>Ladies</persRef> to a tea-party at Georgetown, at <persRef
								ref="lee-thomas2">Governor Lee’s</persRef>— I could not well spare

							false imputations which Bayard had attempted to cast upon me, in two
							long speeches, delivered in his highest tone of Eloquence, had affected
							me more than they ought to do— For after all, I know it is not in his
							power now essentially to injure my credit, either with the Senate or
							with the public, and that his most violent attacks upon me can give him
							nothing more than a hard bought triumph, on the mere forms of debate—
							For the talent of extemporaneous speaking he knows his great superiority
							over me, and he exults in displaying it; because in every other
							particular he is conscious of his inferiority— It is perhaps from
							consciousness of both these things also that his exultations of victory
							are so galling to me— I know my moral and political principles to be
							more pure than his; and this is saying little, for his are very loose,
							and even corrupt.— I believe my talents and acquirements greater than
							his, excepting that of unpremeditated eloquence— Of that I have very
							little, and he more than any man I ever heard in Congress— But as this
							is the only point in which an appearance of contest between us is
							exhibited to the world, he never loses an opportunity of holding himself
							out against me.— My report above all he was unable to brook, for it has
							been praised so much, that to him it was past all endurance; and so
							impatient was he to break out upon it, that he poured himself forth in
							his two speeches to day, against every principle of order, upon a
							question on which the vote was unanimous.— It was all a Philippic upon
							me.— Finally next Wednesday was assigned to hear M<hi rend="superscript"

							however, about ninety members who assembled under M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bradley’s summons— Upon which he stated
							the authority formerly given him, and his reasons for calling the
							meeting— But he said that as exception had been taken to his exercise of
							that authority it was now at an end, and the meeting must proceed at
							their own pleasure. He said that he had issued his circulars to every
							Republican member of both houses—indeed to Every member, excepting<hi

							of Representatives— Nor should I have omitted them, said he, but that

							some question whether there should be a viva voce nomination, and a

							nomination— On taking the ballot’s for the Office of President there
							were 83 votes for <persRef ref="madison-james">James Madison</persRef>,
							3 for <persRef key="monroe-james">James Monroe</persRef>, and 3. for

							declared James Madison duly nominated by a great majority of votes, as a
							Candidate for the Office of President, and George Clinton for that of
							Vice-President— A Committee of Correspondence was then chosen consisting
							of a member from each State, but Connecticut and Delaware not being
							present, had no members chosen— A Resolution was then offered by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles, and adopted, for publication
							stating this nomination, and the reasons which induced the meeting to
							make it; after which the meeting adjourned without day, and I came home—
							Many of the persons who attended this meeting thought it precipitately
							called— Many refused to attend— The number present was a bare majority
							of the whole number of members—27. Federalists were not invited— About
							60 others were absent— Among whom were all the Virginian or Randolph
							minority— <persRef ref="mitchill-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

								ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard</persRef>
							came in late, and seemed internally vexed at some part of the discussion
							which took place.— We adjourned after 3 O’Clock to meet again on
							Tuesday— The other members having first left the Committee-room, I found
							myself alone with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles.— He then said
							“our friend Bayard<hi rend="strikethrough">’s</hi> appears out of humour
							to day”— Upon which I answered—yes— And he seems to me labouring under a
							violent internal struggle, between his fear of deserting his own party,
							and his wish to join your’s— Giles smiled, and said it was exactly so—
							He then gave me a history of Bayard’s overtures from time to time during
							the whole course of this administration, to join in supporting them— All
							predicated upon one of two things, by way of consideration— The one some
							personal accommodation of interest or of honour for himself, the other
							upon some inducement for the State of <hi rend="italic">Delaware</hi>,
							to detach herself from the Eastern and join to the Southern interest— In
							the course of this Story, Giles interwove some remarks, which he
							probably meant me to understand— He said that as to their supposed
							inveteracy against federalists as such he felt none of it— That the
							Administration knew the comparative weight of federal talents and would
							gladly be aided by them— That he had always discountenanced Bayard’s
							proposals for geographical party boundaries, and as to his personal
							views had told him that he might rely upon his own talents and be
							assured that under any administration which they should support, they
							must be duly appretiated— Giles did not give me his opinion as to the
							correctness of these motives of Bayard; but he left me to form my own—
							They are in my estimation not sound moral or political principles.— In
							remarking that the Administration <pb n="335" type="ms"/>would willingly
							possess the aid of the federal talents he said “what aid do we derive
							from our supporters in the Massachusetts delegation in Congress?”—they
							are all worthy respectable men—such men as we generally send
							ourselves—perhaps better—but they cannot be of much service to us— What
							aid do we derive from the State of Connecticut? we know that the weight
							of talent &amp; character there would be useful to us, and have none of
							that inveteracy, which is sometimes imputed to us against them— To these
							parts of his remarks I made no reply— I believed them meant for me to
							make a particular application of them to myself— So far as they might be
							meant as a stimulus to any personal views of my own, I determined to be
							very explicit with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles, but I thought
							it best to reflect upon what he said, and postpone my observations to
							another day— So far as they might be in the nature of overtures for
							conciliatory courses of policy between the Eastern federalists and the
							administration, I thought it a subject to converse upon with other
							gentlemen— I spent the Evening at home, writing to <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father</persRef>.</p>
