							at Nantucket— After some conversation it was agreed that I should call

								ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Quincy</persRef> asked me to have some conversation with him, which
							I did at his chamber— He enquired into the motives of my late conduct in
							Congress, which I fully detailed to him— He said my principles were too
							pure for those with whom I was acting—and <hi rend="italic">they would
								not thank me for them</hi>— I told him I did not want their thanks—
							He said they would not <hi rend="italic">value me</hi> the more for
							them— I told him, I cared not whether they valued me for them or not— My
							character such as it was must stand upon its own ground, and not upon
							the bolstering of any man or party— I fully opened to him my motives for
							supporting the Administration at this Crisis, and my sense of the danger
							which a Spirit of opposition at this time is bringing upon the <hi
								rend="italic">Union</hi>. I told him where that opposition in case
							of War must in its nature end— Either in a <hi rend="italic">Civil</hi>
							War—or in a dissolution of the Union with the Atlantic States in
							subserviency to Great-Britain— That to resist this I was ready if
							necessary to sacrifice every thing I have in life, and even life itself—
							I intimated to him that he would be called perhaps ere long to make the
							election which side he would take too— He said he did not see the
							prospect in the same light, but if he did, he should also be willing to
							meet that question when it came— He did not say which side he should
							take— The result of the Conversation was an opinion on my part that he
							was too far pledged in opposition to retreat, and that his own idea was
							rather that of reclaiming me from the “<hi rend="italic">error of my
								ways</hi>”— We must wait with patience, to see where the right is.—
							I spent the Evening at <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Thornton’s</persRef> with a large
							party— Had a long Conversation with <persRef ref="casamajor-louis">M<hi

						<p><date>2. </date>Met with <persRef ref="giles-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles’s</persRef> Committee, at ten
							this morning— He had a bill drawn, but was waiting for copies to be made
							out for the members— We made some progress in discussing its various
							Sections, and adjourned untill Thursday morning, with the view of
							attending the Senate— But they too had met and adjourned— I now
							pointedly asked M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles, whether he
							thought that sort of negotiation, of <persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard</persRef>, on personal
							considerations for himself, and local advantages for his State, was a
							sound course of proceeding on moral and political principle— Giles
							evaded answering this question— He said <pb n="336" type="ms"/>that
							nothing had ever pass’d between them which could properly be termed a
							negotiation— That Bayard had been he believed more explicit with
								<persRef ref="smith-samuel2">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Smith</persRef>— That in his Conversations with him, the most
							particular of which was last Spring, at <persRef ref="clark-daniel"
								>Daniel Clark’s</persRef> Ball, he had indeed intimated a wish to
							coalesce with the administration, always connected with some views of
							personal aggrandizement for himself— He had said there were no prospects
							for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> under this Administration— That <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef>
							<hi rend="italic">hated</hi> federalists— But he hoped a new State of
							things would come with which <hi rend="italic">he</hi> could be
							reconciled— A War, for instance— And within a few days he has suggested
							the same thing, with regard to <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Madison’s</persRef> Election.— I did
							tell him said M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles, that if he could
							find the views of public affairs of the Administration such as he could
							cordially support, he might remove his residence to Philadelphia, and
							would very soon be at the head of the <hi rend="italic"
								>Pennsylvania</hi> delegation, which might place him in that rank
							and consideration to which he thinks himself entitled— I then observed
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Giles that as, from some observations
							he had made to me at our last Conversation, I had supposed he might
							intend that I should apply to myself some intimations of a similar
							nature, I thought myself bound to be very explicit with him— That in any
							support I have given or ever shall give to this or any other
							administration I have been and shall be governed solely by public
							considerations, and the belief that the Administration aims at the
							welfare of the Nation.— That I have no personal expectations or wishes
							whatsoever— He replied that he had often been asked by his friends in
							Virginia respecting me; and had uniformly told them that he believed I
							considered every public measure as I should a proposition in <persRef
								ref="euclid">Euclid</persRef>, abstracted from any party
							considerations, and that was the reason why he thought that since we
							have been together in Senate there were perhaps no two members who so
							often voted together as him and me. There was a good deal more of
							conversation between us, but none which I deem it now necessary to write
							down— It was on my part entirely without reference to myself—on his it
							had possibly some meaning.— He said he believed the present <persRef
								ref="clinton-george">Vice-President</persRef> would serve again in
							that Office— But if he did not, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> should have no
							objection to select an <hi rend="italic">Eastern</hi> Gentleman— That as
							to <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">DeWitt Clinton</persRef>, who was said
							to be the greatest political intriguer in the United States, nothing
							could induce him (Giles) to support his pretensions.— That <persRef
								ref="lewis-morgan">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lewis</persRef>
							the late Governor of New-York was expected here in a day or two, though
							he did not know for what— That with respect to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Madison’s election, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had no
							personal views of his own to promote— That he had never said a word to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Madison about it; for he should have
							thought it indelicate— And he believed the same of <persRef
								ref="nicholas-wilson">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Nicholas</persRef>— The result of the whole Conversation in my mind
							is this—Giles and Nicholas are the managers for Madison’s election, in
							the two houses.— Giles has been working with me and with Bayard, much in
							the same way.— Opening to our view personal expectations and flattering
							prospects to engage us with them.— Bayard who (as I told Giles) <hi
								rend="italic">lacks advancement</hi> has more than met him half-way,
							and will eventually make his bargain.— Giles was somewhat unexpectedly
							met, and probably not well pleased with my direct and explicit denial of
							any personal views, by which any Administration could take hold of me—
							But he still perseveres in touching strings, which he thinks will
							vibrate internally for his purposes.— Giles understands his business—
							And it is no small part of his address to manage as he does his
							political coquetting between Bayard and me— By setting us upon one
							another, he is sure to draw strength from our weakness.— This also
							explains to me that bitter and unrelenting virulence with which Bayard
							is always seeking opposition to me— He thinks to recommend himself to
							Giles, by his virulence against me— Giles’s conversations have clearly
							shewn his motives— I had been much surprized at it before, and found it
							utterly unaccountable.— I intimated something of this opinion to Giles,
							and he assented to it— Bayard formerly carried on the same struggle
							against Giles himself— But since Giles has been in such a triumphant
							majority that is ever since we have all been in Senate together, Bayard
							has invariably cowered before Giles, and sought his consolation in
							pecking at me— — — I spent the Evening with the <persRef

							that we could harmonize among ourselves— That I had little intimacy with

							healed it was idle to think of attempting any thing— That if a

							aid, for effecting it; and I should readily converse with any Gentlemen
							who wished it, on the subject— He said he would commit to paper his

								Gardenier’s</persRef> speech this day last week, on this bill, part

								>Johnson</persRef> of Kentucky, <persRef ref="campbell-george"
								>Campbell</persRef> of Tennessee, and <persRef ref="montgomery-john"
								>Montgomery</persRef> of Maryland replied to what he had said, by
							such direct and personal invective, that a challenge of M<hi

								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Johnson ensued— <persRef

								Eppes</persRef> the two seconds, have been making the formal

							such general notice that a crowd of one or two hundred persons, are said
							to have followed them to the selected spot, where they were finally
							separated for the present by the magistrates of the District and of the
							neighbouring County of Maryland— On coming home I found <persRef

							very angry at the interference of the magistrates— In the Evening,
								<persRef ref="story-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
