							Smith of Tennessee, had the day before yesterday <hi rend="italic"

							yesterday had convinced him— I feel so much personally for the man, and

								Gilman</persRef> this day spoke to me, with intimations that it was
							the wish of several gentlemen with whom he had conversed, to <hi
								rend="italic">bring me forward</hi>, in some active and
							distinguished Station— But that it was wished I would take occasion
							either in some Speech, or in some written publication to express my
							Sentiments with respect to the practicability of our present form of
							Government— As from some of my writings published before I went to
							Europe, there were persons who thought me inclined to favour a
							Constitution approaching nearer to the monarchical form— I told him I
							would reflect upon these suggestions, but my present impressions which I
							did not think likely to change, were these—I was sworn to support the
							Constitution of the United States— I would support it with the utmost of
							my power, and with perfect sincerity— I had during the present Session
							of Congress, to say nothing of preceding dates, pledged more to support
							it, in my own opinion, than any other man in the Union— I had sacrificed
							to it the favour of the party which had placed me in my present Station—
							I had therefore not only the common Stake of others who support the
							Administration, but the responsibility of appearing to abandon my own
							party; and was liable to all the obloquy which such desertion carries
							with it— My motive for it was, to support the Constitution as I had
							sworn— I had therefore taken an active part in the public Affairs both
							foreign and domestic— And to the best of my ability endeavoured to
							defend it against its enemies external and internal— But I had not set
							one party at defiance, in this conduct, for the purpose of making myself
							the instrument of another— That as to my speculative opinions upon the
							practicability of our present Constitution, I had my doubts, whether in
							case of a <hi rend="italic">War</hi>, it would get along in its present
							form— I believed it would become, more democratic— With regard to the
							theory of Government, I had not for many years read over any of the
							papers written by me and published before I went to Europe; but I was
							not aware of any one sentiment or opinion contained in them, that I
							could now retract— That, as to my being brought forward in a conspicuous
							Station, I certainly did not think it a desirable thing— There was not a
							place in the gift of the People or of the Executive of the United States
							or of my own State, for which I had the slightest wish— That to be <hi
								rend="italic">dismiss’d</hi> from the place which I now am in, would
							doubtless occasion a moment of personal mortification, for which
							however, my mind was made up; and which would be more than compensated
							by the advantage of being <hi rend="italic">released</hi> from the cares
							of the public service, at such a time as this— But that as to any thing
							else, so far as my personal desires were concerned, I would not speak
							ten words; nor write two lines to be President of the United States— Nor
							of course to be any thing subordinate to that— He said this was standing
							on very independent ground indeed— But that for himself he was satisfied
							there ought to be that Confidence in a Man’s Principles, &amp;
							integrity, not to require of him any pledge of opinions at-all.— I did
							not enquire, nor did he tell me with whom he had conversed, or what the
							object was to which he referr’d as the conspicuous Station of which he
							spoke in general terms— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gilman however
							is the particular friend of <persRef ref="clinton-george">M<hi

							is of <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

							about as well qualified for the one as for the other— He then said in
							the same tone; that he thought so too. But he believed the Department of
							State would suit me best; and when <hi rend="italic">he</hi> should be
