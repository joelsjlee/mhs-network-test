						<p>I attended at the morning Service of S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
							John’s Church. <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read prayers for Quinquagesima Sunday,
							and preached from Hebrews 12.2 “Looking unto Jesus the author and
							finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured
							the cross despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the
							throne of God.”— In the afternoon at the Presbyterian Church <persRef
								ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef>
							preached from James 2 12. “So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be
							judged, by the Law of Liberty.” In this as in others of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith’s discourses, he inclines more than
							is usual with presbyterians, to the doctrines of the efficacy of good
							works. I read also the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of <persRef
								ref="bancroft-aaron">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bancroft’s</persRef> Sermons, on the corruption and abuses of the
							papal hierarchy, and the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> on the nature
							of the reformation in the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> century—and
							I read a Sermon of <persRef ref="channing-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Channing</persRef> on War, delivered
							at Boston on the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January— It is a
							political pamphlet against <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President
								Jackson’s</persRef> threat of reprizals for five Millions of
							Dollars; and it is filled with common-place declamation against War—
							Channing is the most renowned preacher in Boston— He has whenever he
							dared been a bitter and servile politician in the pulpit—a chaplain
							general of blue light federalism— War is a fine subject for the
							rancorous benevolence of politician priestcraft to harp upon— War is
							always execrable unless justified by its cause and object— But there are
							philosophical views of War which the benevolent apostles always
							overlook— This Sermon is superficial, and flat, but is published as a
							factious pamphlet. <persRef key="frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Frye</persRef> dined with us, and <persRef
								ref="connell-john">John Connell</persRef> spent an hour of the
							Evening with me— In the morning I revised for the National Intelligencer
							the minutes of the <persRef ref="stansbury-arthur">Reporter</persRef>
							which <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Seaton</persRef> had given me yesterday, of the desultory Speech
							which I made yesterday in the house, and in the Evening, I endeavoured
							to arrange the heads of remarks yet to be made by me to unfold my whole
							purpose respecting the present state of our Affairs with France, and
							upon which I am again to be disappointed.</p>

						<p><date>Monday 2. March 1835</date> <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> -2.</p>
						<p>My Speech of Saturday was printed so confusedly this morning, in the
							National Intelligencer as to make much of it nonsense— I spoke of it to
								<persRef ref="gales-joseph">Jos. Gales</persRef>, who sent for his
							foreman who came to the house and on collating the manuscript with the
							Paper of this morning,—he saw the gross mistake that had been made, and
							said the Speech must and should be printed over again— <persRef
								ref="henderson-francis2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Henderson</persRef> claimant of a grant to the Representatives of
								<persRef ref="laurens-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> John
								Lawrence</persRef>, and <persRef ref="gilpin-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gilpin</persRef> sent in and called me
							out of the house— In the House several petitions, and memorials were
							presented— On motion of <persRef ref="white-campbell">C. P.
								White</persRef> 10,000 copies of the report on Commerce and
							Navigation to 30 Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1834 should be
							printed. Sundry Chairmen of the standing Committees asked to be
							discharged from further Consideration of subjects referred to them—
								<persRef ref="hamer-thomas">Hamer’s</persRef> report from the
							judiciary Committee upon the public printing was read, laid on the table
							and ordered to be printed— The Report on the West-Point Academy was
							discussed till <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef>
							moved to discharge the Committee of the whole on the Union from the
							further consideration of the Resolutions relating to the dispute with
							France, and that they be taken up in the House, upon which <persRef
								ref="wilde-richard">Wilde</persRef> called for the yeas and nays,
							which were 104 to 92— The question first in order was on <persRef
								ref="archer-william">Archer’s</persRef> Amendment to my Amendment of
							the first Resolution offered by C. C. Cambreleng <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">E. Everett</persRef> made a feeble speech in
							favour of adhering to the execution of the Treaty— He was followed by
								<persRef ref="allen-william3">Allen</persRef> of Ohio—<persRef
								ref="love-james">Love</persRef> of Kentucky and <persRef
								ref="moore-thomas3">Moore</persRef> of Virginia <persRef
								ref="evans-george2">Evans</persRef> of Maine; <persRef
								ref="sutherland-joel">Sutherland</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="clayton-augustin">Clayton</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="gilmer-george">Gilmer</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="lytle-robert">Lytle</persRef>, Cambreleng offered to take the
							words of the closing Sentence of the Minority Committee report, without
							the words at all hazards. <persRef ref="robertson-john2"
								>Robertson</persRef> of Virginia had resolutions of his own to
							offer— So had <persRef ref="jones-seaborn">Seaborn Jones</persRef>, and
							finally <persRef ref="binney-horace">Binney</persRef> came out in a
							Speech with all his power against my Resolutions, and in favour of
							Archers— <persRef ref="watmough-john">Watmough</persRef> moved to lay
							all the Resolutions on the Table— I replied to them all, particularly to
							Archer on his Resolution <persRef ref="hardin-benjamin"
							>Hardin</persRef>, <persRef ref="chilton-thomas">Chilton</persRef>,
							Archer replied to me by long and furious personalities—to which <persRef
								ref="hawes-albert">Hawes</persRef> for me rejoined— I rejoined to
								<persRef ref="gorham-benjamin">Gorham</persRef>, who surrejoined—
							The motion to lay on the table was rejected 48. 166. Archer’s Resolution
							by 71 to 143 Robertson’s and Seaborn Jones’s without yeas and nays, and
							my Resolution carried unanimously 211 votes—followed by clapping of
							hands in Gallery and house— Adjourned at Midnight.</p>

						<p>VI:30. <date>Tuesday 3. March. 1835.</date> Close of 23<hi
							rend="superscript">d.</hi> Congress— <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fah<hi rend="superscript"
								>t</hi></persRef> 8.</p>
						<p>The House met at ten— Several members absent when the question was taken
							last Evening asked permission now to record their votes in favour of the
							Resolution— The greatest part of the day was consumed in debating the
							Amendments of the Senate to the General Appropriation Bill— They had
							annexed to the items of outfit and Salary for a Minister to
							Great-Britain a proviso that they should not be paid, unless the
							appointment should be made by and with the advice and consent of the
							Senate— I opposed this amendment and the House disagreed in it— The
							Senate insisted, there was a committee of conference, who agreed that
							the appropriation itself should be struck out— It was within a half an
							hour of midnight when the Bill went to the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President</persRef>, but it was carried through— The fortification
							Bill was not so fortunate— At near Midnight <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> moved as an
							Amendment to the Amendments of the Senate, an additional Section,
							placing three Millions of dollars at the discretion of the President,
							for the military and naval service—and for ordinance and
							fortifications—to this the Senate disagreed—on the return of the Bill I
							voted to recede from the amendment, foreseeing that otherwise the whole
							bill would be lost— The House however insisted and the Senate <hi
								rend="italic">adhered</hi>— The House asked a conference, to which
							the Senate agreed; the Committee of conference reported, an
							appropriation of 300,000 dollars for ordnance and 500000 dollars for
							increase of the navy; but the report was made after midnight and there
							was no Quorum to receive it— Cambreleng at first delayed and finally
							refused to make the report— The President soon after Midnight, left the
							Capitol— The Senate sent a message to the House, to remind them of the
							report of the Committee of Conference—then a message that they had
							finished their business, and were ready to adjourn—and while the House
							were vainly endeavouring to make a Quorum, the Senate adjourned—upon
							which after an address from the Speaker, <persRef ref="bell-john"
								>Bell</persRef> in return for an unanimous vote of thanks, at 20
							minutes past 3. A.M. the House was adjourned without day— Home 20
							minutes to 4.</p>
