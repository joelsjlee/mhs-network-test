						<p>I called twice this morning, once before, and once after breakfast at
								<persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">Governor Armstrong’s</persRef> new
							house— The first time about 8 he was not up. The second time he received
							me—and I had two hours of conversation with him— I returned to him the
							Reports of <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef> and
							of the Heads of Departments which I had received from him yesterday—and
							asked him what were the duties of the Committee— He did not exactly
							know— There would be a Report to be made to the Board of Overseers, at
							their meeting in January next; but it was a mere formality— He proposed
							to look up the Report of the last year, and to follow it as a precedent—
							I said I knew not precisely what the duties of the Committee were, but I
							presumed they were, to inspect the condition of the University and to
							report the same in writing to the Board of Overseers I had read this
							morning the Reports of President Quincy, and of the Heads of
							Departments,—and regretted that I had arrived yesterday so late, that I
							could not then read them— Upon perusing them this morning, the question
							had occurred to me whether they were complete— That is whether all the
							subordinate reports required by the usage were made— He said the Report
							from the Professor of Law, had not been made quite in time; but he
							expected to receive it to day— I asked why there was no Report from the
							Professor of Natural philosophy and Astronomy. He said he believed the
							Professor, <persRef ref="farrar-john">Farrar</persRef>, was not upon
							good terms with the corporation—but that was no reason, why he should
							not have made a Report— I asked why there was no report from the
							Librarian— He said that was made to another Committee. This introduced a
							general discussion upon the condition of the University, and the duties
							of the visiting Committee, in which I urged him to make a report, to the
							board of Overseers, not merely formal, but such as might call the
							attention of the board to any deficiencies or abuses in the management
							of the Institution itself— He promised to ascertain from the Secretary
							of the Board <persRef ref="pierce-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pearce</persRef>, what are the precise duties of the <pb n="485"
								type="ms"/>Committee, to consult with the other members of the
							Committee, (only 5 of whom, out of ten attended the Meeting) and to
							prepare a Report, which he would submit to my consideration, before the
							meeting of the Board in January—I have sown this conversation <hi
								rend="strikethrough">of</hi> with Governor Armstrong as seed— I
							believe the University needs an electric shock to restore it from a
							paralytic state, and I will make an effort to apply it— President Quincy
							has done much, and has the best possible disposition to do more—but he
							wants countenance and support from abroad and he has the fear of man too
							much before his eyes.— I called also at the House of <persRef
								ref="hallett-benjamin">B. F. Hallett</persRef>, and then at the
							Office of the Daily Advocate, where I found him— Had a conversation of
							two hours with him upon politics— He promised to republish the Article

								ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> came this Morning and
							agreed to renew his lease for five years from the 1<hi

							that I am to expend 2000 dollars in building a new farm house, and in
							making other alterations and repairs—his rent to be 800 dollars a year,
							and he to pay all the taxes— I read to him at his request the former
							lease and promised to draw up a new one for him to examine before
							executing it— He said he was drawn as a juryman, to go to the Supreme
							Court at Dedham, and expected to be engaged there the whole week— But he
							wished to have the affair of the lease settled before my departure for
							Washington— My Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came
							out from Boston, dined with us and returned in the Evening— His account
							of the Resolutions passed by Anti-masonic members of the Legislature of
							Vermont, was somewhat discouraging— The Resolutions were reported by
								<persRef ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef>, who smarting with his
							dismission from Office by <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>Van-Buren</persRef>, substitutes his resentments for principles and

							But the Democratic party in Boston, have proposed to the Anti-masons to
							place Charles’s name on the list to be jointly supported for the State
							Senate at the approaching elections— He has determined however to
							decline this honour. I was confined the whole of this day to the house,
							and with great difficulty got through an answer to a Letter from
								<persRef ref="bancroft-george">George Bancroft</persRef>— I am
							threatened with the loss of my right hand, for every purpose of

								Kendall</persRef> of Medfield, this Morning from John 11.23 “Jesus

							resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead,

							never die; Believest thou this?” After dinner—the text was from
							Ephesians 4.14. “That we henceforth be no more children tossed to and
							fro, and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men,
							and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.” M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Kendall is a young man, Son of <persRef
								ref="kendall-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kendall</persRef>
							of Plymouth— His Discourses were sensible and well-written; but
							inanimately delivered— He seemed to need the performance upon himself of
							a miracle; like that which formed the subject whence his text was drawn—
							To be raised from the dead— He noticed the difference between a
							restoration from death to life, as in the case of <persRef ref="lazarus"
								>Lazarus</persRef>; and the resurrection from the dead, at the
							judgment day— And gave it as his opinion, that the final resurrection
							was not with the same body which we have upon Earth.— I read the first
							Sermon of the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, upon the manner of praising
							God— Not one of the most satisfactory to me— I read also some pages of
							the Dissertation H. upon the Congress of Nation, the most verbose upon
							the evils of War of any that I have yet read— And I finished reading the
							second Volume of the Letters from <persRef ref="walpole-horace">Horace
								Walpole</persRef> to <persRef ref="mann-horace2">Sir Horace
								Mann</persRef>— They are very amusing— I was struck with one of them
							in which he mentions the publication of <persRef ref="bolingbroke-henry"
								>Bolingbroke’s</persRef> three Treatises on the Spirit of
							Patriotism—the Patriot King, and on the State of Parties— In the last he
							denies that there was any design in the Ministry at the close of
								<persRef ref="anne">Queen Ann’s</persRef> reign to restore the
							Stuarts— Exactly like the denial that the Hartford Convention was part
							of a project for a separation of these States and a Northern
							Confederacy— Walpole’s remark upon the impudent assertion of
							Bolingbroke, reminded me of <persRef ref="otis-harrison">H. G.
								Otis’s</persRef> assertions equally bold, to whitewash the Hartford
							Convention.—</p>

							decline— I finished this morning the reading of <persRef

							and political principles— My day was much wasted as usual— I wrote an

							shagbark Acorns and wild Cherries in the cleared hazel-bush patch in the

						<p>I sent to <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thomas Greenleaf</persRef> the Indentures, between the Supervisors

							Quincy, and the widow <persRef ref="thayer-betsey">Betsey
								Thayer</persRef>— A Lease for one hundred years of a house lot,
							about half an Acre, on the Eight Acre lot given by <persRef

								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> having fixed also on this day
							for the baptism of <persRef ref="adams-charles7">his second
								Son</persRef>, I was obliged to go to Boston to be present at that
							ceremony—and must execute the Deed, for my part some other day— I went
							into Boston, with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef>; and we took with us Charles’s eldest boy <persRef
								ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef>, who has hitherto remained
							with us— I called at Charles’s Office, where I found <persRef
								ref="spear-william">William Spear</persRef> and at <persRef
								ref="colman-samuel">Samuel Colman’s</persRef> shop, and settled with
							him an Account for 14 parts, from 13 to 26. of the National Gallery of
							Portraits— At Noon Charles’s child was baptized, at his house, by
								<persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Brooks— Edward Brooks, and <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> and M<hi rend="superscript"

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Frothingham</persRef> is
							keeping M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks’s House— Immediately after
							dinner I returned with Charles to Boston—and then came with my wife home
							to Quincy— <persRef ref="kirk-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Kirk</persRef> went and returned with us. We reached home about half
							past seven in the Evening— This day is the centurial anniversary of my
							fathers birth— On the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October 1735.
							Old Style, he was born— This is the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							October 1835 Old Style— He was born of <persRef
								ref="adams-john4;hall-susanna">Parents</persRef> in humble life, and
							has left an illustrious name, for his descendants to sustain by virtues
							like his own— May it please the disposer of all Events that his
							great-grandson this day devoted to the service of God and man, may enjoy
							as long, as useful and prosperous a life</p>
