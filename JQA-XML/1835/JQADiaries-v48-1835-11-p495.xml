                        <p>Heard <persRef ref="holland-frederic">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Holland</persRef>, in the morning from 1. John 4:16—[“]God is love:
                            and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God; and God in him”—and in
                            the afternoon, from Hebrews 4.9—“There remaineth therefore a rest to the
                            People of God”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holland is not happy in
                            the exterior of eloquence— He has a downcast almost sheepish look in the
                            Pulpit, is awkward in his action—has a harsh grating voice; and little
                            knowledge of its appropriate modulation—but his composition is good—his
                            style animated, and highly oratorical—dealing quite as much as the
                            soberness of religious discourse should do in metaphorical amplification
                            and hyperbole— His morning Sermon was a hymn of glory to love— Meaning
                            thereby benevolence—charity— The afternoon discourse was but a sequel to
                            the same—with a somewhat perplexing enquiry concerning the place of
                            Heaven— The preacher declared his entire belief that the general idea of
                            Christians as to the place of Heaven—in the sky—beyond the Stars was
                            erroneous— He appeared to discredit the resurrection of the body, and
                            perplexed himself a little with the inquiry, what will be the specific
                            character of happiness in the future world— He was quite sure it would
                            be in the exercise of love—benevolence—charity; which brought him again
                            into the track of the morning Sermon— They were both very animated, and
                            excited close and constant attention. I read the second Sermon of the
                                8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef

                            Christ in the Church—in which there is introduced an argument for
                            Toleration— One of those in which he starts strong objections to meet
                            them with weak Solutions— I agreed with <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E. Price Greenleaf</persRef>, to

                            permission the next autumn— I have found them very agreeable— I read
                            several Letters from <persRef ref="walpole-horace">Walpole</persRef> to
                                <persRef ref="mann-horace2">Mann</persRef>— One which introduces the

                            from the Time when he was struck off the Pension list until his death—
                            He had a Petition signed by Church’s daughters, which he took back to
                            obtain the signature of the husband of one of the daughters, which he
                            will send me, together with the testimony to Church’s poverty— He asked

                            struck off the list— I promised to make enquiry into the subject, and if
                            I should find just ground for it, to move for the repeal of the Act of
                            Congress, under which many Pensioners were struck off the list— After

                            patented He shewed and explained its operation to me—not however so that
                            I could fully understand it— They said they would forward this model to
                            the superintendent of the Patent Office by the Mail to-morrow, and the
                            new specification of the Patent to me. Alpheus Spear was here this
                            Evening— I read to him the draft of a new Lease of the Mount Wollaston
                            farm for five years, which I had prepared, and he took it with him for
                            examination— I engaged to go to the Farm on Wednesday— I planted
                            Apple-seeds Pear-seeds, Plum stones, Tulip tree seeds, and Shagbark

                            morning, about that little strip of Saltmarsh land, for which he has
                            been four or five years negotiating— I offered it for him, as the fence
                            now runs, for fifty dollars, which he thought so enormous that I
                            expected to have heard no further from him concerning it— But he now
                            disclosed his purpose— He wishes to have it to the road, so that he may
                            remove the fence, and take in a larger slip— <persRef
                                ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> had understood his
                            intent before, and had hinted to me the expediency of bounding him by
                            the fence as it now runs— He finally said he would endeavour to purchase
                            another piece of Saltmarsh, and asked if I would buy his short acre
                            locked in with my land— I told him I wood for a reasonable price—

                            sale to Souther, as he would have given me— My Son <persRef

                        <p>I was engaged, writing, last Evening till 10. O’Clock—my fire had gone
                            out, and I had got insensibly chilled with cold— I went to bed, and was
                            four hours recovering my natural warmth; and two hours more without
                            closing my eyes in sleep— I lost the Night— At four I rose, and after

                            discussed again the building of the House at Mount Wollaston, and the
                            renewal of Spear’s lease— Adams finally concluded to go to Bangor, for
                            lumber, and went to Boston to embark in a Schooner ready to sail this
                            day— Spear agreed to pay 10 per cent more rent upon 200 dollars
                            additional for painting the house inside and out, for blinds and window

                            and returned, early this Evening— I answered a Letter that I had

                            the visiting Committee of the Board of Overseers. It is much more
                            comprehensive than I had anticipated— But it will not be in my power to
                            meet again with the Committee.— I sowed two rows of Apple and Pear seeds
                            with plums, Shag-bark walnuts and Tulip-tree seeds in the cleared hazel
                            bush patch— I walked also to the Mount Wollaston farm, where <persRef

                            year, and four horse-chesnuts all thinn’d from my Garden— As the time of

                            were with us— The Bunker hill Railway passes through three of my
                            lots—the Field, the Joy, and the Savile lots: The company wish to
                            purchase 25 feet from the Railway on the East-side, and 12 feet on the
                            West-side— They have now six-feet wide—and they wish also to purchase a
                            wedge of ground at the termination of their Rail-way.— The distances
                            were measured by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphrey, through the
                            three lots— At the third the Railway is raised on piles, from 15 to 20
                            feet high, over a swamp; and the work is so decayed that we could not
                            pass over it— We were kept there upon the Survey till past four O’Clock,
                            and it was near five when I got home— I lent M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Humphrey the plan taken by <persRef ref="withington-mather"
                                >Mather Withington</persRef> in August 1826. of the three lots with
                            the Rail-way passing through them.— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
                            Humphrey promised to return the plan to W. Spear on Saturday Evening,
                            with his own plan of this day’s surveys. <persRef ref="spear-alpheus"
                                >Alpheus Spear</persRef> was here this Evening, pressing for the
                            Execution of his new Lease— I promised to have the two copies of it
                            ready for execution to-morrow Evening— He settled with me also for the
                            parish tax upon the farm for the last four years—making a deduction of
                            about 15 dollars from the tax of the year 1831— This affair has thus
                            been settled without a lawsuit; by a small sacrifice of my right. My Son
                                <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> had engaged to go
                            with us to the Survey on the Railway; but he sent me word last Evening

                            the Madam Alford prize— But what the benefactions are, and why they
                            should be conferred on those two young men was not explained.— I thought
                            these enquiries should be made, and answered before making the Report to
                            the board—and I suggested the expediency of adding some remarks upon the
                            mutilation of books taken out by Students from the university Library,
                            and proposing some remedy for the evil.— It would perhaps be more
                            appropriately the duty of the Committee on the Library— We had next some
                            conversation upon present political prospects— An election warmly
                            contested— He told me he did not think that <persRef

                            Governor by the People— He said he had been excessively urged, to
                            decline; but had thought it unnecessary inasmuch as he had not been
                            asked— He said much more than I have time to record— From his house I
                            went to the Branch Bank, and made preparation for our departure— Then to

                            Compliments— I may probably never see him again, as he is going next
                            Spring with his family to Europe. He is an amiable, sensible,
                            unpretending man, and has been one of a very few unvarying and
                            disinterested friends to me— I dined at my Son Charles’s house, and
                            immediately after dinner returned to Quincy, with Mary, her two children

                        <p>Heard <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Lunt</persRef>, this morning from Matthew 5.43. [“]Ye have heard
                            that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine
                            enemy: 44. But I say unto you, Love your Enemies, bless them that curse
                            you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them, which
                            despitefully use you, and persecute you”— This was an argumentative
                            Sermon, in reply to the objection that the precept is contrary to the
                            nature of man— Resentment for injuries, it is affirmed is the Law of
                            nature— To require of men that they should love their enemies, is to
                            exact an impossibility— It is to enervate the Soul and to debase the
                            Spirit— To love your enemy is impracticable—and the precept by requiring
                            more than a man can sincerely give, leads to an <hi rend="italic"
                                >ostensible</hi> obedience, which terminates in outward profession
                            and inward hypocrisy— The reply was very ingenious and forcible— The
                            forgiveness of injuries is the highest glory of the Christian Code of
                            Morals— It is not impracticable— It is exemplified by Millions, every
                            hour of the day— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s afternoon text
                            was from Revelation 21.4. “And God shall wipe away all tears from their
                            eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying,
                            neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed
                            away”— This was a discourse of a very unusual character— An attempted
                            glance at the condition of the disembodied Soul, beyond the grave— A
                            narrative of human life, to the blessed in heaven, by a Spirit just
                            released from life upon Earth— It was deeply solemn and impressive, and
                            even painfully affecting. The third Sermon of the 8<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"

                            and the Citizen of the world was cold and tame, in comparison, with the
                            awful eloquence of the new-comer to the skies from the imagination of
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt— It sunk into my heart, with a
                            melancholy sentiment for the remainder of the day— I told <persRef

                                >Charles</persRef> waiting there; and took leave of him— We came all
                            together in one division of a Car, and alighted at half past 11. at the
                            wharf in Providence, where the Steamer President, Captain<space/>was
                            ready to depart— It began to rain immediately after we left Quincy; and
                            to storm before we started from Boston— A heavy Southeast gale with
                            driving wind accompanied us till we reached Providence, and we were
                            almost drenched in passing from the Car to the Steamer— We left Boston
                            precisely at nine, and performed that part of our Journey in two hours
                            and a half— At Noon the Steamer loosened from the wharf, the storm still
                            raging, and about 3. P.M came to at Newport— The Storm then had ceased,
                            and the wind came round to West-North-west, clearing the sky to crystal,
                            but blowing still a gale— Our Captain waited till about 9 this Evening,
                            to allow the swell of the Sea off Point Judith to subside, but upon
                            going out the gale was still so heavy that the boat could not stem the
                            waves, and after beating against them, pitching and rolling for two
                            hours with out advancing three miles, the boat became restive to the
                            helm, and it became necessary to return to Newport and lay at the wharf
                            till morning— In the evening before we left the wharf <persRef

                        <p>From Newport to New-London—and Long-Island Sound—</p>
                        <p>At eight O’Clock this morning we parted again from the wharf at Newport,
                            with a clear sky, but a heavy gale, West-North-west, which continued the
                            whole day.— On doubling Point Judith, and until we reached the Eastern
                            end of Fisher’s Island the boat laboured exceedingly, and all my family
                            and most of the other passengers were Sea-sick. Among the multitude,
                            there were of my acquaintance, <persRef ref="appleton-nathan">M<hi

                            for Havre, to spend a year or two in France and Italy; chiefly for the
                            health of one of the daughters who has symptoms of pulmonary complaints—

                            fresh supply of pine-wood fuel— While lying at the wharf, I strolled
                            into the Streets, and was accosted by a man of <persRef
                                ref="falstaff-john">Falstaff</persRef>-size, who announced himself
                            to me, as the mate of the Ship Washington when we came from London to
                            New-York in 1817. He said he had been constantly since that time engaged
                            in whaling voyages, and had very lately arrived from the South Sea— At
                            7. in the Evening we left New-London again, the gale still blowing
                            heavily at West North-west— Five hours our boat was stemming wind and
                            tide; after the change of which there was less of commotion— I was up
                            till near one of the morning reading a fulsome Article in the

                        <p>From Long-Island Sound to New-York and Philadelphia—</p>
                        <p>The latter part of the Night, the progress of our bark became easy— At
                            seven this morning we landed at New-York, and the boat that left
                            Providence yesterday at Noon; arrived within an hour after us— We
                            breakfasted at the City-Hotel, where the only acquaintance whom I met
                            was <persRef ref="barnum-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Barnum</persRef> of the great Hotel at Baltimore;—who told me how he
                            saved his house from the fury of the mob last Summer.— At ten O’Clock we
                            took the Steam-boat for Amboy, where we landed between one and two— Then
                            the Rail-way Car, in which we came to Bordentown at four— Then the
                            Steam-boat for Philadelphia, where at seven we landed upon Chestnut
                            Street wharf; and came and took lodgings for the Night, at
                            Congress-Hall, corner of Chesnut and third Streets.— Here, after tea,
                                <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> left us, taking her
                            daughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef> with her, and
                            went to her friend <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                                Clapp’s</persRef>, having promised to spend a week or ten days with
                            her.— Our fellow travelers from New-York were with very few exceptions
                            different from those with whom we came through the Sound— No old
                            acquaintance, save a man, who as formerly a resident at Haverhill, had
                            known me there; named <persRef ref="u">Plummer</persRef>— And a resident
                            at New-Bedford named <persRef ref="u">Bartlett</persRef>— I walked to
                                <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Nicholas Biddle’s</persRef>, and found him laid up on a Settee with
                            a lame leg and foot. About three weeks since he met with a fall in the
                            Street, and in the struggle to recover himself snap’d the tendon of the
                            calf of his leg— He is confined for three Months if he ever recovers the
                            used of his leg— But he keeps his Spirits up cheerful— <persRef

                            and his family are at his seat in the Country— I sat with him, in
                            conversation till past Midnight, and frankly told him of the troubles of
                            my present position, and of the deep anxieties of my prospects for the
                            winter.— While I was with him <persRef ref="reed-william2">W. B.
                                Reed</persRef> came in and spent an hour, much elated with whig

                                >r</hi> Biddle urged me to take the dispute with France in hand— It

                            home in a Hack and I walked from the landing place at the foot of the
                            Capitol Hill— At half past eight I entered the house where I have
                            resided the last six winters— May a blessing rest upon it!— <persRef

                                Phillips</persRef> was one of our fellow Passengers from
                            Philadelphia— He had left his family at New-York, and came, with the
                            Mail which leaves that City at four in the afternoon— Arrives after
                            Midnight at Camden opposite to Philadelphia, whence he crossed the river
                            at five this morning— He comes to Washington to engage lodgings for
                            himself and his family for the winter and to bespeak his Seat in the
                            House of Representatives— He intends to go back for New-York on Monday
                            or Tuesday. There were two or three other persons, who recognized me as
                            old acquaintance; but whom I did not remember—</p>
                        <p>We have thus for the first time accomplished the whole journey of five
                            hundred miles from Boston to Washington City, by Steam Five conveyances
                            by water, and four by land, Two of the Railroads, that from Boston to
                            Providence, and that from Baltimore to Washington, have been opened
                            since I left this City to return home last May— Our detention in the
                            passage of the Sound was equivalent to the addition of 170 miles to our
                            Journey— We have been four days.— But never to remembrance has my mind
                            in travelling, been in so complete a state of stagnation as upon this
                            Journey— I have neither written, read observed nor reflected— What then
                            will be the Winter?</p>

                        <p>Four Nights successively with scarcely two hours of Sleep each Night; and
                            incessant travelling with alternation of Railway and Steam-boat, had
                            wearied me so thoroughly that it was 8 this morning when I rose— I
                            attended public worship at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
                            Church. A <persRef ref="dana-charles">stranger</persRef> read prayers
                            for the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Sunday after Trinity, and
                            preached in the Morning from Hebrews 9.27. “And as it is appointed unto
                            men, once to die, but after this the judgment[”]— <persRef

                            and her Son <persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas</persRef> came in
                            immediately after Church, and stayed and dined with us— <persRef

                            also paid us a visit— After dinner I went to the second Presbyterian
                            Church, but met <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                M’Lellan</persRef>, who informed me that their second Service was at
                            seven in the Evening— I went therefore again to S<hi rend="superscript"
                                >t.</hi> John’s and heard the same Stranger, read the Evening
                            prayer, and preach from Mark 8.36—“For what shall it profit a man, if he
                            shall gain the whole world, and lose his own Soul? 37. Or what shall a
                            man give in exchange for his Soul?” Both the Sermons were upon the
                            judgment day; and they were deeply solemn and impressive—without
                            enthusiasm, but not without eloquence— After church I went to call upon

                                >r</hi> Phillips at Connell’s chamber. Phillips has engaged the

                            for his family, for the winter, and he disengaged himself from dining
                            with me to-morrow as he had promised, as he has concluded to go to
                            morrow at 4. O’Clock in the afternoon, in the railway Cars to Baltimore—
                            On my return home, I found <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi

                        <p>I called this morning at the Office of the <persRef ref="cass-lewis"
                                >Secretary of War</persRef>, with the Petition of <persRef
                                ref="vinson-thomas">Thomas Vinson</persRef>, for the increase of his
                            Pension, and the papers in the case of <persRef ref="church-thomas"
                                >Thomas Church</persRef> who was a pensioner under the act of March
                            1818. and was struck off the list under the Act of May 1821— He promised
                            to enquire into both the cases and inform me of the result— I intimated
                            my intention to propose a repeal of the Act of 1821. and said I should
                            probably move a call for a Statement of all the pensioners who had been
                            struck off from the list, because they had some property— I conversed
                            with him also, on the controversy between Ohio and Michigan, and the
                            self-Constitution of the latter into a State; for which he said there
                            was a precedent in the case of the State of Tennessee— He spoke also of
                            the Public Lands, for the sale of which in the present year he said the
                            proceeds paid into the Treasury would amount to ten Millions of dollars—
                            We had also a long conversation upon the state of our dispute with
                            France, which I greatly fear from what he said, that there is little
                            prospect of its being satisfactorily adjusted— He spoke of a declaration
                            to be made by the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> in
                            his message that the French Government had demanded an explanation,
                            which never could or would be given— I said Negotiation was the art of
                            avoiding direct issues; and that if such a declaration should be made, I
                            thought settlement would be farther off than ever— I called at the
                            Officers of the National Intelligencer, and ordered the paper to be sent
                            to my house. Then at the <unclear>Pat</unclear>ent-Office, with the
                            papers of <persRef ref="lane-charles">Charles Lane</persRef> of Hingham—
                            Then at the Capitol, where I took my seat in the House— Saw <persRef

                        <p>I have taken a very severe cold, and awoke this morning about 2. O’Clock—
                            At three I rose—wrote till five, and then went again to bed for an hour
                            and a half— I was occupied upwards of two hours in searching among my
                            papers for the copy of <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s</persRef> cypher, but
                            without success.— I found however a number of Letters and despatches,
                            belonging to the Department of State—which have been packed up with my
                            papers, since I have been out of office— I took them to the Department
                            of State where I saw first <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">Asbury

                            was upon the Records of the Department a copy of the Report of <persRef
                                ref="jefferson-thomas">Thomas Jefferson</persRef> of 24. April 1790

                            the constructive power of the Senate in the case of Appointments of
                            Ministers to Foreign Countries— I examined the Volume of Reports made by
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson to both Houses of Congress,
                            but it was not among them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth said
                            there was no doubt a copy of it, among M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford declined assenting to it—
                            Forsyth spoke also of a claim by the Belgian Government for reciprocity
                            of duties, founded upon a questionable allowance by us of the same to
                            the Hollanders— It was left a standing controversy with the Dutch when
                            my administration terminated— Forsyth said the <persRef

                            Message, and that his opinion concurred with mine, in this case— After

                        <p>I brought up the arrears of my Diary upon these loose Sheets, and
                            examined the remainder of the papers in my blue Chests, numbers 9. 10.
                            11. 12. 13. 14. and one without number— I did not find however the
                            papers of the Ghent Negotiation, nor <persRef
                                key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Crawford’s</persRef> cypher. There are multitudes of useless papers
                            which would make a good bonfire, and will never be good for any thing
                            else— I sent the keys of the six numbered chests to <persRef
                                ref="stone-henry">Stone</persRef> the engraver, who cut
                            corresponding numbers upon the keys—and the key of N. 9. opens also the
                            unnumbered chest— Two of the chests are empty; and will serve for
                            packing all my papers since March 1809. I returned <persRef

                                Woodbury’s</persRef> visit by a card, and called upon him, at his
                            office of Secretary of the Treasury— Had a conversation with him upon
                            the alteration proposed of the Laws for the collection of the Revenue—
                            He referred me to the Report on that subject made by him at the last
                            Session of Congress; and to a Bill which then passed the Senate, but not
                            the house— I spoke also of my intention to propose again a rule of the
                            house requiring the Committee of Ways and Means to report the general
                            Appropriation Bills, within thirty days from the beginning of the
                            Session, or the reasons for further delay— He said this might easily be
                            done, as he had made the last annual Report on the Finances, the first
                            week of the Session, and should do so again— I spoke of the
                            unconstitutional provisos inserted into Appropriation-Bills, as of an
                            exceedingly dangerous practice— He spoke of the Patronage-Bill, of the
                            last Session, and of the Boston pamphlet in opposition to it; which he
                            characterised as of great ability— I told him that I was not the author
                            of it, and told him also who was— He said it had given him a new view of
                            the subject, and quite conclusive against the Bill— I called also at the
                            Office of the National Intelligencer and saw <persRef

                            absorbed all the labouring part of the day— I read too some pages of the
                            Moral Class-book, and a chapter of the Natural History of Insects,—and
                            great part of the Poem of <persRef ref="romeo">Romeus</persRef> and

                            passages in the poem, which is nearly as long as the Tragedy and
                            contains at least 3000 lines— In this Poem Capulet says that Juliet, is
                            not yet sixteen—too young to be a bride—and Romeo is said not to have
                            yet a beard upon his chin— My attention was distracted by this waste of

                        <p>The weather is more like that of July or August, than of November, and
                            the Anthracite Coal fires have brought upon me the catarrhal Cough,
                            which for several winters past has harrassed me, and from which I can
                            never more expect to be free— As the Session of Congress approaches, I
                            feel the duty of preparing, by search for information to act upon
                            measures which may come before them for consideration— The first which I
                            intend myself to bring before them, is a plan for expediting the passage
                            of the general Appropriation Bills— After consulting the Journals of the
                            House of Representatives, for the last two Sessions, I walked to the
                            Capitol, stopping by the way at the patent Office, where I left the
                            drawing for <persRef ref="lane-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Charles Lane’s</persRef> patent, to be copied— At the Office of the
                            Clerk of the House, I looked at the Journal of the Senate at their last
                            Session— In the Library I consulted <persRef ref="hatsell-john"
                                >Hatsell’s</persRef> Precedents, <persRef ref="grey-anchitell"
                                >Greys</persRef> Parliamentary Debates, and the Journals of the
                            House of Commons, for cases of messages from one House to the other to
                                <hi rend="italic">remind</hi> them of a Bill before them— I made a
                            few extracts from them. <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
                                >Jefferson’s</persRef> manual—Section 47. refers to 3. Hatsell 28
                            and 5. Gray 154— I examined both those passages, and the Journals of the
                            House of Commons to which Hatsell refers— The latest precedent that I
                            found, of a <hi rend="italic">reminding</hi> message, was of Feb<hi
                                rend="superscript">y</hi> 1721-2— I had not time to finish my
                            examination and must resume it— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My
                                wife</persRef> went and took tea with her Sister <persRef

                                Smith</persRef>— I joined her there and walked home with her— In the
                            Evening I began to write upon the proposed Resolution for a new Rule of
                            the House to spur the passage of the Appropriation Bills—and immediately
                            the range of argument for the measure expanded before me— New research
                            became necessary, and I was able to write only a few lines, when bedtime
                            came.</p>

                        <p>I rose first at three O’Clock; oppressed with the catarrhal cough, and
                            ordered no fires to be made in my chamber and in the dining room; and
                            there were none the whole day— The morning was warm, but afternoon the
                            wind came round to the Northward, cool—continued writing on a proposed
                            rule of the house, and believe there must be two to effect my purpose of

                        <p>A North-east wind with drizzling rain the whole day contrasted with the
                            Summer weather of Friday and yesterday Morning. I attended public
                            worship this morning at the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Presbyterian
                            Church, where a very young man preached from Luke 19.10. “For the Son of
                            man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.” The auditory was
                            very small. <persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Edward Smith</persRef> the late Pastor of that Church left them in
                            June last and removed to New-York. In the afternoon I attended at S<hi

                            read the Evening service for the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Sunday
                            after Trinity and preached a short Discourse from Mark 10.47—[“]Jesus,
                            thou Son of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef>, have mercy on me.” The
                            Sermon was not so alarming as the text; and the day was so dark, as it
                            drew towards Sunset that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley had some
                            difficulty to read his own Sermon, and faltered frequently— After Church
                            I had a visit from <persRef ref="u">Captain Gardiner</persRef>, of the
                            army, who has suffered something in his fortunes, for having heretofore
                            had a political regard and friendship for me— He has been for some time
                            stationed with a company at Fort Warburton on the banks of the
                            Potowmack, between this City and Alexandria; but has now received
                            another destination to Point Comfort— My writing upon the necessity for
                            new Rules of the House of Representatives to hasten the passage of
                            Appropriation Bills swells and swells till it absorbs my attention and
                            crimps my time for every thing else— I read in the morning <persRef
                                ref="sullivan-william">William Sullivan’s</persRef> moral
                            Class-book, with which I am upon the whole well pleased— In one passage
                            of the Book he gives a large extract from a Sermon of <persRef
                                ref="buckminster-joseph">Buckminster</persRef> in which he points to
                            the 53<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> chapter of Isaiah as the conclusive
                            prophecy of Jesus as the Messiah, of all those usually adduced as such
                            in the Old Testament— It was remarkable that the preacher at the
                            Presbyterian Church this morning read that chapter— It is mysterious and
                            oracular, and applies wi<unclear>th</unclear> clear obscurity to the
                            life and character of Jesus—but yet?</p>

                        <p>Rain and Sleet almost the whole of this day— There seems to be an impulse
                            more powerful than my will which engrosses and swallows up my Time in
                            some one object of occupation to the exclusion of all others— The Rule
                            for the House now forms that object, and I can neither get through with
                            my reflections upon it, nor abstract myself from them— Before dinner I

                            immediately after my War Speech as it was called—the Letter is addressed

                            revolutionary Pensioners of 1818. struck off the list by the act of
                            1820. and not restored; both of which he approved— And it suggested to

                            Hawley had in the morning instead of a Sermon read a long pastoral

                            received my Letter, which would be published in the Bangor Whig and
