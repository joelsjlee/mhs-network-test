						<p>The first day since Friday the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> that the
							Thermometer has been any part of the day as high as the freezing point—
							A sample of winter such as I never before witnessed, at Washington,
							either for the degree or the duration of the cold. The Sky has been
							almost constantly clear, and the wind ranging from North to North-west.
							It has much abridged my diary; and sunk much of my time in idleness.</p>
						<p>This morning at the Presbyterian Church I heard <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Colton</persRef>, from Matthew 16.26.
							“For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world, and lose
							his own Soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his Soul?” a
							magnificent specimen of the hyperbolical style— It was enchanting— The
							inestimable value of the Soul, was set forth in splendid imagery and
							language of surpassing beauty— The
							intellect—memory—imagination—affections, which in their combination
							constitute the Soul—its capacities of enjoyment and of misery, and the
							eternity to which it is destined or doomed furnished topics of
							amplification, admirably seized and managed— After dinner at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read the Evening service for the first Sunday after the Epiphany, and
							gave a short Sermon from Psalm 36.9 “For with thee is the fountain of
							life; in thy light shall we see light.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hawley commented upon the impressiveness of the Scriptural imagery— I
							read also the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of <persRef
								ref="colman-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colman’s</persRef>
							Sermons upon the imperfection of Human knowledge—and the 22<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> upon the duty of acquiescence in the Will
							of God—many of the remarks in this, were very affectingly applicable to
							my own Condition— And I closed my Sunday reading with three short
							chapters of <persRef ref="sullivan-william">William Sullivan’s</persRef>
							Moral Class-Book—containing the proofs of the existence of God from the
							construction and organization of the Earth— The 23<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>A person by the name of <persRef ref="u">Sheldon</persRef> came with a

								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> party in the House,

							ballot, would vote against the publishers of the Globe if they are
							called to vote viva voce, it is supposed they will not dare to vote

							the Episcopal Church— <persRef ref="preston-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Preston</persRef> the Senator from the
							State said to me that I had lost in Davis a devoted friend—and I believe
							it was true. Nearly the last words he ever spoke in the House were, that
							he hoped God would forgive him for the past he had taken in 1828 against
							me; for he never should forgive himself— I rode to the grave-yard with
								<persRef ref="ferris-charles">Charles G. Ferris</persRef> from
							New-York— As we were descending the broad flight of steps from the
							Rotunda, on the Eastern front of the Capitol, I heard the snap of a
							Pistol—sounding like a squib— It was aimed at the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">president of the United States</persRef>, by an
							insane man named <persRef ref="lawrence-richard">Lawrence</persRef>, and
							it was said he snap’d a second pistol, but I heard only one report— They
							both missed fire. The incident occasioned some commotion; but the
							funeral processi<unclear>on</unclear> was not delayed— The number of the
							members who followed it however was not so great as usual— From the
							grave-yard I returned with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ferris to the
							Capitol, where there came only the <persRef ref="bell-john"
								>Speaker</persRef>, and one or two other members— He took the Chair,
							and at my motion adjourned the House— I walked home, stopping on the way
							to <persRef ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef> tavern, to return the
							visit of <persRef ref="johnson-reverdy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Reverdy Johns<unclear>on</unclear></persRef> of Baltimore. Left
							cards also for <persRef ref="williams-nathaniel3">N Williams</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="kennedy-john2">J. P. Kennedy</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Culloch</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="monroe-james2">Alderman James Monroe</persRef> of
							New-York— I apologised to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson for not
							having answered a Letter which I received from him shortly before I came
							from Quincy— <persRef ref="johnson-mary2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Johnson</persRef> was with her husband—very pretty—
							This Evening I was visited by <persRef ref="davis-amos">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Amos Davis</persRef>, a member of the
							House from Kentucky with a friend of his by the name of <persRef ref="u"
								>Minafy</persRef>— The remainder of the Evening was absorbed in
							directing copies of my Oration upon <persRef ref="lafayette">La
								Fayette</persRef>, to members of the Legislature of Massachusetts.
							Heavy Thunder and Lightening.</p>

								Julius</persRef>, brought me a Letter of introduction from <persRef
								ref="duponceau-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Duponceau</persRef> of Philadelphia— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Julius is a commissioner, sent by the Prussian Government to this
							Country to visit and examine the Prisons and Penitentiaries, for the
							purpose of introducing improvements into those of Prussia— He is well
							acquainted with the work of Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							<persRef ref="beaumont-gustave">de Beaumont</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="tocqueville-alexis">Tocqueville</persRef>, and spoke of it in
							terms of qualified approbation. He said there would shortly be published
							a Report of a <persRef ref="crawford-william4">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> who had been sent here by the British
							Government and was in the United States last year, which would be more
							full and satisfactory than that of the French Commissioners, and that he
							had read M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford’s Manuscript— <persRef
								ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Connell</persRef> called upon me, and said it had occurred to him
							that it would be proper for the House of Representatives to pass some
							Resolution expressive of their abhorrence of the attempt yesterday to
							assassinate the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>, and
							that I was the proper person to offer such a Resolution— That he had
							mentioned his thoughts to <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef>; who concurred
							entirely in the opinions—particularly as there was an Article in the
							Globe imputing this act of the <persRef ref="lawrence-richard"
								>Assassin</persRef> to the Speeches of Senators against the
							President— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell, that I did not
							wish to meddle with this affair politically at-all— The man was in
							prison—to be dealt with according to Law— What was his motive I knew
							not—nor who, if any one, was his instigator— I saw no necessity for me
							to be officious on the occasion— At the House <persRef
								ref="mercer-charles">C. F. Mercer</persRef> came to my seat and
							asked if I did not think the House should appoint a Committee to <hi
								rend="italic">investigate</hi> the transaction, which occurred while
							the House was formally in Session— I said no—at least I saw no propriety
							for my moving in the matter— In the House, <persRef ref="gilmer-george"
								>Gilmer</persRef> Chairman of the select Committee on so much of the
							Message as relates to an Amendment of the Constitution, in relation to
							Presidential Elections, moved the discharge of the Committee, who cannot
							agree upon any thing, and offered a long amendment of his own which was
							ordered to be printed— My call upon the President for copies of
							correspondence concerning the dispute with France, was adopted without
							opposition— The day was employed upon private Bills, in Committee of the
							whole, and in the House.</p>
