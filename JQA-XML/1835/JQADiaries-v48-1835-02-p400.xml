							Agent for Princeton College, the Alumni of which have resolved to raise
							one hundred thousand dollars, to endow the College, and for which they
							solicit the contributions of their friends. I declined subscribing for
							the present, having a similar demand pending, from the Alumni of Harvard
							University, and until that shall be determined, I did not incline to
							contribute for the benefit of other Colleges— I told M<hi

							College—at the solicitation of <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> M’Dowell</persRef>— At the House immediately after the
							reading of the Journal I obtained leave to present two Petitions from
							Citizens of the County of Oneida, in the State of New-York, for the
							abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia— I referred to remarks
							I had made on presenting similar Petitions in December 1831—said I had
							not changed my opinions then expressed, and moved the reference of these
							Petitions without reading to the Committee on the District of Columbia,
							which was done. I then asked leave of the House to say a few words by
							way of explanation—which was granted— It was upon my having said last
							Saturday that the Senate had dodged the question of the dispute with
							France—and upon the commercial excitement produced by the stand taken by
							me on the same occasion— My explanation amused the House— The rest of
							the day was consumed in debating upon trifles— Whether next Tuesday or
							Friday should be assigned for Bills on the Territories, and the boundary
							of Ohio—whether <persRef ref="letcher-robert">Letcher</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="moore-thomas3">Moore</persRef> should be paid for

							copies should be printed of the two Reports of the Post-Office Committee

							have outstripped the necessity of the case. My apprehension is, not of
							War, but that the rights of the claimants under the Treaty, and the
							honour of the Country will on this subject be ultimately sacrificed and
							abandoned. The fear of this has urged me prematurely to press the
							consideration of it upon the House of Representatives, and now spurs me
							to renew the call upon them for action— I have failed, and the occasion
							has been seized successfully to turn the Election to the U.S. Senate
							against me, for what I have said in the House on this occasion— Cautious
							Perseverance! support me—</p>
