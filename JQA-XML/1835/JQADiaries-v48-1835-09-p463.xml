						<p>At half past seven O’Clock this morning the Stage from Boston to Plymouth
							stop’d at my door in Quincy— <persRef ref="davis-isaac">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Isaac P. Davis</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter C.
								Brooks</persRef> were in it—my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> and I immediately joined them, and the Stage
							proceeded to Plymouth where we arrived at 1/2 past12 at Noon— We came
							through Hingham, Scituate, Hanover 4. Corners, Pembroke Duxbury and
							Kingston— There were three women in the Stage, one of them with a child
							under two years old, very quiet— She left the Stage at Scituate and one
							of the other women at Kingston— There were also three other men in the
							Stage who were and remained strangers to us— There is comparatively very
							little improvement of the Country from Hingham to Plymouth— The
							appearance of it is however pleasing—the Season has been fine and the
							verdure is yet upon the fields and upon the trees— Indian corn, and
							apple Orchards just ripening— Groves of pitchpine trees with sapling
							black Oaks mark the approach to Plymouth— We stop’d at <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Nicholson’s</persRef>, where we
							met several Gentlemen boarders— Before and after dinner we had several
								visitors—<persRef ref="davis-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Lothrop Hedge</persRef> one of the Senators of the County— We visited the registry

							Hall and the enclosed fragment of the primitive rock— The remainder of
							the rock on the wharf—the New Meeting house of <persRef ref="kendall-james">D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Kendall</persRef>—and grave yard on the brow of the Hill— We had

						<p><date>16. VI. </date>Wednesday— From Sandwich to Woodville Falmouth</p>
						<p>My late hours last Night delayed my rising, till with the Sun We
							breakfasted at Seven, and <persRef ref="king-gedney;king-jerusha">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> King</persRef> immediately after departed in the

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis</persRef> <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and I went in our Barouche
							to the old village of Sandwich where I had been once in my life
							before—that is in April 1787. 48 years have since passed away, but we
							passed by the House where old <persRef ref="freeman-nathaniel2">General Freeman</persRef> then resided, and the new
							Meeting House on the spot where the old one stood in which we saw our
							Tutor <persRef ref="burr-jonathan">Jonathan Burr</persRef> ordained— The Pond, the Brook and the Waterfall are
							still there with all their lively remembrances, but there is now,
							besides a very extensive glasshouse establishment, belonging to <persRef ref="jarves-deming">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Deming Jarves</persRef>, which we now visited, and
							over every part of which we went— It is far less extensive than that of
							<persRef ref="dyott-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dyott</persRef>, at Kensington near
							Philadelphia; but there are here 350. workmen and boys employed at wages
							from 9 to 25 dollars a week—and they not only make here the same sort of
							pressed glass which I had seen made there, but M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Jarves claims to be the inventor of it and that it was first
							made here. We returned and dined at <persRef ref="u">Hinckley’s</persRef> tavern with the company
							we had left there, and with the addition of <persRef ref="merrick-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Merrick</persRef> the Minister of the Parish where M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Burr had been settled— <persRef ref="emmons-john">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Emmons</persRef> had been out to hunt Deer, but lost
							his dog and returned without game— At half-past two we took again to the
							Barouche, and came across Cape Cod, through Falmouth, to Wood’s Hole, or
							Woodville. At North Falmouth, we had some conversation with the
							<persRef ref="nye-ebenezer">Postmaster Nye</persRef>— At half past 6, we arrived at the tavern kept by <persRef ref="webster-j">J.
							Webster</persRef> and sent for <persRef ref="u">an old Sea Captain Hatch</persRef> who came and agreed to go
							out with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis and me early tomorrow
							Morning to fish for the Tautaug or Black fish, and the Scuphaug or White
							fish— There is now no company at Woodville; but it is a Summer resort
							for valetudenarians from Boston, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brooks’s son <persRef ref="brooks-edward">Edward</persRef> with <persRef ref="sturgis-william">William Sturgis</persRef> and their families were some

						<p><date>17. V. </date>Thursday.— From Woodville to Nantucket—</p>
						<p>I rose at 5. O’Clock, and <persRef ref="davis-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis</persRef> and I went
							out with <persRef ref="u">Captain Hatch</persRef> in a fishing boat into Martha’s vineyard Sound,
							to fish for Tautaug and Scuphaug—otherwise called Black fish and white
							fish— We caught 8 or ten of the first and one of the latter which
							resembles a large silver fish. But our time was limited— I caught only
							one large Tautaug, and at a quarter past 9 we were obliged to return to
							Woodville. We breakfasted at <persRef ref="webster-j">Webster’s</persRef> Tavern, and at 10 O’Clock the
							Steamer Telegraph <persRef ref="barker-nathaniel">Captain Nathaniel Barker</persRef> touched at the wharf and took
							us in— We dined on board the Boat, and arrived at 20 minutes past 2 at
							the Island and Town of Nantucket— We had on board the boat ten or twelve
							fellow passengers among whom was a <persRef ref="u">methodist Minister named Lindsey</persRef>, who

							Society 4. July 1835—and a Zion’s Herald extra—upon Slavery and against
							the abolitionists— At Nantucket we took lodgings at <persRef ref="u">Starbuck’s</persRef> Hotel,
							where we found <persRef ref="silliman-benjamin">Professor Silliman</persRef> and <persRef ref="silliman-benjamin2">his Son</persRef>, and <persRef ref="paine-robert3">Robert Treat Paine</persRef>
							who is here engaged in Astronomical observations for the geodesical map
							of the State— Professor Silliman is delivering a course of Lectures on
							Geology— Numbers of the Citizens of the Island visited us in the
							afternoon, among whom <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bunker</persRef> of the
							Committee of Arrangements upon the delivery of Professor Silliman’s
							Lectures, who invited us to attend one of them this Evening which we
							did—from 7 till near 9 O’Clock— It was at the Town Hall— There was a
							full auditory of at least 300 persons—men and women, all neatly dress’d—
							The Lecture was on the primary formations of the earth, and the remains
							of gigantic animals chiefly of the Saurian, Lizard or Crocodile
							kind—</p>

							<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mack</persRef> and heard <persRef ref="angier-joseph">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Angier</persRef>, recently settled as the
							Minister of this Church, from Luke 10.27. “And he answering said, ‘Thou
							shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
							and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind[’]”— He omitted the
							remainder of the verse, which is the repetition of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edes’s morning text from Leviticus— There
							is great difference of Style, as well as of delivery between these two
							young men.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edes’s manner being more
							plain and better adapted to the understanding of uncultivated minds—all
							his reasonings were pointed to the practical exercise of benevolence—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Angier ingeniously brought his
							discourse to the same conclusion, but he discussed somewhat largely the
							question what was to be understood by the word Love as applied to God,
							and very properly urged that it was a sentiment entirely different from
							that affection which is borne towards any earthly object. He observed
							that there was danger of mistaking one of these Sentiments for the
							other, and he noticed the cumulation of human faculties to which the
							commandment is applied— The Heart, the Soul, the strength and the mind—
							He did not however attempt to define those faculties to discriminate
							them from each other— The understanding, the affections, the reasoning
							faculty and the will, appear to be intended in the use of those words,
							and perhaps they were used only to enforce in the most emphatic manner,
							the precept— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Russell one of our visitors
							reminded me that I had measured him in the year 1815 at London for a
							Passport— After the Church Service this afternoon, <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi

									I. P. Davis</persRef> visited again at <persRef ref="arnold-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Arnold’s</persRef>,
							and saw his fine flower-garden and two green houses, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Arnold himself closed the Evening with a
							visit to us— The boil on my hand almost disqualified me for writing, and
							I read in <persRef ref="bulwerlytton-edward">Bulwer’s</persRef> England and Englishmen lent me by a fellow lodger at

							journey to Boston. We engaged a Carriole and came home to Quincy where
							at half past five by God’s blessing we found all the family well.— We
							had among our fellow-travellers from New Bedford a very respectable
							Methodist preacher by the name of <persRef ref="mudge-enoch">Mudge</persRef>— The road from New-Bedford is
							fine all the way— The towns through which we passed all thrifty and
							prosperous At South Bridgwater we had an uncommonly good dinner, at an
							excellent inn—from Randolph to Milton Mills we came over the Blue-hill
							Turnpike, and found upon it a village two miles long of neat,
							comfortable and elegant dwelling Houses with two large Houses of
							worship, all a new Creation since the turnpike was opened, that is
							within the last fifteen years— We passed by East-Randolph, about two
							miles distant at the right hand as we came, exhibiting a village
							apparently as flourishing as that through which we passed— Near the
							whole Blue-hill turnpike and much of the New Bedford road is cut through
							with forests of Pitchpine, Black and white Oak, white maple, white Birch
							and Hornbeam, all but the Pitchpine small and young wood The largest
							trees are of the Button wood, Sycamore or Planetrees—as we approach
							Milton white Elms, Chesnuts—Hickories Ash, commence and the Locust trees
							cease— Indian Corn, Potatoes grazing and pasture lands are all the
							cultivation— There are in Middleborough four large ponds.</p>

							<persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> came down in his waggon and after him three other men with

							the only one of them whom he knew was named <persRef ref="u">Taper</persRef>. I visited my Oaks,
							white walnuts, and pignut trees there which were in scanty bearing—none
							of the fruit ripe— I gathered nevertheless some nuts and acorns— <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi

							upon the observations I had made in our weeks excursion—Plymouth,
							Sandwich, Falmouth Woodville—the Vineyard Sound, Nantucket and New
							Bedford offer a large field for great variety of comment, and remark;
							but the head partakes the imbecility of the hand—and my reflections pass
							away never to return— I found a Letter here from <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef> calling
							for an immediate answer which I cannot write— I visited my garden,
							Nursery, and Seminary but at this period the vegetation of the Season
							has almost entirely ceased— My Seminary has been weeded and a new soil
							surrounds my young seedling trees— The corner Seminary maple has not
							grown at all in my absence; but with perhaps twenty other plants from
							the Washington and Philadelphia seeds, promises to survive the
							approaching winter and become hereafter a lofty tree.</p>

						<p>My hand is entirely disabled. I attempted to write the journal of

							but said he wanted about 315 dollars expended in repairs on the lower
							barn, about nine hundred dollars to pull down the old house and build a
							new one, and from seventy five to one hundred dollars upon a watering
							place near the beach— He offered eight hundred dollars a year for rent;
							if I would pay all the taxes— I promised to go down next Tuesday if the
							weather should be fair to see how he proposes his repairs should be made
							and to talk over the affair with him again— <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> came to
