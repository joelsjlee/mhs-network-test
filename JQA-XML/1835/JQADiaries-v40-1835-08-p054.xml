						<p>Notwithstanding the heavy showers and thunder of last Evening, the heat

							Garden and Nursery were short, and without useful observation.— The Sun
							has arrested the germ of almost all the seedlings of this year, but here
							and there an Apple tree, pushes up the germ, even as late as now.— So of
							Pear trees— The maple at the corner of the Seminary, this day opens its
							eighth pair of leaves, but the night insect has eroded the sixth and
							seventh pairs—The leaves come out, each pair exactly at right Angles
							with the last, and the stem is a perfect perpendicular to the ground—
							This is the natural growth of the maple; but of twenty-five which have
							come up from the seeds that I brought with me from Washington and
							Philadelphia, one only has had this rapid growth—five have
							perished—eight or ten are pining and about ten are thriving— None of
							them can endure unsheltered the fierce heat of the Sun—and the invisible
							insect preys upon their tender leaves.— I found several young black
							caterpillars upon the terminal leaves of the elm sprung from the
							fragment root in the Summer house cellar— My Son <persRef

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> this morning, from 1. John 5.8. “and there are three
							that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood:
							and these three agree in one.”— This verse immediately follows after
							that of the three that bear record in Heaven; the Father, the Word, and
							the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.—the strong hold of the
							Trinitarians, but the authenticity of which is so vehemently contested,
							and so feebly maintained— The text itself is in language so highly
							figurative that its meaning is very obscure— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt understands by the Spirit, the miracles performed by
							Christ—by the water, the purity, and innocence of his life, and by the
							blood, his death upon the Cross— A very ingenious exposition; but of
							very questionable accuracy That the single word Spirit should mean the
							miracles performed by Christ is as hard to believe as that the word
							water should signify the innocence and purity of his life— Such strained
							and far fetched constructions lead to the enquiry why the Spirit of God
							should use dark and mystical language to express plain and simple
							thoughts— The three witnesses on earth of this text I understand as
							meaning the Spirit of the Gospel, the baptism of repentance and
							regeneration, and the blood of Christ— The argument of the chapter is
							the necessity of believing that Jesus Christ is the Son of God; and the
							demonstration of this fact is represented to consist in the doctrine of
							eternal life proclaimed by him— The witnesses to this fact are the
							immortal Spirit—the purification of repentance, and the Seal of Christ’s
							blood— And this construction is congenial with the argument of the
							chapter and of the whole Epistle— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt
							however made a very good discourse by a commentary on the text as he
							understands it— He made no reference or allusion to the controversy upon
							the preceding verse which if spurious as it no doubt is; was introduced
							by some person who had profoundly meditated upon the genuine text of
							this Epistle, and upon the character of all the writings of the
							Evangelist <persRef ref="john">John</persRef>— It was a communion
							Sermon, and immediately after it the Sacrament was administered by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt. I gave <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams</persRef> two Letters
							which I had received for her and her daughter <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef> from New-Orleans— She told
							me that her daughter <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Angier</persRef> was very ill, with a
							bilious fever— Afternoon <pb n="55" type="ms"/>M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt preached from Proverbs 22.6. “Train up a child in the
							way he should go: and when he is old he will not depart from it”— A
							discourse upon the importance of giving a good education to children;
							and a particular commendation of Sunday Schools with exhortation to the
							people of his congregation to give their own Sunday School, an increased
							support— I took <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> to
							Meeting with me, morning and afternoon— I read the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon of the seventh Volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, entitled by him the resources
							of the Christian.— His text is from the same Epistle, from which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt preached this morning. 1. John 4.4.
							[“]greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world”— The
							Sermon is an exceedingly elaborate argument to prove that God is more
							powerful than the Devil— No trivial task for a Calvinist preacher— And
							Saurin as usual entangles himself inextricably in the web of his own
							metaphysics— He concludes that if the Devil does get final possession of
							the vast majority of mankind, it is owing not to the deficiency of God’s
							superior power, but to the depravity of man— Elizabeth C. Adams and
								<persRef ref="harrod-mary2">Mary Harrod</persRef> were here this
							afternoon.</p>

						<p>I went into Boston with my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> to attend the adjourned Meeting of the Alumni of

									>r</hi> Robert Charles Winthrop</persRef> the Secretary, and
								<persRef ref="lowell-charles">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								Lowell</persRef>— After waiting about a quarter of an hour we
							adjourned the Meeting to 9. O’Clock of the morning of Commencement day
							in the Library Hall of the University— As we came out from the Meeting
							we met <persRef ref="wainwright-jonathan">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Wainwright</persRef> who had just returned from
							Andover, and who was going to attend the Meeting. I left with <persRef

							of <persRef ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef> and a copy of the

								<persRef ref="cruft-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward

								>r</hi> and <persRef ref="cruft-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Cruft</persRef> were going this afternoon upon an
							excursion of ten days into Vermont— After making a few emplettes I went
							to Charles’s Office, and we returned to Quincy to dine—found that the
							child <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny</persRef> had been quite
							unwell. <persRef ref="adams-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> who was
							here upon some carpenter’s work, shewed me the 36<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Annual Report of the home missionary Society, containing
							what he considered as a libel on the town of Quincy— It is a report to
							the Society from a man named <persRef ref="cornell-william"
								>Cornell</persRef>, the Minister of the Orthodox Congregational
							Church recently built here, and who says there are as many as seventy
							families in the town, who never see a Bible, who never attend at any
							Church, and within whose doors, no Minister had entered for the last
							twenty years— And that were, Parents as ignorant is if they were Pagans—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams told me that <persRef
								ref="adams-josiah">his father</persRef>, the Deacon, had asked him
							to shew me this pamphlet—that it had produced great excitement, and that
							there had been talk of calling a Town-meeting about it— <persRef
								ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef>
							was here in the Evening and spoke on the same subject— He said that he
							and <persRef ref="brigham-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brigham</persRef> had been to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell
							to demand upon what evidence he had advanced such grave charges against
							the Inhabitants of Quincy. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell told
							them that he had no copy of his Letter—that he did not recollect
							precisely what he had written, and that he had intended no reflection
							upon the inhabitants of the town, and had expressly said that he did not
							suppose they differed in this respect from other towns in general. He
							believed that instead of twenty years, it was only two years that he had
							written, that certain families had not seen a minister within their
							houses—and that those who had no Bibles were the roman-catholic workmen
							at the Quarries— Beale said he did not know but Cornell would be drummed
							out of the Town— My visit to Boston this morning, curtailed the
							performance of my daily task.</p>

						<p>I had promised <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> if
							the weather should be fair and cool to go down to the Mount Wollaston
							farm, and view the buildings last Saturday afternoon. But the heat of
							the day and the thunder showers prevented the fulfilment of my
							intention— Spear, who is anxious to ascertain whether he is to have a
							new lease of the farm or not came again this morning, and I promised him
							I would come down this afternoon, as I accordingly did, with <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>— We inspected the lower barn
							which is in a very ruinous condition, and upon which he claimed repairs
							to the amount of 200 dollars He wished also to have the house taken down
							and a smaller one, built upon the same site, and he wanted considerable
							repairs to the Corn-house— He spoke of selling gravel at a dollar a
							sloop load at half profits, and he now sends <persRef
								ref="spear-charles">his Son</persRef>, every morning, at 2. O’Clock
							rising at one to Boston with milk— Since Huckleberries are ripe, he says
							his custom has increased, and last Sunday he took with him forty gallons
							which he sold— All the farms round this neighbourhood are turning to
							this mode of cultivation, which is simple and convenient, requiring
							little trouble, and improving the land by the quantity of manure made by
							the cattle Spear was also very anxious to settle the difference we have
							had about the Parish-tax, and made me a proposition to compound for it—
							I took the opportunity to look at my young orchard on the North side of
							which he has now, a field of Indian Corn. The Apple trees look quite
							unpromising; but the Oaks, chesnuts and Shag-bark walnuts round three
							sides of the border are more encouraging to my plantations than any
							thing else that has befallen me— That they will in twenty years from
							this time form a grove surrounding, and sheltering the orchard I have
							the strongest reason to hope, though with a certainty that I shall not
							witness it myself, and a great uncertainty into whose hands the Estate
							within that time may fall— We returned home about Sunset, and with
							Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>, I went in
							and spent an hour of a small Evening party at <persRef
								ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodward</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> were there—
							Several rather sudden deaths at Boston within the last week have
							occasioned apprehensions and rumours that the yellow fever is there— The
								8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and last number of Charles’s Appeal
							from the new to the old whigs is this day published in the Daily
							Advocate and in the Sentinel simultaneously— These papers are well
							written, and form a defence of the Constitution of the United States
							against one of the most formidable and pernicious assaults that it has
							ever sustained: and of which the Patronage Bill, which passed the Senate
							at the last Session of Congress was the first fruit— A politic silence
							has been observed with regard to these papers, by <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster</persRef> and his partizans, and
							it is yet doubtful, what their effect may be— I visited my plantations,
							and find the seedlings looking generally fresh since the rains— I
							trimmed the Apricot tree in the Seminary, and covered the wound with the
							composition beeswax suet rosin— Staked a willow twig for a Bean pole:
							and filled Pot 7. with fresh earth in which I buried 3 English Jenneton
							Pear Cores— The tree is now for the first time in full bearing; and the
							Pears are sound and good— I had the old Plum trees in the Eastern close
							washed with Soap-suds and the Moss that had gathered on them scraped
							off— The 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> pair of leaves opens on the
							Seminary corner maple—</p>

						<p>My Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went into Boston

								>John Quincy</persRef> so that we have now all his family here—
								<persRef ref="adams-thomas6">Thomas Adams</persRef> the constable
							came with a subscription paper, addressed to the Selectmen of the Town,

							think <pb n="57" type="ms"/>proper in relation to the charges, against
							the inhabitants of Quincy of being in regard to religion and the Bible,
							as ignorant as Pagans— The paper was subscribed by <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-thomas">Thomas Greenleaf</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-daniel">Daniel Greenleaf</persRef>— I declined
							signing my name to it, and said I was very sorry <persRef
								ref="cornell-william">this poor man</persRef> had got himself into
							so much trouble by his indiscretion. That he had written under a
							religious impulse, and seemed to have forgotten that Charity was a part
							of the obligations of Christianity— But as he was under the heavy
							displeasure of the People of the Town, if I should put my name to this
							application for a town-meeting, it might have the appearance of my
							taking part against him, which I should not wish to do— <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E. Price
								Greenleaf</persRef> came this afternoon, and budded for me with
							Summer and Winter sweeting Apples a number of the young stocks growing
							in my Nursery. <persRef ref="bass-lewis">Lewis Bass</persRef>, one of
							the Selectmen came to enquire upon what terms I would convey to the Town
							a portion of Land of the Penn’s Hill Orchard, at the bend of the road,
							sufficient to widen the road— This is an expedient to prevent the
							renewal of the Petition to the County Commissioners, to open a new road
							through my Orchard, upon which there was a survey by the County
							Commissioners last Summer. I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bass
							that I should be disposed to do any thing reasonable for the
							accommodation of the Town; and that as soon as the Season should become
							cooler, I would go with him and view the ground, and see if we could
							agree upon the terms on which the Town may have as much of the land as
							they will want. I received a Letter from <persRef ref="cazenove-charles"
								>Charles J. Cazenove</persRef> and C<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi>
							of Boston, containing a claim for 336:83 upon a draft which they drew
							upon me in November 1832, but which was never presented to me— The
							demand is against the Estate of <persRef key="adams-john2">my deceased
								Son</persRef>, and is for Sales of flour in 1831. This evening I
							received a note, from <persRef ref="wakeman-thaddeus">M<hi

								Wakeman</persRef> came this morning, and I had a conversation with
							him of about two hours— He was very urgent that I should accept the
							invitation of the American Institute of New York to deliver the address
							at their Anniversary Fair, but gave me no reason for it which could
							outweigh or balance my reasons for declining. I desired him to assure
							the Society of the grateful sense which I entertained of the honour they
							had done me by the invitation, and especially by the manner in which
							they had conveyed it; to add the assurance of my hearty good wishes for
							the prosperity of the Institute, and for the prosperity of their cause,
							and further to say, that if in the public Station which I occupy, it may
							be in my power to render them any service, I shall always eagerly avail
							myself of it— I stated to him a part of the reasons which require my
							perseverance in declining to deliver the Address. The general
							considerations, which dictate the policy of sustaining and cherishing
							the manufacturing interest were obvious, and had been presented with <pb
								n="58" type="ms"/>eloquence and ability, by the gentlemen, who had
							delivered the Addresses of the three preceding years—<persRef
								ref="baldwin-henry">Judge Baldwin</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="kennedy-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. P.
								Kennedy</persRef> and <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward
								Everett</persRef>. To repeat them could neither excite much
							interest, nor much promote the purposes of the Institute— Should I
							undertake to deliver the Address, it would be expected of me and I
							should myself hardly be justified in undertaking it, but with intention
							of presenting the subject under new and different views; and my own
							opinion was that the great difficulty under which the manufacturing
							interest of the Country labours, is a political combination of the South
							and the West against it.— The Slave-holders of the South, have bought
							the co-operation of the Western country, by the bribe of the Western
							Lands; abandoning to the new Western States, their own proportion of the
							public property, and aiding them in the design of grasping all the Lands
							into their own hands— <persRef ref="benton-thomas">Thomas H.
								Benton</persRef> was the author of this System, which he brought
							forward as a substitute for the American System of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and to supplant him as the leading
							Statesman of the West— <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef>, by his Tariff-compromise with <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							abandoned his own American System— At the same time he brought forward a
							plan for distributing among all the States of the Union the proceeds of
							the Sales of the Public Lands— His bill for that purpose passed both
							Houses of Congress, but was veto’d by <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President Jackson</persRef>, who in his annual Message of December
							1832. formally recommended that all the Public Lands should be
							gratuitously given away to individual adventurers and to the States in
							which the Lands are situated— Now if at this time, on the eve of a
							Presidential election, I should, in a public Address to the American
							Institute disclose this state of things, and comment upon it, as I
							should feel it my duty to do, it would probably produce great excitement
							and irritation—would be charged with having a political bearing, and
							subject me to the imputation of tampering with the election— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wakeman said that this had opened to him a
							new volume, and explained to him many things which had seemed to him
							unaccountable— Still he thought my opinions might be presented in such a
							manner as would not be irritating or offensive, and the Institute would
							take measures for giving a very extensive circulation to the Address—
							They had printed 1500 copies of that of judge Baldwin, which had also
							been printed in Newspapers to the amount of eight or ten thousand— They
							would circulate still more of an Address from me— I said there were
							other reasons which admonished me to avoid at this time any occasion of
							bringing myself before the public eye—particularly on account of the
							part which I took in the controversy with France, and in that between
							Ohio and Michigan, both of which I expected would occupy much of the
							attention of Congress at their next Session— I did not satisfy M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wakeman, and although I did not assign to
							him the strongest of my reasons for persisting to decline, I did not
							satisfy myself— The strongest of my reasons was a conscious inability to
							fulfil the expectations of the Institute and of the Public if I should
							comply.— Those expectations would run high, and would be disappointed—
							They would turn to disgust, and my discourse instead of having any
							beneficial influence upon the public mind, would be turned as an

						<p><date>8. IV:15. </date>Saturday— The day was fair, and the Sun warm, but
							the evaporation from the heavy rain of yesterday, made the air cool, and
							the atmosphere damp. <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							went to Boston, and returned to dinner—Visited my Seminary, Garden, and
							Nursery— Gathered ripe white Currants in the garden, and sowed a row of
							them, along the Eastern side of the house; barely covering them with
							Earth— The first blossom opened on the Easternmost of the two Althaea
							trees fronting my chamber windows— The corner seminary maple opens its
							ninth pair of leaves, and is a foot high— My seedling plants have got to
							be so numerous that my attention is too much scattered among them. The
							black currants, on the seedling bush first bearing this year, are
							ripening— The day was devoted to the redemption of Journal arrears, and
							I came to the account of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April
							1834, and the suppression by the previous Question, of my intended
							Speech on the Reasons of <persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">Secretary
								Taney</persRef> for the removal of the Deposites.— I feel on the
							revisal of the transactions of that day as I felt at the time, a deep
							mortification, at the trampling underfoot of the first principles of
							freedom, in the adoption of the fourth Resolution of the Committee of
							Ways and Means, and the appointment of the travelling Bank-investigation
							Committee— It was a measure less pernicious in its effects than in its
							principle. The Directors of the Bank understood and adhered to their
							rights—refused submission to their tyrannical inquisition, and sent them
							back to Washington, as wise and as knowing as when they left it, on
							their scrutinizing expedition— <persRef ref="thomas-francis"
								>Thomas</persRef> the Chairman vented his Spleen, by moving that the
								<persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">President</persRef> and Directors of
							the Bank should be brought to the Bar of the House to answer for a
							contempt, but the motion only served to display in full relief the
							impotence of his malice, and the happy inability of the House of
							Representatives to tyrannise, even when they have lost the restraint of
							self-controul. The issue of this procedure was consolatory to me, as
							demonstrating the weakness, even of the <pb n="60" type="ms"/>House of
							Representatives in concert with the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President of the United States</persRef> to tyrannize over
							individual citizens— My opinion however remains unchanged that the House
							of Representatives dishonoured themselves by a Resolution, which if they
							had possessed the power of carrying it into execution would have been
							most arbitrary and oppressive— The grasp at power has been a remarkable
							characteristic of this Administration, and the President the Senate and
							the House of Representatives each in turn have manifested the
							encroaching temper.— Charles brought out from Boston the first volume of
							the Letters from <persRef ref="walpole-horace">Horace Walpole</persRef>,
							to <persRef ref="mann-horace2">Sir Horace Mann</persRef>, of which I
							read the Preface.</p>

						<p>The Preacher was <persRef ref="phipps-harrison">Harrison Gray Otis
								Phipps</persRef>, a Son of the late <persRef ref="phipps-thomas"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Phipps</persRef>, whose sudden
							death happened in 1832 the day after this young man had taken his
							bachelor’s degree at Cambridge— This was his first or second performance
							in the Pulpit, and it was very creditable— The text of his morning
							Discourse was John 16.32. the latter part of the verse—“Yet I am not
							alone, because the father is with me.” That of the afternoon was from
							Romans 6.23. “For the wages of sin is Death: but the gift of God is
							eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.” There was in his manner
							earnestness and simplicity— His subjects were well divided, and his
							thoughts more obvious, and less attenuated with metaphysical refinement
							than is common among the young Clergymen, from the theological school at
							Cambridge— There was something of the timidity of a beginner in his
							performance; enough to bespeak the favour of his auditory, the People of
							the Parish taking an interest in his success, as a townsman, the Son and
							Grandson, of <persRef ref="phipps-thomas2">Physicians</persRef> much
							respected for two generations past— I read also the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> Sermon of the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>,
							upon the necessity of taking heed to our ways— And in the whole
							collection as I have yet read them, there is not one more full of useful
							instruction— His text is from Proverbs 4.26. which in the English common
							Bible reads “Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be
							established.” In Saurin’s French he has it “balance the road of thy
							feet, and all thy ways shall be well regulated.[”] The words ponder and
							path give a vividness to this Sentence in the English which it has not
							in French— There are no corresponding works in the French language. The
							remarks of Saurin therefore upon the inaptitude of the figurative
							expressions in this proverb to the French language, do not apply to the
							English— There is a picturesque beauty in the words ponder the path of
							thy feet, perfectly congenial to the character of the English Language,
							and most impressive as a precept of Prudence— This precept Saurin
							considers, as applied in the text not only to the conduct of men, but to
							their Sentiments and their judgments— He subsequently however confines
							the disquisition to the prudence of action—and teaches his hearer to
							weigh all his purposed actions 1. with the principle whence they spring
							2. with the circumstances of the actor 3. With the manner of action 4
							With its appropriate limitations 5. with the attainments and capacities
							of the actor, and 6. with the time of action— Upon each of these heads
							he gives supposed cases of deliberate action, and directions to suit
							them— It is obvious that this formal, and methodical meditation cannot
							be applied to the ordinary and unimportant purposes of daily life; but
							with regard to all actions leading to consequences operative upon the
							happiness of the actor, and upon the well-being of others this Sermon
							furnishes an admirable practical Lecture— The details are equal to the
							design— I read nothing else. <persRef ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi

						<p>A fine Summer day, with clear sky, warm Sun, and cool refreshing breeze—
							I planted from the Eastern end of the Seminary a border of white
							Currants— Gathered black Currants ripe from the seedling bush— Staked a
							willow twig, at the gate corner of the Seminary— Purslane, Marsh
							Mallows, Sword grass are the weeds that now cover my Seminary bed— The
							English Jenneton Pears, are dropping over ripe from the tree— I have
							filled Pot 7 and Stand 2. with Cores of this Pear; and deposited Stands
							1. 2. in the cellar— Shingle-staked the corner seminary maple 13 inches
							high, so that the scorching Sun cannot bear upon the germ, which is the
							fatal stroke to delicate plants— I had a morning visit from <persRef
								ref="gorham-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Benjamin
								Gorham</persRef>, with <persRef ref="foster-thomas2">Thomas F.
								Foster</persRef>, a member of the last Congress from Georgia, and
								<persRef ref="flournoy-thomas">General Flournoy</persRef>. Foster,
							like all the Georgians, is an ardent politician, somewhat infected with
							the nullification virus, and stiff as buckram for State-rights, but
							honest, honourable and talented— He was one of the delegation who lost
							the Election to the new Congress, by their taint of nullification—
								<persRef ref="wilde-richard">Wilde</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="gilmer-george">Gilmer</persRef>, <persRef ref="gamble-roger"
								>Gamble</persRef> met the same failure, the Georgia delegation being
							elected by general ticket— There are now three vacancies in the
							delegation; in the Seats of <persRef ref="wayne-james">Wayne</persRef>,
							appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, of <persRef
								ref="schley-william">Schley</persRef>, who is a candidate for the
							Office of Governor, and has resigned his seat in Congress, and <persRef
								ref="terrell-james">Terrill</persRef> who has resigned owing to ill
							health— Foster said Gilmer had declined being a Candidate—and that
							Wilde, who is gone to Europe, had left with <persRef ref="u">his
								brother</persRef> a discretionary power to declare him a Candidate
							or not, as he should see fit. It was yet uncertain. Foster said nothing
							of himself— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gorham invited me to dine
							with him on Wednesday. In the afternoon I had visits from <persRef
								ref="white-naaman">N. L. White</persRef>, of Braintree, who is to
							take his first degree at Cambridge, at the approaching Commencement, and
							has assigned to him for a part, the character of the late <persRef
								ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice Marshall</persRef>— He came to
							enquire of me, if I knew, what had been the judge’s religious opinions—
							I told him I did not. That I believed he was of the Episcopalian Church,
							and I presumed <persRef ref="story-joseph">judge Story</persRef>, who
							had been very intimately acquainted with him, could inform him, what had
							been his individual religious impressions— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> White said he was limited to ten or twelve minutes for the
							delivery of his part— That he had written as much as would take three
							quarters of an hour to speak, and now was lopping off, till he scarcely
							knew what he should lop off further. He said he knew himself by his
							inexperience, incompetent to delineate the character of Judge Marshall,
							and thought no one could do it, within the compass of the time allotted
							to him. I said he must measure his ambition, by the reasonable
							expectations, which would be entertained of his performance, rather than
							by the copiousness of his subject— He said he had seen and heard it
							affirmed that the Office of Chief Justice was more important than that
							of President of the United States, and asked me how that should be— I
							said it was because the Construction of the Constitution and Laws of the
							United States was in the last resort given to the Supreme Court; and
							because the power of constructing the Law, is almost equivalent to the
							power of enacting it: the Office of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
							is held for Life— That of President of the United States only for four,
							or at most for eight years. The Office of Chief Justice requires a mind
							of energy sufficient to influence generally the minds of a majority of
							his associates— To accommodate his judgment to theirs, or theirs to his
							own. A judgment also capable of abiding the test of time, and of giving
							satisfaction to the public— It requires a man profoundly learned in the
							Law of Nations—in the Commercial and Maritime Law—in the Civil Law, in
							the Common Law of England, and in the general <pb n="62" type="ms"
							/>Statute Laws of the several States of the Union— With all these powers
							steadily exercised during a period of thirty four years, Chief Justice
							Marshall has settled many questions of Constitutional Law, certainly
							more than all the Presidents of the United States together— A person by
							the name of <persRef ref="ames-philander">Philander Ames</persRef> came
							to enquire the price of the lot of land belonging to the Estate of
								<persRef ref="boylston-ward">Ward Nicholas Boylston</persRef>, in
							Charlestown, and whether it belonged to me— I told him it was M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston’s, and referred him to my
							Co-Executor <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Nathaniel Curtis</persRef> for the price of it— Evening
							visit from <persRef ref="whitney-peter">Rev<hi rend="superscript"

								Hardwick</persRef> was here about a quarter of an Acre of Salt-marsh
							land at the Mount Wollaston farm, which he has been several years
							wanting to purchase of me— I promised to go and view it, as soon as cool
							weather should come— I continued clearing the Seminary border Alley of
							Weeds from the Eastern end, which I began yesterday, and this day
							proceeded as far as the Apricot tree. Sowed an edge of white Currants
							from the Eastern fence to the Apricot— In the Nursery I found the leaves
							at the germ of the chesnut trees, covered with aphides, and the large
							black Ants travelling about among them— Rubbed off as many of them as I
							found, with my finger and thumb.— I bathed and swam ten minutes
							yesterday with Charles, and this day alone at <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-daniel">Daniel Greenleaf’s</persRef> wharf.— The
							Passage to the Pear and Plum-trees at my Northern garden fence is
							opened, and the hazel bushes cleared away— They were a harbour for
							snakes, which infest the garden almost daily— The heat of the day
							slackened my labour, and left me short of my daily task— I received a
							Letter from <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef> at Washington about my private business; and in great
							distress and agony at an attempt of a <persRef ref="bowen-john"

									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Thornton</persRef>, at Washington, to
							murder her, and her mother <persRef ref="brodeau-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brodeau</persRef>. There is a great
							fermentation upon this subject of Slavery, at this time in all parts of
							the Union— The emancipation of the Slaves in the British West India
							Colonies— The Colonization Society here, the current of public opinion
							running every where stronger and stronger into democracy and popular
							supremacy, contribute all to shake the fetters of Servitude— The theory
							of the rights of man has taken deep root in the soil of civil Society—
							It has allied itself with the feelings of humanity and the precepts of
							Christian benevolence. It has armed itself with the strength of
							organized association— It has linked itself with religious doctrines and
							religious fervour— Anti-Slavery Associations are formed in this Country
							and in England, and they are already co-operating in concerted agency
							together— They have raised funds to support and circulate inflammatory
							Newspapers and pamphlets gratuitously—and they send multitudes of them
							into the Southern Country, into the midst of the swarms of Slaves. There
							is an Englishman by the name of <persRef ref="thompson-george3"
								>Thompson</persRef>, lately come over from England, who is
							travelling about the country holding meetings and making eloquent
							inflammatory harangues, preaching the immediate abolition of Slavery.
							The general disposition of the people here is averse to these movements
							and Thompson has several times been routed by popular tumults. But in
							some places he meets favourable reception, and makes converts— There has
							been recently an alarm of Slave-insurrection in the State of
							Mississippi, and several white persons have been hung, by a summary
							process of what they call Lynch’s Law. That is Mob-Law— Add to all this
							the approach of the Presidential election, and the question whether the
							President of the United States shall be a Slave-holder or not. They
							never fail to touch upon this key in the South, and it has never yet
							failed of success. Rouse in the heart of the Slave-holder, the terror of
							his Slave, and it will a motive with him paramount to all others never
							to vote for any man, not a Slave-holder like himself— There are now <pb
								n="63" type="ms"/>calls in the Atlas the <persRef

							the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>-<persRef

							at Charlestown— It is said this was suppressed, but Edward Everett says
							there were riotous assemblages in the Streets very noisy till late last

							and withering as they had been all Night— I replaced the earth, and two
							of the maple seedlings in the Pot, with a little moist fresh earth to
							keep them straight; and the third maple in another Pot N. 8: filled with
							fresh earth and watered both the Pots— This accident gave me however the
							opportunity to see how the first roots of the maple-tree are formed, and
							how the plant comes out from the wing or fan, in which the seed is
							enclosed— I planted also in the Hazel patch, just half cleared away, a
							row of 16 whole jenneton Pears at 15 inches distance from each
							other—intending to cover the whole of that Patch with seedlings. I
							further hoed up the weeds in the Seminary alley and have had an alley
							opened to it from the Easternmost door of the house— Just before 2. I
							went with <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and bathed and

						<p><date>14. IV. </date>Friday.— Sun rose 5:6—fiery haze at the horizon—

						<p>There was something remarkable in the appearance of the atmosphere this

							rain before the close of the day The sky was otherwise clear, and the
							heat of the Sun so intense that I could not labour, upon my Plantation—
							In the visit to my Nursery however I found that the borer worm had
							attacked the two oldest of my seedling Oaks— This worm has almost
							destroyed the common locust tree in this region of Country— Has
							committed and is committing terrible ravages among the Apple trees—but
							this is the first indication I have had of his enmity to the Oaks— He
							goes directly to the heart of the tree, boring a hole not bigger than
							the head of a pin from the surface through the bark, and digging round
							between the wood and the bark to make himself a spacious residence while
							he penetrates into the wood. I had laid a Stone under the ground, and
							over the roots of the seedling red Oak, now in its seventh year—with the
							Inscription “Alteri Seculo” upon it— I am not sure that this worm has
							not already falsified the prediction and cut off in its infancy my
							candidate for life in the next century— If I save it now, will it not
							always be liable to a fatal attack from the same borer worm? and will it
							not be so with all the works of my hands? when shall I discover a plant
							for the life of the next century? <persRef key="adams-charles2"

							disabled all the morning by the heat. About four in the afternoon there
							came up a shower with light and distant thunder after which there was
							more freshness in the air— I am still copying, and perseveringly doing
							nothing— The accounts of the riots in Baltimore continue. In the State
							of Mississippi mobs are hanging up blacks suspected of insurgency, and
							whites suspected of abetting them— At Charleston South Carolina Mobs of
							Slave-holding Gentlemen intercept <pb n="65" type="ms"/>the Mails, and
							take out from them all the inflammatory pamphlets, circulated by the
							abolitionists, who in their turn, are making every possible exertion to
							kindle the flame of insurrection among the Slaves— We are in a state of
							profound Peace, and overpampered with prosperity— Yet the elements of
							exterminating war seem to be in vehement fermentation, and one can
							scarcely foresee to what it will lead.</p>

							and Peach trees— The Jargonelle pears are ripening, and almost all
							rotten at the core. I finished the weeding of my Eastern Seminary alley,

							service— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt preached from Romans 13.1.
							“Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers, For there is no power
							but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God.” It was a discourse
							upon the importance and necessity of Government; and upon the duty of
							submission to lawful authority. The riotous Spirit which is manifesting
							itself in every part of this Country has <unclear>alarmed</unclear> the
							friends of order and of Law— The dominion of the mob is taking the place
							of Governors, Judges and Sheriffs, and all security to the life, liberty
							and property of the Citizen is shaking to its foundation— Even in this
							town there has been no small agitation of a question about tarring and
							feathering of this Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt’s Sermon was a spirited appeal to the sense of Justice, and of
							order in his auditory. The argument was of course all on his side, and
							the Sermon was highly seasonable— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney’s text was from Proverbs 14.32—“the righteous hath hope in his
							death”—a consolatory dissertation upon the death of the righteous; in
							which he avowed his belief that there can be no eternity of punishment
							consistent with the character of a just and merciful God— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney’s voice and his eye-sight are
							equally failing, and he will probably not much longer be able to perform
							any of the Offices of public worship. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt requested the children of the Congregation, who were present to
							remain, after the afternoon service and delivered to them a Lecture— I
							read the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Sermon of the 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef>, upon chimerical projects— Like the one
							immediately preceding it is a Treatise of practical morality, and of
							useful instruction—containing many sagacious observations, and shewing
							much knowledge of human nature. Preoccupation of mind distracted my
							attention from it as almost always happens on Sundays, and at my age
							little of any use is to be learnt by reading— At twenty-one, when I
							delivered to the Phi Beta Kappa Society an Oration on the same Subject,
							this Sermon would have been to me a Treasure— <persRef

							of caterpillars which I took and placed under a quart glass tumbler
							Nothing useful can be accomplished in this world without perseverance
							and consistency of pursuit.— I have wished to ascertain the character of
							many of these changeable worms by following them through their different
							metamorphoses; but excepting the Silk worm and one cabbage-worm in 1805
							I have never been able to effect it— Last Summer I took in three
							caterpillars from the willows and they went into Cocoons— But on my
							return here last May I found they had perished—probably by the frost of
							winter— The natural History of Insects and of Plants, Entomology and
							Botany are Sciences which might be improved to great advantage by
							practical farmers— There scarcely passes a day, but I observe some new
							phenomenon of vegetation, but I know not how to turn it to use. Among my
							present observations the most impressive is the difference in the
							rapidity of vegetation between different seeds of the same plants,
							exemplified specially in the maple seeds which I brought from
							Philadelphia and Washington, one of which <pb n="67" type="ms"/>has
							produced a plant now 15 inches high, and opening its tenth pair of
							leaves, each at right angles with its immediate predecessor, and rising
							Story above Story, like a Chinese pagoda, while others growing in the
							same manner have opened their leaves from two to eight pair, and scarce
							any two of them to the same extent— I have suffered a bed of grass to
							cover the seedlings in the Eastern seminary, and this with the
							shingle-sheltering as yet preserves most of them, from the scorching

									>Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript"

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Leach</persRef> the Minister of the

							dinner time; and they had concluded to take another opportunity to visit
							me. He asked me, if I had received an answer from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell, to the Letter from the Committee.
							I had, early this morning, and read it to him— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Smith made also some enquiries concerning his claim against
							the Government of Chili, for the seizure of his vessel called the
							Macedonian, by <persRef ref="cochrane-alexander">Lord Cochran</persRef>
							in 1819 or 20—and asked if the Government of the United States was not
							itself bound to indemnify the sufferers, having made a Treaty with
							Chili, while this claim remained unsatisfied. I said I could not answer
							those Questions— A Bill had passed the Senate at the last Session of
							Congress, assuming the payment of large claims upon France, on the
							ground that they had been abandoned, for an equivalent beneficial to the
							Nation, by Treaty—but it had not passed the House of Representatives— If
							such an act should receive the sanction of Congress for claims against
							France, the case of the Macedonian might come within the principle—
							Perhaps the best course for him and the other claimants now to take
							would be to write to the <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Secretary of
								State</persRef>, and ascertain what is the condition of the claim as
							between the Governments; and if it has been abandoned to address a
							memorial to Congress at their next Session in behalf of the claimants;
							which if they should so determine, I would readily present, and so far
							as I should be able, would support— He said he would follow this advice—
							But must wait the return of <persRef ref="perkins-thomas">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thomas H. Perkins</persRef>, now in
							Europe, and who had lost by that seizure seventy thousand dollars— His
							own loss had been not less than thirty thousand— He said the robbery had
							been consummated without the shadow of a judicial process— That Lord
							Cochran had distributed the dollars among his own ship’s company on the
							deck of his own ship—and the Chilian Government had converted the vessel
							to their own use without even the pretence of a trial— At 6 O’Clock this
							afternoon, <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beale</persRef> called, and I went with him and <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Greenleaf</persRef> to meet the Committee at the Town-Hall— Every
							member of the Committee was present. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cornell’s answer to the Letter of the Committee was read and discussed—
							It is very respectful in style and manner, but neither denies the
							imputations in the report to the Missionary Society, published in their
							pamphlet, nor adduces any Evidence in support of them— He intimates that
							all the persons who concurred in the publication are responsible— The
							Committee determined that the Chairman should write a second Letter to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell, calling upon him for the
							Evidence upon which he made those imputations, and requesting him to
							answer before to-morrow Evening 6 O’Clock to which time the Committee
							adjourned their meeting— There was a bright Northern light this Evening,
							and the change to the coolness of autumnal air was sensibly marked.</p>

									>Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Cornell</persRef> a second Letter in behalf of the
							Committee of the Town of Quincy, and received his answer— I attended the
							Meeting of the Committee, at the Town-Hall at 6 O’Clock in the
							afternoon, and read to them my Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cornell, and his answer which is merely evasive— It was then voted that
							the Chairman be requested to prepare a report to be made to the town, at
							their adjourned meeting to-morrow afternoon at five O’Clock— And that
							the Committee meet at four, to consider and discuss the report— There
							was some question whether a Corporation could be prosecuted or prosecute
							for Slander. I proposed that the Letters which have passed between the
							Committee and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell should be reported,
							with a few brief remarks upon it by the Committee—and that it be
							recommended to the Town, to pass Resolutions— That the allegations in
							the Report of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell to the Missionary
							Society, and published in their thirty-sixth annual Report, injurious to
							the moral and religious character of the Town of Quincy, are false and
							scandalous— That the Correspondence of the Committee with him, and the
							proceedings of the Town upon the whole subject be published, in a
							Newspaper, and inserted in the Town’s Records.— I suggested that perhaps
							it might be proper to address a Letter to the President of the American
							Missionary Society, complaining of the publication of this libel upon
							the inhabitants of Quincy; but the Committee thought this would make
							more Town-meetings necessary and might lead to angry religious
							controversy— Just before the Committee adjourned, a <persRef
								ref="richards-jacob">Doctor Jacob Richards</persRef> of Hanover four
							Corners in the County of Plymouth came in and said there had been a
							person named <persRef ref="church-william2">Church</persRef>—he believed
							William, who had been some time a Revolutionary Pensioner, and then
							struck off the list because he declined making Oath that he had no
							property, though in fact he had none— He had afterwards applied for the
							restoration of his Pension, but died three or four years ago without
							obtaining it— He had been buried at the expence of the Town of Scituate
							where he belonged, and his compensation for medical attendance and for
							necessary medicines furnished him remained unpaid— He had left three
							daughters all married to mechanics and all poor— The question of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Richards was whether the Pension of which
							this man had been deprived upon a mistaken conclusion that he had
							property could not now be recovered by his legal representatives? I told
							him I had heard of many such cases, and of some whose Pensions had been
							restored during the lifetime of the claimant— But I knew of no instance
							in which it had been <pb n="70" type="ms"/>recovered after his decease—
							That if it could be done it must be by a special Act of Congress for
							which the three daughters must petition— In their petition they must
							state the material facts of the case and authenticate by testimony upon
							Oath, that of the Pensioners poverty— If they would forward such a
							Petition to me, I would present it to the House of Representatives at
							the next Session of Congress, and do all that might be in my power to
							carry it through; but I could not answer for its success— He said he
							would write to me on the subject, and asked me to write to him, which I
							assured him I would— Garden labours, hours of idleness— Evening cold and
							vivid lightening in the South west with a cloudless sky.</p>

						<p><date>21. IV:30. </date>Friday— Heavy Rain, with Thunder in the Night and
							till 8 O’Clock this Morning. After writing the journal of yesterday, I
							was engaged with the intermission only of a half hour for breakfast,
							till dinner in preparing a report to lay before the Committee of the

								ref="curtis-noah">Noah Curtis</persRef>, were absent—all the other
							members present— I read my report, which was approved and signed by all

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale came to the Town meeting and signed
							the Report— <persRef ref="brigham-josiah">Josiah Brigham</persRef> was
							Moderator— He read the proceedings of the former Meeting, stated the

							their Report— I then read the Report, and the Correspondence between the
							Committee and <persRef ref="cornell-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Cornell</persRef>— The report closed with two
							Resolutions proposed for the adoption of the Town— The first declaring
							the Statements injurious to the moral and religious character of the
							inhabitants of Quincy, in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell’s
							Report to the Massachusetts Missionary Society wholly destitute of truth
							or reasonable foundation— The second, that this Report, and the
							Correspondence between the Committee, and the Rev<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell be entered upon the
							Records of the town, and published in the — newspaper.— The blank was
							filled with the Centinel, the Daily Advertiser and Patriot, and the
							Trumpet— After the Report was read, and a short pause, the Moderator
							invited the inhabitants of the Town to express their Sentiments,
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">Daniel Greenleaf</persRef> moved
							that the Report of the Committee be accepted, the Resolutions adopted,
							and the Thanks of the Town given to the Committee for their Services—
							The question was put separately, upon each of the two Resolutions, and
							then upon the acceptance of the Report, and all voted unanimously— I
							moved that all the proceedings of the Town upon the subject should be
							published with the Report, and the Correspondence, which was adopted.
								<persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field</persRef> moved that one
							hundred extra copies of each of the three newspapers containing the
							proceedings should be printed, so that each householder of the Town
							should have a copy— <persRef ref="bass-benjamin">Benjamin Bass</persRef>
							thought this would occasion unnecessary expence, but he was the only one
							who voted against it— The Selectmen of the Town, were charged with the
							publication in the Newspapers— After this <persRef
								ref="bartlett-ibrahim">Ibrahim Bartlett</persRef> one of the
							Schoolmasters of the Town, said that reports had been circulated
							concerning him, which he wished openly in the face of the Town to
							contradict—one was that he had said he would take off the ears of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell. He never had said so, and whoever
							asserted that he had was a wretch— The other was that if it had not been
							for him, there would have been no Town-meeting on this matter— This was
							an honour to which he was not entitled— He had not signed the Petition
							to the Selectmen for the Town Meeting— He had even opposed it.— Though
							he was now glad it had been held. He had thought the publication by the
							Selectmen would be sufficient—but he had now altered his opinion—
								<persRef ref="hollis-zebediah">Hollis</persRef> said he hoped the
							Gentleman would not be alarmed at idle reports of his being inclined to
							violent measures— Worse things had been said of him, and not <pb n="71"

							Committee for their Services was adopted, and the Meeting dissolved
							before seven O’Clock— There was a Town meeting also at Boston this
							Evening to pass Resolutions against the proceedings of the Abolitionists
							as they are called—the preachers of Slave-emancipation— Evening clear

							visit, of kindness and curiosity, and gave me a small volume of Sermons
							published by him, and entitled Sermons from the fowls of the Air, and
							the Lilies of the Field— He told me that he had been some time a
							Missionary in India, and that he had seen me once in London, at a
							Meeting of the British and foreign School Society in the year 1816. (13.
							May) We had some conversation upon the most agitating topic of this
							time—Slavery and its abolition. He thought that the abolition of Slavery
							must come—but that it should be gradual; beginning by attaching the
							slave to the soil, like the Serfs in the North of Europe— I said
								<persRef ref="king-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rufus
								King</persRef> had expressed a similar opinion in a Speech on the
							Missouri question, in the Senate of the U.S. but I believed the

							Planters of the South will separate from the Union in terror of the
							emancipation of their Slaves, and that then the Slaves will emancipate
							themselves by a servile War. This consummation may be yet remote, and
							must be preceded by the sacrifice of the Public Lands to the Western
							States, effected by the co-operation of the South, to purchase that of
							the West, in perpetuating the Servitude of their Negroes.— This
							Coalition accomplished the election of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"

							now in full vigour to secure the election of his successor. This is the
							under current, with the tide of Democracy at the Surface— <persRef

							>Louisa-Catherine</persRef>— He kept her there, but returned himself

							long, but useless— The vegetation of almost all my seedling plants has
							ceased for the Season, but the Peach trees continue to grow, and two or
							three of them in the Eastern Seminary are three feet high— Here and
							there a seedling Apple still shoots its plumelet upwards, and two or
							three of the Chesnut Oaks, have put forth a third shoot this Season— I
							covered up in Stand 4. Pear Cores, Cherry stones and a few black
							Currents, and placed it in the cellar.— And I planted in the ring patch
							fronting my Study window, five cherries—and at the Eastern end of the
							Seminary one Apricot Stone.— I looked into <persRef ref="rees-abraham"
								>Rees’s</persRef> Cyclopaedia, Volume 6. for some explanation, and
							account of the dog-days, but it is very confused and unsatisfactory. He
							attributes the name of Canicular days to the antient Egyptians—says they

								>Hesiod</persRef> and <persRef ref="homer">Homer</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="virgil">Virgil</persRef> and <persRef ref="horace"

							of twenty-days before and twenty days after the Heliacal rising of
							Sirius which he fixes about the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							August— The dog-days thus would be from the 21<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> of July to the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of
							September—but he says that a very proper alteration has of late been
							made in the Almanacs (English) making dog-days begin the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of July and finish the 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August— That is the time during which

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="greenwood-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Greenwood</persRef> of Boston, in the morning from Psalm 139.1. “O
							Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.” The discourse was the common
							argument for the existence of a God, inferred from the evidence of
							design in all the works of Creation, but it was stated in a light rather
							different from the usual one— He said that in contemplating the proof of
							design, of the adaptation of means to ends, in the movements of the
							Heavenly bodies, in the organization and structure of animals and of
							vegetables upon earth, in the perpetual demonstration of predisposition
							which is exhibited to our senses— It becomes not only incredible, but
							inconceivable how all this universal harmony in the operations of Nature
							should exist, and yet that there should be no being in the Universe to
							whom it is <hi rend="italic">known</hi>—<hi rend="italic"> </hi>This
							knowledge is not in matter itself— Mind only can predispose—and where
							predisposition is made manifest to our own intelligence, we cannot
							resist the conclusion that it was produced by intelligence distinct from
							matter— There is then a mind to which the system of the Universe in all
							its immensity and all its innumerable varieties must be known—and that
							being is God— But this discovery can be practically useful to men only,
							by the application of it to their own existence—by the consciousness
							that the intelligence with which they themselves are endowed, is of the
							same nature as that which understands and knows the system of the
							Universe— It is distinct and separate from the matter of which their
							bodies are composed, and subject to none of its Laws—as the creating,
							knowing Spirit cannot die, the portion of it bestowed upon man must be
							immortal—and for the enjoyment and exercise of it man must be
							accountable to the source whence it was received— The novelty and
							ingenuity of this statement of the argument struck me very forcibly,—and
							the deduction of human responsibility to the creator, from the proof of
							his existence in the necessity of intelligence to understand what
							intelligence has made was itself the work of a powerful mind— There was
							an apparent connection between this Sermon and that of the afternoon,
							from Psalm 4.6. “There be many that say, Who will shew us any good?
							Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.” He said this
							enquiry was as common now as it was in the days of the Psalmist— Many
							still say who will shew us any good?— The Psalmist does not answer
							directly the question; but calls upon God to lift upon him the light of
							his Countenance— This is the answer full and complete— Under the light
							of the divine Countenance <hi rend="italic">all</hi> is good.
							Poverty—disease—death—the heaviest calamities that can befall the
							condition of man—<hi rend="italic">all</hi> are <hi rend="italic"
								>good</hi>— This closing part of the Discourse was eloquent and
							pathetic—and altogether the two Sermons left a pleasing and grateful
							impression upon the mind, of piety to God, and of gratitude and
							contentment under own condition of life— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Greenwood’s delivery is cold, inanimate and drowsy.— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> took <persRef
								ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny</persRef> with her to Meeting, but she
							was unwell there and her grandmother came out with her and brought her
							home— <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Louisa</persRef> was unwell too and did
							not go— <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitney</persRef> was in the Pulpit— I read the 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon of the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>
							upon the variety of opinions— A discourse of a peculiar character,
							strongly indicating however the skeptical turn of the author’s mind— The
							text is from Matthew 16.–13–17. the enquiry by Jesus of his disciples,
							who men said he was—and who they, the disciples said he was? with
								<persRef ref="peter">Peter’s</persRef> answer, that he was the
							Christ—and the reply of Jesus that this was a special revelation to <pb
								n="73" type="ms"/>Peter, from God— There are some very severe
							reflections upon Peter’s apostasy after having received this Revelation—
							Some bitter Satire upon the preacher’s auditory— He discusses the
							motives of Jesus in asking this question; who men said he was? He turns
							to his hearers, and asks what answers they would receive, if they should
							ask the question what men said of them; and what would be their motives
							for asking it— Their motives might be jealousy, vanity, idle curiosity;
							and one would be answered that men said he was a thief, another an
							adulterer, another a false witness against his neighbour— He says too
							that when the disciples answered Jesus that some said he was <persRef
								ref="johnthebaptist">John the Baptist</persRef>, some <persRef
								ref="elijah">Elias</persRef> some <persRef ref="jeremiah"
								>Jeremias</persRef>, or one of the prophets, they suppressed the
							most odious things that were said of him, because they would not repeat
							blasphemies— Finally he says that he has no taste for religious
							metaphysical subtleties— That whoever tells him, that nothing is
							certain, he sees clearer light in the opposite opinion— That when he
							affirms that he has a material body and an intelligent Soul, and that
							his will is free, he finds himself sustained by a light impossible to be
							found in the opposite propositions— A Sophist, says he, [“]may imagine
							objections that I could not solve; but he could not find reasons to
							counterbalance those which determined me: he may embarrass, but cannot
							convince me”— These are the concessions of a doubting mind—and they
							explain why Saurin’s argumentative objections to his own doctrines are
							always stronger than the answers to them— I performed this day my daily
							task of writing, and in the Evening read some pages in the Autobiography
							of <persRef ref="bridges-samuel">Sir Egerton Bridges</persRef>.</p>

						<p><persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston this
							morning, and returned before dinner. He brought out with him his
							daughter <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa-Catherine</persRef>. I
							spent the forenoon from Breakfast time in the Garden, Nursery, and
							Seminary— I planted a fourth row of whole Pears, (Catherine) just
							gathered from the tree, in the cleared hazel bush patch, and four whole
							Pears, in the Nursery, before the western wall, and near the eldest
							seedling Oak—The old S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Michael and S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Germain Pear trees in the Garden bear
							very full, but the fruit is all blighted. The corner seminary maple,
							shews the germ of its eleventh pair of leaves, and the corner chesnut
							Oak near it, puts forth a third shoot— What an infinite variety of modes
							has Nature to produce the same results!— <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">E. Price Greenleaf</persRef> came this
							afternoon, and examined the buds in the young cherry-trees which he
							inserted on the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> and 25<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> of last Month— Almost all of them have
							taken, and the stems of some of the trees have swollen so that the yarn
							bandage made a furrow round them— One bud of an Apple stock, inserted
							last Summer, from <persRef ref="thayer-solomon">Solomon
								Thayer’s</persRef> Mount Wollaston Apple, is just now opening to put
							forth a leaf.— In the innumerable disappointments, which befall me since
							this plantation fancy came over me, these occasional incidents of
							success, not only more than balance them with pleasure, but afford a
							continually repeated enjoyment, delusive indeed like all the pleasures
							of the imagination, but which occupy and pleasingly agitate the mind—
							When I lose a plant, especially one which I have cherished, and enjoyed
							in hope the painful sensation is ridiculously acute, but is momentary
							and soon forgotten; but the plant that comes up; that grows from day to
							day the first Season and from year to year afterwards is a continual
							feast—and as it grows, and gives growing hope of proving hereafter
							useful by producing fruit, it affords enjoyment not unworthy of a
							rational being— I cannot bring myself to take much interest in flowers,
							because they pass off, and perish leaving nothing behind—but the trees
							now seemingly as evanescent as the petal of a rose, and which yet one
							hundred years hence will bear delicious fruit, or afford a shelter and a
							shade to after ages of men; <pb n="74" type="ms"/>these yield me
							delight— Serit arbores quae alteri saeculo prosint—never was I believe
							sentiment deeper seated in human heart than in mine— My walnut tree now
							in its thirtieth year, now grows every year in beauty and usefulness,
							and there is a growth in its descendents about the garden and Nursery
							all planted by my hand, and which in the next century may be pointed out
							as such— My Seminary Maple of which three months since I picked up the
							seed at Philadelphia affords me daily amusement, and has taught me the
							process of Nature in the production and growth of that kind of tree.—
							This Apple bud, which has been 13 Months in the stock, and now first
							shewing a sign of life is another pleasure, though the hope of its
							continuance is but slender— For the constant failures of my plantations
							teach the vanity of human life, as their success is among its best
							enjoyments. <persRef ref="brigham-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>A restless and almost sleepless night. I awoke before two O’Clock with a
							burning throat, great hoarseness, dull pain across the eye-brows and
							some fever— A free perspiration soon came on and gave me some relief— It
							continued till the entry Clock struck four and I arose— Repairing to my
							Library chamber I found myself weak and faint but upon lying down on the
							bed about half an hour I recovered so as to be able to write: and so the
							day was employed. I visited my garden, nursery and seminary, but
							abstained from all labour in them and observed nothing to notice in the
							growth of my plants— Intermitted hearing <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">my grand-children</persRef> read—
							I consulted <persRef ref="woodward-ebenezer">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Woodward</persRef> who was here, and advised a
							teaspoonful of calcined magnesia to be mixed with the Seidlitz powder
							to-morrow Morning— Thus I worried through the day and in the Evening,
							with <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> called first at <persRef
								ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale’s</persRef>,

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Greenleaf’s</persRef> where we
							found him and his daughter <persRef ref="greenleaf-mary3"
							>Anne</persRef>— We came home as the town Bell was ringing nine— I took
							a warm foot bath, and cup of sage tea and went to bed— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> is recovering from
							her indisposition, but kept her chamber all this day— I was copying the
							account of my excursion to Harper’s Ferry, in May of last year, and it
							brought to my mind more pleasing recollections and associations during
							those three days, than I can find in the four months retravelling
							through that long Session of Congress— This revision might indeed be
							useful to me, were I thirty years younger than I am;—but how can what I
							learn now be useful to any one? Seized by the throat as I have been the
							last two Nights, the only thought which ought to absorb all the
							faculties of my Soul is my own approaching dissolution, and the
							dispositions which I can make of my worldly affairs, for the future
							well-being of my posterity— All this I know and feel, with deep
							conviction, and yet pass on from day to day, as if I neither knew nor
							felt it at-all— October next will be three years since I made with great
							care and consideration a Will— The state of my affairs has since then
							considerably changed; that of my family still more— I ought to make now
							another Will; but in the Spirit of procrastination, postpone it, for the
							chance of another year of Life, reserving it for one of the labours of
							the next Summer.</p>

								Lunt</persRef> this morning from Matthew 9.12. “But when Jesus heard

							they that are sick[”]— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt as he seems
							usually to do, related the occasion, upon which these words were spoken
							with a brief comment intermingled with the narrative— Then recurred to
							the leading idea that Christianity is a medicinal regimen for disease,
							he adduced the prominent infirmities in the moral and intellectual
							nature of man, as examples of the diseases which it is the object of the
							Christian dispensation to heal—of these he said little till he came to
							the mention of enthusiasm, at which all the remainder of the discourse
							was pointed. He defined enthusiasm to be an extravagant excitement of
							the mind, accompanied with a delusion of the imagination,—and he painted
							with energy the evils to which it gives rise— He was particularly severe
							upon religious enthusiasm, and upon the absurdities that flow from the
							hallucination of a belief that there is a special communication of
							influences of the divine Spirit—he spoke of it as of a species of
							insanity. The <pb n="77" type="ms"/>afternoon Sermon was from Proverbs
							22.1. “A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches”—and it was
							a pleasing and useful exposition of the advantages of a good name— There
							is no doubt that to this time, and in this age as in that of <persRef
								ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef> a good name, is preferable to great
							riches, but the acquirement of it seems equally beyond the controul of
							the greater part of mankind— It is not more in the power of a man to
							obtain the possession of a good name, than that of a great Estate—
							Riches may be acquired by industry and frugality, with a moderate share
							of good fortune, but a good name excites envy, malice, and hatred, an
							all their active energies for its destruction— This is emphatically the
							destiny of a good name whenever eminently acquired; and so dependent is
							it upon the chances of Fortune, and the caprices, the prejudices and the
							Passions of others, that no virtue can be sure of attaining, and no
							exertion can enjoy the privilege of retaining it— A good name therefore
							like great riches, is a Lottery ticket— Happy he who wins the prize—but
							no man must flatter himself that shall gain by deserving it— <persRef

							upon the uniformity of the conduct of God— A discourse altogether
							speculative and not practical; as indeed must necessarily be all

							was to shew, that in the infinite variety of the operations of God,
							there is undeviating uniformity of object— That Order is Heaven’s first
							Law results from the perfections of the divine Nature, and with this

							in the State of Illinois, and situated within one Mile of Vandalia, the
							Seat of Government of that State. What has become of the Land warrant

							to ask my advice what to do— He shewed me a copy of the Letter from his

							offered to forward the Letter to the Commissioner of the General
							Land-Office—to receive his answer, and if there should be occasion, to
							make enquiries concerning the Land, of any of the members of Congress
							from the State of Illinois I thought the greatest danger was that the
							Land had been sold for the payment of taxes— He said he would get his
							father to write to the Commissioner of the General Land-Office, and
							would bring me the Letter— <persRef ref="bass-lewis">M<hi
