									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bartlett</persRef> called on me early
							this morning for Toasts and a Hymn for the celebration of the coming
								4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> I
							gave them eleven toasts which I had just written, and desired them to
							select such of them as they should approve, and if they wanted more,
							obtain them from some other person— I furnished these with reluctance
							having no talent at toasting; and being sure of bitter criticism upon
							every Toast that I give— They asked me also for a Hymn, but I declined
							to perform that Service. I told them that in composing the Toasts I had
							excluded every sentiment approaching to party Spirit of any kind. They
							said this was their own desire; but the consequence is that the Toasts
							are all flat— Yet even these wretched Toasts, took up some of my time
							this morning— Having transcribed from loose sheets, to the last Volume
							of this Diary, the Journal of September and part of October 1833. I
							commenced this day upon the break between 10. January and 31. March of
							the same year I have formed the purpose of filling up that Volume of
							which there are now more than 200 blank pages—for the accomplishment of
							this I give myself one hundred days, which will bring me to the close of
							the Season, and leave me nothing to undertake that I can accomplish
							before my departure for Washington— And all this must be subject to the
							intervention of accidents—perhaps of ill health, or other circumstances
							unwelcome to think of, in advance— In my visits this day to my Garden, I
							sowed in Pot N. 11. a white one, with four crushed Downton Strawberries
							for the seed— The alleys of my garden have at length been cleared of
							their coat of grass and weeds, and my cherries are all gathered— About
							two thirds of them by Robins and Cat-birds— I planted a row of Cherry
							Stones in the bed next the Nursery fence— <pb n="31" type="ms"/>From a
							seedling cherry of last year, towards the fence— <persRef

							character of <persRef ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>, which I gave
							him— I resumed and continued my Catalogue of Medals and Coins for
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>— About Sunset I
							walked to the sixth Mile-stone. The weather was so cool, that we had
							fire in the dining room all day.</p>

						<p>I had devoted the day to the labours which I have assumed and promised
							myself large progress in the redemption of arrears in my last volume,
							but made very little. <persRef ref="houghton-jason">Jason
								Houghton</persRef> a tax collector of the town of Milton brought me
							a tax bill, County and Town, of 75 cents, upon my 3 Acres of Penny-ferry
							Salt-marsh— My Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came
							out from Boston with <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">his daughter</persRef>
							and dined with us— I gave him the portion of Coins and medals of which I
							had made out the list, but I found that this work was far from being
							finished— Immediately after dinner <persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas L. M’Kenney</persRef> of
							Philadelphia came in, and was desirous of seeing the monument and Tombs
							of <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> and <persRef
								key="adams-abigail">mother</persRef> in and under the Meeting House—
							I went with him, and after a search at five or six different houses
							found the key to the cellar, and there after another long search found
							the keys of the interior of the house, but not of the vault where my
							father and mother lie buried— We went into the Meeting House and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kenney read the monumental inscription
							upon the marble tablet, at the right hand of the pulpit as you go to it—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kenney asked me for a copy of this
							Inscription, written, as the monument itself was erected by me— But as I
							take it for granted he will have no recollection of his request
							to-morrow, I told him I would send him a copy of it if he desired it— He
							saw the monument of <persRef ref="quincy-josiah3">Josiah
								Quincy</persRef> the Patriot and of <persRef ref="quincy-abigail2"
								>his wife</persRef> in the burying yard, which led us into that
							abode of my fathers and <persRef ref="adams-george;adams-john2">my
								Sons</persRef>— We went all over the yard and he viewed the marble
							monument of the Quincys, and the Granite Tombstones, erected by my
							father over the remains of his forefathers—<persRef ref="adams-henry"
								>Henry Adams</persRef>, who died in 1647. <persRef
								ref="adams-joseph3">Joseph Adams Senior</persRef> who died in 1694.
								<persRef ref="adams-joseph2">Joseph Adams junior</persRef> who died
							in 1737 and <persRef ref="adams-john4">John Adams Senior</persRef>, who
							died in 1760— The original grave stones of Henry and the two Joseph’s
							still remain— The first is a granite stone, in which was inlaid a small
							square marble tablet bearing the obituary inscription, but that is
							gone—and so it is from every other stone of the same kind in the yard.
							about 1680 they began to use the Slate Stones with the Inscriptions cut
							into them— They have proved more durable, and those of Joseph Adams
							Senior and <persRef ref="adams-abigail3">Abigail Baxter</persRef> are
							still in a state of good preservation at the spot where they were
							deposited— But the marble slab inlaid in the granite tomb-stone of Henry
							Adams, erected by my father in 1817. is already broken, and there are
							some other marks of decay in one of the other tombstones, which will
							need to be repaired— The Quincy monument is also somewhat dilapidated—
							The marble pedestal is cracked, and one of the corners of the
							entablature is <pb n="32" type="ms"/>broken off. The Epitaph written by
							me in 1802 is scarcely legible— The frosts of winter contract the
							ground, which the excavations to receive the coffins make hollow. In
							time, the ground upon the surface caves in; and every Spring the melting
							of the frost heaves up the surface, and the burdens upon it— There are
							self-planted trees growing out of some of the graves, and these uproot
							the grave-stones— The vaults along the sides of the yard, are of modern
							invention—within the last twenty-five years, and they are without
							epitaphs, or inscription, except in some cases of the mere name— Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> M’Kenney took some pencil-minutes from
							the tombstones— The key of the vault containing the remains of my father
							and mother were not to be found— It was about Sunset when Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> M’Kenney left me to return over
							Milton-Hill to Boston— Charles was already gone—and so was my regular
							occupation— </p>

						<p>The weather has again changed suddenly to high summer heat, and the
							drought commences— My seedling plants this Season up are withering, and
							those that have the protection of the weeds will be likely to fare the
							best— My special solicitude is for the maples the appearance and growth
							of which I now witness for the first time— The seed that I brought from
							Philadelphia has succeeded best and I only regret that I had not taken
							ten times the quantity, that from Washington comes up differently—with
							seed leaves, and looks drooping and sickly— My tall apple and peach
							seedlings, which had so fair a promise of growth last year are both
							diseased this Season; but I have no remedy for their diseases— The
							apple-tree is infested by swarms of small green lice, which cover the
							ends of the shoots, and change into a small black fly; and there are
							with them swarms of black ants continually running up and down the
							shoots— They arrest the growth of the shoots and curl up the leaves as
							they first put forth— The disease on the peach is a mildew— The green
							lice also attack occasionally the tips of the willow shoots— I observe
							that wherever a seedling plum comes up, there is a gathering of Ants and
							that the leaves are eaten away— <persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirke</persRef>
							is proceeding in the process of weeding my garden— My arrears of Diary
							were the occupation of the day—with the papering of coins for <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>. In the Evening, I had left
							my house to visit <persRef ref="dewindt-caroline">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs.</hi> De Wint</persRef> at <persRef
								ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B.

								<persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Snelling presented me a Letter of
							Introduction from <persRef ref="brooks-edward">Edward Brooks</persRef>
							at Boston— They came as a Committee from the Boston Academy of Music, an
							Association incorporated 22. March 1833. for the purpose of promoting
							Education in the science and practice of music— They have purchased the
							building which was the federal Street Theatre, and are fitting it up for
							a Hall, for the performance of Concerts and Oratorios— They propose to
							open it with a religious solemnity, and they apply to me to deliver an
							Address upon the occasion. I had some conversation with them upon the
							Nature and character of the Institution, which I think very laudable,
							and which may be highly useful. I told them that I believed there was
							not in the world a civilized Nation which neglected the Art, and Science
							of Music so much as the People of this Country. And it was the more <pb
								n="33" type="ms"/>remarkable, as we were rather distinguished for
							the taste and talent of painting— I rejoiced therefore, that this
							Institution had been formed, and hoped that it would tend to the
							promotion of Harmony, not only of sound, but of sentiment and of temper
							among the People— I said I felt myself honoured by their application to
							me to deliver the Address upon the opening of their building, though I
							feared, from the nature of my engagements, and the numerous applications
							of the same kind which I had been under the necessity of declining it
							would not be in my power. They said they had hoped that the peculiar
							character of this undertaking might induce me to make an exception in
							this case, and requested me to take the proposal into consideration, and
							to give them an answer hereafter—to which I agreed. They left with me
							two annual reports of the Academy—for 1833 and 1834, and two printed
							collections of hymns, anthems and songs performed at juvenile Concerts
							given by the Academy. After they left me I went to M<hi

							the day and the clergymen of the town, whom we accompanied to the
							Meeting House. <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thomas Greenleaf</persRef> presided.— The performances
							were 1. A voluntary by the brigade Band. 2. A song written for the

								Pierpont</persRef>, excellent, and sung by <persRef ref="u">M<hi

							The whole occupied about two hours, and from the Meeting House the

							the House in which <persRef ref="hancock-john">John Hancock</persRef>
							was born, stood upon it.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lincoln’s
							Oration was a very good one, without any infection of party

							especially noticing those, who were natives or inhabitants of this Town—
							Pointing to the benefits which we have derived from our National
							Independence, and indicating the means by which they are to be preserved
							and perpetuated— Inviolable attachment to the Union <pb n="34" type="ms"
							/>the Freedom of the Press, and the discipline of the Militia— He was
							about an hour in the delivery, and was very warmly applauded— I walked
							with the Procession to the entrance of the Lot, and then left them, came
							home and dined with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary">my
								family</persRef>— Charles dined with the company, but left the table

								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Whitney and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Whitcomb soon after came, and Charles returned with them to

						<p><date>5. IV. </date>Sunday.</p>
						<p>Heard <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef>, this morning, from Job 28.12. [“]But where shall
							wisdom be found? and where is the place of Understanding?” and 20.
							[“]Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of Understanding?”
							and 32.8. “But there is a Spirit in man: and the inspiration of the
							Almighty giveth them understanding.” He considered the second text as
							the answer to the first, and the purpose of the discourse was to shew
							that the Spirit of God operates by direct agency upon the mind of man,
							as effectively as it does upon the material world— This approaches to
							the quaker doctrine; but must nevertheless be true— How the
							accountability of man is to be reconciled, with this superintending and
							inspiring power of the Almighty is a problem yet to be solved— <persRef
								ref="pope-alexander">Pope</persRef> says that the Great first Cause,
							binding Nature fast in Fate left free the human will— But if the Will be
							free, how is it influenced by the inspiration of the Almighty.— If the
							Understanding comes by inspiration, how does it depend upon the Will of
							Man? If Wisdom comes from inspiration, whence comes Folly?— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt did not enter into these discussions,
							nor into an examination of the doctrine of inspiration as taught by the
							Methodists, and high Presbyterian <persRef ref="calvin-john"
								>Calvinists</persRef>; but asserted that the doctrine of divine
							influences upon the mind, was true in a certain sense. I took <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">my two Granddaughters</persRef>
							to meeting with me, for the morning service— <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="harrod-mary2">Mary Harrod</persRef> were there— Elizabeth and
							Mary Harrod from New-Orleans. Isaac Hull, from West Point— They arrived
							at 2 O’Clock this Morning— The afternoon Sermon was from Matthew 19.24
							“And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the
							eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.”
							The figure of speech, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt said was a
							proverbial expression among the Jews, but he did not give his authority
							for the assertion— It has much more the air of an original expression of
							Jesus Christ, who never spoke but in Parables— The meaning here of the
							words, the kingdom of God is—the Christian Religion— There is great
							severity in the remark; but its application must be restricted to the
							circumstances under which it was made— The young man came anxiously to
							enquire what good thing he should do, that he might have eternal life—
							Jesus referred him to the Commandments and the observances of the
								<persRef ref="moses">Mosaic</persRef> Law— This then according to
							Jesus was sufficient for his Salvation— But the young man had kept all
							these from his Youth up.— For all this there had been no promise made of
							eternal Life— This was brought to light by the Gospel, and for its
							enjoyment something more than the Law from Sinaï required— Jesus told
							him then if he would be perfect he must go, and <pb n="35" type="ms"
							/>sell all that he had and give to the poor; and then come and follow
							him— The young man demurred—he went away sorrowing, for he had large
							possessions— This is all human nature— The gospel is the religion of the
							poor. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt enumerated the temptations to
							which riches are liable, and which disqualify their owners for
							Christianity; but as the theme is somewhat invidious, he dispensed his
							rebukes with gentleness— I read the fourteenth Sermon of the sixth
							volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>— The last of
							the Volume— Upon the tranquility bred from perfect Charity— The text is
							from 1 John 4.18 [“]Perfect <hi rend="italic">love</hi> casteth out
							fear”— So is it in the English Bible— In Saurin’s text it is perfect
							Charity banisheth fear— But the Charity of the New Testament is
							synonymous with brotherly love, and is the vital Spirit of Christianity.
							The preacher perplexes himself with the effort to reconcile the doctrine
							of his text with that of the fears which it is his habitual duty to
							rouse in the breasts of his heavers, for their own Salvation—and
							although the Discourse is elaborate, and written with great ability, it
							leaves an unsettled Sentiment upon the mind, between the banishment of
							fear by perfect charity, and the obligation of fear as a motive to
							repentance for sin— I read further some pages of <persRef
								ref="milman-henry">Milman’s</persRef> History of the Jews— There is
							an involuntary impression in reading this book that the Historian does
							not believe a word of the story that he tells— And such must be the
							impression from any attempt to assimilate the historical narrative of
							the Scriptures to the authenticated events of profane history— In the
							Bible, all is marvelous—all is miraculous— From the first chapter and
							verse of Genesis to the last of the Apocalypse, all is out of the order
							of Nature, and will not bear to be tested by the Laws of Nature as known
							to us.— There were light sprinklings of showers this afternoon; with the
							rumbling of distant thunder— They confined me to the house for the
							Evening.</p>

							the application to me would have been improper, if the Academy had been
							a mere musical Society— I told him I had understood them exactly as he
							now explained, and gave him my thanks, for a volume which I received
							yesterday; being the Manual of the Boston Academy of Music, for <pb
								n="36" type="ms"/>instruction in vocal music, on the system of
								<persRef ref="pestalozzi-johann">Pestalozzi</persRef>—a small
							volume, composed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mason and published
							by the Academy.— I had no other interruption this day, but although I
							rose at half-past three of the morning, and was as assiduous in my
							labours as it is in my nature to be, it was an inefficient day— There
							was a heavy thunder shower from two to five in the afternoon— I visited
							repeatedly my Garden Nursery and Close, watching my seedling plants, but
							without discovering one new one any where— My young white mulberries
							however are for the first year, bearing fruit—two of them—the third
							though much older has never yet borne a berry— I give lessons of reading
							to <persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">my two Grand
								daughters</persRef>, and learn what untiring perseverance and
							immovable Patience is necessary to practice the art of teaching—
							Accidents continually occur to occasion intermissions of the lessons,
							and after a single day’s intermission, the repugnance of the pupil to
							resume the study must be overcome— I wrote a short Letter this Evening
							to <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef>.</p>

								Spear</persRef> came, and paid his rent for the quarter just
							expired: and I had some conversation with him concerning the renewal of

							third number of his appeal from the new to the Old Whigs was published

								<persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H. Everett</persRef> was
							grossly insulted, the company refusing to hear him speak, on suspicion
							that he was the author of the Papers under the signature of a Whig

							presided at the feast, and endeavoured to obtain a hearing for M<hi

								<persRef ref="dewindt-elizabeth2">Elizabeth</persRef>— They are to
							go upon their return to New-York on Thursday— After the rain of
							yesterday, which refreshed my seedling plants, I discovered only one new
							comer, a Philadelphia maple, breaking through the ground of the box in
							the Eastern close next the road— There was one there up already— The
							Philadelphia Maples come up much alike— No seed—leaves— The plumelet
							pierces its way through the ground, rises about an inch, and opens two
							regular maple leaves, about a week after, the plumelet rising another
							inch opens two more maple leaves at right Angles with the first pair— In
							another week it rises and opens a third pair of leaves, again at right
							Angles with the second— Here are now those which I sowed on the first of
							June, and the first of which came up on the 22<hi rend="superscript"

							five large Nursery Downton Strawberries, which I crushed and sowed in
							five places at suitable intervals on the ground under the Northern fence
							of the Eastern close— The day thus slipped away, and I wrote only a few
							lines besides the Journal of yesterday.</p>

						<p>My garden, nursery and Eastern close Nursery, are now so fully stocked
							with seedling plants of fruit and forest trees of my own sowing that it
							absorbs hours of time merely to look at them. I sowed yesterday half a
							dozen ripening white mulberries in a broken earthen pot N. 14. to
							ascertain if the seed will vegetate— My Nursery is overburdened with
							young forest trees, which grow there with great rapidity— Especially the
							Horse Chesnut Elm, English white Oak, Red and Chesnut Oaks, Button wood,
							and Ash—to which I may add the Black walnut—of all which I have several
							trees growing— I finished for the second time since I came home, weeding
							my new Eastern close Nursery— The second shoot of my Chesnut and red
							Oaks, is now coming out, and a fourth pair of leaves forming on the
							plumelet of one of the Philadelphia Maples— I trimmed down an old Peach
							tree in the Garden, near the dwarf Apple tree, which bears this Season,
							very full— <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef>
							dined with us, as did my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> who came out from Boston alone. I gave him the
							remainder of my Collection of Coins and Medals—of which I have made out
							a list, in a confused state, and requiring future arrangement. The
								<persRef ref="lothrop-samuel">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi

							female School or Academy in the City came after dinner to invite me to
							deliver an introductory Lecture or Address to the Institute of
							Instruction, for their course of Lectures to commence in the course of
							the next Month— I declined this invitation, as I have so many others,
							for which I have no time, and for which besides I do not feel myself
							well qualified— It seems to me that I have no faculty for writing or
							speaking upon anything that is not controversial. I had much
							conversation with Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lothrop and
							Emerson, <pb n="38" type="ms"/>upon various topics, Literary, political
							and religious, on all which I had much more than my share of the

						<p><date>10. IV. </date>Friday Rainy morning, and a cold Northeasterly wind
							the whole day— The redemption of my arrears of Diary is arrested by the
							want of the Journal of the House of Representatives of the second
							Session of the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Congress— This put me
							upon the Search among my old pamphlets, of which I have
							thousands—lumbering a multitude of Trunks Chests and boxes, and
							increasing in numbers almost every day— To assort them and select from
							them those that are worth binding, is a Herculean task, which I shrink
							from undertaking— In the attempt to collect together the loose sheets of
							the Journal that I wanted, a large portion of the day was wasted. In the
							process, I collected a considerable number of my own compositions,
							several of which are so intermixed with other voluminous matter that
							they are like two grains of wheat, in two bushels of chaff— The course
							of my occupations being thus interrupted, to avoid a total loss of time,
							I wrote four short Letters, one of which, to <persRef ref="burch-samuel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel Burch</persRef>, Chief
							Clerk in the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives of the
							United States— I spent also three hours in my garden, Nursery and

							learn nothing, from obtuseness in the faculty of observation and
							sluggishness in that of reflection— <persRef ref="kirk-john"
								>Kirk</persRef> has weeded the alleys in the garden, and part of the

									rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams’s</persRef>; I gave
								<persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef> two Letters which

							young <persRef ref="campbell-archibald">Lieutenant Campbell</persRef>,
							from Albany, a companion of <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull
								Adams</persRef>— They were going to <persRef ref="miller-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Miller’s</persRef>. <persRef ref="marshall-john">John Marshall</persRef>, Chief
							Justice of the United States died at Philadelphia last Monday the 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> He was
							one of the most eminent men that this Country has ever produced— He has
							held this appointment thirty-five years— It was the last act of <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Administration, and one of
							the most important services, rendered by him to his Country— All
							Constitutional Governments are flexible things—and as the Supreme
							Judicial Court is the tribunal of last resort for the Construction of
							the Constitution and the Laws, the Office of Chief Justice of that Court
							is a station of the highest trust—of the deepest responsibility; and of
							influence far more extensive than that of the President of the United
							States— John Marshall was a federalist of the <persRef
								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef> School— The associate
							judges, from the time of his appointment have generally been taken from
							the democratic or Jeffersonian party—not one of them excepting <persRef
								ref="story-joseph">Story</persRef> has been a man of great ability.
							Several of them have been men of strong prejudices, warm passions, and
							contracted minds— One of them occasionally insane— Marshall, by the
							ascendancy of his genius <pb n="39" type="ms"/>by the amenity of his
							deportment, and by the imperturbable command of his temper has given a
							permanent and systematic character to the decisions of the Court and
							settled many great constitutional questions favourably to the
							continuance of the Union— Marshall has cemented the Union, which the
							crafty and Quixotic Democracy of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
								>Jefferson</persRef> had a perpetual tendency to dissolve— Jefferson
							hated and dreaded him— Marshall kept Jefferson much under the curb; some
							times, as perhaps in the case of <persRef ref="burr-aaron">Aaron
								Burr’s</persRef> conspiracy too much so—but Marshall’s mind was far
							better regulated than that of Jefferson— It is much to be feared that a
							successor will be appointed of a very different character— The <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President of the United States</persRef> now in
							Office has already appointed <persRef
								ref="mclean-john2;baldwin-henry;wayne-james">three judges</persRef>
							of the Supreme Court; with the next appointment he will have constituted
							the Chief Justice, and a majority of the Court— He has not yet made one
							good appointment— His Chief Justice will be no better than the rest— The
							death of Judge Marshall has occurred under Circumstances of deep
							melancholy— His disease was the stone—he had been saved and relieved
							about three years, by the operation of the lithotomy performed with
							consummate skill by <persRef ref="physick-philip">Doctor
								Physick</persRef>— He had now been brought, a few days before his
							death to Philadelphia, for a further and last resource to save him—
								<persRef ref="marshall-thomas2">His eldest Son</persRef>, a man of
							more than forty years of age, having a <persRef ref="marshall-margaret"
								>wife</persRef> and family of six children, was at Baltimore, on his
							way to Philadelphia, to sooth with filial affection and tenderness the
							last moments of his father’s life, when by the falling of the timber of
							a house in a Tornado, upon his head he was mortally wounded, and died
							after being trepanned three or four days before his father. Oh! how much
							suffering is in the best and happiest condition of human existence.</p>

						<p>A man by the name of <persRef ref="sargent-barnard">Barnard

								>President Monroe</persRef> in 1820. to the heirs of <persRef
								ref="sargent-barnard2">his grandfather</persRef>, whose name he
							bears, and who was a soldier in the last War— The heirs besides himself
							are six from all of whom he has Quit claim deeds— The land has been sold
							for twelve dollars for the payment of taxes, though he says he did send
							to some one the money to pay the taxes— The purchaser of the Land
							however, together with a person named <persRef ref="burns-joseph">Joseph
								Burns</persRef>, has proposed to pay him fifty dollars for a Deed in
							which all the right of the grantees should be conveyed to them— He
							shewed me two Letters from Burns, one written last Winter, proposing to
							pay the money through <persRef ref="spangler-david">David
								Spangler</persRef>, their Representative in Congress to me the
							Representative of Sargent, and that the Deed should be transmitted,
							through me to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spangler for them— But in a
							subsequent Letter, he says they have paid the money to <persRef
								ref="cass-lewis">Governor Cass</persRef>, the Secretary of War, and
							requests that the Deeds may be <pb n="40" type="ms"/>transmitted to him—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sargent came to ask for my advice.—
							He said he was willing to give for the fifty dollars a Quit-claim Deed
							for all the heirs, but not a general Warranty. I told him if he would
							bring me such a Quit claim Deed, duly expected, I would send it to a
							person at Washington who would deliver it to Governor Cass, and receive
							from him the Money, which I would then have paid to Sargent— He said he
							would have the Deed made out, and would bring it to me— <persRef

							dined and passed the day. At one O’Clock we had a Meeting of the
							Supervisors of the Adams Temple and School Fund— All the members
							present— It was three years since the last meeting— The principal
							business of this meeting was the preparation of an Indenture of lease
							for one hundred years of a house lot, upon the eight-acre Hancock lot
							given by <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> to the town of
							Quincy— The Deed is of about half an Acre, to a widow, named <persRef
								ref="thayer-betsey">Betsey Thayer</persRef>, but <persRef
								ref="underwood-ebenezer">Captain Underwood</persRef> is building a
							House upon it— The Indentures were drawn, by <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Josiah Quincy
									jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef>— There was some
							discussion upon their purport, and two amendments proposed and adopted—
							Reports were made by a Committee of the board, consisting of <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Greenleaf</persRef> and <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef>, upon several subjects
							referred to them at the last Meeting— The same Committee were continued
							for similar Services— The Indentures as amended are to be executed by
							the Supervisors together with the Selectmen of Quincy, and the Lessee,
							at a future day— The Committee were also authorised to lease verbally a
							small strip of Land at the Babel Pasture, and also to lease the Quarry
							upon reasonable terms. A vote passed also that the Indenture of Lease
							when executed should be recorded upon the Corporation Book— About three
							O’Clock the meeting was dissolved, and the members remained and dined

								Alexander Young jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> Minister
							of the New South Church, Summer-Street. Boston— His morning text was
							from Proverbs 20.27. “The Spirit of Man is the candle of the Lord.” and
							that of the afternoon from Luke 12:6. “Are not five Sparrows sold for
							two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God.” The morning
							discourse was an argument against the prevailing infidelity of the age,
							materialism, and earnestly contended for the separate existence of the
							body and Soul— This distinction is clearly marked both in the old and
							the New Testament—most especially in the Book of Ecclesiastes Chapter
							12. verse 7. where it is said that after death the dust shall return to
							earth as it was: and the spirit shall return to God who gave it— But
								<persRef ref="job">Job</persRef> says that in the flesh he shall see
							God, and <persRef ref="paul">Saint Paul</persRef> expressly affirms the
							resurrection of the Body—a spiritual body—incorruptible, and therefore
							no longer subject to the Laws of matter— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Young’s afternoon Sermon, was an exhortation against cruelty to inferior
							animals—an Article of Christian morality perhaps not sufficiently
							attended to, by many otherwise good men— Cruelty to the brute creation,
							is seldom instigated by Malice or anger, but is the result of wantonness
							or insensibility— It does not belong to the natural disposition of man,
							but is an instinct of depraved nature. <pb n="41" type="ms"/>M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Young had many historical allusions in his
							Sermons, indicating his familiarity with by-paths of Literature, not
							much travelled by his clerical associates of the present age— He
							adverted particularly to the distressing circumstances under which
								<persRef ref="boethius-anicius">Boethius</persRef> wrote his book on
							the Consolation of Philosophy.— He cited also a long passage from
								<persRef ref="milton-john">Milton</persRef> on his blindness; and
							referred to the distressed state of mind of <persRef ref="newton-isaac"
								>Newton</persRef>, towards the close of his life— I read the first
							Sermon of the seventh Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef>, upon Godly Sorrow a subject connected with a

							severely reproved by Saint Paul— There is a mixture of philosophical
							speculation in many of the Sermons of Saurin, which gives to his
							discourses an elaborate character, and sometimes chills the ardour of
							his appeals to the sensibility of his hearers— I read also part of a
							Book of <persRef ref="milman-henry">Milman’s</persRef> History of the
							Jews, a Summary of the Law, delivered from Sinaï, or as Milman himself
							calls it, the Legislature of <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef> in the

							philosophical analysis of this Hebrew Legislation, has not yet fallen in
							my way— It is probably in this Law, that is to be found the principle of
							that unexampled and permanent influence of the Jewish Nation over the
							fortunes and opinions and institutions of the rest of mankind— But in
							what it consists M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Milman has not

						<p>A Summer day of furnace heat— Thermometers in open air above 90. It

							The origin of most, if not all of them is in the Phi Beta Kappa

						<p>Heavy rain, in the Night and when I rose this morning— It poured in
							streams with frequent flashes of Lightening without thunder—after which
							succeeded a gale with beating rain till about 8 O’Clock when it
							subsided— There were two or three light showers in the course of the

							Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> however, returned to
							Boston, leaving his daughter <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">Louisa
								Catherine</persRef> here. I had no aptitude for labour, and wasted

							Not even weeding— But I planted in a cracked, white Earthen Pot. 10.
							Keen Seedling Strawberries. 6. white mulberries and 5. mazzard
							cherry-stones— I had last year remarked the difference of the colour of
							the Earth in the two kinds of my earthen ware flower Pots— One set white
							and glazed— The other merely baked earth of the colour of bricks— The
							white retained longer the moisture of the Earth with which they were
							filled— I have now made the experiment, by pouring a quart of water in
							two of the stands of each kind one pair in a closet of my chamber—the
							other within the porch below— In both instances, the water in the plain
							baked earth was absorbed or evaporated in four or five days, but not in
							the white-glazed ones— I must repeat this experiment with more care and
							attention— I shingle guarded several of my seedlings in the Seminary,
							and topped several of my growing Peach trees— Towards Evening I walked

						<p>The weather has so much influence upon my condition and occupations that

							stand; and one in another brick-coloured stand; to ascertain the
							difference of the time in which the water will evaporate from them—both

						<p><date>18. IV. </date>Saturday.— Sun rose 4:38. Yesterday and this morning
							I saw Venus and Jupiter in conjunction as morning Stars just one sign of
							the Zodiac in precedence of the Sun. By perseverance in writing without
							visiting my garden before breakfast I am enabled to redeem a portion of
							arrears in the last volume of my journal; but if I step outside of the
							House, the day or a large portion of it is lost. At this Season, the
							heat of the Sun makes it almost impossible for me to labour at the
							cultivation of my plants, and I do little more than saunter, over my
							grounds in search of something to observe, and from obtuseness of
							intellect discovering nothing from which I can draw a profitable
							inference— I procured this day four new Earthenware Pots, and in one of
							them planted six fresh mazzard cherry stones—and in its stand, I
							deposited 28 stones of the same kind, which have been six days soaking
							in Water— I discovered one pignut just up in the garden near the
							Jargonel grafted pear tree—one in the Summer house cellar, putting out a
							new shoot from a stem of the last year, so slender, that it had till
							this day escaped my notice, and after an interval of nearly a fortnight
							two Oaks newly up in the seminary— I see the effect of the Sun upon the
							vegetation of the seedling plants— It scorches the leaves, arrests the
							progress of the plumelet, and suspends the active principle of
							vegetation— The leaf turns yellow, curls up, becomes speckled with rusty
							looking spots, and the plant dies— Yet they must have the light of the
							Sun, for they perish alike without it— Of four rows of Apple-seeds and
							Pear cores which in the autumn of 1833 I planted under the young elms at
							the Northern end of my Nursery, scarce half a dozen puny apple and pear
							trees, not one of them six inches high remains. I therefore continue
							shingle guarding my fresh seedlings in the Seminary, and especially see
							the necessity of protecting the young maples— The seed leaves of those
							from Washington have already mostly withered away.— I find in the
							newspaper called We the People, published at Bridgewater, a reply of the
							Whig Anti-mason, to some remarks which had appeared in that paper
							censuring the Political Speculations of the Whig Anti-mason, in the
							Boston Daily Advocate— And in the same number of We the People, the
							first Appeal from the new to the Old Whigs is also republished— I wrote
							to my nephew <persRef ref="adams-john3">J. Q. Adams 2<hi

						<p><date>19. III.45. </date>Sunday— Heard <persRef ref="cunningham-francis"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cunningham</persRef> of
							Dorchester, in the morning, from Luke 15.21. “And the son said unto him,
							Father, I have sinned against Heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more
							worthy to be called thy Son.”— The parable of the prodigal Son. There
							seems to be some danger that the true moral lesson to be learnt from
							this story should be mistaken— In order to draw Sinners to repentance,
							Jesus associated and conversed with them— This became a subject of
							censure and reproach against him, by the Pharisees and scribes; and it
							was in justification of himself that he spoke this parable— He had said
							that he came not to call the righteous but Sinners to repentance— That
							he came to save that which was lost. The purpose of this parable was
							therefore to bring out in the strongest relief the motives and
							inducements to repentance— The repenting Sinner, is thus made the most
							interesting personage of the story— There is something like moroseness
							in the offence taken by the blameless brother, at the affectionate
							kindness with which the returning truant is received by the father; and
							the declaration that there shall be more joy in Heaven over one sinner
							that repenteth than over ninety-nine just persons who need no
							repentance, may be perverted into a recommendation to sin, for the sake
							of after repentance. The object of this discourse was to correct such
							erroneous inferences, and to shew the superiority of condition, and the
							purer blessedness of the just person even over the enjoyments of the
							forgiven penitent— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cunningham’s afternoon
							Sermon was from 2. Peter 3.1. [“]This second Epistle, beloved, I now
							write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of
							remembrance: 2. That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken
							before, by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles
							of the Lord and Saviour.” The discourse was an argument to shew the
							obligation of Christians to make themselves more intimately and
							perfectly acquainted with their religion and its author— There is
							something peculiar in the Style of composition, and in the manner of
							delivery of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cunningham, not pleasing,
							though not offensive— His prayers are too much studied— I took my two
							grand-daughters <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="adams-mary4">Louisa</persRef>, to meeting with me this
							morning— I read the second Sermon of the seventh Volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, upon the Grandeur of the
							Counsels of God, and the abundance of his means—the text is from
							Jeremiah 32.19.— And the preacher remarks upon the extreme difficulties
							with which the Minsters of the word of God have to contend when they are
							obliged to meddle with Politics— Such he says was the case with the
							prophet <persRef ref="jeremiah">Jeremiah</persRef>— This is a curious
							point of view from which that Book, and indeed all the prophesies of the
							old Testament might be considered— I read also the fifth Book of
								<persRef ref="milman-henry">Milman’s</persRef> History of the
							Jews—The Conquest of Canaan— He remarks upon the extreme uncertainty of
							the numbers, as they are noted in the old Testament; and a note at the
							beginning of the fourth Book page 119. leads the reader to the
							conclusion that the author has no faith in the position that the
							emigrant Israelites at the Exodus from Egypt numbered 600,000 fighting
							men— He wishes to retrench a cypher, or at least to take the 600,000 as
							the amount of the whole People— Even these are more numerous, than can
							be well accounted for to inhabit and find subsistence upon a territory
							less than fifty miles wide, and not more than 120 Miles long— It may be
							well to consult <persRef ref="hume-david">Hume’s</persRef> Essay upon
							the populousness of antient Nations.</p>

							finally followed by a Bill— There was in this case a half-year still
							left due; for the bill to run on, but I paid for that also and entered

								ref="palfray-charles">his Son</persRef> the Editor of the Paper that
							it was not from any dissatisfaction with it, but because I was obliged

							subscription and the receiver does not send it back, the publisher shall
							recover against him the price of the Paper, as if he had regularly
							subscribed for it— And upon the strength of this decision many

							Point Alderton. After trying unsuccessfully two places for fishing
							grounds we found one near Cohasset rocks where the fish were in
							abundance, and in the course of two hours we caught about fifty Cod and
							Haddock, of which my own captures were three fine Cod— Soon after two
							O’Clock <pb n="47" type="ms"/>there was a threatening appearance of an
							approaching squall, and it was thought prudent to leave the fishing
							ground, and return into the harbour, to be under the protection of the
							shore— The squall proved however merely a light shower of rain,
							succeeded by a fresh and pleasant breeze, and a clear sky— We dined upon
							Chowder and fried fish, after two luncheons of Cold roast, and salt
							Beef, Ham and Tongue, with Madeira, Sherry, Champagne, and Haut-Brion

							my companions, went to <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							House, and sent him the key of his Office, which he had lent me, and

						<p>The day was clear, and a bright Sun shone unclouded from morn to eve. The
							temperature of the atmosphere was mild and calm, with occasional light
							breezes— My principal concern was to shelter my seedlings in the
							Seminary, where my Philadelphia maple at the corner next the gate, first
							opens its sixth pair of leaves— It is just one Month since its first

							the others have grown so rapidly, and those from the Washington trees,
							give little promise of life— I gathered a quart of ripe thimbleberries,
							from the wine in my Nursery, and broke up a Nest of black caterpillars
							upon the willow in the Summer house cellar, and one of mouse coloured
							downy-haired Caterpillars upon my old Shagbark tree; also a tip stem

							it for granted he is the contractor to erect or furnish the materials
							for the building— I told him that not being an Episcopalian, and not
							residing in Bridgewater, I had no occasion for a pew there; upon which

							me: he came accordingly this morning with <persRef ref="u">his

							been much correspondence upon the subject of instituting a National
							Literary and Scientific Academy at New-York; a project upon which I had
							attended a Literary convention there in October 1831. That he should
							wish to exhibit this correspondence to me, as there were many
							distinguished Gentlemen, particularly of the South, who were desirous of
							carrying this purpose into effect— I did not decline the inspection of
							the Correspondence, but he alluded to the reluctance and aversion which
							I had found in Philadelphia to the promotion of this Scheme, four years
							ago, and of which I had informed him— It satisfied me, that if an
							Institution, like that projected by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Matthews was ever to be accomplished it must be in an after age, and
							when the Sciences shall be more ardently cultivated than they are in
							this Country at the present time— I did not say to D<hi

							of all the Sciences of calculation and of Speculation, made me unfit to
							be at the Head of such an Institution, and that my age unfits me for any
							undertaking the usefulness of which depends upon the efficient ardour,
							constant exertion and undiscourageable perseverance with which it is
							pursued. I am drawing close upon the verge of seventy— I have done
							nothing, I have no ability to do any thing that will live in the Memory
							of mankind— My life has been spent in vain and idle aspirations, and in
							ceaseless <pb n="50" type="ms"/>rejected prayers, that something should
							be the result of my existence beneficial to my own Species— It is time

						<p><date>26. IV. </date>Sunday:— Heard <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> in the morning from 1
							Peter 3.15. “But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready
							always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the
							hope that is in you, with meekness and fear.” The Sermon was an argument
							to shew that religion was natural to the human mind— That it was one of
							the necessities of man’s nature, and so no doubt it is— The dilemma to
							which the human mind is reduced appears to be this— Matter exists from
							all eternity, or there is a first cause existing from eternity—now it is
							more difficult to conceive of the eternal existence of matter, than of a
							predisposing creating cause—intelligent of cause and effect— When we ask
							ourselves whence and how this material creation came into existence, the
							very conception which enables us to ask the question is an attribute not
							pertaining to matter. Why do we ask ourselves the question? why are we
							capable of conceiving the ideas of a Creator of eternity, of our own
							existence before our birth, and after our death— Why is it that upon the
							Planet which we inhabit, there is but one animal, of the innumerable
							multitudes which swarm upon it endowed with the faculty of reason? That
							this Planet has not existed many thousand years, or at least that the
							animal Man has not been more than fifty or sixty centuries a dweller
							upon it is certain— The conception and desire of future existence, are
							the foundation of religion; and we say, the Creator is benevolent— He
							gives existence for enjoyment— If he has bounded our existence by the
							present life, why has he made us conceive of, and wish for another? The
							brute creation have no such conception—no such desire— They enjoy their
							existence while it lasts, without hope or fear of futurity— Man then is
							a religious animal—but what is the inference from this; and what is the
							true religion?— This must be the subject of another Discourse— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lunt’s afternoon Sermon was from Matthew
							13.31. [“]Another parable put he forth unto them, saying the kingdom of
							Heaven, is like to a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took and sowed
							in his field: 32. Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is
							grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the
							birds of the air come, and lodge in the branches thereof.” This was upon
							the universality of the Christian Religion— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt gave notice that the Communion would be administered
							next Sunday— <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna;adams-louisa3">three
								children</persRef> went to meeting this morning; and I took
							Mary-Louisa with me this afternoon— I read the 3<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> Sermon of the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Volume of
								<persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, upon the compassions
							of God— This is one of the most remarkable Discourses of the whole
							collection, and which would deserve to be studied with close Meditation—
							The doctrine that divine Mercy, must be always understood as an
							attribute harmonizing, with other attributes, and that the perfection of
							omnipotence consists in this harmony, leads to many important
							reflections— There is a mere glancing at the Trinity as if the <pb
								n="51" type="ms"/>Preacher felt that it belonged to his subject, but
							dared not approach it— I read a few pages of <persRef ref="milman-henry"
								>Milman’s</persRef> History of the Jews, and completed the copy into
							my last volume of Diary, of the rubbish notes I had taken from 10.
							January to 31. March 1833— This was the anniversary of my wedding day,
							and I made my Grand-daughter Mary-Louisa begin with it the reading of

							duly impressed with the indispensable necessity of shading the seedlings
							of the present year, though I have lost, within the last seven years at
							least a thousand trees by neglecting that caution— I have hitherto paid
							little attention to the old fruit trees—some of which bear almost every
							year with great profusion— I have now had them trimmed and their dead
							limbs taken off— The progress of the young fruit trees in the garden is
							excessively slow, and that of the young forest trees as rapid— There is
							a young Pear tree, from a sucker of an old stump bark bound in which for
							the last five or six years I have every year opened a slit in the bark—
							It shews a green and thrifty top, but is still bark-bound, and bears no
							fruit— I had it this day washed, and the Earth loosened round its roots—
							The Philadelphia Maple at the corner of the Seminary opens its seventh
							pair of leaves, and is nine inches high— The growth of all the rest is
							comparatively slow— I sowed Cheat and Melon-Seeds at the North east
							corner of the Seminary, and staked a twig of willow next the new pignut
							in the Honey-locust patch— After dinner I sent to <persRef

							commemorate—upon the abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia,
							upon which there is a partial agitation, in this part of the Country at

						<p>Copious showers all the morning, at first with Thunder and Lightening—

							Chambery, came as a mendicant, with certificates and recommendations
							engrossed upon parchment and also printed— He was coming to settle in

							Thence by the charity of a benevolent Captain of a merchant vessel he
							obtained a free passage to this country, and now roams about for
							contributions to enable him to go back to Chambery and bring his family
							here— There is a class of beggars of this description constantly
							wandering about the Country; all having nearly the same story to tell;
							and all armed with certificates and recommendations from Clergymen, and
							Magistrates and Consuls and other official personages, who pay their own
							tribute thus, by taxing others for money— <persRef ref="spear-alpheus"
								>My tenant of the mount Wollaston farm</persRef> came this evening
							to speak about the renewal of his lease which expires on the next 31<hi

							dollars a year for the rent of the place, and for that would give him a
							lease for five years defeasible by either party with one year’s notice—
							He said he could not afford to give that rent. I replied that he might
							take his own time for consideration, and then make me an offer— He
							objected to this, for fear that somebody should offer more than he could
							give; but I told him, I had made him a specific offer—if it did not suit
							him, he must either say what would, or quit the place— Well he said that
							was fair enough, and began to talk of repairs, and improvements, and
							putting the farm in order— I said he must let me know what he wanted in
							this respect, and what it would cost. He asked me to go down upon the
							farm, and said he would shew me, what he should wish to have done. I
							promised to go next Saturday afternoon, if the weather should be fair
							and cool— I heard <persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">my

							of my Diary— Paid a short visit to my Garden and Nursery; and read

						<p><date>30. IV:10 </date>Thursday— Foggy morning— Afternoon Shower— Evening
							clear</p>
						<p>I wrote a short Letter to <persRef ref="sullivan-george">George
								Sullivan</persRef>, declining to deliver the anniversary Address to
							the American Institute of the City of New-York next October— The
							multiplication of these Addresses, Orations and Discourses, of late
							years has made them all somewhat cheap— They give a peculiar character
							to the Literature of the Country— I am sometimes doubtful, whether I
							might not have rendered some service to the community by accepting
							occasionally some of those invitations; and particularly whether I might
							not have employed my time more usefully this Summer, by delivering three
							or four of the score of Orations and Addresses, for which I have been
							solicited, than by wasting it as I am, in mere copying from loose sheets
							into a bound book my own dull diary— So it is that I am never satisfied
							with myself— I had this day no interruption of visitors, but heard
								<persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">my
								Grandchildren</persRef> read twice— Spent three of the best hours of
							the day, in my Garden, Nursery and Seminary, and performed rather more
							than my average daily task of copying, because I was able to write after
							dinner— I had sowed some of the earliest strawberries ripe, on the 22<hi
								rend="superscript">d</hi> of June—yesterday I gathered a few of the
							latest, and of these, sowed eleven this day in the Summer house Cellar,
							across from the willow tree, to the row of pignuts— The young Pear tree
							about the centre of the Garden bears well this year—and this day some of
							its fruit was first ripe— I see the first leaves of currant bushes,
							along under the fence at the North end of my Nursery. Nothing else will
							grow there, under the shade of the English Oaks and Elms.</p>

							These papers contain a critical review of <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
								>Daniel Webster’s</persRef> last Winters Speech upon <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">J. C. Calhoun’s</persRef> Patronage Bill— Since
							the existence of the Government of the United States, there has not been
							so dangerous an assault upon the Constitution, as that Bill, which
							actually passed the Senate, at the last Session of Congress— Webster’s
							Speech in its favour carried it through— That Speech has been thoroughly
							exposed, and the principles of the Constitution have been indicated in
							these papers written entirely by my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef>— They have been published simultaneously in the
							Advocate, and in the Centinel, but have hitherto been unnoticed by any
							attempt of Webster or his friends to answer them— They are republished,
							in the Anti-masonic Newspapers at Bridgewater in Plymouth County and at
							Concord in Middlesex; but on the part of the new whigs have as yet been
