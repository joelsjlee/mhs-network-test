						<p>I resumed and finished the preparation of my Administration account, as

							concerning the granite quarries at Quincy— <persRef

							with a Bill of Estimates for the repairs of the House in the

						<p>There is an erosion upon Time which I never can arrest. I intended to
							have taken my account to the Orphan’s Court this morning; but two
							O’Clock came, and although I had done nothing, I was yet in my chamber.
							I took my four Orations and three Reports composed since 1831. to the
							Book-binders, and left them there to be bound in a Volume— I had one
							Volume of my compositions bound before The Silesian Letters and the
							Lectures on Rhetoric and Oratory form three other Volumes.— A complete
							collection of what I have printed would form one, or two volumes more— I
							am collecting other pamphlets to be bound.— They accumulate excessively
							upon my hands, and the proportion of them that deserve to be preserved
							is not very great. The selection is no easy, and a very tiresome task. I
							called at the fourth Auditor’s Office, and saw <persRef
								ref="johnson-robert">Robert Johnson</persRef>, a Clerk there, and
							Treasurer of the Columbian College to enquire respecting the interest
							due upon their bond to me, of which there are nearly two years due— He
							said he hoped to receive funds from <persRef ref="rice-luther">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rice</persRef> very soon but had none
							at present— I told him that I was going in a few days to leave the City
							for the Summer, and must before my departure discharge certain debts— If
							I could not receive the interest due to me from the College I should be
							obliged to borrow money and pay interest upon it; to indemnify me for
							which I must claim interest upon the arrears due more than a year from
							the college— He said this was reasonable and he believed the Trustees of
							the College would be willing to pay it— I said I should write to him on
							the subject next week— I then called at <persRef ref="giusta-antoine">M.
								A. Giusta’s</persRef>, and gave him directions for bottling my Cask
							of wine; at <persRef ref="smith-walter">Walter Smith’s</persRef> Store,
							in Georgetown, about the first of August, which he promised— He offered
							me a loan of one thousand dollars for a year at 5 per cent interest—
							Walked round the Capitol Hill— Directed <persRef ref="borland-alexander"
								>Borland</persRef> to make the repairs required by <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs </hi>Wolfenden</persRef> at the
							House on Pennsylvania Avenue— <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Kuhl</persRef> was here also and at his solicitation I
							authorised him to make repairs to the amount of <unclear>. . .</unclear>
							dollars in the Shop which he is to occupy at 12 1/2 dollars a month from
							this day— A man by the name of <persRef ref="u">Edwards</persRef> was
							here this afternoon with <persRef ref="u">Riggles</persRef> and engaged
							the house next to <persRef ref="carbery-thomas">Carbery’s</persRef> at 5
							dollars a <pb n="549" type="ms"/>month for the present— <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boyle</persRef> came to enquire
							what was the cost of the granite steps at the House in F. Street which
							my Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> procured at Quincy and
							had brought round here, but I was not able to tell him— He said he
							wanted steps for the entrance to his own house, and had concluded to
							procure them of the Quincy granite. He had written to Boston to enquire
							the price of procuring it, but had not received an entirely satisfactory
							answer— I answered this Evening two Letters accepting the election of
							honorary member of Literary Societies in the La Fayette College at
							Easton Pennsylvania, and at the University of Vermont at Burlington.</p>

							that impressiveness in the discourse which could leave the memory of it

							directed the distribution among the members of the Society of a number
							of Copies of <persRef ref="doddridge-philip2">Doddridges</persRef> Rise
							and progress, and of <persRef ref="baxter-richard2">Baxter’s</persRef>

							read the Service for the second Sunday after Easter, and preached from

									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bancroft’s</persRef> Volume, on
							the doctrine of universal restoration, against which he pronounces a

							how?— <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>
							declares whoever makes the enquiry a fool— A state of existence after

							from death— Believing this we must trust the ruler with his skies—</p>

						<p>My old crazy acquaintance from Fauquier County Virginia <persRef
								ref="wallace-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wallace</persRef>
							called upon me, while we were at Breakfast this morning, and I found by
							his conversation that his eccentricities are growing upon him— His right
							hand was cruelly scarred from wounds not yet well healed and which he
							told me were caused by a wolf he had caught to keep tame. He wished to
							ascertain what would be the operation of his nature in a famished state—
							So he kept him two days without food, and having killed a lamb he had
							smeared his arms and his bosom with its blood, and then went to the
							wolf— The animal at the first moment made a desperate leap at his
							throat, but he warded him off with a stroke of his arm— The wolf then
							flew at his arm, and fastened his teeth in the fleshy <pb n="550"
								type="ms"/>part of his arm; but with his right hand he broke off his
							hold, and the wolf then drove his teeth into the hand— He on his hand
							drove his fist down the wolf’s throat, forcing him to open his jaws, and
							then jammed his head to the side of wall, till he completely mastered
							him, and flung him off disabled— I asked him if he kept the wolf
							afterwards as a social <unclear>inmate</unclear>—he said not long— He
							had wanted his hide to be tanned— I asked him how his rattlesnake family
							were now— He said the rattlesnake was the most perfect gentleman in the
							world— He never made offensive War, and always gave notice of his
							purpose of self defence— I asked him how the Elections were going in
							Virginia— He said he took no interest in them, and had nothing to do
							with them. But that from what he heard there would be a large majority
							in the Legislature in favour of the Administration, and of the New-York
							man, <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef>. He said he
							wanted to have the power to make three Laws— 1. The total abolition of
							Slavery throughout the world— 2. The abolition of all coercive legal
							process for the recovery of debts—and 3. a Law by which persons ill
							sorted in marriage and disagreeing might be separated— He was very
							declamatory upon all three points, and very intolerant of interruption—
							I contested only the third of his projects, which I thought would
							operate entirely against the woman. He told me he was going to attend a
							sick woman at Point comfort— His eye looks unusually wild, and he has
							little sanity of mind left— At the Department of State I made an
							exchange with <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">Asbury Dickins</persRef> the
							Chief Clerk, of two old Sessions pamphlet Acts of Congress for two that
							I wanted to make up a volume— <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsythe</persRef> left the City this
							morning for a short visit to Georgia, by the way of New-York— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickens spoke much of prospects of change
							in our relations with China, consequent upon the extinction of the
							English East-India Company, and the general opening of the China trade
							to the English Merchants— He said the English Merchants at Canton had
							got into a quarrel with the Chinese Government, and were urging their
							own to assume a hostile attitude, and bring the Chinese to terms by
							force— He thought they might succeed; but I did not— I settled the
							accounts of <persRef key="adams-john2">my deceased Son</persRef> at
								<persRef ref="cox-william3">W. Cox’s</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="kinchy-paul">P Kinchy’s</persRef>, and called to ask for his
							account at <persRef ref="clagett-darius">Clagett’s</persRef>— Then I
							took my drafted account to the Orphan’s Court, to ascertain if it was in
							due form— <persRef ref="neale-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Neil</persRef> the Register told me that all the vouchers, whether
							Accounts, notes, or bonds must be authenticated under Oath of the
							Creditors before a Magistrate— I then called on <persRef
								ref="tayloe-benjamin">B. O. Tayloe</persRef>, and requested him to
							make Oath to the account which I had settled with him in January, which
							he readily promised— I sent him the account this Evening— There was a
							heavy thundergust which confined me to the house the remnant of the
							day.</p>

						<p>I was engaged in one of the most tedious and dispiriting operations in
							the world; that of sweeping off from my bookshelves and out of the house
							waggon-loads of pamphlets and old newspapers— The numbers of them that
							accumulate from day <pb n="551" type="ms"/>to day, and from week to week
							are incredible— To tear them all up and use them as waste paper savours
							too much of the Vandal, to keep them all makes loads of lumber, and
							finally choaks up the house; besides adding imprudently to the danger of
							fire— I have now files of nearly one hundred different newspapers—and of
							as many periodical magazines, Reviews, and Journals of every sort and
							description; besides Addresses, Eulogies, Orations, Discourses, Sermons,
							Dissertations, Poems, and Plays without number—nine tenths of them fit
							for nothing but to be burnt— And yet some of them are very valuable— To
							select the wheat from the chaff is an excruciating task— I went to the
							Union Bank at Georgetown, with the three Notes that I had taken up
							during the winter and asked <persRef ref="english-david">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> English</persRef> the Cashier to make
							the necessary affidavit before a magistrate, to obtain their allowance
							by the <persRef ref="chase-samuel2">judge of the Orphan’s
								Court</persRef>, which he promised to do— I then went to the Capitol, and proposed
							to <persRef ref="follansbee-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Follansbee</persRef>, who has charge of the Public Documents, to
							send him a waggon load of them from my Treasures; and which he said he
							would very gratefully accept. I came home, and agreed with <persRef
								ref="giusta-antoine">M. Antoine Giusta</persRef>, to borrow a
							thousand dollars of him for a year at five per Cent interest; which will
							be necessary for me to pay off a remnant of debt here and for travelling

								Hellen’s</persRef> two children, a <persRef ref="hellen-benjamin"
								>boy</persRef> and a <persRef ref="hellen-josephine">girl</persRef>
							were here to spend the day and dined with ours— There was again a heavy
							thunder shower this afternoon which confined me to the house; and I had
							a painful tooth-ache and swollen cheek which has been three days coming
							on.</p>

								<persRef ref="burnett-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							and <persRef ref="derby-richard">Richard Derby</persRef>—and at <persRef ref="kinchy-paul">Kinchy’s</persRef>—
							Called at the Franklin Insurance Company, for the dividend on my Stock

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph H. Bradley</persRef> the
							Secretary informed me that the Directors had determined before paying my
							dividend, to call for new endorsers upon all my security notes, and he
							gave me a Letter that he had written to me to that effect. I told him I
							questioned the authority of the Directors to require new endorsers— He
							asked me to write to the Directors, and state to them my desire not to
							give further endorsers which I promised to do— I walked then to the
							Capitol, and promised <persRef ref="follansbee-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Follansbee</persRef> to send him a
							waggon load of old documents— After I came home <persRef
								ref="giusta-antoine">M. A. Giusta</persRef> was here and told me he
							had deposited to my credit one thousand dollars at the U.S. Branch Bank;
							for which I gave him my note, payable within a year, upon interest at

								Howard</persRef> the Commissioner was the person who had suggested
							the omission of the allowance for the variation of the compass, as a

								<persRef ref="tayloe-benjamin">B. O. Tayloe’s</persRef> account,

							experience I have had, I should decline to pay any demand in future,
							till after a certificate upon it from the register that it will be
							admitted— This has been done in several of the cases of claims, and with
							this judge;—it should always be done— He is scrupulous overmuch— More
							than any other judge of the Orphans Courts in Maryland— His integrity
							however is unquestioned. I called next at the <persRef
								ref="bradley-william">Mayor’s</persRef> Office, and received from
							him a Deed of Square 592 under the sale for taxes in 1826— He returned
							me also the two Deeds from <persRef ref="tyler-benjamin">B. O.
								Tyler</persRef> to me of 29. March 1820 and 8. Feb<hi
								rend="superscript">y</hi> 1821. Tyler’s title was from the
							Corporation itself— But the legality of the sale being questioned by
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-james">James Greenleaf</persRef>, the Square
							was again sold for taxes in 1826. and bought in by my Son <persRef
								key="adams-john2">John</persRef> for me— The surplus beyond the
							amount due for the taxes was bid up high by James Greenleaf who attended
							the Sale; but my title being from the Corporation, the surplus was of
							course payable to me. The Mayor gave me accordingly a check on the
							Patriotic Bank, signed by him and countersigned by the Register <persRef
								ref="hewitt-william">Hewitt</persRef>, for 472:32. payable to my
							order and which I endorsed— He said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							James Greenleaf might make a suit of it in Chancery— I took the deed to
							the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court <persRef ref="brent-w"
								>William Brent</persRef>, and left it to be recorded— I went next to
							the Capitol, and looked at the copy of the map reported 8 March 1820 to
							the House of Representatives, by <persRef key="monroe-james">President
								Monroe</persRef>, of the boundary of Ohio and Michigan, as surveyed
							under the act of Congress of 20. May 1812. There was no report from the

							I spoke with <persRef ref="follansbee-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Follansbee</persRef> upon the Waggon load of Documents
							that I have sent him, and of those which I am still to send— I walked
							home, gathering some Elm and Maple seeds on the way— After dinner
							towards Evening I returned the visit of <persRef ref="cass-lewis"
								>Governor Cass</persRef>, the Secretary of War—and had about an hour
							of miscellaneous conversation with him— <persRef ref="cass-elizabeth"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Cass</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="u">one of his daughters</persRef> were there— He spoke of the
							news from France as flattering; and of the accounts from the border war
							between Ohio and Michigan; as very threatening and dangerous.— I went

							of April 1812. and on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
								May—<persRef ref="tiffin-edward">Edward Tiffin</persRef> of Ohio was

								Meigs</persRef> was appointed Surveyor General, and on the 10<hi

							places—Meigs being appointed Commissioner of the General Land Office,
							and Tiffin Surveyor General— On the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of
							May 1812. Congress passed an act to authorise the President of the
							United States to ascertain and designate certain boundaries— This act
							directed the surveyor general under the direction of the President, as
							soon as the consent of the Indians could be obtained, to cause to be
							surveyed the western and northern boundary of Ohio, bordering on the
							Territories of Indiana and Michigan, agreeably to the Act of 30. April
							1802 for admitting Ohio into the Union; and to cause to be made a plat
							or plan of the boundary line from the Southern extreme of Lake Michigan
							to Lake Erie— Upon this Survey nothing was done, till 1815 when under an
							order from the Commissioner of the General Land-Office, the Surveyor
							General, employed a man named <persRef ref="harris-william2"
								>Harris</persRef>, who instead of running a line according to the
							Acts of Congress, ran it according to the line proposed in the
							Constitution of the State of Ohio— This line of course was not
							approved—but in 1818. under a new order from the Commissioner of the
							Land Office, the Surveyor General employed a person named <persRef
								ref="fulton-john2">Fulton</persRef> (Harris having declined, under a
							plea of inadequate compensation[)]— Fulton’s line is the one which was
							reported in March 1820, by President Monroe, to Congress— There are
							however several errors in this which require further clearing up— The
							most extraordinary circumstance of all is the wilful deviation of
							Harris, from the line prescribed by the Acts of Congress, to the line
							requested by the Constitution of Ohio.— There were shewn to me, several
							Letters, between the Commissioner of the general Land-Office, the
							Surveyor General, and the Governor of Michigan, then <persRef
								ref="cass-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Cass</persRef>— I

						<p>I have something like a whitlow coming at the first joint of the

							These infirmities come upon me in thick succession; warning me that it
							is time for me to withdraw from the world of bustling action— I have

								<pb n="556" type="ms"/>had some conversation with the Secretary,
								<persRef ref="cass-lewis">Cass</persRef>, upon the boundary question
							between Ohio and Michigan— He had on his table a Report from the
								<persRef ref="hayward-elijah">Commissioner</persRef> of the general

								>Harris</persRef> who drew the line from the South bend of Lake

							due East to Lake Erie; but about E.N.E. to the North cape of Maumee
							Bay—that is precisely the claim of Ohio— He said Tiffin had been
							President of the Convention which formed the Constitution of Ohio and
							afterwards Governor of the State—that he was an honest man, but had
							mistaken the import of the act of Congress— He shewed me also <persRef
								ref="talcott-george">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

							suspended— The Commissioners of Ohio employed to run the line within the

							escaped nine men of their party were arrested, and lodged in prison in

							but by an act of unequivocal war— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cass
							said the Report from the Commissioner of the general Land Office, with

								<persRef ref="fendall-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fendall</persRef> several books which he had lent me some years
							since; and called at the Office of the Register of Wills with my

							at the Office of the Franklin Insurance Company and spoke with the
							Secretary <persRef ref="bradley-joseph">Joseph H. Bradley</persRef> of
							their dividend and of the demand of the Directors for new endorsers upon
							the Contingent notes— He said he had not been able to get a meeting of
							the Directors since my answer to his last Letter, but he would make
							another effort before I should go away— At the Office of the Register of

							of Congress the only book which I had not already returned and that was
							the Works of <persRef ref="filmer-robert">Sir Robert Filmer</persRef>— I

							hardly remove him for that— The Laws of the Territory had as yet proved
							sufficient for their own vindication. If they should not the Laws of the
							United States prescribed the mode in which the President must interfere—
							He thought the prospect very unpromising— Towards Evening I called at

							told him I had been compelled to borrow money upon which I was paying

							College would relieve me— And that I should be under the necessity of
							claiming interest on the arrears of the College if they should continue—
							He promised to obtain as soon as possible a meeting of the Trustees, and
							to let me know the result— I proceeded to the Capitol, and in the
								<persRef ref="franklin-walter">Clerk’s</persRef> Office, obtained a
							copy of the Memorial from the Legislature of Ohio, to Congress,

							round the Capitol, a small handful of fallen seeds— The tree has borne
							this year very full, and the seeds are now all fallen; under the tree
							there were a few, which had just come up, the cotyledons being just
							opened— This ascertains that the seeds of the Maple like those of the

							years since. The garden is on the banks of the Schuylkill, not half a
							mile beyond the bridge, and opposite the landing place of the Coal from
							the mines. Carr said that some days since 123 vessels passed through the
							draw of the Bridge in one day. I was at this Bridge with the other

							passed away and I should now not have known the place again. A little

						<p>I wrote a Letter to my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> to advise him of my being here, and of my hope to
							reach home this day week, or the day after. Received two Notes from
								<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>—one
							an invitation to dinner to-morrow— I called at his house but not finding
							him at home left word that I was engaged for to-morrow, but would call
							again to see him— Returned <persRef ref="binney-horace">H.
								Binney’s</persRef> visit, but he was not at home. Called to see
								<persRef ref="duponceau-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Du
								Ponceau</persRef> and spent an hour of pleasant conversation with
							him— He told me of a learned Mexican who had entirely overthrown his
							system that all the languages of the North American Indians was
							Polysyllabic, by proving that there is a tribe of Indians in Mexico who
							speak a monosyllabic language, resembling in many of its characteristic
							properties, and in multitude of words, the Chinese. Duponceau much to my
							astonishment had never heard of <persRef ref="baratier-jean">John Philip
								Barretier</persRef>. I read to him part of the Article upon Baratier
							in <persRef ref="lempriere-john">Lempriere’s</persRef> Biographical
							Dictionary— I visited also <persRef ref="kretschmar-frederick">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Kretschmar</persRef> the translator of
							my Oration upon the Life and Character of <persRef ref="lafayette">La
								Fayette</persRef>— I found him keeping a circulating library, and
							Store of Music and Musical Instruments at N. 70 South third Street— He
							is a young Westphalian 29 or 30 years of age, who says he has served in
							the Prussian Artillery six years and has been five years in this
							Country; preferring a useful occupation in a free country, to military
							idleness in an absolute monarchy. He says he has succeeded so well in
							this Country that he expects <persRef ref="u">his father</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="u">mother</persRef> and their family to come over this
							year to join him and settle in this Country. He sent me his manuscript
							translation to read. I called upon <persRef ref="rundle-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Rundle</persRef> and received
							192 dollars for six dividends since April 1832 on the Schuylkill bridge
							stock. Visited with <persRef ref="hopkinson-joseph">judge
								Hopkinson</persRef> the Academy of fine Arts, and saw the Pictures
							and Statues.— The only novelty is in the yard, a headless Colossal
							Statue, said to be of <persRef ref="ceres">Ceres</persRef> and near
							three thousand years old brought by <persRef ref="creighton-john"
								>Captain Creighton</persRef> from Megara.— We dined with <persRef

								>Moore’s</persRef> Melodies; but not with Common Sense one day— His

								<persRef ref="willing-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef>, daughter of
								<persRef ref="willing-richard">Richard Willing</persRef>—just
							sixteen—a child ripening into woman—exquisitely beautiful— <persRef

							with them, first to the garden and green-house of <persRef
								ref="pratt-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry
								Pratt</persRef>, on the banks of the Schuylkill, where were a
							profusions of flowers in bloom, and a multitude of Plants and trees—with
							three or four small fish ponds— It is curious only as a garden of
							Plants, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pratt, the proprietor keeps
							it at a very heavy expense, but without ever residing at the place—
							There were Lemon and Orange-trees in full bearing—and gold and silver
							fish and tadpoles, embryo frogs in the Ponds.— We then went to Belmont
							the former Residence of <persRef ref="peters-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Peters’s father</persRef>, and where
							in October 1824. I met and dined with <persRef ref="lafayette">General
								La Fayette</persRef>; but the place is now occupied by a farmer and
							his family, and the mansion is going to decay— The most observable thing
							left there is the Spring house, where the milk is kept on a brick floor
							in pans surrounded by the water of a running stream— I took a tumbler
							full of the milk which was good, but not equal to that of the ruined
							Castle at Töplitz. We then went to the viaduct across the Schuylkill,
							and the inclined plane of the Columbia rail-road— It rises 182 feet in a
							distance of 2840— Several small waggons or cars variously loaded with
							pine fire-wood, with pine planks, with a small family and their
							household furniture, were drawn up, or let down upon this plane, while
							we were there— We returned to the City— I wrote a short Letter to
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, from whom I
							had received one this morning— We dined at <persRef

								Chapman</persRef> was at the table. We had conversation, more upon
							political topics than at any of the preceding parties. Much upon

						<p><persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fairman</persRef> came
							this morning, and I went with him to the Unitarian Church, and heard
								<persRef ref="channing-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Channing</persRef> of Boston, who preached from Matthew 22.36.37.
							[“]and Jesus said unto him thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all
							thy heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy mind” These words he
							said suggested a great variety of considerations; but he should now
							confine himself to one, which was that Religion was natural and
							congenial to the heart of man— That it was peculiar to the constitution
							of human nature to trace the connection between cause and effect. He
							enlarged upon this idea with a great variety of illustrations, but
							without explaining precisely what Jesus meant by the command to his
							disciples to love God—nor what he himself meant by Religion. His whole
							discourse impliedly treated the Love of God, and Religion as identical—
							But his argument left much to question, and much to be explained— The
							house was crowded almost to suffocation.— After Church we called at
								<persRef ref="walsh-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Walsh’s</persRef>, and he engaged me to dine with him— <persRef
								ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Biddle</persRef> declined, and rode out of town in the afternoon— I
							dined with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walsh and his family; <persRef
								ref="u">his eldest Son</persRef>, and four elder daughters— <persRef
								ref="harper-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								Harper</persRef> of Baltimore, was the only guest except me— There
							were many visitors after dinner, among whom, <persRef ref="vaughan-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Vaughan</persRef>, who
							engaged me to breakfast with him Tuesday morning at half past seven.
								<persRef ref="jaudon-samuel;jaudon-marguerite">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Jaudon</persRef> with a small boy, were also there, and a young man
							named <persRef ref="u">Williams</persRef>, a writer in the American
							quarterly Review. I took a walk towards Sunset with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Walsh, his eldest daughter, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams— On returning to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddle’s at nine, I found a Letter from
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> requiring an
							immediate answer which I wrote and sent.— I had already received and
							answered one this morning— My situation is becoming irksome from a
							conscious feeling of idleness, and of getting to be a burdensome inmate
							in my friend’s house. I long to be moving homewards, and to return to
							occupations which may be useful to my family or to myself— I looked this
							Evening into <persRef ref="lee-henry3">Henry Lee’s</persRef> Life of
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef>, and soon
							sickened with disgust at what I read. Napoleon was a Harlequin Emperor
							and King— Lee is a Scaramouch Biographer— I think I shall never read as
							much more of his book, as I read this Evening.</p>

							ultimately prevail, by obtaining the full measure of Justice, required

						<p><date>29. IV:45. </date>Friday— From Philadelphia to New-York; and
							Steamer President, Long-Island Sound.</p>
						<p>At six O’Clock this morning we embarked in the Steamboat at Philadelphia,
							and at a quarter before nine, landed at Bordentown, where the Railway
							Cars took us up— The family occupying one division of a Car— At half
							past eleven we reached Amboy, and there entered the other Steamer which
							landed us at New-York, at five minutes before two. At an adjoining wharf
							lay the Steamboat President, <persRef ref="bunker-es">Captain E. S.
								Bunker</persRef>, and without waiting to pass a Night in New-York,
							we only passed from one boat to the other— I took a walk into Broad way,
							and viewed the walls of the large Hotel, of Quincy Granite, which
								<persRef ref="astor-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Jacob
								Astor</persRef> is building; the walls of which are now at the fifth
							Story— I met in the Street <persRef ref="wilde-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Richard H. Wilde</persRef>, late a
							member of the House of Representatives of the United States from
							Georgia, who is going to England. On the passage from Philadelphia to
							New-York, I met with no old acquaintance—but a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hart</persRef>, who landed at
							Burlington, a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Harris</persRef> who landed at Elizabethtown, and a <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hotchkiss</persRef> of
							New-Haven, accosted me as having seen me before, and had each some
							conversation with me. In the Steamboat President I met <persRef
								ref="potts-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Potts</persRef> the
							member of Congress from Pennsylvania, the <persRef
								ref="wainwright-jonathan">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Doctor
								Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright</persRef> of Boston, and <persRef
								ref="tilden-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph

								<persRef ref="wainwright-peter">father</persRef> was also at the
							boat to take leave of his Son; with whom he has been spending the Winter
							at Boston. He is now upon his return to England, where he resides at
							twelve miles distance from Liverpool—going in the Packet, to sail on the
							first of next month— I think I <unclear>had</unclear> not seen him,
							since I dined with him at his house in Cambridge, in July 1809— His Son
							was then about closing the term of his Freshman year at the University—
								<persRef ref="wainwright-elizabeth">His wife</persRef>, <persRef
								key="adams-abigail">my mother</persRef> and <persRef
								key="adams-thomas">brother</persRef> were all at that dinner— It was
							the day, on which I delivered the last of my Lectures on Rhetoric and
							Oratory— What changes and Revolutions since that day! Twenty-six years
							of interval have added furrows to his brows and to mine— We now met and
							parted with much cordiality. At 5 O’Clock the boat left the wharf, with
							fair weather and a gentle breeze, and before dark were in Long Island
							Sound, our Boat’s motion being much retarded— One of her engines is out
							of order so that it cannot be worked— In the course of the Evening, I
							had various conversation, with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Potts,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tilden, and D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Wainwright, till between ten and eleven O’Clock when I
							retired to my State room to bed. I bought a shaving-brush at New-York

						<p><date>30. V:15. </date>Saturday.— From off Block Island to Providence and
							Quincy.</p>
						<p>The night was fine, and the water smooth— The Steamer limped along at the
							rate of ten miles an hour, and on rising this morning, after a night of
							sound Sleep, very unusual for me in a Steamboat, I found her opposite
							Block Island, with a heavy swell, though with a calm Sea. Most of the
							Lady and children Passengers, and some of the men were sick—we came
							round point Judith about eight O’Clock; passed the Newport Light House
							at nine—landed the Newport Passengers at about 1/2 past nine—took in
								<persRef ref="amory-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nathaniel Amory</persRef> who resides at Newport, but was going to
							Boston—and landed at Providence at Noon, just in time to see the other
							Steamer depart for New-York— I wrote a few lines to my Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> to inform him that we hoped
							to reach Quincy this Evening, and gave them to <persRef
								ref="wainwright-jonathan">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Wainwright</persRef> who promised to send them immediately after his
							arrival at Boston— I took at Providence a whole Stage for my own family
							to bring us immediately to Quincy. At half past twelve we left
							Providence— At a quarter before four, dined at <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Fuller’s</persRef> at Walpole—
								<persRef ref="fuller-stephen">Fuller</persRef> himself died the
								22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of May 1833— We turned off from the
							Boston road at Dedham, and reached our own home at Quincy, at seven in
							the Evening, a quarter of an hour before Sunset. My Son Charles had
							arrived there not five minutes before us; having received my note by
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wainwright just in time to come out
							and meet us. He was in good health and Spirits; <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> having presented him with a
								<persRef ref="adams-charles7">second Son</persRef>, last Wednesday
							the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> He returned to Boston this
							Evening; promising to come out again to-morrow. The weather was rather
							warm, and I closed the day with a grateful heart for the blessing of our
							safe arrival, all well; from this long journey of 500 miles— The Country
							all the way from Providence is in full bloom— The Apple Orchards loaded
							with blossoms— The Lilacs and Horse Chesnuts charming the eye, and
							filling the atmosphere with fragrance. The nests of Caterpillars
							swarming in the Orchards give testimony that the reproduction of animal
							life keeps pace with that of vegetation.</p>

									>r</hi> Farley</persRef> of Providence, preach from Leviticus
							19.32. “Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of

								>r</hi> Farley was eloquent upon the reverence due to old age; and
							marked it as a peculiar excellence of the Law delivered from Sinai that
							it was enjoined with so much solemnity: coupled in the text with the
							fear of God; and closing thus with the emphatic observation—I am the
							Lord. The afternoon Sermon was by <persRef ref="huntoon-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntoon</persRef> of Milton, from
							Hebrews 6.1. “Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of
							Christ, let us go on unto perfection.”— The Christian obligation of
							aiming at perfection, is one of the great superiorities of the gospel
							over all other systems of religion: for, frail and inconsistent beings
							as we are, if we are sincere in the belief of the obligation of our
							religious duties, we must be improved by the constant conviction that it
							is our duty to aim at perfection— <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef> gave notice that the

							installation of <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lunt</persRef> would ring at ten O’Clock, and the second
							at eleven— He also gave notice that the communion would be administered
							next Sunday. I read the ninth Sermon of the sixth Volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, upon true Liberty.— The
							subject is not treated as it would be at this time. Saurin considers the
							Liberty mentioned in his text as the liberation of men by Jesus Christ
							from the Laws of the <persRef ref="moses">Mosaic</persRef>
							dispensation—and Liberty as regarding 1. The understanding 2. the will
							3. the conscience 4. the conduct 5. the condition of man— <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came out from Boston this
							afternoon with <persRef ref="kirk-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Kirk</persRef>: he was here about an hour and returned
							to Boston— I looked into my garden this morning, and found it as usual
							overrun with weeds— Many of my trees killed—the seedling trees of former
							years looking for the most part unpromisingly, and a small portion of
							the seeds that I planted last Summer and autumn coming up— While I was
							in the garden <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> E. Price Greenleaf</persRef> came, and advised me to
							leave the weeds growing, to protect the nascent Seedlings from the
