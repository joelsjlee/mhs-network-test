						<p><persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field</persRef> brought me a printed
							Petition to the Legislature of the Commonwealth for the abolition of
							Capital punishment— He asked if I would sign it— I declined, and told
							him I had not brought my mind to the conclusion that it would be for the
							good of the community— We have by the Laws of the Commonwealth only five
							crimes punishable with death—Treason, Murder, Burglary, Arson, and Rape—
							Now a Law to save the precious lives of men guilty of either of those
							crimes has in my judgment little claim to the merit of humanity. They
							are a class of People with whom humanity cannot sympathise— A law to
							prohibit the killing of Rattlesnakes would be as rational, and might be
							urged also upon principles of humanity— There is another point of view
							in which the abolition of capital punishment at this time is specially
							objectionable. While such exceeding tenderness is felt for the lives of
							Traitors, Murderers and Robbers, here is the Sovereign people, hanging
							up without judge or jury, gamblers, and even the mere circulators of
							printed papers recommending the abolition of Slavery. On one hand we
							have the most reckless disregard of human life, and the punishment of
							death summarily inflicted for offences comparatively light and even for
							that which is no offence at all, on the other Traitors and Murderers,
							are taken into peculiar favour—and their lives must be preserved and
							guarded, as if they were the very jewels of the Land. The signs of the
							times are portentous— All the tendencies of Legislation, are to the
							removal of restrictions from the vicious and the guilty, and to the
							exercise of all the powers of Government, Legislative judicial and
							executive, by lawless assemblages of individuals— I have however no <pb
								n="79" type="ms"/>doubt that the punishment of death will be
							abolished in this Commonwealth—and in all probability throughout this
							union— I had a morning visit from <persRef ref="gray-thomas2">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Gray</persRef> of
							Jamaica-Plains, with <persRef ref="russell-joseph3">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Russell</persRef>—and <persRef
								ref="mcfarland-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Samuel
								M’Farland</persRef> brought me a Letter of Introduction from
								<persRef ref="mckennan-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								M. T. M’Kennan</persRef> of Washington County, Pennsylvania, a
							member of the last, re-elected to the present Congress— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Farland is a wool-grower, travelling in
							this part<hi rend="strikethrough">y</hi> of the Country, for pleasure
							and curiosity— There was a Lady with him, who said her residence was in
							this State.— <persRef ref="sargent-barnard">Barnard Sargent</persRef>
							brought me a Letter from <persRef ref="sargent-barnard2">his
								father</persRef> to the <persRef ref="brown-ethan">Commissioner of
								the general Land-Office</persRef>, which I promised to forward—
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston, and
							returned at One O‘Clock, and then went with me to the annual party of
							the Proprietors of Neponset Bridge at Squantum— The Proprietors Meeting
							was first held; at which I presided. The Clerk, <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-thomas">(Thomas Greenleaf)</persRef> The Treasurer
							and Superintendent of the Bridge <persRef ref="beale-george">(G. W.

							<persRef ref="wales-g">Wayles,</persRef>
							<persRef ref="miller-edward">Miller,</persRef>
							<persRef ref="foster-james">Foster,</persRef> Beale, and T. Greenleaf)
							were unanimously re-elected— The vote of full-power to the Directors to
							act for the Proprietors as they might for themselves was adopted, and a
							vote that the Directors of the Farm School on Thompson’s Island should
							pass the Bridge Toll-free, on their visits to that Establishment, till
							further order of the Proprietors.— The meeting was over in a quarter of
							an hour and was followed by a similar meeting of the Directors— I
							administered the Official Oath to Thomas Greenleaf as Clerk and to
							George W. Beale, as Treasurer and Superintendent— We had a dinner of
							Chowder, fried fish, Madeira and Champagne wine, Melons, Apples, Pears
							Peaches and Plums— The party consisted of <persRef ref="bass-josiah"
								>Josiah Bass,</persRef> G. W. Beale, Thomas Greenleaf, and his Son
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">E. Price,</persRef>
							<persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">Daniel Greenleaf,</persRef> Edward

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>, with my Son Charles
							and myself. The weather was not foul but chilly, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wayles inclined to change the day of the
							annual meeting to a warmer Season. We came home before Sunset, and met
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and <persRef

						<p>At five this morning, according to previous agreement, I roused from bed
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> E.
								Price Greenleaf</persRef>, and we walked together round Neponset
							Square, excepting that instead of going over <persRef
								ref="gulliver-anthony">Gulliver’s</persRef> brook we turned in at
							the Railway passage and went through that to the cross road from
							Blacksmith’s Corner to the Neponset Bridge road— The sky was lowering,
							and there was a light sprinkling of rain, before we went out and another
							while we were walking, but we got home quite dry, after a walk of two
							hours— Immediately afterwards the rain came on in a succession of
							showers all the morning, and until within an hour of Sunset— I confined
							myself to my chamber, and to the writing of my journal old and new— When
							it cleared off the pressure upon my breast and Spirits was so heavy that
							I took another solitary walk, nearly to the Quincy gate and found myself
							relieved. In the Evening I read several of the Letters from <persRef
								ref="walpole-horace">Horace Walpole</persRef>, to <persRef
								ref="mann-horace2">Sir Horace Mann</persRef>, which are very
							amusing, and as descriptive of the downfall of <persRef

						<p>The weariness and fatigue of yesterday gave me a longer Nights repose
							than usual, and the Clock had struck five this morning before I rose.
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Prïce Greenleaf</persRef> immediately afterwards knocked at my door,
							and we walked round by the Braintree Meeting house, and returned over
							the magnificent summit of Penn’s hill— My feet were galled yesterday so
							that the walking of this day was painful— It was near 8. O’Clock when I
							got home— The worst effect of this morning walk is that it shortens much
							my daily writing—and this I cannot prevent— My garden visits are now
							almost entirely confined to planting seeds and Stones of Apples, Pears,
							Plums, Cherries, Apricots and Peaches for the vegetation of next Spring—
							I am still so careless in marking the precise seed which I sow, that I
							fear I shall not know which of them it is that come up. <persRef
								ref="cook-philadelphia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Philadelphia Coo</persRef>k, an old woman from Mendon came in
							towards Evening, and was here upwards of an hour, insisting upon my
							reading certain manuscripts of her composition upon the subject of
							Temperance— She claims to be the first person who founded a Temperance
							Society—of which there were only twelve members all women and one half
							of them members of her own family— They pledged themselves to total
							abstinence from the use of wine and spirituous liquors, except in cases
							of pain and distress—an exception sufficiently wide— M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Cook however urgently preaches total
							abstinence, and protests against the use of spirituous liquors even as
							medicine— She gave a very self Satisfied account of her immense labours
							and sacrifices and sufferings in the cause of Temperance— She enquired
							if I had received about eight years ago when President of the United
							States two anonymous Letters upon Temperance— I said I had no
							recollection of them, but I had received many anonymous Letters, of
							which I took little or no account. She said she had written those
							Letters and would be glad if I could now find them— But I told her my
							files of Letters received at that time were at Washington— She said she
							wanted them because she had now determined to have her manuscripts
							printed— I read two or three of those she had with her, which were
							merely declamatory, and confused in Style— A sort of Chaos from which
							might be worked out one of <persRef ref="sargent-lucius">Lucius Manlius
								Sargent’s</persRef> Dissertations— I read till dark, when she went
							away, to lodge at <persRef ref="u">French’s</persRef> Tavern; leaving
							with me the longest of her manuscripts to read, and saying that she
							would come again and take it to-morrow Morning— She is a widow 65 years
							of age has two Sons and two Daughters all but one married, and her face
							and form look well-suited to perform the part of one of the Weird
							Sisters of <persRef ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef>—
							After she was gone I walked with <persRef key="adams-charles2"

						<p>There is a publication by <persRef ref="olmsted-denison">professor

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Loomis</persRef> of Yale College,
							New-Haven, announcing that they have observed the great Comet of
								<persRef ref="halley-edmond">Halley</persRef> which has been
							expected for some Months— They say it is in the Constellation of Taurus,
							North of the two horns of the Bull, at right angle with those two Stars,
							and about as distant from the eastern-most of them, as they are from
							each other— Precisely in that spot I saw this morning after I rose, with
							the naked eye, a luminous spot rather nebulous, but whether the comet or
							a star of the fifth magnitude at the foot of the twin Castor I could not
							without a Telescope ascertain— <persRef ref="cook-philadelphia">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Philadelphia Cook</persRef> came
							again to converse with me upon the subject of Temperance— I read while
							she was here the manuscript she had left with me. It was a narrative of
							what one poor obscure woman (herself) had atchieved in the great cause
							of Temperance, from the first female association of twelve persons which
							she formed at Mendon to the present time— She had directed the Stageman
							to call for her here; but he sent a boy with a chaise for her— She was
							exceedingly earnest for total abstinence, not only from ardent Spirits
							but from wine—cyder—even small beer— All fermented liquors without
							exception— She had enquired into my own habits, and I had told her, I
							usually drank one glass of wine, at or after dinner, and often two— Just
							before she went away she asked to say a word to me specially and said
							she had examined my countenance, which did not look well; and she asked
							me to abstain from drinking wine altogether, for one month, by way of
							trial— I thanked her for her advice and said I would think of it— She
							said wine was poison—it was fire—it was alcohol— I asked her if wine was
							poison, or fire, how it happened that the first miracle performed by
							Jesus Christ was that of turning water into wine, by Gallons, at a
							wedding feast— She said there was no evidence that he drank any of it
							himself—and that he made good pure wine—but all the wine now made was
							adulterated—made in copper vessels— To drink it was to pour poison down
							the throat. She asked me what I thought about her having her manuscripts
							printed— I said she should consult with Printers for that; and I wished
							her all possible success in her labours for the promotion of Temperance—
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went into Boston,
							and returned to dine— He brought me from <persRef ref="degrand-peter"
								>Degrand</persRef> a certificate of 3 Shares of Stock in the Atlas
							Insurance Company: and Apricot and Bolmer Plum Stones, from <persRef
								ref="cruft-edward">Edward Cruft</persRef>— In the garden I filled a
							Pot with 1. Greengage Plum stone 5 cherry stones, 4 Williams Apple seeds
							and 2 Sugar Pear cores, and 10 seeds of the same— I planted also Row 6
							in the cleared Hazel bush patch with 12 whole Sugar Pears; and covered
							the remainder of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> row with Cherry
							stones and North Nursery Crab-seeds— This Evening <persRef
								ref="sargent-barnard2">Barnard Sargent</persRef>, brought his deed
							of land in Ohio, with the spelling of his name rectified. I promised to

						<p><date>6. IV. </date>Sunday— Heard <persRef ref="whitney-george2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Whitney</persRef>, in the
							morning from Job 7:16. “I would not live always”—and in the afternoon
							from Mark 14.8. “She hath done what she could.” As M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> George Whitney advances in years, his
							confidence in himself increases. He writes in a style more ambitious
							than correct— He reads well, and has a very animated delivery, and with
							a conscious self-satisfaction, with which his hearers are apt not to
							sympathise— His discourse this morning was a disquisition upon the
							unreasonableness and folly of wishing to live always—a disease not very
							common among men—we cling to life for the present moment, and are never
							ready to die now—but we all know we must die sooner or later, and
							naturally long only for an undefined continuation of existence— Against
								<hi rend="italic">this</hi> love of life, there is perhaps not <pb
								n="82" type="ms"/>much necessity for spiritual exhortation—when
								<persRef ref="job">Job</persRef> speaks the words of the text, he is
							in a paroxysm of despair, and it immediately succeeds a declaration that
							his life is loathsome to him— A very impressive exhortation against the
							wish to live always is a superfluous waste of the Preacher’s powers— The
							afternoon Sermon was more practical— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney descanted upon the exquisite perfection of the person to whom
							such a testimony was borne— The lesson to be learnt of doing what we
							can, is an obvious inference from this text; and the Sermon closed with
							a reference to the story of the widow’s mite cast into the Treasury, and
							to the memorable commendation of her gift, by Christ— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney freely uses figurative language,
							but not always with congruity— As a sample of his style, when he was
							describing the miseries of human life, as arguments to quench the desire
							to live always, he spoke of a man, borne down by the heavy hand of
							weakness— His manner of preaching is not so acceptable to the People as
							that of <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef>.— I read the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon
							of the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, upon the bad use of Riches—
							He says there are cases of Conscience hard to solve— That honest hearts
							may sometimes not exactly know what Religion requires and exemplifies by
							putting the question of resistance against Tyrants. No preacher in this
							Country, at the present age, would consider this as a question hard to
							solve. The doctrine of the Sermon is that in the use of riches, a man is
							mad, who loses sight for one moment of the shortness of human life, and
							of the chance that his own life may be taken from him this very night.—
							Again says the Preacher— [“]The thought of approaching death leads to
							the thought of approaching judgment— Now upon what will that approaching
							judgment turn? Think you it will be upon certain vain speculations? upon
							certain barren virtues which are the whole moral system of some of us?
							Think you that God will ask you, have you well taken care to make
							yourself inaccessible to your fellow citizens? have you well closed your
							door against those importunates who came to speak to you of their
							interests? Have you well assumed an outward appearance suited to freeze
							those who might wish to approach you? Have you well taken care to escape
							from the eyes of the world into caverns and desarts?— Ah! my brethren
							what ideas are these of the moral system of Jesus Christ? Ah! my
							brethren, where have you been brought up? A man who continually thinks
							that he may die in a few days—that he may die this very night; such a
							man even thereby thinks that he may be judged in a few days—or even this
							very night, and even thereby never loses sight of the community, to the
							good of which his duties as a Christian engage him to labour.” This is a
							sample of Saurin, in his best manner— I walked this Evening with
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">E. Price Greenleaf</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Josiah Quincy’s</persRef>— <persRef key="adams-charles2"

						<p>At ten minutes past five this morning <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">E.
								Price Greenleaf</persRef> knocked at my door and we took a walk of 6
							miles over the canal landing Bridge round to the Weymouth Turnpike and
							back by the Episcopal Church—out two hours— <persRef ref="bass-lewis"
								>Lewis Bass</persRef> the Selectman sent me a note to enquire if I
							could go and view the ground which they wish me to give the town, to
							widen the road on Penn’s Hill. I sent him word I would meet him there
							to-morrow Morning at Sunrise— I made two visits to my Garden and
							Nursery—one from Noon till dinnertime, when I planted in row 7. of the
							cleared Hazel-bush patch 14. Cores of the Orange pear now ripe—my object
							now being to identify the particular sort of seed sown, to compare with
							the growth and progress of the plant when it comes up— This is specially
							desirable for the Apple and Pear— First to observe the relative rapidity
							and slowness of their growth, the difference between which is enormous;
							and secondly to observe which seeds produce the healthy plants, to
							discern them from those, which take the blight almost immediately after
							they come up— I have many seedling plants of the present year of both
							kinds, but not knowing from what particular seed either of them came, I
							have no useful guide for the selection of seed in future— I have
							therefore now, planted in each of the rows of the cleared hazle-bush
							patch, one kind of Pears or cores only and have successively taken the
							Jenneton, Jargonel, Catherine, Sugar and Orange Pears, one to each row,
							as they successively ripened— I propose to do the same with the
							Apples—in the rows and in the Pots— I have nearly ascertained that my
							Apple-seedlings of most rapid growth are from the Office or woodhouse
							tree, and those of slowest growth from the Dwarf tree.— The last are
							indeed so very slow; that I cannot expect to live to see any of them
							come to a bearing age— Still my experiments afford me so pleasing a
							pastime that I repeat them from year to year, hoping that the results
							may prove hereafter useful to my descendants or to others, when I myself
							may be forgotten— With the same purpose, I took out my grand daughter
								<persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> this afternoon into
							the garden, where she planted—South and East of the Nursery gate 1.
							Bolmer Plumstone—one Cruft Apricot-Stone. 1 whole Squantum Peach. 2.
							Peach-stones 6. whole Orange Pears, 20 North-Nursery Crab Apple seeds
							and 1. whole apple. 3 wild cherries and 3 Greenleaf cherries all in one
							row— Some of them I hope may come up, and then that she will remember
							that they were trees planted from the seed with her own hand. I would
							willingly give this taste to every individual of my posterity, believing
							that if I could it would be profitable to after ages—a simple taste, a
							cheap pleasure—a source of improvement in the cultivation of the earth;
							a link of attachment to the soil tending to strengthen the love of their
							Country, and to preserve them from the vices of dissipation and folly— I
							filled also Pot 13. and planted in it 1. Bolmer Plum. 1 Cruft Apricot
							stones, Orange Pear-seeds, Office Apple seeds, wild and Greenleaf
							Cherries. I answered a Letter from <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">Dutee J.

							were condemned, the greatness of the blessing conferred upon the men

							who never returned to glorify God or to bless their deliverer.— One only
							in ten thought of grateful return for the miracle upon his person—and
							that one a Samaritan—or as Jesus called him a stranger— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall dined with us. His afternoon Sermon
							was from Luke 2.49—“wist ye not that I must be about my fathers

							volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, upon the long suffering of God towards the
							Amorites—because the iniquity of the Amorites was not yet full The
							preacher tells his hearers that the case of the Amorites was their
							own—that God spares them only because their iniquity is not yet full;
							and that his terrible judgments are in reserve for them— This is a
							severe denunciation, but when he comes to specify, he disclaims all
							application to individuals and speaks only of national sins— These
							consist in tolerating licentious books; in sacrificing the reformed
							religion to Policy—in harbouring hatred and discord—in complaining of
							persecution and practising it, and in captious criticism upon preachers
							and their discourses. He stops himself in the midst of this enumeration
							of deadly sins; says it is long enough—and that the wretched age for
							which he had been reserved seemed to have taken for its model that which
							drew down the vengeance of God upon Sodom and Gomorrah; Admah and
							Zeboim.— Did the preacher believe this?</p>
