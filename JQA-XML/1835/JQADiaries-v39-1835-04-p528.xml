						<p>At eleven O’Clock this morning, I took my granddaughter <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef>, to see the Menagerie of
							wild beasts which came into the City yesterday, and of which there is
							the greatest variety that I have ever seen in this Country— There are
							two elephants, one very large; I think nine feet high; and the other
							small, not more than five. A Rhinoceros, the most perfect one I ever
							saw— A large lion— A Royal Bengal Tyger remarkably fine— Two spotted
							Hyenas, with fiend like looks— A Zebra, a Tapir, a Gnu, a Jackall— A
							Camel, a White Bear, a wilderness of Monkies and Parrots, an Eagle, a
							wolf, wild cats, small spotted Leopards, an Ounce, and sundry smaller
							animals, with which I was not acquainted. One of the keepers went into
							almost all the dens, and held the beasts in perfect submission to him—
							He kept the Lion, as crouching; and obedient as a Lap dog— But he did
								<pb n="529" type="ms"/>not think fit to associate with the white
							Bear, the Tyger, or the Hyenas— There was a Captain Jack, scarlet
							uniformed monkey, who rode round some time, on a small poney, and a
							round dickey, was placed in Saddle form on the back of the large
							Elephant, and two sets of little girls from eight to twelve years old,
							seated therein rode two or three times round— The tent was well filled
							with Spectators and I met there several of my acquaintance— Among them
								<persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter Hellen</persRef>, whom I
							invited to go home and dine with us; but who declined, being obliged to
							return to Alexandria— I went next to the City Hall, but the <persRef
								ref="bradley-william">Mayor</persRef> and Register <persRef
								ref="hewitt-william">Hewitt</persRef> were again both absent— I left
							my deeds from <persRef ref="tyler-benjamin">B. O. Tyler</persRef> and
							promised to call again— Then I went to the National Intelligencer, and
							got engaged again in a two hours conversation with <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef>— Came home and found a
							half-witted man, subject to nervous contortions, who had invited himself
							to dine with us which he did— <persRef key="frye-carolina">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frye</persRef> was also here— As I
							was walking home, I found in the Pennsylvania Avenue a silver tea spoon
							marked with a C.— I thought it perhaps a poisson d’Avril, but picked it
							up and brought it home.</p>

						<p>I called at the Secretary of State’s Office, and asked <persRef

							to permit me to send to the Department a small box containing fifty
							copies of my Oration upon the Life and Character of <persRef
								ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef> to be forwarded to <persRef
								ref="lafayette-george">his Son</persRef>; which he said he would do—
							The Committee of Arrangements requested me to take charge of them— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth spoke to me of the boundary
							controversy between Ohio and Michigan, and of the question of our
							Northeastern boundary with Great-Britain— He said there was a recent
							Resolution of the Legislature of the State of Maine, approving of the
							rejection of the award made by the <persRef ref="william-i">King of the
								Netherlands</persRef>— He seemed to lean to the Ohio side on the
							question of boundary with Michigan; and weary of the North eastern
							boundary question— At the Capitol, in the Library I found <persRef ref="russell-joseph3">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Russell</persRef>— I called for <persRef
								ref="ward-robert">Ward’s</persRef> History of the Law of Nations,
							before <persRef ref="grotius-hugo">Grotius</persRef>, and for <persRef
								ref="bodin-jean">Bodin</persRef>, de la Republique— I spent two
							hours in turning over the leaves of these two Works— Ward’s book I have
							always thought a very valuable one, not only as a historical monument,
							but as tracing the principles of international intercourse to their
							foundations, and as rendering justice to the high and extraordinary
							character of Grotius, the founder of the modern Science of the Law of
							Nations— I looked over the Chapter titles of Bodin’s Republic to see if
							any thing could be found of the division of powers into Legislative
							Executive and Judicial but met with nothing to the purpose— Bodin, like
								<persRef ref="hobbes-thomas">Hobbes</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="filmer-robert">Filmer</persRef>, considers Sovereign Power, as
							indivisible and illimitable; though he marks the difference between
							those who make the Laws, and the magistracy who execute them— I sought
							in <persRef ref="chalmers-alexander">Chalmers’s</persRef> Biographical
							Dictionary for the Articles Hobbes and Filmer, which I found— The latter
							very short— Returning home I stop’d at the National Intelligencer
							Office, and spoke to <persRef ref="u">Deeble</persRef> the Bookbinder
							about the transmission of the fine Copies of my Oration to the members
							of Congress. He came to my house and took fifty Copies which I had

						<p>The child <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny</persRef>, is recovering
							from her severe intermittent fever, but <persRef ref="hellen-mary">her
								mother</persRef> and <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>grandmother</persRef> are much indisposed with heavy colds— I
							called at <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Wolfendens</persRef> for a settlement of her rent and she gave me a
							bill of half her quarters rent for putting up a coal grate— Walking
							round the Capitol, <persRef ref="plummer-franklin">Franklin E.
								Plummer</persRef>, a member of the late House of Representatives
							from Mississippi was starting from <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dunn’s</persRef> in a Carryall, and
							asked me to take a seat with him which I did; he was driving to the War
							Department, where I left him— He said he thought <persRef
								ref="poindexter-george">Poindexter</persRef> had been imprudent, in
							his great dinner Speech at Philadelphia.— The whigs of Philadelphia have
							made a magnificent Banquet at the Arch-Street Theatre; in honour of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Poindexter; against whom, the basest
							conspiracy ever witnessed in this Country has been defeated and
							exposed—growing out of the attempt of <persRef ref="lawrence-richard"
								>Richard Lawrence</persRef> to assassinate the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>, at the Capitol, on the
								29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January, the day of <persRef
								ref="davis-warren">Warren R Davis’s</persRef> funeral. Immediately
							after Lawrence’s two pistols missed fire the President said it was a
							Poindexter affair— Soon after a man named <persRef ref="coltman-charles"
								>Coltman</persRef> a member of the Common Council, suborned two men
							named <persRef ref="foy-mordecai">Foy</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="stewart-david">Stewart</persRef> to make affidavit’s that they
							had seen Lawrence go to Poindexter’s house, and talking with him, a day
							or two before the attempted Assassination— The President was treasuring
							up these Affidavits, when they were communicated to <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef>, when visiting at the
							House, and by him to <persRef ref="southworth-sylvester"
								>Southworth</persRef>, a newspaper correspondent and Reporter— The
							facts got thus into the newspapers— Poindexter, wrote to the President
							demanding an explanation but received no answer— Poindexter demanded an
							investigating Committee of the Senate; and there was one appointed who
							detected and exposed the conspiracy, so far at least as to fasten the
							Subornation by Coltman; and the falsehood of the two affidavits— They
							reported a triumphant vindication of Poindexter’s innocence, and the
							report was unanimously accepted by the Senate— The public indignation is
							thus transformed, from the Assassin of the person to the Assassin of
							character, and Jackson himself bears no small portion of the public
							odium. The Philadelphia whigs turn it to political account; and give a
							great festival to Poindexter, to celebrate his escape from the
							conspiracy— Poindexter avails himself of the occasion to make a flaming
							opposition Speech, which may be excusable in him but which seems to me
							not well judged— The whole affair is sickening to me, and looks too much
							as if we were running into the manners of the Italian Republics.</p>

								<persRef ref="hallam-henry">Hallam’s</persRef> Constitutional
							History of England. my object was to ascertain if I could find in them

								ref="justinian">Justinian’s</persRef> Institutes for definitions—
							But under the denomination of Law, he includes the Plebiscitum, the

						<p>here is Legislative—Executive—and Moral authority, all exercised by one

						<p>fulsome enough in all conscience—what he means by opening all the main I
							cannot exactly tell— Chief in Arms is <persRef ref="montesquieu-charles"
								>Montesquieu’s</persRef> executive for the Laws of Nations— But
							Horace does not confine the defence of arms to agency abroad; nor does
							he say any thing of Amendment in Arts— There was a heavy thunderstorm

							visit from <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef>. He
							thinks that if <persRef ref="livingston-edward">Edward

									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt</persRef> was sent for,

							the weather being stormy, and no evening Service at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s. <persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith’s</persRef> morning Sermon was
							from Matthew 12.49. “And he stretched forth his hand toward his
							disciples, and said, Behold my mother, and my brethren!” It was the most
							liberal discourse that I ever heard from a Presbyterian Clergyman— He
							assumed that Jesus throughout his life shewed a constant regard for all
							the relations of consanguinity, and that in saying that his disciples
							were his disciples were his mother and his brethren, he plainly meant to
							indicate that his affection for his disciples was equally strong and <pb
								n="532" type="ms"/>tender, with that of the most powerful ties of
							nature in domestic life—and the doctrine that he deduced from this was,
							that the same tenderness of affection ought to subsist between the
							disciples themselves— That to whatever denomination of Christians they
							belong, they are bound to consider all other Christians as children and
							brethren of one and the same family— This is true Christianity— The
							afternoon Sermon was from Luke 7–8. “For I also am a man set under
							authority having under me, Soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he
							goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this,
							and he doeth it.” He noticed a difference in the relation of this event
							by <persRef ref="matthew">Matthew</persRef>, from the narrative in
								<persRef ref="luke">Luke</persRef>. I met on the Square a <persRef

							I took him with me, and gave him a seat in my pew— He talked so
							constantly and so oddly on the way, that I thought him hardly of sane
							mind. He appeared to sleep nearly the whole Sermon time; and remained in
							the Church after it was over, I suppose to talk with M<hi

								>My wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef>,

							exemplified in Horace’s Odes of lyric poetry; and thence to the same

								>Pindar</persRef>, and <persRef ref="anacreon">Anacreon</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="boileau-nicolas">Boileau</persRef>, <persRef

								>Byron</persRef>, <persRef ref="burns-robert">Burns</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="dibdin-charles">Dibdin</persRef>, all the English
							Songsters, the French Chansonniers, and above all, the Psalms. There is
							one character infinitely diversified in them all—but what are the
							essential characters of Horace’s Ode’s— 1. Unity—a seminal idea,
							pervading the whole Ode. 2 Rich imagery. 3 picturesque descriptions of
							nature 4. Sublime and lofty Sentiment. 5. Maxims of wisdom sententiously
							expressed— 6. harmonious versification; a beauty of which we can have
							but a very faint idea, from ignorance of the pronunciation of the
							language, and of the various measures of his verse— Many of his amatory
							odes however are grossly indelicate— The subjects of others are
							uninteresting, or unintelligible— Many of them refer to manners, no
							longer existing—the allusions to the mythology, and to the astrology of
							the time are frequent; and not always clear— Those to the roman history,
							and to individuals cotemporaries of the Poet, are common— There are
							Bacchanalian and Love Songs, and some religious hymns, of which the
							carmen Saeculare is the chief— A remarkable difference between his Odes
							to the Gods and the Psalms of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef> is
							that his devotion never dwells upon any moral attribute in his deities—
							Another remarkable thing in Horace is, that although a professed
							Epicurean, his most admirable Sentiments are from the Stoic School— I
							walked to the Capitol, and at the Office of the <persRef
								ref="franklin-walter">Clerk of the House</persRef> made enquiries
							respecting sundry Bills and reports relating to the Ohio and Michigan
							boundary question— I found <pb n="533" type="ms"/>several bills, and the
							report of the Committee of the Territories of the House, made on the
								11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of March 1834— I still want much
							information upon the boundary question, to be prepared to act upon it,
							at the next Session of Congress— The man whom I took with me yesterday
							afternoon to Church, came this day to see me— His name is <persRef

							the returns of the Census of the Territory, and the large lithographed
							map shewing the location of the disputed lands—of which <persRef ref="u"
								>Burch</persRef> gave me three copies— I went into the Library, and
							read nearly two hours in <persRef ref="hallam-henry">Hallam’s</persRef>
							Constitutional History of England— I took the period of the Revolution
							of 1688 and found an account of the Petition of right and the Bill of
							rights— He has a very high opinion of <persRef ref="william-iii">William
								the third</persRef>, and a very bad one of <persRef ref="anne">Queen
								Anne</persRef>— I looked into the Biographical dictionary for the
							Article of <persRef ref="filmer-robert">Sir Robert Filmer</persRef>, and
							found that he died in 1647. of course before the Execution of <persRef

							been many years before <persRef ref="sidney-algernon">Sidney</persRef>
							undertook to refute them, and yet longer before they were demolished by
								<persRef ref="locke-john">Locke</persRef>— I see nothing obnoxious
							in them, but what is equally so in <persRef ref="hobbes-thomas"
								>Hobbes</persRef>— There is something very plausible in the idea
							that parental authority is the foundation of civil Government. Hobbes
							and Filmer, both argue much from the Scriptures of the old Testament but
							there is in truth nothing there to sustain the pretension that
							Government was derived from parental authority— From the time of the
							flood there is always a compact or Covenant, of God with <persRef

							seems to be desperate— I have read the opinion of the <persRef

							argument advises the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>
							to interdict resistance by the Territorial Government of Michigan to the

							from 1. Thessalonians 5.21. “Prove all things; hold fast that which is
							good.” He said that the words of his text, had no special and immediate
							reference to the subject of his discourse, which was the form of
							Government of the Presbyterian Church— That the original form of
							Christian Church Government, naturally arose from the Synagogues of the
							Jews— That the <pb n="536" type="ms"/>the great majority of the first
							Christians were Jews, though from the first there were among them many
							Gentiles or heathens— That the Christian Churches were formed on the
							model not of the Heathen or of the Jewish Temples but of the Jewish
							Synagogues— The Temples both Jewish and Heathen, being devoted to the
							worship of Sacrifices and served by Priests—while in the Synagogues
							there was neither Priest nor Sacrifices; but the Service was performed
							by Teachers and Elders, and resembled the Services now performed in most
							of the Christian Churches of almost all denominations— He then gave some
							account of the origin, character and authority of the teachers and
							ruling elders of the presbyterian Church; but wished his hearers to
							understand that the form of Church Government was altogether subordinate
							and secondary to the essentials of Religion, which were the same in all
							Christian Churches— He finally said that he should perhaps pursue this
							subject in his next Sunday morning’s discourse, but it was not certain—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith’s mind seems to be labouring

							cause; and it gave me new matter for reflection— It made me dissatisfied
							with the draft of a Speech which I had written, and which now appears to
							me week and inefficient for want of method and arrangement—
							Extemporaneous debate cannot be methodical; but where there is so much
							matter, as I have on this Bill it cannot be introduced and disposed of
							but by a formal written discourse— I began therefore a second draft of a
							Speech; and was engaged with it the whole day, except when drawn off for
							other indispensable business— <persRef ref="kennedy-john3">John

								ref="brent-daniel">Daniel Brent</persRef>, of 14. March who thinks

								>Galignani’s</persRef> Messenger from 5 to 14 March— After dinner I
							walked to <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye’s</persRef> to make some enquiries of him— One was whether such
							offices now existed as the Apothecary General and Assistant Apothecaries

							Hellen</persRef>—whose youngest Son, <persRef ref="hellen-walter2"
								>Walter</persRef> has just come of age—and concerning the

							found after returning home that <pb n="537" type="ms"/>the Offices of
							Apothecary General, and his Assistants were tacitly abolished by the Act
							reducing the Military Establishment of 2. March 1821—and yet they were
							both included in Benton’s Patronage Bill of 4. May 1826— <persRef

							Oration, of which <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							prospect of two opponents—one Jackson man, and one whig: they have now
							both withdrawn, and he has no opposition— He says his two opponents were
							brought out by the same person— He appears to be much exasperated
							against <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef>, and
							very bitter against <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef>.
							He says that he dislikes very much <persRef ref="white-hugh">M<hi

							in preference to Van Buren. I told him I thought the electioneering
							contest would take a geographical turn; and would go altogether North
							and South— This is very apparent, but what will be its effect upon the
							movements at the next Session of Congress.— This afternoon I walked to
								<persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								T. B. Johnsons</persRef> but he was not at home— Much of the day was
							absorbed in examining the contest between the President and Senate upon

							in that case, and on <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript"

								Herring</persRef> of New-York was here— He is engaged upon a work
							called the National Gallery of Portraits, for which he wants that of
								<persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef>, with a biographical
							narrative— He has written to me two or three times upon this subject,
							Letters, which from the multiplicity of business and of cares with which
							I am over-laboured, I have neglected to answer— He has sent me messages
							by <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> and one or two
							other persons through whom I have apologized from my failure, and I
							repeated the apology now, with which he professed to be satisfied— He
							wished to have engraved for his book, the full length portrait of my
							father, painted by <persRef ref="copley-john">Copley</persRef>, in 1783
							now at Harvard University, Cambridge, and the Kit-cat, painted by
								<persRef ref="stuart-gilbert">Stewart</persRef> when my father was
							President of the United States— He also desired to have the Portrait of
								<persRef key="adams-abigail">my mother</persRef>; painted at the
							same time— I told him they might be used for the purpose of engraving,
							and he said he expected to be in Boston, in the course of the Summer,
							and would come to see me at Quincy— He spoke also with great approbation
							of the Portrait of me lately painted by <persRef ref="durand-asher"
								>Durand</persRef>, and thought it the strongest likeness of me that
							he had ever seen. He said he had advised M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Durand to commence the engraving of it immediately— I promised to call
							on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Herring upon my homeward way, if I
							should stay long enough in New-York— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clements</persRef> was here to hire

							with me to my door— He told me of a beggarly famished man, who got into
							the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President’s</persRef> House last
							night; and at two O’Clock this morning, roused him twice in bed, by
							attempting to get into his chamber, which was locked— He roused the men
							in the house; who took him; and he had nothing to say but that he was
							hungry. They shut him up in the Stable, from which he escaped this
							morning before daylight— I wasted a large portion of this day, in
							searching, for a foolish saying of <persRef ref="falstaff-john"

						<p><date>19. VI. </date>Sunday— Easter-day.</p>
						<p>Rain all the morning. I attended at the Presbyterian Church, where
								<persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> preached from John 12:43. [“]For they loved the
							praise of men, more than the praise of God.” he did not continue the
							subject of his last Sunday morning’s discourse— He gave notice that on
							account of the inclemency of the weather, there would be no afternoon
							service. There was immediately after the Sermon, an Easter Anthem sung,
							by the singers in the front gallery— There was no Evening service at
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, and I had no
							opportunity to attend any where after dinner— I read <persRef
								ref="bancroft-aaron">Bancroft’s</persRef> Sermon 23 <pb n="540"
								type="ms"/>on the doctrine of immortality preached on Christmas
							day—and the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> on the duties enjoined by
							the fourth commandment—to keep the Sabbath day holy— The second of these
							discourses, is more satisfactory to me than the first— I walked out
							towards evening, and called on <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B. Johnson</persRef>, with whom I
							sat in conversation about an hours— In the pursuit of my enquiries
							concerning this Patronage Bill, I got engaged with <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and <persRef ref="seaton-william"
								>Seaton’s</persRef> Register of debates Vol. 6. part 1. upon the
							debates in the Senate of the Winter of 1829–30. the first Session of the
								21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> Congress; and of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson’s</persRef> Administration— It absorbed
							my attention so intensely that the day was gone, and I had done nothing—
							It seemed a trial of strength between the makers of long Speeches, who
							could hold out longest, and wander widest from the proper subject of
							discussion— A very large portion of the debate upon Executive patronage
							was wasted upon <persRef ref="foot-samuel">Foot’s</persRef> Resolution
							respecting the Public Lands— That debate was one of the earliest results
							of that coalition between the South and the West, to sacrifice the
							manufacturing and free labour interest of the North and East to the
							Slave-holding interest of the South, by the plunder of the public Lands
							surrendered by the South to the new Western States— This was the secret
							of that combined, and simultaneous attack of <persRef ref="hayne-robert"
								>Hayne</persRef> and <persRef ref="benton-thomas">Benton</persRef>
							upon the Eastern Section of the Union, so manfully and ably met and
							repelled by <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="sprague-peleg">Sprague</persRef>— The Jackson Administration
							had been formed upon this combination and had drawn New-York and
							Pennsylvania into its vortex— It is rather surprising that the sacrifice
							of the public Lands was not then entirely consummated— Benton was the
							founder of this project— <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> had
							built his reputation as a Statesman and raised his ladder to the
							Presidency upon internal improvement, of the Western Country— He had
							connected himself with the free labour interest of the North in this
							pursuit; Benton who had been one of his partizans till then saw he could
							supplant him, by purchasing of the South the plunder of the public
							Lands, and selling to them the Western interest of internal improvement—
							This was the governing impulse of the joint movement of Hayne and
							Benton, against the East and North in that debate. Why can I pursue this
							subject no further?— <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> was
							seized violently this morning with a return of chills and fever, and was

							received a Letter from the <persRef ref="sprague-william">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d</hi> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sprague</persRef> of Albany, which I answered— Walked round the
							Capitol Hill before dinner, and to alleviate my anxiety and distress,
							gave up as much as possible my mind to my researches upon Executive
							Patronage— I read over most of the debates in the Senate, through the
							memorable Session of 1829–30. and made out a list of all the Speakers on
							the numerous questions involving this Constitutional principle— I
							perused also the Executive Journal of that Session, published as an
							Appendix to the Legislative Journal of the same Session— It was <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Webster’s</persRef> Speeches and replies to
								<persRef ref="hayne-robert">Hayne</persRef> in that Session, in the
							debates on <persRef ref="foot-samuel">Foot’s</persRef> Resolution, which
							raised his reputation to the highest pitch, and not without reason— They
							are monuments of eloquence, and debateable power— Neither he nor Hayne
							in their Speeches on that Resolution introduced the Patronage question
								<pb n="541" type="ms"/>but Foot himself and others did—particularly
								<persRef ref="clayton-john">Clayton</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="johnston-josiah">Johnston</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="grundy-felix">Grundy</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="livingston-edward">Livingston</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bibb-george">Bibb</persRef>— The great effort of every member
							was to shew that he could make a tiresome long Speech— Webster however,
							putting his whole stake upon the answer to Hayne, rather affectedly
							avoided noticing <persRef ref="benton-thomas">Benton</persRef>, who was
							the great and real assailant— The Policy of this is extremely doubtful—
							It seems to me upon a review of the whole debate that Webster should
							have answered Benton as well as Hayne—that he should have assumed the
							offensive against both, and exposed the profligate combination between
							Nullification and the Robbery of the Public Lands which urged the joint
							attack on Benton and Hayne upon the East— This he did not do— He kept
							wholly on the defensive as to the East; and suffered Hayne to sacrifice,
							all the rights of the old States to their portion of the public Lands,
							with impunity— This was the deadly poison of that league which brought
							in the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> Administration,
							and it has never yet been exposed— The failure of its consummation
							hitherto has been owing to the breach between Jackson and <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, brought about by <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van-Buren</persRef>—to the consequent
							precipitation of the nullification rebellion of South-Carolina—to the
							compromise between <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> and Calhoun,
							and to Clay’s Land-Bills, which though defeated by Jackson’s veto have
							yet defeated or rather delayed the total sacrifice of the public Lands,
							which yet Jackson openly recommended in his message of December 1832—
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> and <persRef

								ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> that the appointing power is
							vested in the President and Senate, and it is upon this false statement
							that nearly the whole of their arguments to the support of the Bill are

							House of Commons, in which were two voluminous Reports of <persRef
								ref="bowring-john">J. Bowring</persRef> upon the Public Accounts
							Revenues and expenditures of France. They are full of exceedingly useful
							information— I find by it that the annual revenue and expenditure of
							France, exceeds one thousand millions of Franks; or about two hundred
							Millions of dollars— The population of France is about double that of
							the United States— Its expences are ten times more than ours—Army, Navy,

								<persRef key="adams-john2">my Son</persRef> for seven years, of

							in July 1785. when the population of the City was less than
							twenty-thousand Souls— It is now little short of two hundred and forty
							thousand, and still increasing with unexampled rapidity— He remarked
							that very few persons had made fortunes by this course of Events,
							although the rise in the price of Lands had kept full pace with the
							growth of population— That <persRef ref="astor-john">John Jacob
								Astor</persRef>, had systematically invested his property in Lands
							and had now an Estate worth thirteen or fourteen, some said fifteen
							Millions of Dollars— He said he himself had foolishly two or three years

						<p>Farther waste of time in making out an alphabetical list of Postmasters
							in the two Counties of Norfolk and Plymouth, Massachusetts, and a list
							of members of the House of Representatives in the Massachusetts
							Legislature, from the towns in the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Congressional District. These lists are made with a view to the
							distributions of public documents of which an extra number of copies are
							printed by order of the House of Representatives for circulation— This
							must be systematically done, and the system that I have heretofore
							pursued is susceptible of improvement. <pb n="544" type="ms"/>One of the
							Clerks from the war department, came from the <persRef ref="cass-lewis"
								>Secretary Cass</persRef> to enquire the name of a young man of
							Dorchester, Massachusetts, for whom he had promised me a Warrant of
							admission as a Cadet at West-Point for June 1836. I gave him the name
							from memory, and mistook the middle initial. I afterwards recurred to
							his Letter, and went to the Department, where the warrant was already
							made out—the error was rectified, and I took the warrant with me,
							properly directed to <persRef ref="howe-samuel2">Samuel B.
								Howe</persRef>— He is required to repair to West-Point, between the
								1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> and 20<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of June 1836— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cass told me
							that <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> and <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Howard</persRef> had not succeeded in
							their mission to Ohio and Michigan— That the Commissioners from Ohio had
							run their line, and the Government of the State was exercising
							jurisdiction, from which he expected a conflict and blood shed— He asked
							me if I had read the opinion of the <persRef ref="butler-benjamin"
								>Attorney General</persRef> on the dispute— I said I had; and
							regretted to see in it what I had understood as a surrender of the right
							of Michigan to the lands— He said it was not so intended nor so
							understood in Ohio—I said the opinion was certainly against the present
							pretensions of Ohio, but I thought the right was surrendered by the
							concession that although Congress had not formally acceded to the
							proposition in the Constitution of the State of Ohio, they had reserved
							the right of acceding to it thereafter— He said it was only that they
							had the same right now, which they had then— That they had not the moral
							right, but that they possessed the legal right; there being no
							restriction upon Congress as there was upon the States, against passing
							Laws impairing the obligation of contracts— I said that was enough, and
							I considered it as a surrender of the question— I did not admit the
							right of Congress to pass Laws in violation of their own contracts; and
							added it was precisely question with the French chamber of deputies.
							There was a heavy hot gale from the Southwest this morning; and a Cold
							gust from the Northwest followed by thunder, lightening and rain in the
							Evening— I was taking a short walk, and went in to <persRef

						<p>Interruption of purpose, and abstraction from the preparation of my

							visit of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Vice-President Van
								Buren</persRef>, and our conversation was of a balloon ascension of

							somewhere in Ohio, who was nine hours and a half in the air, and at half

								<pb n="546" type="ms"/>We spoke also of a foot race lately run for a
							premium of 1000 dollars near New-York and won by a Connecticut farmer—
							Ten miles in one hour. He performed it in 59 minutes 48. Seconds— Two
							others, foreigners, came within one minute of success. There were nine
							competitors for the prize. And immediately after the atchievement two
							persons offered themselves to undertake to walk five hundred miles
							without eating or drinking, for a prize of 500 dollars— Another subject
							of conversation was the Temperance reform— Another the condition and
							prospects of the Roman Catholic Religion in this Country— No Politics—
							He told me that <persRef ref="delavan-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Delavan</persRef>, the great Patron of the Temperance

							the finest old Madeira wine— He would neither drink it himself, nor sell

								>Fischer’s</persRef> shop, to have a new Diary volume bound for me,
							and then went to the Congress Library, where from the first volume of

							1777. they were not incorrect; but they would not be so, for the time

							Force had got a number of extracts from the Newspapers of the time,
							concerning the preceding flag which was a white field with yellow
							stripes and a Rattlesnake, with the motto “don’t tread on me”— But he
							said he could not find how, or when, or by whom it had been ordained— I
							urged M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Force, to improve his Calendar in
							future years, by adding to it an Almanack, and the Post Offices The
							Almanack, he said he certainly would, and the Post-Offices if
							possible—but he said he had made proposals, both at the general
							Post-Office and at the Department of State, to include their annual and
							biennial Registers in his Calendar; but although he had offered
							exceedingly advantageous terms they had been rejected, because he was
							not of the right faith— I gave M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Force a
