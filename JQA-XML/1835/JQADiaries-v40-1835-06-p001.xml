						<p><date>1. IV:30. </date>Monday.— I came home with a Resolution to make an
							effort to employ my time more usefully this Summer than I have
							heretofore done and particularly to discharge more faithfully my duty to
								<persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef>— But I can take no
							self-satisfaction from the success or more properly the failure of this
							day— I rose early but only redeemed the last arrears of my diary. A cold
							morning shower kept me before breakfast from the garden, and at
							breakfast we had fire in the parlour. The sky afterwards cleared away
							for the Sun, with Summer heat. My Mount Wollaston Tenant <persRef
								ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> came only to promise
							that he would come again next week on Tuesday. <persRef ref="carr-john2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carr</persRef> settled with me
							for his rent to the first of April and asked me questions about <persRef
								ref="poindexter-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poindexter</persRef>. He said <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson’s</persRef> friends here pretended that the reason why
								<persRef ref="lawrence-richard">Lawrence’s</persRef> pistols did not
							shoot Jackson was that he could not be shot— The <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">Rev’d M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitney</persRef> and his Son <persRef ref="whitney-augustus"
								>Augustus</persRef> paid me a morning visit, and <persRef

							with <persRef ref="reed-luman">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Luman
								Read</persRef>
							<pb n="2" type="ms"/>were here after dinner. They came about the double
							collection of Portraits of the Presidents, which M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Read has employed Durand to paint for him— One of which he
							intends to present to some public national institution, and the other he
							proposes to keep, himself— I lent M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Durand
							the Portrait of my father, painted by <persRef ref="stuart-gilbert"
								>Stuart</persRef> in 1799 for him to copy, and I promised to sit to
							him next Thursday morning for another portrait of me— That which he
							painted of me at Washington two months ago, has been exhibited at
							New-York, at the annual exhibition, and was thought an excellent
							likeness— Durand has painted a copy of it for <persRef
								ref="davis-charles2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles A.
								Davis</persRef>, which he has presented to my Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">wife</persRef>, and which is now at the
							Athenaeum exhibition in Boston. But instead of making another copy,
							Durand asked me to sit again to which I assented. I visited my garden in
							the heat of the day and planted Philadelphia maple seeds in Pot 1. and
							Washington maple-seeds in Pot 2.— The Pots have all but one been emptied
							by Rats and mice, or some other mischievous animal, and two or three of
							them are broken. Some of my Peach trees are dead—others dying— Weeds
							over run the whole garden, and my planting prospects are dismal—</p>

						<p>I spent great part of this day in my garden and nursery, examining my
							seedling trees and plants— I began by planting a row of Philadelphia
							maple seeds, along under the Northern fence of my Eastern close. I
							scatter these seeds in various places without knowing whether any of
							them will vegetate— I had made much preparation last summer and autumn,
							for extending my plantations of nuts acorns and seeds of trees— In the
							midst of my experiments I was suddenly called away; my plantations were
							of course suspended, and another year has passed away leaving my
							purposes unperformed— Most especially the design of ascertaining the
							pedigree of my Seedling plants— That is, of identifying the plant that
							comes up with the nut, acorn or seed that was sown— I had sown in 18
							earthenpots certain seeds, Stones and acorns of particular and valuable
							kinds— I had staked and stoned them, and made minutes of them in a
							Memorandum book. But the work was unfinished when I was called away. I
							directed that the Pots should be put into the cellar for the winter to
							preserve the Seeds from the hard frosts— They were so deposited; but
								<persRef ref="kirk-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Kirk</persRef> who was left in the house when <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> went to Washington
							removed afterwards to Boston— My pots have remained in the cellar to
							this time without Sun or rain for two Months of the Spring— The rats and
							mice have half-emptied some of them, and there is only one of them in
							which several seedlings trees, which had come up in it last year seem
							yet to be alive but perishing— Makers of experiments which require years
							for solution must make up their minds to bear many disappointments
							without being discouraged— I had also planted several rows of Stones and
							seeds in the garden; which have all been dug up and lost, by a man who
							has been at work in it this Spring— A Stranger who knew not where my
							treasures were deposited, and thus uprooted them unwittingly— Many of my
							seedling plants of former years, however remain but their growth <pb
								n="3" type="ms"/>after the first year is so slow, and imperceptible
							that I take little interest in them— Besides the time spent in my garden
							I lost some hours in searching all my books upon Astronomy, for a
							catalogue of fixed Stars of the first magnitude, and finally found one
							only in <persRef ref="lalande-jerome">de la Lande</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas

							which I somewhat reluctantly consented; and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Greenleaf invited me to a party to-morrow Evening at his

						<p>At ten O’Clock this morning, on the ringing of the first Bell, I went to
								<persRef ref="u">French’s</persRef> Tavern, where were assembled the
							Ecclesiastical Council, for the installation of the <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> William Parsons
								Lunt</persRef>, as Colleague Pastor to the <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Peter
								Whitney</persRef> over the first Congregational Church and Society
							at Quincy— The <persRef ref="harris-thaddeus">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi> Doctor Thaddeus Mason Harris</persRef> my classmate at
							Harvard University was Moderator of the Council, and was opening it with
							prayer— After which the names of the Churches and Societies were called
							over which had been invited to attend, at the solemnities of the day—
							They were numerous but were almost all present by their Pastors; and
							most of them by one lay delegate— The documents were then read by
								<persRef ref="whitney-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Whitney</persRef>, of the invitation of the Church and Society to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt to settle as the Colleague of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney; and of his acceptance of the
							invitation, upon the terms proposed—a Salary of 800 dollars a year; and
							six Months notice to be given, if on either side a separation shall be
							desired— <persRef ref="lowell-charles">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowell</persRef> then enquired if the documents were to be submitted
							to the Council relating to the dismission of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt, from the office of Pastor to the second Unitarian
							Church and Society in the City of New-York; where he was for some time
							settled— To this, <persRef ref="pierpont-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pierpont</persRef> of Boston objected—maintaining that
							it was a matter with which the Council had no concern; and intimating
							that the besetting Sin of Ecclesiastical Councils in all ages had been
							usurpation of Jurisdiction— Then arose an ardent and somewhat sharp
							debate upon the question whether the papers should or should not be
							read; which was finally terminated by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt himself’s requesting that they might be read, which they were. It
							appeared that the cause of his dismission from the New-York Congregation
							was their neglect to provide for his support—and the want of unanimity
							in his favour. He was dismissed at his own request, with a protest of a
							small number of the members of his congregation against the proceedings.
							The debate delayed the common consent of the Services more than a half
							an hour. It was near Noon, when the Procession preceded by the Committee
							of the Parish entered the Meeting-house— The order of the Services was
							1. An Anthem— 2. Introductory prayer and Selections from Scripture by
								<persRef ref="whitney-george2">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								George Whitney</persRef> of Roxbury. 3. A Hymn by <persRef
								ref="whitney-augustus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> F. A.
								Whitney</persRef>. 4. Sermon, by <persRef
								ref="frothingham-nathaniel">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham</persRef> of Boston. 5.
							Prayer of Installation, by the Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Peter
							Whitney, Senior Pastor of the Church. 6. Charge by the <persRef
								ref="parkman-francis">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis <pb n="4" type="ms"
								/>Parkman</persRef> of Boston. 7. Right hand of fellowship, by the
								<persRef ref="cunningham-francis">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
									M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cunningham</persRef> of
							Dorchester. 8. A Hymn by the Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham— 9. Address to the Society, by
							the <persRef ref="gannett-thomas">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gannett</persRef> of Boston. 10.
							Concluding prayer, by the <persRef ref="huntoon-benjamin">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Huntoon</persRef> of Milton. 11 An Anthem—and 12 the Benediction by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt the installed Pastor— The
							performances were all creditable— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frothingham’s Sermon admirable— From 1. Timothy 3.16. “And without
							controversy, great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in
							the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the
							Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.” The
							principal topic of the discourse was the manifestation of God in the
							person of Jesus Christ; and it was illustrated in the peculiar manner,
							and original train of thought and splendid composition of the preacher—
							There were allusions in the charge, in the right hand of fellowship, and
							in the Address to the Society, to the present condition of religious
							affairs, and to the recent changes in the Constitutional Laws of the
							Commonwealth relating to the connection between Ministers and their
							Congregations. The Services closed about half past two— The House was
							not quite filled— The members of the Council, preceded by the Committee
							of the Parish, returned to French’s tavern where they dined—about fifty
							persons— The dinner was short— There was cyder served but no wine I
							presided at the table as I had been requested to do by <persRef
								ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef>
							for the Committee, and just before the rising from Table returned the
							thanks of the Society and Church, to all the members of the Council in
							attendance, and especially to those Gentlemen who had taken part in the
							performances of the day— I said it had been my fortune to be absent
							during the time of the transactions between the Society and the new
							associate Pastor which had terminated in his instalment as the Colleague
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney this day. That I had however
							been informed of them from time to time as they had taken place, had
							approved of them all, and rejoiced exceedingly at the unanimity with
							which the Church and Society had agreed to invite M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt to settle with them as the Colleague
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney— That on my return three days
							since to my residence, I had been requested by the Committee of
							Arrangements to preside at the table this day, which office, all
							unfitted for it as I was, I had accepted with pleasure inasmuch as it
							afforded me the opportunity, in the name and behalf of the Society and
							Church to return their thanks, to all the members of the Council for
							their attendance and especially to the officiating members for their
							very appropriate and acceptable performances— We thanked them for the
							Instruction which we had received from their friendly ministrations we
							thanked them for their kind sympathies—for their good advice, and
							affectionate exhortations: we thanked them for their fervent prayers and
							asked the continuance of them; [“]that under the manifestation of the
							word of God, unfolded to us as it had been in the discourse of the day,
							in all its magnificence and splendour, the new relations formed between
							the colleague of the venerable pastor who sat at my side, might
							permanently redound to the welfare as well temporal as spiritual of the
							flock, and to the glory of God, in the promotion of Christian Piety and
							Christian Charity”— The grace was then said by the Rev<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierpont,
							and the company dispersed— The President of Harvard University, <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">Quincy</persRef>, and the former President,
								<persRef ref="kirkland-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kirkland</persRef> were present. <persRef ref="kendall-james">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Kendall</persRef>
							<pb n="5" type="ms"/>of Plymouth, and sundry others, mostly young men—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham came home with me, and
							paid a visit to <persRef ref="hellen-mary;adams-louisa-catherine">our
								Ladies</persRef>— As did <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> James H. Foster</persRef> and his
							daughters <persRef ref="foster-mary">Mary</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="foster-louisa">Louisa</persRef>— Mary is in very bad health,
							and looks as if in a deep consumption. <persRef ref="dorr-andrew">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Andrew Dorr</persRef> of Boston, with
								<persRef ref="dorr-andrew2">his Son</persRef> came to make enquiries
							concerning a claim which he had before the Commissioners under the
							French indemnity Treaty of 1831. and which he said they had rejected.
							The ship was taken by a French privateer in 1810. under the Berlin or
							Milan decree— She was retaken by a british armed vessel, and carried
							into an English Port, and there restored to the owners upon payment of
							heavy salvage, and this constitutes M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Dorr’s claim to indemnity under the Treaty with France. <persRef
								ref="nelson-jeremiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jeremiah
								Nelson</persRef> is M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dorr’s agent for
							pursuing his claim before the Commissioners, but he has not informed him
							upon what principles it was rejected by them— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dorr that I had heard the Treaty itself
							made no provision for any captures under the Berlin and Milan decrees
							except those cases which had been condemned after their revocation. He
							thought this strange— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dorr told me that
							his brother <persRef ref="dorr-john">John</persRef> was still living;
							but that his brother <persRef ref="dorr-joseph">Joseph</persRef> whom I
							last saw in Paris in 1815 was dead— My Son <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> came out from Boston, and was present at the
							services, but not at the dinner. He returned home towards Evening. I
							went to the Evening party at <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Greenleaf’s</persRef>— It was
							given to the two Ministers M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt— All the Whitney family, and
							almost all the Greenleafs were there—<persRef ref="baxter-catharine"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Baxter</persRef> and <persRef
										ref="u;u">her daughters</persRef>—<persRef ref="miller-edward">Edward Miller</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="miller-caroline">his wife</persRef>, <persRef ref="u"
								>Son</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">daughter</persRef>, M<hi

								Son</persRef> and <persRef ref="beale-ann"
								>daughter</persRef>—<persRef ref="woodward-ebenezer">Doctor
								Woodward</persRef>, and some who to me were strangers. There was a
							cold Supper, with fruits of the last year— I came home between ten and
							eleven— My wife and Mary were not well enough to go out any part of the
							day.</p>

						<p>There was an excitement in the transactions of yesterday, which did not
							entirely subside at Night— I slept little, and rose this morning very
							early. After writing sometime I visited my garden, and particularly the
							Eastern close where I began last autumn the experiment of raising fruit
							and forest trees from the seed— There are apples, pears, peaches and
							oaks— A very small portion up of those that I sowed, and of those that
							are up, two thirds or three-fourths likely to perish—suffering already
							much by the drought— I continued the row of maple-seeds under the fence
							doubtful whether any one of them will come up— At ten O’Clock <persRef
								ref="durand-asher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Durand</persRef>
							came, and I sat to him about two hours— Invited him to dine with us, but
							he was under an engagement to go this afternoon with <persRef
								ref="reed-luman">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Read</persRef> to
							Mount Auburn. He proposed to come out and take another sitting on
							Saturday; and I engaged him to come at twelve O’Clock; to stay and dine
							with us, which he promised. And I requested him to invite M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Read in my name to come with him, which he
							said he would propose— I took him with me to the top of the hill
							opposite my house to view the prospect of the Bay and of the surrounding
							Country— After dinner I reinspected my garden and Nursery; and found the
							last in the most indifferent condition. It is already so full of
							seedling plants of former years that there is nothing of the last
							Summer’s <pb n="6" type="ms"/>sowing in it, except about half a dozen
							chesnut oaks— All my strawberry vines of every variety, wild and
							cultivated are covered with blossoms— But whenever the Strawberry vines
							grow and are not carefully weeded, they are smothered with red clover
							which it is impossible to separate from them— I had six seedling Nettle
							trees the berries of which I sowed in May 1830— They came up last year
							in May and were of very slow growth. The winter has killed them all but
							one which is barely alive— This evening <persRef ref="adams-thomas5"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Adams</persRef> came, and
							proposed to me a pair of Carriage horses for which the owner asks 600
							dollars. I took it for consideration— He also said there had been a
							meeting of the inhabitants of the town who had resolved to celebrate the
							next 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July, and had chosen a
							Committee of which I was chairman, to procure an Orator— I have received
							five Volumes of the writings of <persRef ref="washington-george"
								>Washington</persRef>, from the second to the sixth inclusive, and
							have begun to read them</p>

								Ibrahim Bartlett</persRef> Secretary of a Meeting of the Citizens of
							Quincy, held on Wednesday Evening at the town Hall, brought me a written

							procure an Orator, and to report at the adjournment of the Meeting, on
							Saturday the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> half past seven in the

								father</persRef> of my <persRef ref="cranch-richard">uncle
								Cranch</persRef>, at the spot where the old Field, or as I call it,
							Trask house stood, and what price I would ask for it— I told him I would
							sell for a reasonable price but must make enquiry to ascertain what that
							would be— He said he had a large family to support and small means, and
							wishing to build a house preferred a retired spot, where he supposed the
							land would be comparatively cheap, to the positions where it is in great
							demand. My Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came from

								>Louisa-Catherine</persRef>; dined here, and returned early in the

							Boston Advocate has produced much excitement— I told him I wished to
							give him my collection of Medals and coins, and that he should undertake
							to arrange them and have them put up in suitable boxes and draws— There
							was this Evening a refreshing shower much needed— I went to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Greenleaf’s to agree with him for a
							meeting of the Committee, upon the celebration of Independence day—but
							he had already retired to bed— I visited my garden and nursery morning
							and afternoon— Finished sowing the row of maple Seeds, under the
							Northern fence of my Eastern close—very doubtful whether any of them
							will ever come up— My black and red Currant bushes are in bearing—the
							third year from the seed.</p>

								<persRef ref="tufts-quincy">Quincy Tufts</persRef> respecting the
							red cedar swamp in Randolph which once belonged to <persRef

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tufts wished to know whether I had any
							knowledge of this land— It is the same land which on the 21<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of September 1833. I visited with Zenas
							French; but I know little more about it. At Noon <persRef
								ref="reed-luman">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Read</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="durand-asher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Durand</persRef> came out from Boston. I sat again for my picture,
							and walked before dinner to the top of the hill opposite my house, with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Read, to shew him the prospect— They
							dined with us, and returned early after dinner to Boston— In the evening
							I called at <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thomas Greenleaf’s</persRef>, and found <persRef
								ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef>
							there— They agreed to meet on Monday Evening at my House, at seven
							O’Clock; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale engaged to notify
								<persRef ref="whitney-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Whitney</persRef> and <persRef ref="brigham-josiah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Josiah Brigham</persRef>, the two
							other members of the Committee appointed by the Citizens who resolved to
							celebrate the anniversary of Independence, to procure an Orator— We had
							some conversation upon the condition and prospects of the town of
							Quincy, in the increased and increasing demand for the granite, or
							rather Sienite Stone, which forms some of its rocks, and which is now so
							much used for building dwelling houses—not only in Boston, but in
							New-York, and New-Orleans. owning some of the land which bears this
							stone, there are enquiries geological, economical, and topical, which I
							ought to make concerning it. 1. Of the composition of the stone, and its
							varieties— 2. Of the number of ledges, and number of workmen, now
							employed upon them 3. Of the prices of the stone in its different
							qualities. 4. Of the different manners in which it is transported to the
							landing places, and thence to the places of its final destination. 5.
							other enquiries, to be suggested by the information obtained from the
							result of these.— In my garden I planted sundry peach-stones, and seeds
							of wintered apples, which I had collected to plant last autumn and left
							here when I was called away.— I began also to transfer to the last
							volume of my Diary, the minutes made during my late visit to
							Philadelphia.</p>

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> this morning from 2. Peter 1.12 “Wherefore I will not
							be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye
							know them, and be established in the present truth”— This was an
							occasional discourse, upon the duties and appropriate offices of a
							minister of the gospel, in his relations with his parishioners extremely
							well written and as well delivered as a languid manner, with much
							occasional effort at animation would admit. It was nearly an hour long,
							which was more than the patience of some of the auditory could approve—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt is said <pb n="8" type="ms"/>to
							have parted from his former flock at New-York in consequence of some
							defect of activity in his social relations with his parishioners, and
							there appeared to be some indirect allusion to this incident in the
							selection of his text, and in the purport of his discourse— In promising
							not to be negligent of his pastoral duties he asked for an indulgent
							consideration of their various nature, and of the obstacles to the
							entire fulfilment of one class of them, arising from the necessary
							devotion of time to another. The preparations for weekly public worship,
							necessarily occupying a large portion of time, and the cares of a
							domestic household absorbing another, he said would leave only a remnant
							which could be applied to friendly visiting of the members of the
							Society, perhaps once or twice a year— He spoke with great respect of
							his Senior associate <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef>, who was not
							present; reminded the people of his long and faithful Services, and
							expressed his confidence that they would ever retain, the sentiments of
							reverence and affection for him, which his good offices towards them as
							the minister of god in their exercises of public devotion, in the
							baptism of their children, in the solemnization of their marriages, in
							the last Offices of religion, over the remains of their departed
							relatives and friends, had so long and so amply deserved— At the close
							of the morning services M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt administered
							the communion, in which I participated, but sent the <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">children</persRef> home with
								<persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beale</persRef>— On coming home I found <persRef ref="degrand-peter"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef>, who had come
							out from Boston; and who dined with us, and went to meeting with me
							after dinner— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s afternoon text was
							from Matthew 5.8. “Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see
							God.” A contrasted parallel, between the objects which the world account
							as blessings, and those which are so characterised by Jesus Christ, and
							an exposition of what is to be understood, by the promise that the pure
							in heart <hi rend="italic">shall see God</hi>, formed the topics of this
							discourse— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand after tea, returned to
							Boston. I read the tenth Sermon of the sixth volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, upon general abuses.
							Applicable to all times, and all countries. We had as evening visitors
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel;greenleaf-elizabeth">M<hi

						<p>There was a frost last Night, and after attempting this morning to write

								Adams</persRef> came and found me there, and in settling with me his

							two hours— At nine O’Clock with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> in a Carriole
							of <persRef ref="gillet-simon">Gillet’s</persRef> driven by <persRef

							of May and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> who still

							came in, and <persRef ref="reed-luman">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Read</persRef> with his Son in Law, <persRef ref="allen-theodore"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Allen</persRef>, to look at the

							of my house in Court Street; and while I was there <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander H.
								Everett</persRef> came in, full of political speculation. Thence I
							went to the Athenaeum, and viewed the annual exhibition of pictures,

								ref="quincy-eliza">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Quincy</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="quincy-eliza2;quincy-anna;quincy-maria;quincy-abigail"

							which copy <persRef ref="davis-charles2">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								C. A. Davis</persRef> has made a present to my Son Charles’s wife—

								>Odiorne’s</persRef> Book Store, and paid for the Volumes of

								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef> from 2 to 6—and the
								7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> which they now delivered to me— We

								ref="beale-george">George W. Beale</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="brigham-josiah">Josiah Brigham</persRef>, members of the

							met at my house— <persRef ref="whitney-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> John Whitney</persRef> the other member of the Committee
							was suddenly taken ill this morning, and could not attend— After gravely

								Webster</persRef>, to Alexander H. or <persRef ref="everett-edward"
								>Edward Everett</persRef> to <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President

								>Josiah</persRef>, we finally settled upon giving an invitation to

								>r</hi> Webster would have been preferred; but he has just gone upon

							They are suffering severely from the drought; and many of this years
							shoots have already perished— The Oaks are still coming up, and under

							I yesterday discovered 20. and this Morning 25. A remarkable
							circumstance is that wherever I have put down a single seed or plant of

							invariably grows <pb n="10" type="ms"/>up with them, and in many cases
							entirely smothers them— I leave all the weeds round my young plants now

						<p>My Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came out, and
							brought with him his eldest boy <persRef ref="adams-john17">John
								Quincy</persRef>— I rode with Charles to the Railway house, and
							thence walked to the quarries of granite or Sienite Stone upon my land,
							which have recently been opened— There are two companies with whom he
							has contracted, and each of them has opened a waggon way from <persRef
								ref="hall-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall’s</persRef>
							way, to the quarry—both have begun to work, but with different prospects
							of success— The rocks lie in immense masses, shelving one over another;
							but there are varieties in the composition of the rocks, one portion of
							which only is in great demand— It is that which splits in large blocks,
							and has a uniform appearance of darkling blue, without any vein of a
							rusty reddish colour; for the latter when exposed to the atmosphere
							exudes a dusky smoky, discolouring matter, and is in no demand except
							for cellar-stone. This difference of the Stone is a discovery of late
							years, and first became generally known by the discolouring of the
							Quincy Meeting House, which is very great, to the excessive
							disappointment and mortification of the People— There is a taste of
							fashion for the bluish uniform colour, which makes the difference of
							value between that and all the rest, as great comparatively as between
							that of gold and copper, or of silver and tin— The Stone-cutters who
							have not the conveyance of the Railway cannot work the inferior Stone to
							make any profit, and after blasting it out of the rock are obliged to
							leave it on the ground One of the quarries now opened on my land appears
							to yield Stone of the best quality— The other as yet has brought out
							none but the stained stone, and the contractors are apprehensive they
							shall be obliged to abandon it— There is intermingled with the Stone,
							suitable for building, much of other kinds—loose rocks of entirely
							different character; and much of that which they call pudding Stone— As
							we were returning, Charles spoke to <persRef ref="bryant-gridley">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bryant</persRef>, the agent of the
							Railway company, about the places where the Railway passes through my
							lots and for which I never have been indemnified. He said he would
							mention it to the Directors of the Corporation— The President of which
							is <persRef ref="cary-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cary</persRef>, Son in Law to <persRef ref="perkins-thomas">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thomas H. Perkins</persRef>; and
							Perkins himself, <persRef ref="davis-isaac">Isaac P. Davis</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="jackson-patrick">Patrick T. Jackson</persRef> are in
							the direction. Bryant said it was their intention to lay anew the
							Railway to the Bunker-Hill ledge, which is out of repair, and has been
							for several years abandoned— There are now in the neighbourhood of the
								<pb n="11" type="ms"/>Railway-house, eight or ten sheds, with men at
							work hammering the Stone for the ornamental mouldings of the columns of
							the Astor house at New-York. While we were at the quarries a sudden and
							great change of weather took place. The morning was at high Summer
							heat—about noon the wind changed to the North-east, chilling cold; and
							brought up rain— Charles returned after dinner with his child to Boston—
							We had a fire in the parlour this Evening.</p>

						<p>I wrote a note this morning to <persRef ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Josiah Quincy j<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi></persRef> enquiring whether it would be agreeable and
							convenient to him to deliver an Oration in this town, on the approaching
							anniversary of Independence; and informing him that if it should be, he
							would receive an invitation to that effect from the Committee— I sent it
							down to his house, having heard that he and his family had come out from
							Boston— But it proved that they did not come out till this afternoon— My
							Letter was sent to him again, and towards evening he came in person, and
							told me that he would with pleasure deliver the Oration; but that as
							President of the Common Council of Boston, he should be obliged to be
							there on that day. I went in to <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale’s</persRef>, and gave him
								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy’s</persRef> answer to
							the invitation of the Committee, which I requested him to read, at the
							adjourned Meeting of the Citizens to-morrow evening, which it will not
							be in my power to attend— And I desired him to report also that I had
							written to Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Josiah Quincy j<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> and had received from him the above
							answer— I had been told that many of the Citizens would be glad to hear
							me deliver the Oration, and I requested M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Beale, if any such feeling should be manifested to say that I would
							cheerfully deliver the Oration, as I should be happy to gratify any wish
							of the Citizens of Quincy, but that circumstances of a domestic nature
							would render it a painful office at this time, it being not only the day
							of <persRef key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> death, but having
							since the last Anniversary lost a <persRef key="adams-john2">beloved
								Son</persRef>, who was born on that day— I did not wish explicitly
							to give this reason, but he might allude to it in general terms to avert
							any possible application to me. <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus
								Spear</persRef> came this morning, and I walked with him to the
							beach at the Mount Wollaston farm, and viewed two places, at one of
							which he was desirous that a wharf should be built— This is a great
							undertaking which if accomplished would doubtless be very advantageous
							to the farm, but the expense of which might far transcend its resulting
							profits— A road, a mill dam, a mill, and one or more dwelling houses are
							among M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spear’s contemplated associations
							with the building of a wharf—about all which I must reflect and enquire
							much before I proceed to undertake— The best place for the wharf appears
							to me to be opposite the old lime trees. Returning home I saw the canal
							wharf covered with blocks of the granite Stone, some of which <persRef
								ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi></persRef> was casing up, to be sent to New-Orleans; upon a
							contract by <persRef ref="u">Newcomb</persRef> for the Stone of a
							dwelling house for 1900 dollars— They have been, nine men, about two
							months at work for the performance of this contract, and are just now
							completing it— Adams asked me what I thought of having <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s</persRef>
							last Sunday morning Sermon printed— I told him, I should be much pleased
							with it, and would take ten copies, if it should be— There were two
							Sloops loading with Stone at the wharf— There was also much of the
							Stone, engaged for the works now in progress upon George’s Island— While
							I was out, <persRef ref="cruft-edward;cruft-elizabeth">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Cruft</persRef> from Boston were here with a <persRef ref="u">young
								English traveller</persRef> whom they introduced, said to be a
							relation of the <persRef ref="baringbrothers">Baring’s</persRef>, and
							after dinner, <persRef key="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef> widow,
								<persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Ann
								Adams</persRef> was here— She spent the winter chiefly in New-York,
							at <persRef ref="dewindt-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De
								Wint’s</persRef>, but has since been at Portland, Haverhill, and
							Medford— She returned to her house the day before yesterday.</p>

							Cary</persRef>, President of the Railway Corporation, and <persRef
								ref="bryant-gridley">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bryant</persRef>
							the Superintendent came this morning to speak upon the subject of their
							occupation of a part of my lots where the quarries of stone have been
							opened— The Bunker hill ledge portion of the railway crosses my Joy,
							Field and Savil lots, at three places, as I shewed them by the plan of
								<persRef ref="withington-mather">Mather Withington</persRef>, taken
							in August 1826. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cary said that <persRef
								ref="perkins-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thomas H
								Perkins</persRef>, now in Europe had requested him to take his place
							as President of the Corporation during his absence. That the company
							would readily indemnify me for the taking of my land, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bryant would give the necessary attention
							for ascertaining by agreement with me the amount of the indemnity.
							Bryant proposed to wait till the approach of Winter when the trees will
							be without leaves, for a joint accurate survey of the boundaries to
							which I assented— The Bunker-hill ledge portion of the Railway is now in
							a state of dilapidation, but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cary said
							the company might hereafter repair it, and resume the working of the
							ledge— <persRef ref="humphrey-levi">Levi Humphrey</persRef> was here,
							with a Braintree highway tax for the last year, which I paid— He asked
							me, if I did not wish to have a Stone-wall fence made on the road border
							of the lot I bought in 1832 of <persRef ref="baxter-james">James
								Baxter</persRef>; which he supposed necessary to preserve the
							growing Oaks upon the land from the intrusion of trespassing cattle— I
							told him I would go and view the lot, and if I should conclude to build
							the Wall, would let him know— He said there were eighty-one rods of Wall
							to make, and the cost of making it would be from 1 dollar and a quarter
							to a dollar and a half a rod— I went to Boston, with <persRef

								Adams</persRef>, the child <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna"
								>Fanny</persRef>, and <persRef ref="wilson-mary">M<hi

							Athenaeum, where <persRef ref="durand-asher">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Durand</persRef> has a chamber in the upper Story of the
							building. He took a sitting of the child till one O’Clock, while I
							deposited at the Savings Bank seventy dollars, in my own name, but for
							the benefit of <persRef ref="wilson-john8">John Wilson</persRef>, my
							Coachman, who left in my hands that sum to keep for him— I gave my Son
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> also, whom I found
							at his house 300 dollars in Bills, to deposit to my credit at the U.S.
							Branch Bank; for I have found inconvenience and danger of loss in
							keeping too large a sum of Bills, in my pocket-Book. I returned at one
							to the Athenaeum, and sat to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Durand till
							two— M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Adams, with M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Wilson and the child had gone to
							Charles’s house. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Durand said he should
							want another sitting both of me and of the child, and promised to come

							also a Portrait of my other Grand-child, <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Mary-Louisa</persRef>, which I propose to give to <persRef

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef>, in the morning from 1. Corinthians 13.13. [“]And now
							abideth faith, hope, charity, those three; but the greatest of these is
							charity”—and in the afternoon from Psalm 3.5. [“]I laid me down and
							slept: I awaked; for the Lord sustained me.” Both ingenious and well
							written discourses— That of the morning upon a very common topic—that of
							the afternoon, singular and original— There is a Sermon of <persRef
								ref="swift-jonathan">Dean Swift’s</persRef> upon sleeping in church;
							which is a Satire; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt may have intended
							indirect admonition to his hearers, by the selection of his subject, but
							it was not apparent in any part of the discourse itself— He considered
							Sleep, as a part of constitution of human nature—as a beneficent
							dispensation of Providence to Man—as furnishing by analogy an argument,
							in favour of the resurrection from death and the immortality of the
							Soul— He remarked that both in the Old and in the New Testament, Death
							is almost always mentioned under the name of Sleep as the kings of
							Israel and Judah who died of natural deaths are said to have slept with
							their fathers; and <persRef ref="paul">Saint Paul</persRef>,
							particularly when referring to the resurrection speaks always of the
							dead as being asleep— And Jesus himself before raising <persRef
								ref="lazarus">Lazarus</persRef> from the dead, said to his disciples
							“Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of
							Sleep[”]— In conclusion the auditory were reminded of their obligation,
							whenever they enjoyed the blessing of Sleep, to employ the first moment
							of awaking in grateful ejaculation to the bountiful creator by whom it
							is bestowed— The Sermon upon Charity, considered that virtue in its most
							comprehensive sense, as that Love which is the highest attribute of God
							and which in the Scripture God himself is said to be. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt noticed this peculiarity of the
							Christian and Jewish System of Religion, as distinguishing it above all
							others, though even in the heathen mythology he said that Love was
							represented as the first and most antient of all the Gods, the father of
							them all, and of men— He marked the distinctions between the virtues of
							Faith, Hope and Charity, and their relations with the several faculties
							of Man. Faith as the operation of Reason, Hope of the Imagination, and
							Charity of the Heart. He described their several properties, their
							influences upon the conduct, and their adaptations to the condition and
							to the happiness of man—concluding as he began by repeating his text—and
							now abideth Faith, Hope, Charity—these three— But the greatest of these
							is Charity. I read the eleventh Sermon of the sixth Volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, upon the advantages of Piety,
							or as the English Translation of the Bible has it of godliness: and I
							began again to read <persRef ref="milman-henry">Milman’s</persRef>
							History of the Jews having already read heretofore great part of the
							first Volume— I had also <pb n="15" type="ms"/>time for writing a page
							of Diary. We had evening visits from <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef>, and his daughter
							<persRef ref="beale-ann">Ann</persRef>, from <persRef ref="miller-edward">Edward Miller</persRef> and

						<p>There was another sudden change of weather yesterday, about five O’Clock
							in the afternoon from high Summer heat to cold craving a fire— The night
							was cold and so was all this day though clear— <persRef ref="carr-john2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carr</persRef> mowed the grass
							in my garden, but the clover was so thick and matted that it had wholly
							smothered my plant of Strawberry from over the hill, and a number of my
							seedling trees. <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thomas Greenleaf</persRef> came to look at my young
							trees in the garden and Nursery; and we went over the wall, and viewed
							with <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beale</persRef> the Apple trees, from which he has been extracting
							the borer worms— They were in ten or twelve of his trees, several in
							each tree between the bark and the wood— But later in the Season they
							bore directly to the heart of the tree. The tenth of June is the time
							for eradicating them, and they are then within six inches from the
							surface of the ground, moving upwards. I had morning visits from
								<persRef ref="jackson-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jackson</persRef>, the member of Congress from the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> district, and from the Lieutenant
							Governor and now acting <persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">Governor
								Armstrong</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jackson told me
							he had seen <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								John Bailey</persRef> last week, and never expected to see him
							again—that he was in the last stage of decline, with a lung fever— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jackson and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Armstrong were both overflowing with Politics, and especially with the
							prospects of the next Presidential election— They both believe that
							according to present appearances <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren</persRef> will be elected;
							but are both extremely averse to taking his side— They were anxious to
							know my opinions which I freely gave them— Intending to be the partizan
							of no man myself, and believing that in point of principle there is not
							the weight of a feather to chuse between the candidates before the
							public, I told them that since the issue of the democratic Convention at
							Baltimore, and especially of the elections to the Legislature of
							Virginia, it appeared to be reduced to a certainty, as much as any event
							depending upon popular elections could be foreseen, that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren would be elected. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jackson said he had last week received a
							Letter from <persRef ref="slade-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Slade</persRef> of Vermont, who was very much opposed to Van Buren;
							which I attributed to the personal resentments for which Slade has had
							so much cause— I told him how ill Slade had been treated by Van Buren,
							and how much I sympathised with him in the sense of his wrongs— I added
							there were other things in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren’s
							treatment of me, which I had reason deeply to resent; but a public life
							ought to be a perpetual sacrifice of resentments— There is not a
							Presidential Candidate before the People at this day, who has not
							treated me ill. I must forgive them all— In the turbid stream of
							political life a consciencious man, must endeavour to do justice to all,
							and to return good for evil; but he must always expect a return of evil
							for good— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Armstrong is much dissatisfied
							with the arrangements of the triumvirate <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
								>Webster</persRef>, <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward
								Everett</persRef>, and <persRef ref="davis-john4">John
								Davis</persRef> in disposing of the Government of the Commonwealth
							as they did, to Everett. He thinks the People of the Commonwealth will
							not ratify the bargain— But the People of the Commonwealth have been so
							managed for the last six years, that I know not how long they may be
							kept in their leading strings— Armstrong told me that it had <pb n="16"
								type="ms"/>been signified to him as the wish of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster that he should preside at the
							Meeting at Faneuil Hall, which he had declined— He said that he felt
							compassion for Webster, knowing the great disorder of his private
							pecuniary concerns—and it was so great that he did not see how it would
							be possible for him to continue in public life at-all— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Armstrong said also something to me about
							the movements against foreigners in this Commonwealth, and he brought me
							the Reports of the Commissioners for the revisal of the Statute Laws—a
							work not yet completed— In the afternoon I rode with the <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary;adams-louisa-catherine">Ladies</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">children</persRef> over
							to Dorchester, and I called to see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bailey— I found him sitting up, in a rocking chair, alone, feeble,
							emaciated, with a thick winter cloak over him, and his hands, burning
							with fever— Able to speak very slowly, with a hollow voice scarcely
							above a whisper and a sepulchral cough— I should suppose he could not
							continue to the end of the month, yet he spoke of his condition, as if
							yet susceptible of recovery. He gave me an account of his disease, from
							its first attack about the beginning of March, and its vicissitudes of
							apparent convalescence and of relapses, which have left a lingering hope
							with him, for which there is evidently no foundation— He said something
							to me of public affairs; but fearing to exhaust his strength by much
							conversation I abridged my visit, and promised to call shortly, and see
							him again— Evening at home.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="baxter-james">James Baxter</persRef> was here this morning,

							which I purchased of him in November 1832— He assured me there was not
							and never had been such a mortgage— That he had offered one to his

							and the debt was now paid— <persRef ref="spear-william">William
								Spear</persRef> was here shortly afterwards, and seemed inclined to
							doubt whether there had not been such a mortgage. He said his brother
								<persRef ref="spear-daniel">Daniel</persRef>, the Deacon, now
							deceased had told him that Baxter himself had said to him that his
							brother had had a mortgage, on the lot, but that he had taken it up—
							Spear returned to me two Deeds and a plan of a woodlot which we viewed
							last October, and about the bounds of which there was question made by
								<persRef ref="bracket-lemuel">Lemuel Brackett</persRef>— He says
							Brackett persevered in contesting the bounds till <persRef
								ref="humphrey-levi">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Humphrey</persRef> the Surveyor went with them and viewed the lot,
							and settled the question against Brackett at once— I agreed to go some
							day next week to the lots where the ledges have been opened this Spring,
							and to mark the places where they are crossed by the Bunker-hill ledge
							railway— <persRef ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field</persRef> was here,
							and gave me a vote of the meeting of Citizens last Evening for the
							celebration of the Anniversary of Independence. It was a vote of thanks
							to the Committee, who had been appointed to procure an Orator, and
							discharging them from further consideration of the subject— After which
							another Committee was chosen for the same purpose— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Field made some enquiry concerning
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>, and asked if I would write to him, upon his

							declined— He then said that <persRef ref="lincoln-solomon">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Solomon Lincoln</persRef> of Hingham
							had been mentioned, as a suitable person to deliver <pb n="17" type="ms"
							/>the Oration; and asked if I knew him— I said I did, and that I had no
							doubt he would deliver a very good Oration; and would be a very proper
							person to apply to— He also asked if next October would not complete the
							century from <persRef key="adams-john">my fathers</persRef> Birthday. I
							said it would— We had much more conversation, upon the concerns of the
							Town and Parish— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Field is a butcher—the
							most active and enterprizing man in the town, and is now for the first
							time one of its Representatives in the Legislature of the Commonwealth—
							He told me that he was the first child, that <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef>
							had christened, and that the first child christened by <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> was
								<persRef ref="field-john">his Son</persRef>—last Sunday evening at
							his house— This afternoon <persRef ref="thayer-stephen">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Stephen Thayer</persRef>, came with
								<persRef ref="thayer-stephen2">his nephew</persRef>, of the same
							name to enquire if he could procure, for the Braintree Lyceum, a Set of
							the Diplomatic Correspondence, edited by <persRef ref="sparks-jared"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparks</persRef>, and published
							by order of Congress— He said there were two Literary Institutions in
							Braintree—one the Lyceum, specially incorporated, and the other a
							Library, and reading room Association, according to a general
							corporation Law of the State acting as a corporate body— One of these
							has received the first set of the diplomatic correspondence in 12
							Volumes, and the other the second set in seven. He wanted the first set,

						<p>A distant salute of 24 guns at Sunrise, announced this as the Bunker hill
							anniversary, and roused me half an hour later than the proper time from
							my bed. My visit to the garden was short and at ten O’Clock, <persRef
								ref="durand-asher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Durand</persRef>
							came. He continued painting the Portrait of my Grandchild <persRef
								ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny</persRef>, and began upon that of
								<persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>— He told me that
								<persRef ref="allen-theodore">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Allen</persRef>, the Son in Law of <persRef ref="reed-luman">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Read</persRef>, after returning with
							him to New-York had come back to Boston, to purchase for him some
							Shells, of which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Read is making a
							collection.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Durand dined with us, and
							returned immediately after dinner to Boston— My Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came out with <persRef
								ref="davis-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Davis</persRef> and took tea with us, and returned in the Evening—
							Charles left with me numbers 1 and 2. of his Papers signed a Whig of the
							Old School, which are to be published in the Boston Centinel— He has
							commenced as a writer of political controversy, and has published in the
							Boston Advocate, a series of nine numbers of Political Speculation,
							under the signature of a Whig Antimason— They have already drawn
							considerable public attention, and these papers when published in the
							Centinel, will draw much more— The undertaking is perilous; for it is to
							counteract a prevailing torrent of popular opinion, in the place where
							he resides— But he has the cause of Truth, of Justice and of the
							Constitution— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis asked me, if there
								<pb n="18" type="ms"/>was in any of the Latin Poets such a line as
							Tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis— I said surely there was, in
								<persRef ref="ovid">Ovid</persRef>; and I repeated the line Et
							fugiunt freno non remorante dies as immediately succeeding it— But upon
							consulting the Book, I found the lines “Tempora labuntur, tacitisque
							senescimus annis,</p>
						<lg>
							<l>Et fugiunt freno non remorante dies”— Fasti 6.770.</l>
						</lg>
						<p>the first of which lines expresses the same sentiment, but in far more
							poetical language, and beautiful imagery— Where the other line
							originated— Tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis, I cannot
							recollect, nor where I read it—though it has been long familiar to my
							Memory— I paid an Evening visit to <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi

						<p>Passed the day without interruption of visitors; but the work of the

						<p><date>19. IV:30. </date>Friday— Boston— Quincy</p>
						<p>I wrote this morning till Breakfast Time and besides the Diary of
							yesterday filled up one page of arrears of the last volume in September
							1833— I give myself this for a morning task, through the Summer, if I
							can so long hold to my purpose— At ten O’Clock I went with my
							grand-child <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="wilson-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Wilson</persRef> to Boston. I left them at the Athenaeum, where
								<persRef ref="durand-asher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Durand</persRef> took a sitting for the Portrait of the child. I
							went thence to my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							Office, and returned to him the two papers that he had prepared, on the
							Patronage bill which passed the Senate at their last Session and which
							are to be published in the Boston Centinel. I made some observations to
							him upon the papers, and suggested to him some ideas— But the
							composition is entirely his own, and he will prefer that it should so
							continue, as it is best that it should. He has opened to himself a
							controversy, the result of which it is not easy to foresee; but of which
							my hopes anticipate a favourable issue. And all my hopes of futurity in
							this world are now centered upon him, and upon his employment of his <pb
								n="19" type="ms"/>time. I spoke to him also of the collection of
							coins and medals which I have given him, and which he is to arrange and
							assort and distribute; and to put up in an appropriate desk, with a
							descriptive catalogue of them to be made— And I further mentioned to him
							my wish to erect a small building of Stone, in which my Library may be
							preserved, and <persRef key="adams-john">my fathers</persRef> and my own
							manuscript books and papers may be kept, at least in some degree secure
							from fire— He made some objection to this, intending himself at some
							future day to build a House at Quincy, where the Library may be
							conveniently kept—but after some conversation with me he appeared to
							give up his objection, and will procure a plan and estimates for the
							building that I propose— I visited at <persRef ref="armstrong-samuel"
								>Governor Armstrong’s</persRef>, but he was not at home.—at <persRef
								ref="winthrop-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas L
								Winthrop’s</persRef>, and he received me— He read me a Letter from
							Colonel<space/>a citizen of the Republic of central America, and charged
							as he says with a diplomatic mission to the United States— The Letter is
							dated at New-York, but gives an account of a city in central America,
							which he visited last Summer, and where he says he found the ruins of a
							Temple 250 yards long 200 broad, and 40 yards high— He says also that he
							found there some exquisitely wrought works of art—and an instrument for
							working in Sculpture of fine Stone— From the inspection of his
							discoveries in that City he infers that the American Hemisphere is the
							seat of the most antient civilization, and that it passed from thence to
							Asia, Africa and Europe— And as it was totally extinguished in America,
							it is now in deep decline in China and Hindostan, and to a lesser degree
							in Africa, and still less in Europe— I told M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Winthrop I thought his theory hardly warranted by the facts
							stated in the Letter—particularly as the working instrument found by the
							writer was of stone, shewing the want of iron instruments— But a Temple
							of such dimensions surely indicates a populous country and a high degree
							of civilization— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Winthrop invited me to
							dine with him, but I was engaged— I returned to Charles’s House, and at
							four O’Clock went with him to <persRef ref="everett-alexander">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander H. Everett’s</persRef> where
							we dined— <persRef ref="everett-lucretia">M<hi rend="superscript"

								Whitney</persRef> and one other Gentleman were the company— Most of
							them are members of the Committee of the State Legislature for revising
							the Statute Law of the Commonwealth; and they are sitting during the
							recess of the General Court— At seven O’Clock I returned with Charles to
							his house, and thence with Mary-Louisa and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Wilson home to Quincy. About half the time we came through
							a very heavy thunder shower, with a continual glare of Lightening, a
							fresh gale and torrents of rain— But we landed all safe just before the
							Temple-bell rang nine— The morning had been fair with a promise of a
							beautiful day— It clouded up about 3 in the afternoon— The gust came on
							suddenly at the dusk of Evening— I met and spoke with <persRef

						<p>I was three hours from Breakfast time till Noon in my Garden and Nursery.
							Filled Pot N<space/>with fresh Earth and planted all my remnant of old
							seeds, Elm, Maple, Peach, Plum, and wintered Apple— The experiment is to
							ascertain, if any of these will come up, in the course of the present
							Season— I trimmed a number of my trees; and left many of them untouched—
							The Oaks are yet daily coming up under the Northern fence of the Eastern
							close— Trimmed the Vine at the Southwest corner of the House— The
							clover, red and white has invaded every part of the Garden— Morning
							visit from <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef>—
							Conversation with him, on the condition of the University, and on
							Politics— He says the result of the proceedings upon the disorders of
							the last year has been favourable, and that the discipline of the
							College is more effective than it had been for many years but it is
							apparent that he is weary of his place, and I apprehend that the mass of
							the Students are weary of him— He feels little interest in the politics
							of the day, his faculties being absorbed in the discharge of his present
							official duties—but there seems to be an inclination to return to the
							larger world and to cast off the Square cap and collegiate gown— He told
							me of his visit yesterday to his old preceptor of Andover, <persRef
								ref="pemberton-ebenezer">Pemberton</persRef>, dying at the age of
							ninety, and also remembered with pride and self gratulation that the
							first Scholar he had ever offered for admission at Cambridge is now
							President of the University— My occupation for the day was writing my
							Diary—one page of redemption of arrears in September 1833—and progress,
							in the assortment and catalogue of the Coins and Medals that I have
							given to <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>— And teaching my
							grand-daughter, <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef> to

						<p><date>21. IV:10. </date>Sunday— Summer Solstice— Sun rose 4:27.</p>
						<p>Heard <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> this morning from Hebrews 2:4. [“]God also bearing
							them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and
							gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will”? and in the
							afternoon from Luke 9.34. [“]While he thus spake there came a cloud and
							overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered the cloud. 35. And
							there came a voice out of the cloud saying, This is my beloved Son: hear
							him.” The morning discourse was principally an exposition of what he
							called the <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> miracles of the gospel of
							Christ— He observed that Jesus Christ himself had rested much if not all
							of the faith on his gospel, which he required of his disciples, upon the
							evidence of the miracles that he performed— He came to improve the
							condition of man in the Nature of Man himself—to eradicate some of the
							vicious principles of his nature to call forth into action some of his
							latent capacities of virtue— To obtain the confidence of mankind for the
							fulfilment of this object, he exercised before them the power of
							suspending and controuling the operations of physical nature. He changed
							water into wine—he fed thousands with five loaves and two fishes—he
							exorcised evil Spirits he healed the sick—he raised the dead to life—and
							he received at different times the miraculous testimonial of God himself
							of the authenticity of his mission from him <pb n="21" type="ms"/>These
							miraculous testimonials, continued, at and after his death, so long as
							they were deemed by divine wisdom necessary for the propagation of the
							gospel— They had ceased after the age of the Apostles—but the moral
							miracles of the gospel had not ceased, they were yet in operation still
							gradually purifying the heart and improving the condition of man— The
							illustrations of this position were copious and eloquent— The afternoon
							Sermon was not less so— It was upon the Transfiguration—one of those
							miraculous testimonials by the direct interposition of the Deity, to the
							truth of the mission of Christ— He said there was a difference of
							opinion among the commentators, whether this was a real transaction; or
							a vision or dream of the apostles, who are said to have been heavy with
							Sleep; while <persRef ref="peter">Peter</persRef> is represented as
							speaking without knowing what he said— But the story is told in <persRef
								ref="luke">Luke</persRef> as of a real transaction; and is so
							represented by Peter in his second Epistle— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt made a practical application of his discourse, by
							representing the various evils incident to human life, as overshadowing
							clouds, which we may naturally fear to enter, but from the midst of
							every one of which may be heard a voice; saying, This is my beloved Son—
							Hear him. The delivery of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt is
							languid, with continual efforts of animation— His composition is good,
							his thoughts ingenious, with more of pathos than of close logical
							argument— I read the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon of the
								8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>; upon the Dedication of the
							French Protestant Temple at Voorburg—in 1726— It is a parallel, between
							the Condition of the Jews, under the Assyrian and Babylonian
							captivities, and that of the French refugees under the persecuting
							Edicts of <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis the 14<hi rend="superscript"
									>th.</hi></persRef>— He directly refers to nine of those Edicts
							issued in the twenty years from 1669 to 1689. but even in 1726. long
							after the death of Louis 14. and in another Country than France, a
							Frenchman, himself one of the fugitives from the execrable tyranny of
							that king, could not speak of it with the indignation that it deserved—
							The tone of the Sermon is rather plaintive than resentful— Louis 14. is
							not named—much less treated as <persRef ref="tillotson-john"
								>Tillotson</persRef> treats him in his Sermons— Saurin mingles with
							his lamentations grateful acknowledgments to the People of Holland, for
							the kindness with which they had received and treated the refugees— The
							occasion upon which this Sermon was preached was however a full half
							century, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and when the
							refugees had in reality melted down into dutchmen— I made a short tour
							in my garden and Nursery, and in the Evening visited <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-john;greenleaf-lucy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							one in box number 2. My Oaks still continue daily to pierce the ground—
							I counted 83 in the Eastern close, under its Northern fence this

						<p>My garden has been neglected for annual cultivation till the growth of

							Hickory shews itself in the S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Germain Pear

						<p>I have undertaken the last two days to labour more assiduously in

									rend="superscript">r</hi> John W. Sullivan</persRef> of Boston,
							Son of <persRef ref="u">Deacon Sullivan</persRef>, who has formed an
							establishment at Germantown, came this morning to make enquiries

							the grant of the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">king of Spain</persRef> to
							the <persRef ref="alagon-unknown">Duke of Alagon</persRef>.— I told them
							they were all null and void—originally fraudulent, and expressly
							declared null and void by the king of Spain, in the ratification of the
							Treaty of cession— He asked also what was the character of the grant to
								<persRef ref="arredondo-fernando">Arredondo</persRef>— I told him I
							was not able to speak with certainty of that— He enquired if persons had
							settled upon public Lands without regular title, whether they could be
							confirmed in possession by Petition to Congress. I said Congress
							sometimes granted rights of pre-emption, upon Petition, to irregular
							Settlers upon Public Lands. <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">E. Price
								Greenleaf</persRef> was here this Evening, and I had conversation
							with him upon seedling plants and trees— Of those that are newly come
							up, the danger from the Sun is just now commencing— M<hi

							tree planted by my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							some years since in my Eastern close, and which are now growing
							vigorously, Also an Ash, from a seed sown by me, and transplanted into
							the close in October 1833.— The Ash is one of the Trees best suited to
							raising from the seed; being of rapid growth, enduring both frost and
							Sun—growing with a straight stem, and little annoyed so far as I have
							witnessed by Insects, field mice or Squirrels— The beetle bug sometimes
							bites off its top, but that seems to be a necessary operation to prevent
							its growth by too slender a stem— I have even this day and yesterday
							headed down one Chesnut Oak, and four pignut hickory trees in my Summer
							house cellar— The bark of one of those Oaks in the cellar, shells off
							like the Shell bark hickory. I have six cherry-trees well laden with

							Hickory, from a nut planted last Autumn, and two Maples from the seeds
							which I brought from Philadelphia— The plant which broke ground on the
								21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> in Pot N. 1. is also a maple, the
							seed of which I sowed on the first of the Month—a second came out this
							day— It is then ascertained that the maple-seed like the Elm-seed ripens
							in the Spring— At Washington and Philadelphia, from the first to the
							fifteenth of May—that they may be gathered in all the month of May, and
							that the time for sowing the seeds is then— I now regret that I did not
							gather ten times the quantity of seeds that I did.— I fix at twenty
							days, the time for the maple seed, to come up. We had this day a tart
							from the cherries of our garden, and a dish of very good Strawberries,
							the first ripe— I sowed in Pot N. 15. six large Downton Strawberries for
							an experiment— In the old Pear tree patch 1. from East to west I planted
							a heap of the cherry-stones from the trees, and of which the Robins and
							Catbirds had picked off the fruit— They strip the trees without
							compassion, and make equally free with the Strawberries. I have found 24
							seedling Oaks up, along the Eastern fence of my Nursery—and shall have
							about 150 seedling Oaks of the present Season— Their most dreaded enemy
							now is the Sun—there will probably not be ten of them to survive the

									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Josiah</persRef>, for <persRef

							be 300 persons at the dinner, which is to be under a Pavilion, upon the
							lot given by <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> to the Town,
							called the Hancock lot— He intimated that there was some
							dissatisfaction, of some of the members of the first Committee appointed
							to procure an Orator, that they had been discharged and another
							Committee chosen, but he said it was not intended to offend the first
							Committee— I assured him that it had given no offence to me—that if I
							had been present at the first meeting I should have asked owing to the
							particular <pb n="25" type="ms"/>circumstances of my family to be
							excused, and after failing in the application to President Quincy and
							his Son, I was glad to be relieved from further service on the

								ref="lincoln-solomon">Solomon Lincoln</persRef> to deliver the
							Oration, and should have very cheerfully applied to him had his name

								<persRef ref="whitney-john">John Whitney</persRef> were averse to
							having any celebration at-all— He asked me, if I would write a hymn, for

							it would be best to have it now by some other person— In Boston, M<hi

							a quarter of an hour. He said he proposed to leave the City on his

							He shewed me also his garden, his vines and his fruit-trees. The garden
							is a square spot, I think about eighty-feet square; with high-buildings
							on every side, and thus protected from all the winds— He has a few fine
							Plum, Apricot, and Pear trees, and Currant-bushes in excellent order, as

						<p>Fog, and alternately a drizzling mist the whole day, with rain to wet the

								<persRef ref="read-nathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathan
								Read</persRef>, of Belfast in the State of Maine had been here
							yesterday, while I was at Boston, and called again before breakfast this
							morning— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Read supposes that he has
							invented, an improvement upon the Construction of Boilers and
							Steam-Engines, to prevent the bursting of the Boilers—of which the
							instances are so frequent and so fatal. He said the explosions almost
							always happened when the Steamer was not on motion—usually just after
							she came to a landing. Its occasion was generally, was the boilers being
							drained of water, and heated to red heat. His invention was a float upon
							a cylinder, to rise and fall with the rotation of the paddle wheels, and
							open and close a valve to keep <pb n="26" type="ms"/>always a supply of
							water in the Boiler, sufficient to prevent its bursting. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Read had several diagrams, upon which he
							pointed out to me the operation of his invention as intended by him; not
							however so clearly as to make it fully intelligible to me, and he
							admitted that it would somewhat diminish the speed of the boat— He was
							desirous of making his invention known by offering it to the Government
							of the United States, if they would undertake to make the experiment— I
							advised him to wait for the next Session of Congress— The danger of
							explosion of Steamboat boilers has already been a subject of discussion
							in the House of Representatives of the United States, to which an
							elaborate report upon it was made by a Committee at a former Session;
							but no Legislation concerning it has yet ensued— It will probably be
							resumed at the next Session, and I advised M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Read to have a model of his invention made shewing the
							operation of it to supply the Boiler constantly with water, to take out
							a Patent for it, and then to make communication of it to Congress, when
							they shall be engaged in making provision against these disastrous
							accidents by Law— He said he would follow this advice— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Read, was the Tutor of my Class, at the
							University— He must be now near seventy-five years of age—he has a turn
							for mechanical inventions, and has busied his whole life upon them, with
							little profit to himself, and not much benefit to the world— He was for
							some years a member of Congress, but has long been retired from public
							life, and bears upon his countenance the marks of age— About sixteen
							years ago, I saw him at Washington, taking out a Patent for some other
							invention, and then he borrowed money of me to pay for his board and
							travelling expenses, which it took him two or three years to repay— He
							is an honest, intelligent, learned, ingenious man, with faculties to
							invent Steam-engines, and to be pinched with hunger for bread— He thinks
							that <persRef ref="fulton-robert">Fulton</persRef> stole his Steam boat
							from him; and he shewed me two certificates, one of them from a
							Committee of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and signed by
							<persRef ref="cranch-richard">Richard Cranch</persRef>, <persRef ref="willard-joseph2">Joseph Willard</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="baldwin-loammi">Loammi Baldwin</persRef>, and another,
							dated in April 1790. that they had examined an invention presented by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Read, for propelling boats by water
							or carriages by Land by the means of Steam, and expressing a favourable
							opinion of its practicability, and of its usefulness— The other
							certificate was dated at New-York, about the same time, and had
							reference to the first Patent Law then preparing in Congress. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Read said that there was a Section in the
							Act as first prepared providing for a limitation of the profits made by
							any invention, if they should become exorbitant; and that at his
							expostulation against it that it was struck out— The weather confined me
							much to the house, though I visited my garden Nursery and Eastern close
							so as to wet my feet uncomfortably— I received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">A. H. Everett</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="thatcher-benjamin">B. B. Thatcher</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="weston-ezra">E. Weston jun<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="spooner-john">Doctor John T. Spooner</persRef> dated
							at Dorchester this day, and informing me of the decease of my highly
							valued friend <persRef ref="bailey-john">John Bailey</persRef>— He died
							yesterday morning, and is to be buried from <persRef
								ref="cunningham-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cunningham’s</persRef> Meeting house, at four O’Clock next Monday

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> this morning from John 1.17.—“Grace and Truth came by
							Jesus Christ.” A parallel between the Christian Religion and others— A
							forcible remark in this Discourse was the simplicity of the Christian
							system as it appears in the new Testament compared with the complication
							and casuistry of the Sectarians called the Fathers of the Church, and of
								<persRef ref="calvin-john">Calvinism</persRef>— He noted especially
							the small number of precepts of which the gospel consists— This is true—
							The Mission of Christ had two objects—Glory to God—Good will to Man— It
							brought Life and immortality to light— It taught the immortality of the
							Soul, and the responsibility of man to a future state of existence, as
							articles of Faith—and assuming that as a Foundation, it taught Love to
							God, and Love to his fellow creature, as comprizing the whole duty of
							Man— It said to the human being—God is your Father—Man is your
							brother—Your duty to God, is filial affection and obedience—your duty to
							man is brotherly Love— This is simple, comprehensive and sublime— There
							is no metaphysical mystification in this— But in <persRef ref="paul"
									>S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul’s</persRef> argumentative
							Epistles, and in <persRef ref="john">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								John’s</persRef> Platonic musings, there is the foundation of all
							the metaphysical subtleties of subsequent ages. There has also been
							great misapprehension of the figurative language of Christ—
							Transubstantiation, is the mere taking in a literal sense, that which
							was spoken as a metaphor. So is regeneration—so is the doctrine of the
							atonement— The divinity of Christ is more directly asserted by S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John and S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Paul, than by Jesus himself— He claimed to be the Son of God—but this
							too was a metaphor— He said, before <persRef ref="abraham"
								>Abraham</persRef> was “I am”— His language concerning himself was
							not so clear or so simple as his precepts— His religion is all divine—
								<persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitney</persRef> preached in the afternoon, from 1. Timothy 1.17.
							“Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be
							honour and glory for ever and ever, Amen[”]— A unitarian Sermon—composed
							apparently with more meditation than M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney has been accustomed to bestow upon his Pulpit exercises— He
							divided the discourse into the consideration of the several attributes
							of God, as enumerated in the text, and the consolations to be derived
							from them in the conduct of human life—dwelling impressively upon the
							words “the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> wise God,” as decisive of the
							divine Unity— The morning was lowering, but the Sky cleared up, and I
							took <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny</persRef> to Meeting with me
							after dinner— I read the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon of the
								6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>—upon the affliction of the
							righteous, occasioned by the Sins of the wicked— The preacher sets out
							by stating that People generally understand the obligation of Sinners,
							to mourn for their own transgressions; but that very few are aware of
							the duty of suffering affliction for the Sins of others, and he presents
								<persRef ref="david">David</persRef>, as having furnished the most
							illustrious example of both these kinds of affliction— He says that in
							contemplation of human reason it is liable to much controversy, whether
							a virtuous man enjoys more happiness in the present life, than the
							wicked; but that the Holy Spirit has decided that godliness has the
							promises of this life, and that if there are exceptions to this
							principle, they are <pb n="28" type="ms"/>not in the conscience of the
							virtuous— In considering the fate which awaits the wicked in the future
							world, and the affliction which this might shed upon the upright, he is
							met with the objection, how the felicity of the virtuous can be perfect,
							if they must witness the sufferings of the wicked whom they loved, and
							with whom they had ties of consanguinity upon Earth— His answer to this
							difficulty is not satisfactory— He says that the happiness of the next
							world, will be the result of order, and will therefore not be disturbed
							by any punishment of the wicked for disorderly guilt— I hope there is
							better warrant for the future happiness of the good than this— I read
							also some pages of <persRef ref="milman-henry">Milman’s</persRef>
							History of the Jews;—paid an Evening visit to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt, who I found with <persRef ref="lunt-ellen">M<hi

							Massachusetts— The House vacated his election upon the absurd pretence
							that he was at the time when elected a Clerk in an Executive Department—
							The People of the District immediately re-elected him, and the House
							then received him— He was afterwards re-elected to three successive
							Congresses, until 1831. He has since been two years a member of the
							Senate of the Commonwealth from the County of Norfolk, and was the
							Anti-Masonic Candidate for Governor this present year— He was a man of
							excellent principles, of sound understanding, and of benevolent
							character. Purely republican, and devoted to Liberty and good
							Government— He had taken an active part in the principal political
							controversies of the last twenty-five years; but always with great
							moderation— Shortly before his election to Congress and while in the
							Department of State, he had married <persRef ref="u">Miss
								Young</persRef>, a niece of <persRef ref="young-moses">Moses
								Young</persRef>, who had also been a Clerk in the Department of
							State— She was of an Irish family; her father having been a <persRef
								ref="u">brother</persRef> of Moses Young, at whose invitation they
							all came to this Country, about the year 1820— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bailey leaves five children. His wife has been for two or
							three years threatened with pulmonary consumption, and little <pb n="29"
								type="ms"/>expected to survive him— He took his death, by exposure,
							in the exertions to save the house in which he lived from a fire, with
							which it was in danger from the conflagration of a factory in its
							neighbourhood about the first of March last— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bailey was in the 53<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> year of
							his age— He was one of the warmest and most faithful of my friends. I
							feel his loss, as of a brother— After the funeral, I went by invitation
							to the house of <persRef ref="morton-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Joseph Morton</persRef>, where several of the Antimasons
							from Boston, took tea—<persRef ref="hallett-benjamin;hallett-laura">M<hi

						<p>On this last day of the month, I took note of the seedling plants up
							under the Northern fence of my Eastern close and found 104 Oaks. 22
							Apple-trees, 19 Pears, 1 Pignut, and 5 grape-vines, with 8 Maples of the
							seed that I brought from Philadelphia and sowed in the first week of
							this month— About one in ten of the trees is already perishing, and the
							Sun and drought of the two succeeding months will thin them down to less
							than half their numbers— There are also 7. Peach trees, from 12 to 6
							inches high—none of the rest have reached more than three inches— Three
							of the Oaks and one Maple have appeared since yesterday morning— I found
							also two seedling Oaks up in the plats where I had horse-chesnuts and
							elms set out last October— I headed down, in the garden a very fine
							cherry tree of the fifth year, for a bud inserted into it last Summer by
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">Price Greenleaf</persRef>, and
							which looks alive— The experiment has failed upon another which I headed
							down about a fortnight since— I was in the garden and Nursery morning
							and afternoon— The red cherries are ripe, and chiefly gathered— So are
							the Strawberries, excepting those which have been choaked by weeds and
							clover— <persRef ref="turner-eliakim">Eliakim Turner</persRef> came this
							morning to borrow money of me, but I had none to lend. <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> was unwell, confined
							to her chamber— I finished transcribing my diary minutes from 4.
							September to 18. October 1833. into my last Volume— This has been my
							occupation for the month now expiring; and there are upwards of 200
							pages in the same volume yet to be filled up— I can do nothing better. I
							received this morning a Letter for <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams</persRef>, from <persRef
								ref="adams-isaac">her Son</persRef> the Cadet at West-Point, and
							towards Evening took it to her, at her house— Met there <persRef ref="miller-edward">M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Miller</persRef>, who was inviting her to a
							Strawberry and cherry-party at his house this Evening— We went
							accordingly, and found there <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-thomas;greenleaf-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Thomas Greenleaf</persRef> and
							their daughter <persRef ref="greenleaf-mary3">Mary Ann</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel;greenleaf-elizabeth">M<hi

								Daniel Greenleaf</persRef>, <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi

								<persRef ref="beale-ann">Ann</persRef>, <persRef ref="quincy-josiah"

								<persRef ref="woodward-ebenezer">Doctor Woodward</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>
							afterwards came in— The Strawberries were so fine, that I longed for
							some of them for seed— I desired Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Quincy to ask <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">his father</persRef> to
							attend a meeting of the Supervisors of the Adams Temple and School fund,
							at my house on Saturday, the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of next
							Month at One O’Clock, and to dine with me afterwards— I gave the same
								<pb n="30" type="ms"/>invitation to M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Thomas Greenleaf, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Miller, the other Supervisors of the fund—
							Walked home, in company with Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Quincy—
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams had been to Boston, to
							meet <persRef ref="dewindt-caroline">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> De
								Wint</persRef>, who comes on a visit to her friends here, and is now
