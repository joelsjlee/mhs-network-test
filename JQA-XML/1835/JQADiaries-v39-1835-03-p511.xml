						<p>Rose much exhausted, and disqualified for all occupation about the middle
							of the day I rode to the Capitol, and spoke at the <persRef
								ref="franklin-walter">Clerk’s</persRef> Office, for the documents
							and papers to be sent me during my stay here, from the Post Office of
							the House— At the Library the Book which <persRef ref="hardin-benjamin"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hardin</persRef> took from my
							table, and kept was transferred by the <persRef ref="meehan-john"
								>Librarian</persRef> from my charge to his— I walked home, and as I
							was descending the steps of the Capitol, met the late Speaker, <persRef
								ref="bell-john">John Bell</persRef> of Tennessee, with whom I walked
							till we came to his lodgings where he left me— I told him I had called
							there to see him before his departure, to say that I retained no unkind
							feeling from the incident upon which I had thought he had done me wrong—
							I wished it to pass into oblivion, and had therefore not objected last
							night to the entry on the Journal that the vote of thanks to him was
							unanimous— He has to go through a sharply contested election at home,
							and the unanimous vote of thanks may be of service to him— He is on the
							whole a good Speaker, and impartial as far as he dares; though
							occasionally subservient from timidity— The greatest injury he has done
							me was by appointing me Chairman of the Committee on the Bill from the
							Senate fixing the Northern boundary line of the States of Ohio, Indiana
							and Illinois; a service which it was impossible for me honestly to
							perform, without indisposing bitterly against me three whole States of
							the Union, and twenty-nine members their Representatives in the House—
							This has accordingly been the result— Never in the course of my Life
							have I known a controversy of which all the right was so clear on one
							side, and all the power so overwhelming on the other— Never a case where
							the temptation was so intense to take the strongest side, and the duty
							of taking the weakest was so thankless— I cannot help suspecting Bell’s
							motive for putting me upon it— Personally to me it has been a great
							misfortune— <persRef ref="silsbee-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>The dissipation of my Spirits, and the agitation of my mind continue,
							little abated— This morning I went first to the U.S. Branch Bank, where
							I made a deposit; and thence to the Union Bank at Georgetown, where I
							discharged the last of the debts jointly due by me, and <persRef
								key="adams-john2">my ever lamented Son</persRef>— I then called at
							the War and Navy Departments. Left with <persRef ref="dickerson-mahlon"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickerson</persRef> a Letter
							from <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac H. Adams</persRef> to his brother
								<persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph</persRef> and spoke to him in
							behalf of two Applicants who have solicited my interposition—one a
								<persRef ref="boyd-wallace">Son</persRef> of the late <persRef
								ref="boyd-john3">General Boyd</persRef>, for a Commission in the

									>Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Benjamin Waterhouse jun<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> for a Commission of acting
							Chaplain in the Navy. I failed in both; though I took M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Waterhouse’s papers from the Secretary of
							the Navy, to <persRef ref="rodgers-john">Commodore Rodgers</persRef>— I
							spoke next to the <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of War</persRef>,
							for the young man <persRef ref="howe-samuel2">Howe</persRef>, for whom
							he has promised <pb n="512" type="ms"/>a warrant of Cadet at West-Point
							for the next year— He repeated the promise now— I had also some
							conversation with him upon the claim of <persRef ref="mackintosh-peter"
								>Peter M’Intosh</persRef> for an increase of Pension— He promised to
							reconsider the case— But my chief object in calling upon him was to
							speak of the controversy relating to the boundary line between the State
							of Ohio, and the Territory of Michigan, of which he was many years
							Governor— I expressed to him an earnest desire that they would devise
							some means of compromising that dispute; and told him that I had never
							witnessed a contest in which the right was so clear on one side, and the
							power so appalling on the other— I mentioned him the recent proceedings
							of the Legislature of Ohio, by which they have determined to take
							possession of the disputed territory, and I said that the message of the
							Governor (<persRef ref="lucas-robert">Lucas</persRef>) upon which the
							Legislature acted was the most impudent State Paper I had ever read.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cass said that the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> entertained the same view
							of the subject that I did, and if the Legislature of Ohio should take
							possession of the disputed Lands, he would deem it his duty to
							dispossess them by force— He thought the people of Michigan, would
							readily agree to a compromise, but did not expect the same of Ohio.—
							While I was at the War Department, <persRef ref="jones-roger">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Roger Jones</persRef> the Adjutant
							General told me he had heard an express had just arrived with
							information that the French chamber of deputies had rejected the
							appropriation bill for carrying into execution the Treaty of 4. July
							1831— The same rumour was circulated all over the City, and <persRef
								key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> W. S
								Smith</persRef>, who came and spent the Evening here was full of
							speculation upon the probable consequences of this Event— <persRef
								ref="persico-luigi">Persico</persRef> was here, and took leave of me
							with tears in his eyes; the appropriation for employing further upon
							Sculpture for the Capitol having failed. He said he should go to-morrow
							to embark at New-York for England. He asked me for Letters of
							Recommendation, but I knew no one to whom I could venture to address
							him— With <persRef ref="vail-aaron2">Aaron Vail</persRef>, the Chargé
							d’Affaires he is acquainted.</p>

							She is about nineteen years of age, has the Tartar face and sallow
							complexion, without any pleasing expression of countenance or grace of
							deportment— She was seated in a chair on a platform with a curtain
							before it which was drawn up to exhibit her— Once or twice she walked
							several times across the platform though her feet were so small that it
							would scarcely have seemed possible that she could stand upon them—
							There was a boy about 17 years old, who spoke English and acted as
							interpreter He wrote on cards in the Chinese Characters mine and
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife’s</persRef> name and
							those of the two children— I then sent them home, and went to the
							National Intelligencer Office— Settled an account with <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef>,
							and enquired for <persRef ref="stansbury-arthur">Stanberry’s</persRef>
							minutes of my Speech last Monday— He told me that night that he had
							taken very full notes while I was speaking, and that he would let me
							have them as soon as possible— Gales complained of the mercenary spirit
							of Stansbury, and said he paid him largely though he was continually
							attempting to levy contributions upon the members whose Speeches he
							reported— While I was with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales,
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> of the Senate and <persRef ref="everett-edward"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Everett</persRef> came

							He has been nominated by Anti-masonic and which Caucusses for Governor
							the next year. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>came and mentioned
							that the <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of War</persRef> had spoken
							to him of his conversation with me yesterday upon the boundary line
							dispute between Ohio and Michigan— He is himself a Citizen of Ohio, but
							wishes the question may be settled according to the principles of
							Justice— He had not seen the message of <persRef ref="lucas-robert"
									>Gov<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lucas</persRef>— I gave him a
							copy of it in pamphlet—having received three copies; though I know not
							from whom— He understood that <persRef ref="binney-horace">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Binney</persRef> had differed in
							opinion from the other members of the Committee of the House, and
							thought Congress had the power to alter the boundary— He enquired if
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Binney, founded this opinion, upon
							the Constitution of the State of Ohio, or the alledged assent of
							Congress to it— I said I had not so understood him. He thought Congress
							had never given that assent, but that there was a discretionary power
							vested in them by the Ordinance of 1787. and by which they might now
							restrict the boundary of Michigan, and enlarge that of Ohio— But I
							advised him to ascertain M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Binney’s opinion

						<p>Snow, Sleet, Hail and rain, the whole day, which confined me to the

								ref="hallett-benjamin">B. F. Hallett</persRef>— The position which I
							now occupy before the public resembles much that which I held in 1807.
							and 1808— The forced unanimous vote in the House on Monday Evening last
							in favour of my Resolution is the exact counterpart of the forced town
							meeting, called by the federalists in Boston, upon the affair of the
							Chesapeak, after they had refused calling one at my request, and of the
							forced Resolutions then adopted: for which they took ample vengeance of
							me afterwards— My conduct then expelled me from the Senate of the United
							States, as it has excluded me from it now— It afterwards sent me for
							eight years on important Missions in Europe; made me eight years
							Secretary of State, and four years President— I have not life before me
							for such another Career now, and with the same Ordeal to pass through, I
							have nothing before me but the prospect of a desperate struggle and
							political ruin— I shall not live to see as before the day of reparation—
							The french chamber of deputies will reject the Bill for paying the five
							Millions of Dollars, stipulated by the Treaty— Some rash and foolish act
							of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President Jackson</persRef> will
							follow, and if the two Countries should be saved from a War, it seems as
							if it could only be by a special interposition of Providence. The
							Presidential succession has mingled itself with all the important
							transactions of the recent Session of Congress; broken up the
							administration party, and laid the foundation for an entirely new
							organization of parties at the next Session— Standing alone as I do,
							disconnected from all parties, and having at the recent Session taken
							upon the French question a stand so conspicuous, so desperately
							contested; so triumphant in its result, and so sure to combine against
							me <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the Candidates for the Presidency, what
							can save me from destruction at the next Session, if the French quarrel
							should continue, but an unseen protecting power?— Be thou faithful unto

							Durand, between one and two hours— Then walked to the Capitol, and at
							the Office of the <persRef ref="franklin-walter">Clerk of the

							Intelligencer of this morning— I went to the Office to ask for an extra
							copy of the paper, and he promised me 25 or 30. saying that an extra
							number of them had accidentally printed— There was in the same paper an
							article censuring the House for not passing the bill for fixing the
							Northern boundary of the State of Ohio— <persRef ref="hall-hiland">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall</persRef>, was in <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph">Gales’s</persRef> office, when I spoke to him on
							this subject, and was present at the whole conversation— I asked of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales a truce from his incessant War upon
							the House of Representatives, ever since the close of the Session— This
							war was waxing hotter and hotter, and Gales had on his table a
							manuscript Article which he was writing for the paper, and which he said
							laughing, was more severe than any thing that he had yet published— I
							repeated the request for a truce; and told him that almost the whole of
							the bitter invectives in his paper against the House were altogether
							unjust— I said that I had never flattered the House, but on the contrary
							had freely expressed my opinions of them, when I thought they had been
							wrong; but that I was under the greatest obligations to them for two
							things—one was the kindness with which they had received and treated the
							Oration upon <persRef ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>— The other
							was their unanimous vote on the second of this month— I felt my own
							character not a little connected with theirs, and could not bear to see
							them unjustly blamed—without taking their defence— Gales vehemently
							contested my positions, and intimated that I was undertaking to school
							him, which I <pb n="519" type="ms"/>very positively disclaimed— I
							repeated, that I only intreated him for a truce; and added that he might
							deify the Senate as much as he pleased, if he would only cease to

							attacks upon the House— I called at the late residence of <persRef
								ref="wilde-richard">R. H. Wilde</persRef> to return his visit, but
							he had left the City yesterday— There are accounts from France, all
							promising a large majority of the House of deputies for the

								ref="sprague-peleg">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peleg
								Sprague</persRef>, late a Senator from the State of Maine, but now
							here upon business as a lawyer— He had been to my house, to see me and

								ref="binney-amos">Amos Binney</persRef>; relating to his accounts as
							Navy Agent at Boston with the Government— He asked particularly with
							regard to the practice of re-opening settled accounts, by order of the
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President of the United
								States</persRef>— I told him that as far as my experience went, the
							general rule was against it; but subject to particular exceptions at the
							President’s discretion— He asked also respecting extra-allowances by the
							Executive to Offices for extra-services— I told him the practice had not
							been uniform— They had been often made and sometimes refused—and
							referred him to the case of <persRef ref="fillebrown-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fillebrown</persRef>, to whom a jury
							had awarded such allowances, for which the House of Representatives had
							refused the appropriation— At the Globe Office I obtained several of

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cass nor M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Edwards <pb n="520" type="ms"/>could be convinced of the validity of
							Mackintosh’s claim— I left the Papers with them, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards is to send me a written statement
							of the grounds upon which the claim is disallowed— I came home and in
							the Evening M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lyon called upon me and spent
							an hour with me— The Legislature of the State of Ohio, have passed an
							Act directing their <persRef ref="lucas-robert">Governor</persRef> to
							take possession of the disputed territory by force—and the Legislative
							Council of Michigan have resolved to make resistance also by force— Lyon
							is going home— I advised him to prevail upon the territorial authority,
							to avoid that encounter of physical force— To send a memorial to the
							President here, calling upon the Government of the United States for
							protection and to await the action of Congress at their next Session and
							I said that if the subject should again come up at the next Session and
							I should be there, and named again upon the Committee on a similar Bill,
							I would make a full report on the whole dispute and do everything in my
							power to prevent as gross an outrage upon Justice as I ever witnessed in
							human affairs— He said I had been the only cause of the failure of the
							Bill in the last House, and that the people in the Territory of Michigan
							were grateful to me for it— Yes, grateful.— I know what that means—
							Never in my life have I taken in public controversies a part more
							suicidal to my own popularity than on the present occasion— The people
							of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois will hate me with perfect hatred, for
							crossing their interests— The people of Michigan while the question is
							at issue, may pass cold resolutions of approbation or of thanks to me
							for espousing their cause, and then forget me— I place in perpetual
							opposition to me and to every thing that I propose or support
							twenty-nine members of the House, and six members of the Senate and for
							this and all its consequences I have no compensation in prospect but the
							bare consciousness of having done my duty— Be it so, and may that
							consciousness carry me through this and all other trials before me, so
							long as it shall please the disposer of Events that I shall be an actor
							in the passing Events of the time.</p>

								ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef>— I asked for the papers

							and they were afterwards sent to my house— Seaton shewed me a fresh
							number of the Southern Literary Messenger <pb n="521" type="ms"/>a
							periodical pamphlet published by a man at Richmond named <persRef
								ref="white-thomas2">White</persRef>. He has time after time directly

							beggary, has published a malignant personal attack upon me in the shape
							of a review of my Oration upon the life and character of <persRef
								ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>— I am willing to be relieved
							even thus from his importunities to write for him— In the leisure
							moments of the day and to compose as much as possible the agitation of
							my feelings, I wrote in the form of a draught of a speech, an argument
							against the patronage retrenchment Bill, concocted in the Senate at
							their late Session, between <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
								>Calhoun</persRef>, <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef>— This is another of

							and perilous part— I am preparing an argument against the Bill, for
							consideration— <persRef ref="durand-asher">M<hi rend="superscript"

							the <persRef ref="mason-stevens2">Territory of Michigan</persRef>, to
							suspend all their measures of force in relation to the disputed boundary

							he had last week received a Letter from <persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>, inviting him to
							undertake the commission, that he arrived here the evening before last;
							saw the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> yesterday—was
							now to receive his instructions, and to leave the city at two O’Clock
							this afternoon, to proceed upon his mission— He said he had not yet
							entirely possessed himself of the merits of the question, but had read
							my Speech in the house at the late Session, and taken notice of the
							Documents therein cited by me— He said the Administration here that the
							right of the case was not on the side of the State of Ohio, but this was
							a matter in which he should have no agency, his commission being only by
							conciliatory means, to persuade the parties to avoid coming to
							extremities— I told him that I had most earnestly urged this upon
								<persRef ref="lyon-lucius">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lyon</persRef>, the Delegate from Michigan, even if the Governor of
							Ohio should resort to force— I had said that the more violent the

							and the greater the forbearance of Michigan the stronger her case would
							be, before Congress and the world— Besides which I supposed the Governor
							of Michigan, would be subject to the orders of the President who might
							forbid him expressly from resorting to force— I understood from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, though not by direct assertion, that
							he was sole commissioner upon the subject with which he is charged— I
							walked out with the intention of visiting the Library of Congress to
							make some researches there—but on reaching the Intelligencer Office, got
							into a Conversation with <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi

							near three O’ Clock— I went through the whole subject of the charges
							against the late House of Representatives, which I undertook to defend—
							He was very anxious about the election of a Senator of the United States
							in Rhode-Island, and seemed to wish that I should interfere with the
							Anti-Masons there to induce them to concur in the Election of a whig— I
							asked him, laughing what he understood by a whig, and told him I had
							been much amused with the embarrassment <pb n="524" type="ms"/>of the
							whig members of the late Virginia Legislature, in accounting for their
							principles, in their Address to the People, published in the
							Intelligencer of this Morning— I asked him who was the writer of that
							Address— He said it was <persRef ref="johnson-chapman">Chapman
								Johnson</persRef>.— I went to the Capitol, but it was three O’Clock,
							and the Library was closed— At the Telegraph Office, I took a file of
							the Register of Debates during the late Session of Congress— The

						<p>I finished this morning the draught of a Speech upon <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">J. C. Calhoun’s</persRef> patronage Bill; which
							would fill eleven columns of the National Intelligencer, and would take
							between three and four hours to deliver. Upon reading it over, I find it
							is without method, and in a great measure without point— A desultory
							discussion upon the debate in the first Congress on the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President’s</persRef> power of removal from
							Executive Offices, with a severe and cutting review of <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster’s</persRef> speech in the
							Senate, in favour of the Bill— That Speech is indeed so shallow, so
							unprincipled, and so subversive of all Constitutional doctrine, that I
							could not possibly treat it with respect: but this is not wise— Some
							time past noon, I walked to the Capitol and looked into two volumes of
								<persRef ref="swift-jonathan">Swift’s</persRef> works— <persRef
								ref="scott-walter">Scott’s</persRef> Edition, for the passage cited
							in <persRef ref="johnson-samuel">Johnson</persRef> Dictionary under the
							word Executive, but could not find it— I found however several
							references to <persRef ref="hobbes-thomas">Hobbes’s</persRef> opinions,
							and examined the Folio Volume of Hobbes’s Works, till 3. O’Clock when I
							was obliged to leave the Library, which is closed at that hour— I did
							not find the word Executive in his Book— He speaks of Legislative Power,
							but scouts all ideas of mixed Monarchy and rejects with the utmost
							disdain all ideas of a division of Powers— His Leviathan was published
							in Paris in 1751. three years after the execution of <persRef
								ref="charles-i">Charles the 1<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi></persRef> His book was exceedingly obnoxious; more however
							for its anti-religious than for its monarchical principles— He insists
							upon the Sovereign power to levy Soldiers and taxes as he may need them—
							It seems to me <pb n="525" type="ms"/>there is nothing in the book worth
							retaining— Historically it may be considered as an exposition of the
							political doctrines of the Cavaliers of that time— This afternoon the
							Telegraph contained J. C Calhoun’s last Speech on his Patronage Bill—as
							shallow as Webster’s and much more dogmatical— There are plausible
							arguments in both—but not one that is sound— After reading that of
							Calhoun, and analyzing the main stay of his argument I found it ended in
							empty sophistry— His conclusion impudently overstretches his premises— I
							began this Evening a reply to his Speech which employed me till near
							eleven O’ Clock— <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>I finished this morning the remarks on <persRef ref="calhoun-john">J. C.

							mine; and now on reviewing my own, I find it like a tape-worm, without
							beginning or end—all desultory— I want Patience to write it over again,
							and methodize it— There is a great defect running through all the
							arguments in reply to the Speeches of Calhoun and <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef>—it is contemptuous and
							disdainful; which I could not help— Calhoun’s tone, is so
							self-sufficient and overbearing, and Webster’s reasoning so utterly
							ignorant or unprincipled that they provoked my temper, and I answer them
							with cutting sarcasm; the use of this weapon is seldom politic— In the
							present case it would certainly not be so. I should write my Speech over
							again to say in mild, courteous, inoffensive language, what I have said
							in consuming caustic— I can make no use of my Speech as now written, and
							yet it contains matter to grind up into dust, Calhoun’s and Webster’s
							Speeches and also Calhoun’s Patronage Report— <persRef
								ref="fendall-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fendall</persRef> was here and I had near two hours of conversation
							with him— He appeared to incline to the opinion that the Grand-jury of
							the Circuit-Court now in Session, ought to indict <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef>, the President, and a
							man named <persRef ref="coltman-charles">Coltman</persRef>, a member of

							perjury, to charge <persRef ref="poindexter-george">Poindexter</persRef>
							with having employed <persRef ref="lawrence-richard">Lawrence</persRef>
							to shoot the President— Coltman is a member of the Common Council, and
							that body have passed Resolutions branding him with infamy— The whole
							transaction is inexpressibly base, and approaches much too near to the
							President for the good of his reputation— The Committee of the Senate
							however exonerate him from the guilt of the conspiracy— Fendall has been
							lately to Richmond, Virginia, where he says the whig members of the
							Legislature had two Caucuses, and postponed the nomination of a
							candidate for the Presidency— The whigs are to have a Convention at
							Baltimore next December to nominate a Candidate for the Presidency— I
							walked round the Capitol before dinner, and in the Evening began an
							answer to a Letter from <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi

							which from drowsiness I could not continue.</p>

							/>Filmer, and the principal question between them was this separation of
							the Legislative and Executive Powers— Filmer insisting as <persRef
								ref="hobbes-thomas">Hobbes</persRef> and all the writers of that age
							on the monarchical side had done, that Government implied absolute
							power, and that there could be no separation of powers, without a
							dissolution of the Government. Locke lays down very distinctly the
							division of the powers, and in the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Chapter of the second book treats expressly of the Legislative,
							Executive and federative power of the Commonwealth, meaning by the
							federative power, the Executive with reference to the Laws of Nations—
							This division is more complete than that of <persRef
								ref="montesquieu-charles">Montesquieu</persRef> I think Locke was
							the inventor of this theory of the division of powers; and of the
							reasoning which considers liberty, as depending upon their separation—
							Montesquieu has taken the arguments of Locke, and applied it to the
							particular organization of the English Government I took out from the
							Library the volume of the works of Sir Robert Filmer— It is a small
							octavo Volume, containing several Tracts upon Government published at
							different times. That, to which Locke’s Treatise is the reply, is the
							last in the volume—entitled Patriarcha; and was first published in 1680—
							This was doubtless the doctrine of <persRef ref="charles-ii">Charles the
								second</persRef>, and of his Court.— It has fared with Sir Robert
							Filmer, and the Tory writers of that age, as it did with the Sophists of
							the age of <persRef ref="socrates">Socrates</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="plato">Plato</persRef>— Men of great and powerful minds,
							assuming erroneous first principles, and erecting upon them plausible
							and stupendous systems of morals and Politics, overwhelmed not by the
							greater skill or talent, but by the purer fountain of elementary
							principle, and rendered odious to all time— I came home, and wrote a
							Letter to my old friend <persRef ref="pickman-benjamin"
								>Pickman</persRef> of Salem, upon the sudden and untimely decease of
							his Son <persRef ref="pickman-benjamin2">B. T. Pickman</persRef> who was

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Thruston</persRef>, wife of

							Where reason ends there creed begins and the old adage credo quia

							principal labour is in taking away from the calvinists their scriptural
							authorities— This too is generally an easy task, but the canons of
							biblical criticism are not so easily settled— The references in the New

						<p>I walked this morning to the Capitol, and spent there between two and

								Nedham’s</persRef> right Constitution of a Commonwealth, <persRef
								ref="harrington-james">Harrington’s</persRef> Oceana and <persRef
								ref="sidney-algernon">Sydney’s</persRef> Discourses on Government,
							for their views of Legislative, Executive and Judicial Power— There is
							very little in either of them upon the last, but all of them mark the
							distinction between Legislative and Executive power— There are seven
							pages of Nedham’s work, of argument and historical illustration to prove
							the absolute necessity of separating these two powers; and there is
							nothing in <persRef ref="montesquieu-charles">Montesquieu</persRef> or
							in <persRef ref="locke-john">Locke</persRef> on this subject, but what
							is quite as well said in these seven pages— Harringtons Oceana, is a
							sort of political romance, dedicated to <persRef ref="cromwell-oliver"
								>Oliver Cromwell</persRef> Lord Protector, and being an Allegorical
							exposition of the English Commonwealth under his Government. Montesquieu
							charges Harrington with building a Chalcedon, with a Byzantium before
							his eyes— But Harrington’s book was published in 1656. and his Byzantium
							then was Cromwell’s Protectorate. Nedham’s book was also published in
							1656—as <persRef ref="hobbes-thomas">Hobbes’s</persRef> Leviathan had
							been published in 1651 <pb n="528" type="ms"/>Sidney’s Discourses were

							refutations of <persRef ref="filmer-robert">Sir Robert
								Filmer’s</persRef> Patriarcha; which was afterwards taken in hand by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Locke— Filmer’s reasoning appears now
							so utterly absurd that one can hardly conceive how two such elaborate
							works as those of Sidney and Locke should have been thought necessary to
							answer them— Filmer solves all civil Government into paternal authority,
							and spurns at every idea of limitation upon it. Hobbes does the same— I
							looked also into <persRef ref="fortescue-john">Fortescue</persRef> de

							thanked me, and said that the Duke had treated him with the utmost

							of <persRef ref="lafayette">General La Fayette</persRef>, who he says
							gave him only ten days before he died a Letter for <persRef
