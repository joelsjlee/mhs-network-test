						<p>I rose at half past three awaked by the pain of a new boil, upon my left

								ref="freeman-russell">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell

								<persRef ref="kendall-amos">Postmaster General Amos

							answered none at-all— He complains much of the treatment he has received
							from the whig party—and of his want of bread— I walked to the Capitol
							and found upon going into the Hall of Representatives, that the three

								Pearce</persRef>, <persRef ref="sprague-william2">W.

							<hi rend="strikethrough">ballot</hi> viva voce— This gave rise to a

							the Representative-elect from the new State of Michigan came this

							relating to the affairs of Michigan— One concerning the boundary
							question— The other with the Constitution of the State and her claim of
							Admission to the Union— And he requested me to take charge of them in
							the house, and to move the reference of them to a select Committee— I
							said it would be perhaps more for the interest of Michigan to have the
							two Messages referred to two separate Committees— I would move the
							reference of the boundary Message, if I could get the floor in time— But
							as the People of Michigan were understood to be very friendly to the
							present Administration, it would be more useful to them to have the
							reference of the Constitution Message moved by a known supporter of the
							Administration in the House—to which he assented— At the House the first
							subject considered was the adoption of the Rules of the House in the
							last Congress—upon which I pressed the adoption of the additional rule,
							requiring the Committee of Ways and Means, to report the general
							Appropriation Bills within 30 days of their appointment, or the reasons
							for failing so to report them— My Resolution raised opposition, direct,
							and collateral, from both sides of the House—<persRef

								ref="mann-abijah">Mann</persRef>, <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron"
								>Vanderpoel</persRef> on one side—<persRef ref="mercer-charles"

							referred to a select Committee for revisal; who were instructed to
							report my Rule; and to receive propositions for amendments to the rules,
							from any member of the House— The question, upon instructing the
							Committee to report my rule was carried 91 to 76.— The Messages from the
							President concerning Michigan were received. I moved the reference of
							the boundary Message to a select Committee of nine, which passed without
							opposition. <persRef ref="mason-john5">John Y. Mason</persRef> moved the
							reference of the Constitution Message also to a select Committee.
								<persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> moved the Committee

							mendicants in the Roman Catholic Countries of Europe— My neighbour
								<persRef ref="tudor-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

							a Letter from <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> upon
							political affairs— Each and every one of these incidents gave me matter
							for meditation, and for deliberation to regulate my own conduct with
							reference to them— Lay was much surprised at Webster’s new zeal for
							anti-masonry; In the Evening I made further progress in the Dissertation
							M upon the Congress of Nations.</p>

								>Mason</persRef>, from John 1.36. “Behold the Lamb of God”— A
							thoroughly calvinistic text— The emblematical representation of the
							deity, in the form of a beast and a bird, seems evidently to be of
							Egyptian origin; but how natural it would be for a heathen or a jew to
							imagine that Christians worshipped a sheep, and a pigeon— After dinner I
							attended with my Grandchild <persRef ref="adams-mary4"

							Church and heard <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript"

							in Advent, and preach from Hosea 10.1. “Israel is an empty vine, he

								>Jackson</persRef> partizan, and has the reputation of insincerity—
							He had a furious controversy last winter with his colleague <persRef
								ref="smith-francis">F. O. J. Smith</persRef> a partizan at least as
							unscrupulous as himself— After much reciprocation of ribaldry, against
							each other in Newspapers and Pamphlets Jarvis challenged Smith to a
							duel, but Smith refused to meet him— With all his party rancour, Jarvis,
							assumes an air of independence, and the tone of a <hi rend="italic"
								>frondeur</hi> against the Administration— This is no uncommon thing
							with the most inveterate party members— They affect freedom of opinion,
							and censure the President with little restraint or qualification— The
							only cue for understanding them is to watch their votes— Jarvis
							sometimes carries the joke so far as to fly the course, and vote against
							his party— The consequence of which is that they have little confidence
							in him— I read in the Knoxville Register the long dramatic narrative of
								<persRef ref="payne-john">John Howard Payne</persRef>— He has
							suffered an abominable outrage, but I fear it is without prospect of a
							remedy— There is no security for the right of Life, of Liberty of
							property or of reputation, in any of the Slave holding States, with
							reference to Negroes, or Indians— I can at least give no aid to procure
							for him a remedy, or satisfaction.</p>

							support from neglect of his duty at the last Congress— <persRef
								ref="patton-john">Patton</persRef> told me that Randolph had asked
							him to nominate him, which he had refused, and told him he should vote
							against him— He said it was painful, for Randolph had distinguished
							himself as an Officer in the last War— Randolph acknowledged that he had
							deserved to be superseded, by his remissness in the performance of his
							duty— There were ballotings before the election was completed; and at
							the last <persRef ref="dorsey-roderick">Roderick Dorsey</persRef> was
							chosen by 122 of 220 votes— Nominated by <persRef ref="thomas-francis"
								>Thomas</persRef> of Maryland— His strongest competitor was <persRef
								ref="pease-j">J. Oliver Pease</persRef>, a youth who when I came
							into the House in 1831 was one of the running boys, and is now not more
							than 19 years old— It was past three O’Clock when the choice was

							Society instead of sending the judges all the Essays transmitted to them
							in competition for the prize, had themselves made a selection out of
							thirty or forty; and the writer of the Letter did not know whether his
							work was one of the selected or not— I told M<hi rend="superscript"

							transmitted to them fourteen in number— That <persRef ref="kent-james"
								>Chancellor Kent</persRef> had read them all— That I had read and
							sent to <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>The winter has set in with great severity— A Heavy Gale of wind from the
							North all last Night ushered in a day bitterly cold; and the Potowmac
							river froze over— At the House the day was absorbed in receiving
							Petitions and Memorials from all the States and Territories— <persRef
								ref="fairfield-john">John Fairfield</persRef> a new member from
							Maine, presented two Petitions for the abolition of Slavery in the

								>Everett</persRef> of Vermont asked if the motion to lay on the

							answered yes— The yeas and nays were taken twice—first on laying on the

							also carried 168 to 50. I voted on bo<unclear>th</unclear> questions in
							the negative— I presented a Petition from <persRef ref="burrows-tillson"
								>Tillson Burrows</persRef>, a Soldier in the last War, disabled;
							praying for a pension, referred to the Committee on Invalid Pensions—a
							Petition from <persRef ref="ewell-joseph">Joseph Ewell</persRef> and

							Church</persRef>, a pensioner under the act of 1818. struck off the list

						<p>My thermometer this morning in the open air sunk the mercury into the
							bulb—but it was graduated only as low as 20. I think it was down as low
							as 10. and the cold disables me distressingly from writing.— At the
							House; the doorkeeper, and assistant doorkeeper were elected— <persRef

							Resolution, and <persRef ref="hunter-john">John W. Hunter</persRef> by

								ref="dade-john">John B. Dade</persRef> against him, but he carried

							on the <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of War</persRef>, for the
							list of Pensioners under the Act of 18 March 1818. afterwards struck off
							the list, very luckily passed without opposition— Patton manifested some
							disposition to question what the list was wanted for, but did not push
							the enquiry— A Resolution offered by <persRef ref="johnson-richard">R.
								M. Johnson</persRef>, that some fifteen or twenty copies of the
							Sessions documents of the House should be furnished to the Secretary of
							War and the subordinate bureaus of his department, was not so lucky— It
							was attacked first by Patton as a useless expense, and secondly by
								<persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>, as an Executive
							encroachment upon the privileges of the <hi rend="italic">Commons</hi>;
							and after a debate of an hour and a half the Resolution at the motion of
								<persRef ref="mason-john5">John Y. Mason</persRef> was referred to
							the Committee on Military Affairs for a Report, whether it would be

							That the Presidential Election was crushing every elementary principle
							of Freedom, in the free States, and that I saw no prospect of useful
							resistance at this time— I should say nothing— I believed no one else
							would say anything— There was a perfect snarle of debate upon a
							multitude of questions succeeding each of other one only of which was
							taken by yeas and nays— This was the identical question to lay on the
							table; carried triumphantly by the South two days ago as a test
							question; now voted down by themselves 121. to 95. to get a vote of
							rejection— The House adjourned about 4. without closing the debate—

						<p>There were several visitors by Cards— I received a Letter from <persRef

							concerning a claim of the <persRef ref="gundeway-elizabeth"
								>widow</persRef> of a revolutionary Pensioner named <persRef ref="u"

							requested in the Letter, and to cause the information desired to be sent
							me— He said that the Resolution of the House calling for a statement of
							the names of Revolutionary Pensioners struck off the list had been
							received, and that it had been commenced even before— I asked him
							whether the question concerning the Michigan boundary was to be managed
							in the House as an Administration measure— He said no— I said I had put
							the question, because the motion made in the House by <persRef
								ref="howard-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Howard</persRef>, to reconsider the vote referring it to a select
							Committee had that aspect— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Howard being a
							warm partizan of the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>administration</persRef>, and having been an Official agent of the
							Executive to mediate between the parties to this controversy since the
							close of the last Session of Congress— He said he believed Col<hi

							suggestion of his own mind; and that it was the desire, that the subject
							should be left to the Committee, to which it had been referred, and
							particularly that the report should be made by me— But he did not say
							the desire of <hi rend="italic">whom</hi>— I returned the visit of
								<persRef ref="martini-adrien">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Martini</persRef>— His servant told me that he was with <persRef

							and found <persRef ref="granger-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							read the Evening service, for the fourth Sunday in Advent, and gave a
							short discourse from John 4.34. [“]Jesus saith unto them my meat is to
							do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.”— There were
							very few persons at Church, and it was dark before the Congregation were

							upon the Congress of Nations; the last of the fourteen transmitted to me
							by <persRef ref="dewey-ld">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dewey</persRef>— I finished a Letter to my Son <persRef

							less of writing than I ought to have done— My Morning reading now is
							about 20 pages of <persRef ref="mosheim-johann">Mosheim’s</persRef>
							Ecclesiastical History, in <persRef ref="maclaine-archibald">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Archibald M’Laine’s</persRef>

							into prosperous and calamitous events— The internal history into
							chapters upon the State of Letters and Philosophy during the century,
							the Doctors and Ministers and form of Government of the Church. The
							Doctrines—the Rites and Ceremonies; and the divisions and Heresies which
							successively arose— This partition is repeated from century to century—
							There is a more general division of the whole subject into four Books— 1
							from the Birth of Christ to the time of <persRef ref="constantine"

								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Laine’s preface is dated Dec<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1764— Mosheim was a Lutheran, and his
							History is not partial to the Church of Rome— Neither is it bigoted

							a Resolution that Congress had not the Constitutional right to abolish

							lay on the table <persRef ref="hammond-james">Hammond’s</persRef> motion
							to reject the Petition, and offer his Resolutions— He called for the

							came the motion to reconsider the reference of a petition from
							Cummington presented by <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef>,
							to the Committee on the District of Columbia—against which I addressed
							the house and was answered by <persRef ref="bouldin-james"

							to-morrow.— Granger<unclear>’s</unclear> Speech was short but spirited
							and pungent— Wise and Dromgoole made frequent and direct allusion to
							what I said yesterday— Wise maintained that Congress had no right to
							abolish Slavery in the District of Columbia, and quoted the provision
							that private property shall not be taken for public uses without
							compensation—and he complained that runaway Slaves should not be
							recovered in the North Notwithstanding the Constitutional provision,
							that they should be restored— Joseph R. Ingersoll proposed a Resolution
							declaring in the broadest terms that the Constitution of the United
							States recognizes the right of the People of the Southern States to hold
							Slaves— A strange concession for a Pennsylvanian</p>

						<p>I attended at ten O’Clock the Committee on the Rules—present <persRef

								ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef>, <persRef

								>Chambers</persRef>—absent <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
								>Cambreleng</persRef> and <persRef ref="parks-gorham"
								>Parks</persRef>— Sundry Amendments to the Rules were proposed, and
							discussed—some adopted and some rejected—the Chairman was finally
							directed to Report to the House—my rule respecting censure for words
							spoken in debate, was to my surprise unanimously agreed to— My proposed
							addition to the rule that Petitions shall not be debated on the day when
							presented was much discussed and at last reluctantly agreed to— Only two
							or three others were adopted— Those proposed by Thomas for requiring a
							bond with sureties from the Serjeant at Arms, and for admitting District
							Attornies upon the floor behind the bar; and that of Parker for
							requiring the members to sit uncovered— In the House immediately after
							the reading of the Journal I addressed the <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>Speaker</persRef>; who said the floor belonged to <persRef
								ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef>— With his consent I stated that
							the Select Committee on the Ohio-Boundary had been ordered within one
							day of a fortnight since— That notice had then been given of an
							intention to move a reconsideration of the vote and of transferring the
							subject to another Committee— That on the Monday following, ten days
							ago, the appointment of the Committees had been announced, and the
							motion for reconsideration had been made— That I had waited until this
							time without applying to the <persRef ref="franklin-walter"
								>Clerk</persRef> for the Papers, in expectation that the House would
							decide the question of reconsideration; but I should not feel justified
							in waiting longer; and gave notice that I should this day notify the
							members of the Select Committee to meet to-morrow Morning.— Slade then
							made his Speech, of about an hour and a half, and was followed by
								<persRef ref="garland-james">James Garland</persRef> of Virginia on
							the Slavery side of the question; after which, Mann of New-York moved
							the previous question— He had already spoken, and Parks of Maine claimed
							therefore the floor before him; but he said it was to move the Previous
							question— The Speaker decided that he was entitled to the floor, the
							rule not applying to the case—the Previous Question was seconded;
							carried—the reference of the Petition was reconsidered, and it was laid
							on the table—and the House adjourned. I desired the Speaker to have his
							decision explicitly noted on the Journal, not being satisfied with it as
							correct— I notified the Committee on the Michigan Boundary Message to
							meet to morrow Morning— <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi

						<p><date>24. V:30. </date>Thursday.</p>
						<p>Met at half past ten this morning at the Chamber of the Committee of
							Manufactures, the Select Committee on the Michigan Boundary Message.—
							All the members present, consisting of <persRef ref="hardin-benjamin"
								>Benjamin Hardin</persRef>; <persRef ref="patton-john">John M.
								Patton</persRef>, <persRef ref="mckay-james">James I.
								M’Kay</persRef>, <persRef ref="dickerson-philemon">Philemon

								Grayson</persRef>, <persRef ref="pierce-franklin">Franklin
								Pierce</persRef>, and <persRef ref="judson-andrew">Andrew T.
								Judson</persRef>— The Committee had only one printed sheet of the
							Message and Documents before them—the rest, probably five or six Sheets
							being yet at the Printers— A Letter addressed to me as Chairman of the
							Committee was received, signed by twelve members of the Ohio Delegation,
							requesting the Committee not to proceed upon the business until the
							House should have decided upon the motion for reconsideration of the
							reference to this Committee.— Accordingly, the Committee unanimously
							determined to adjourn until the House shall decide the question of
							reconsideration; and if the decision should be to leave the reference
							with the Committee, the Chairman should again call the Committee
							together— At the House, <persRef ref="thomson-john2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomson</persRef> of Ohio moved that
							the House should this day at one O’Clock proceed to the choice of a
							Chaplain, which was agreed to— Then came the question of the reference
							of the Michigan Institution Message to a Select Committee; or to the
							Committee on the Territories— <persRef ref="vinton-samuel"
								>Vinton</persRef> of Ohio moved that it should be referred to the
							Committee on the Judiciary of which <persRef ref="beardsley-samuel"
								>Beardsley</persRef> is chairman— <persRef ref="storer-bellamy"
								>Storer</persRef> of Ohio, <persRef ref="lane-amos">Lane</persRef>
							of Indiana, and <persRef ref="reynolds-john">Reynolds</persRef> of
							Illinois were all for the reference to the Committee on the Judiciary—
								<persRef ref="mason-john5">Mason</persRef> of Virginia feebly
							supported his motion for reference to a Select Committee— <persRef
								ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> more earnestly pleaded for
							the Committee on the Territories, and the hour of one came, and the
							ballots for chaplain commenced— Five or six persons were nominated;
							among whom was <persRef ref="comstock-oliver">Oliver C.
								Comstock</persRef>, of New-York, heretofore a member of the House,
							and now nominated by <persRef ref="johnson-richard">Richard M.
								Johnson</persRef>, to whom it was said he had given a certificate of
							character— There were five ballots and at last <persRef
								ref="stockton-thomas">Stockton</persRef> was chosen— The House then
							adjourned over to Monday. I spoke to <persRef ref="carr-overton">Overton
								Carr</persRef>, the Door keeper of the House, about the seventeen
							boys employed by him, without any authority whatever— There is among
							them a <persRef ref="leonard-william">Son</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="leonard-stephen">Stephen B. Leonard</persRef> one of the
							members of the House from New-York.</p>

							have also received on this and several preceding days, Letters, relating
							to business, public and private, pending or soon to be brought before
							Congress. Among them one from <persRef ref="page-francis">Francis
								Page</persRef> a Virginian, son of <persRef ref="page-john">Governor

								ref="nelson-thomas">General Thomas Nelson</persRef>—requesting my

							upon matting.— One from <persRef ref="allen-jw">J. W. Allen</persRef>,

							Appropriation, of 5000 dollars to remove a ledge of rocks at the Mouth

							New-Haven, Connecticut, named <persRef ref="bishop-alexander"
								>Bishop</persRef>, preached from 2. Corinthians 4.18.—“the things
							which are seen are temporal.” a discourse of great power and eloquence—
							Full of thought and of feeling; generally well-expressed— His delivery
							too was very impressive, and his reading intelligent and with well
							placed accent; emphasis, pause and inflection— In dwelling upon the
							instability of all human concerns, opinions, desires, joys, sorrows, and
							fortunes his topics were selected with judgment and treated with
							delicacy, and in some passages with deep pathos— There were transient
							allusions to the day, the closing Sabbath of the year, and to the
							melancholy incidents which have clothed the Senate and the Hall with
							mourning; and he touched on a mothers agonies at the loss of a child in
							a manner which suffused other eyes, and mine with tears— I went again to
							hear him in the afternoon when his text was Matthew 7.24. “Therefore,
							whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken
							him, unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: 25. And the
							rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon
							that house; and it fell not; for it was founded upon a rock. 26. And
							every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall
							be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: 27.
							And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and
							beat upon that house: and it fell: and great was the fall of it—”
							Practical Christianity—good works— Not the favourite presbyterian theme,
							but mine— Not so deeply affecting as the discourse of the morning; but
							coin from the same mint, and of the same metal— I pronounce him an
							admirable preacher— His thoughts have made a lodgement in my Memory, and
							his doctrine distilled like the dew— <persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Connell</persRef> was here this
							Evening— I wrote Letters and Journal, but with a load of anxiety upon my
							heart, which can only implore mercy where it dreads judgment— Yet let me
							hope—</p>

							is Chairman— Mason came to my Seat and remarked that the opposition

							of the Committee of Ways and Means, moved to suspend the rules to enable

							presented the Memorial of <persRef ref="reily-barbara">Barbara
								Reily</persRef>, Widow of <persRef ref="reily-william2">William
								Reily</persRef>, which was referred to the Committee on
							Revolutionary Pensions— I asked leave to offer a Resolution connected

							received— All the States were called for the reception of Petitions; and
							a great multitude of them were presented and referred— The Reports from
							standing Committees were then called for, and Cambreleng, reported the
							appropriation Bills for fortifications, for the army, the Navy, the
							Revolutionary Pensions, and a Bill of Appropriations in <hi
								rend="italic">part</hi> for the support of Government—they were
							twice read by their titles ordered to be printed and referred to the
							Committee of the Whole on the State of the Union— The early report of
							these Bills, is the first fruit of the New Rule, introduced at my
							instance—would that the other consequences intended by me might follow
							with equal and more efficacy— Many other Bills were reported by the
							Chairmen of the other standing Committees and were duly referred to the

							then asked leave of the House to present a Petition and have it

						<p>I had yesterday notified the members of the Select Committee on the
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President’s</persRef> Message,
							relating to the <persRef ref="smithson-james">Smithsonian</persRef>
							bequest, to meet at the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures, at
							eleven O’Clock this morning— I rode up to the Capitol, and attended the
							Meeting accordingly— The members present were<space/><persRef
								ref="garland-james">Garland</persRef>, of Virginia, <persRef
								ref="mckennan-thomas">T. M. T. M’Kennan</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef> of
								Louisiana,<space/><persRef ref="chapin-graham">Chapin</persRef> of
							New-York and <persRef ref="hannegan-edward">Edward H. Hannegan</persRef>
							of Indiana, Those absent were <persRef ref="speight-jesse">Jesse
								Speight</persRef> of North-Carolina, who is sick, and <persRef
								ref="thomas-francis">Francis Thomas</persRef> of Maryland— The
							Message and Documents as printed were read by me— Three Members of the
							Committee, Garland of Virginia, Hannegan of Indiana and Chapin of
							New-York expressed doubts whether the bequest ought to be accepted—
							Garland moved an adjournment of the Meeting to this day fortnight—but it
							was agreed to adjourn to next Saturday week. I proposed to report a
							request that this Committee should be discharged and that the subject
							should be referred to a joint Committee of the two Houses.— In the
							House, the two Members from the State of Mississippi <persRef
								ref="claiborne-john">Claiborne</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="dickson-david">Dickson</persRef> appeared, were sworn and took
							their Seats— <persRef ref="wardwell-daniel">Wardwell</persRef> moved a
							suspension of the Rules to consider a Resolution for discontinuing the
							practice of having public worship in the Hall on Sundays, but the House
							refused. Thomas’s motion for a select Committee with Instructions <hi
								rend="strikethrough">for a select Committee</hi> on the applications
							for the recharter of Banks in the District of Columbia was resumed—
							M’Kennon offered an Amendment to call for the Correspondence of Members
							of Congress with Deposit Banks, and <persRef ref="kinnard-george"
								>Kinnard</persRef> of Indiana an amendment on that, to call for the
							correspondence of Members of Congress with the Bank of the United
							States. I spoke against both the Amendments and against the Instructions
							and especially against a slanderous imputation by <persRef
								ref="beardsley-samuel">Beardsley</persRef> upon the <persRef
								ref="biddle-nicholas">President</persRef> and Directors of the Bank
							of the United States— <persRef ref="galbraith-john">Galbraith</persRef>
							moved the previous Question which was carried 87 to 83. the main
							question was then carried by yeas and nays 100 to 96. The question of
							reference was then carried without opposition—and the Instructions were
							divided—the examination and scrutiny were carried; but the reference of
							all future Memorials was abandoned by Thomas himself and rejected— The
							House adjourned over to Monday— Close of the year with blessing to
							Almighty God for the past, and humble supplication for the future.</p>
