							whole blame is laid upon the then Commander in Chief <persRef

								ref="stael-anne">Madame de Stael</persRef> requesting me to call
							upon her at the Hotel de l’Europe at 4 O’Clock this afternoon;
							concerning something relative to America. I first went out with <persRef
								ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Galloway</persRef> to Ochta—
							The <persRef ref="adams-louisa2">child</persRef> continues with little
							and occasional abatement in the rigorous symptoms of her disorder— No
							appearance of the teeth— No encouragement for any sentiment in our
							hearts but that of resignation— I took D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Galloway with me to <persRef ref="moxon-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Moxon’s</persRef> on the Apothecarys Island; returned
							home, and at four O’Clock called upon Madame de Stael— I found <persRef
								ref="cathcart-william">Lord Cathcart</persRef> the newly arrived
							British Ambassador with her— Also <persRef ref="bentinck-william"
								>Admiral Bentinck</persRef>—a young man who appeared to be an
							attendant upon Lord Cathcart— Madame de Stael’s <persRef ref="u"
								>son</persRef> and <persRef ref="destaelholstein-albertine"
								>daughter</persRef>— A <persRef ref="bentinck-george">son</persRef>
							of Admiral Bentinck, a boy, and two or three other men whom I could not
							ascertain— To every soul in the room I was a total Stranger. Madame de
							Stael was in very animated conversation with Lord Cathcart, and
							expressing in warm terms her admiration of the English Nation, as the
							preservers of social order and the Saviours of Europe. She also
							complimented his Lordship very highly upon his exploit at Copenhagen— My
							lord looked a little aukward at the size and rankness of the Lady’s
							applause; to the personal tribute offered to himself he made no answer,
							but to the besmearing of his Nation he answered that his Nation was a
							Nation which as such felt itself bound by Moral Obligations, which it
							would always fullfill, and to which it would never be false.— I thought
							of the Moral Obligations of the Copenhagen Expedition and of the
							American revolutionary War— Lord Cathcart had his share in both— The
							English talk much about their honour and National Morality; sometimes
							without meaning; but generally with a mixture of hypocrisy and of
							self-delusion in about equal portions— <persRef ref="johnson-samuel"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson</persRef> in one of his
							poems honestly avows that in his time English honour had become a
							standing jest; and it has assuredly not since then improved— The Lord
							and Lady conversed also, about his journey from Sweden to this place,
							upon which his Carriage oversat, and rolled down-hill, and upon her
							journey there, and her fears of a water-passage— She is to leave the
							City to-morrow— Admiral Bentinck seemed a little uneasy, under the close
							siege of compliments which was laid to the Ambassador, and when his
							Lordship took leave and went away, said as if he felt relieved “thank
							God! that is finished!” The Admiral himself immediately afterwards went
							away to his Lodgings, where the Baroness was to go and take him up, to
							go somewhere together to dinner— She had then leisure for some
							conversation with me— She has lands in the State of New-York upon Lake
							Ontario—and stocks in the United States funds, and she wished to enquire
							how she could contrive to receive her interest, in England while there
							is War between U.S. and Great-Britain— This introduced a Conversation
							upon the War, which appeared to be to her a topic far more interesting,
							than the affairs upon which she had sent to consult me— But as she was
							going out to dinner, she desired me to come again to-morrow morning, and
							asked me why I had not been to see her before; having known her father
							by reputation— She said she had read <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father’s</persRef> Book with great pleasure, and that <persRef
								ref="necker-jacques">her father</persRef> had often spoken of it
							with great esteem.— In the Evening I went again out to Ochta—with
								<persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef>— Read some pages in <persRef ref="paley-william"
								>Paley</persRef>, and Sermons 14 and 15. Vol. 8 of the English
							preacher— On the Story of <persRef ref="joseph3">Joseph</persRef>; and

							concluded to return the Civility in the usual form, which I might the
							more regularly do, not having received officially from my Government the
							Declaration itself— He mentioned to me the latest news from England, and
							the Account of <persRef ref="foster-augustus">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Foster’s</persRef> arrival there from America. He
							professed to have a particular attachment to America, with which he felt

							there, an <persRef ref="cathcart-elizabeth">American Lady</persRef>) and
							to cherish a wish that the political differences between that Country
							and England might yet be amicably settled— I assured him that my own
							sentiments in this respect altogether coincided with his— I believed
							peace and friendship to be easily attainable between them and highly
							important to the best interests of both— He sent me the newspaper in the
							Evening with a polite Note— Among the expedients which have been
							suggested to procure relief to the sufferings of my dear child, was that
							of lancing her gums— D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Simpson had
							recommended it from the first— D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Galloway,
							who has no opinion of its efficacy now however concurred in recommending
							it; and I sent twice this day for the Surgeon, <persRef ref="u">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gibbs</persRef> to perform it— He
							came nearly at 12 O’Clock this Night, but on feeling the child’s gums,
							thought it would be useless to lance them— There appear to be at least
							seven teeth coming at once, and no one of them sufficiently advanced to
							render lancing the gum advisable— He promised however to call again in

								>Blodget</persRef>— After returning home, I took a walk to the

								<persRef ref="clarke-edward3">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Clarke’s</persRef> Travels in Russia— I endeavour to collect my
							scattered Spirits, and to seek consolation for the heavy Calamity that
							has befallen me, by reflecting on the mercies of divine Providence—
							Perhaps an affectionate parent feeling only for the happy existence of
							his child could wish no better for it, than that it might be transported
							to the abodes of blessedness, before it has lived to endure the pangs
							and sorrows inseparable from existence in the body— As life is the gift
							of God, and is obviously given for enjoyment, it becomes us not to say
							that the gift is without value— It is our duty to be grateful for it, as
							given to ourselves and to those who are dear to us— Yet in the fallen
							Condition of Man, so much of unavoidable bitterness is mingled up in the
							cup of human being upon Earth that we ought perhaps to be no less
							grateful to God for the Death of a tenderly beloved Child than for its
							life— Thus, much reason may suggest though Nature relucts at the
							conclusion— Had it pleased God to prolong the life of my darling infant,
							to what miseries, distresses and sufferings might she not have been
							reserved? How often, and how cruelly might the ills inevitable which
							would have befallen her have rent her own heart as well as mine?— In the
							bosom of her Father and her God, she has no more suffering to endure,
							and I may hope is in the fruition of immortal bliss— These are soothing
							thoughts— But the bereavement of joy and comfort, to <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">her mother</persRef> and to me! how
							keen and severe it is! She was precisely at the age, when the first dawn
							of intelligence begins to reward the Parents pains and benefits— When
							every gesture was a charm—every look, delight; every imperfect but
							improving accent, at once rapture and promise— To all this we have been
							called to bid adieu! And in renouncing all those expectations of
							exquisite enjoyment of which we had fondly looked forward to the
							prospect, we are stung by the memory of what we already enjoyed in her
							beaming intelligence and angelic temper— Let us bow with humility,
							reverence and resignation to the chastening hand of God; and pray that
							he would sanctify to our improvement, in piety and virtue, an
							affliction, which for the present is not joyous, but inexpressibly
							grievous.</p>

							this Evening I called by appointment upon <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>, who told me that
							he had asked to see me by the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> command. That having made peace, and
							re-established the relations of amity and commerce with England, the
							Emperor was much concerned and disappointed to find the whole benefit
							which he expected his subjects would derive commercially from that event
							defeated and lost by the new War which had arisen between the United
							States and England— That he had thought there were various indications
							that there was on both sides a reluctance at engaging and prosecuting
							this War, and it had occurred to the Emperor, that perhaps an amicable
							arrangement of the differences between the parties might be accomplished
							more easily and speedily by indirect than by a direct Negotiation— That
							His Majesty had directed him to see me and to enquire, whether I was
							aware of any difficulty or obstacle on the part of the Government of the
							United States, if he should offer his Mediation for the purpose of
							effecting a pacification— I answered that it was obviously impossible
							for me to speak on this subject, any otherwise than from the general
							knowledge which I had of the Sentiments of my Government. That I was so
							far from knowing what their ideas were with regard to the continuance of
							the War, that I had not to this day received any official communication
							of its Declaration— But that I well knew, it was with extreme reluctance
							they had engaged in the War, that I was very sure, whatever
							determination they might form upon the proposal of the Emperor’s
							Mediation, they would receive and consider, it as a new Evidence of His
							Majesty’s regard and friendship for the United States; and that I was
							not aware of any obstacle or difficulty which could occasion them to
							decline accepting it— For myself, I so deeply lamented the very
							existence of the War, that I should welcome any facility for bringing it
							to a just and honourable termination— I lamented it, because I thought
							that the only Cause which had made it absolutely unavoidable, was
							actually removed at the moment when the Declaration was made. If the
							course which had been adopted by my Government had been such as I could
							not in my own mind approve, it would not become me, to censure it— But
							it was not so— The Declaration of the <persRef ref="george-iv">English
								Regent</persRef> in April, and the letter which <persRef
								ref="foster-augustus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Foster</persRef> had written <hi rend="strikethrough"
									><unclear>gove</unclear></hi> to the <persRef ref="monroe-james"
								>American Secretary of State</persRef> in communicating it, had as
							it appeared to me left the American Government no alternative, but an
							immediate appeal to arms, or a dishonourable abandonment of all the
							unquestionable rights for which they had contended, and <pb n="415"
								type="ms"/>even the essential characteristics of an independent
							Nation— The blame of the War was therefore entirely on the English side;
							but the war itself was not the less disagreeable to me— I lamented it
							particularly as occurring at a period when from my good wishes for
							Russia, and the Russian Cause, I should have rejoyced to see Friendship
							and Harmony taking place between America and England, rather than
							Discord and Hostility. I knew the War would affect unfavourably the
							interests of Russia— I knew it must be highly injurious both to the
							United-States and England— I could see no good result as likely to arise
							from it to any one— Nothing but mischief; and gratification to the
							makers of mischief— The Count said he had considered it altogether in
							the same light—and so had the Emperor—who was sincerely concerned for
							it, and who had himself conceived this idea of offering his mediation—
							He thought an indirect negotiation, conducted here, and aided by the
							conciliatory wishes of a friend to both parties, might smooth down
							difficulties, which in direct discussion between the principals might be
							found insuperable— To a mutual friend, each party might exhibit all its
							complaints and all its claims, without danger of exciting irritations or
							raising impediments— The part of Russia would only be to hear both
							sides, and to use her best endeavours to conciliate them.— I said, the
							Count was aware that there was a third party to be consulted as to the
							proposal—the British Government— He said the proposal had already been
							suggested by him to the <persRef ref="cathcart-william">British
								Ambassador</persRef>, and he had yesterday dispatched an account of
							it to his Court— I asked if I could obtain a Courier’s Passport, to
							communicate the information to my Government— He said it might be
							furnished in a manner that the person should be dispatched as a Russian
							Courier— I asked him if he could obtain from Lord Cathcart any paper
							which should operate as security from capture by British Cruizers—as in
							that case I presumed I could find an American vessel here to carry the
							dispatches— He said he would ascertain and inform me in the course of a
							very few days— And he should write to <persRef ref="dashkov-andrei">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daschkoff</persRef> to repeat the same
							proposal to the Government of the United States.— The Count dwelt
							earnestly on the Emperor’s regard for the U.S. and added that the
							Emperor was fully sensible of the great advantage to the interests of
							his People, resulting from the commercial relations with America— He
							said it manifested itself even in objects of a light Nature— He the
							Count had received from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daschkoff a
							picture—a view of M<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"><hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s</persRef> Seat—and upon
							his mentioning it to the Emperor, His Majesty had insisted upon seeing
							it himself.— The Count was obliging in his enquiries, and condolence
							upon my domestic misfortune— His Countenance retains strong traces of
							the illness he had at Willna; and he complained of having taken Cold at
							the funeral of <persRef ref="vonbudberg-andreas">Baron
							Budberg</persRef>; one of his predecessors in the Department of foreign
							Affairs. He read me a note which he received while I was with him from
							Lord Cathcart, with news from England and Spain— Of the English and
							Allies having taken Madrid.— After leaving the Count I called on M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Kimball, and left with him a letter for
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef>— He and M<hi

						<p><date>25. </date>At 9 O’Clock this morning I went with <persRef
								ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef>, to Field Marshal General <persRef
								ref="saltykov-nikolai">Count Soltykoff’s</persRef> house; and
							attended the funeral of his wife, <persRef ref="saltykov-natalia"
								>Countess Natalia</persRef>— The Ceremonies were the same as I have
							seen them several times before— About ten the procession moved from the
							house, and was an hour and three quarters in reaching the Monastery of
								<persRef ref="nevsky-alexander">S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Alexander Nevsky</persRef>. The service, including a short Sermon,
							was an hour and a half long; and it was about two in the afternoon when
							we got home. The procession was large, and the attendance numerous— The
							principal change that I perceived was in the Diplomatic Corps. <persRef
								ref="cathcart-william">Lord Cathcart</persRef>, with a suite of
							seven Gentlemen attached to the British Embassy, <persRef
								ref="zeabermudez-donfrancisco">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="serracapriola-nicola">Young duke of Serra-Capriola</persRef>,
							as attached to the Legation of the two Sicilies, and <persRef
								ref="hochschild-carl">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hochschild</persRef> as Chargé d’Affairs from Sweden were there—
								<persRef ref="demaistre-joseph">Count Maistre</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="vonblome-otto">Baron Blome</persRef> and myself, formed the
							only remnants of the former diplomacy— The Courtiers were as assiduous
							to the British Ambassador, as eighteen months ago they had been to the
								<persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">Duke of Vicence</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fisher</persRef> called upon me after I came home; much alarmed and
							anxious about his present situation here.— The English are all preparing
							to leave the Country— Their fears are greater than I believe there is
							occasion for. My Landlord <persRef ref="u">Strugoffshikoff</persRef>
							also came to me; much alarmed and mortified at the present situation of
							his Country— Hinting, but afraid expressly to say that Moscow is in the
							hands of the French, and still reposing Confidence in the <hi
								rend="italic">cunning</hi> of <persRef ref="kutuzov-mikhail">General
								Kutuzoff</persRef>. Nothing Official has yet been published by the
							Government concerning the occupation of Moscow; and the rumours are
							innumerable— Several persons it is said have been made to sweep the
							Streets for having said that Moscow was taken— So that the people are
							afraid of talking.— I walked before and after dinner. Called at the
								<persRef ref="bezerra-joao">Chevalier Bezerra’s</persRef>, but
							neither he nor <persRef ref="u">his lady</persRef> was at home— <persRef

						<p><date>28. </date>I was awaked and rose this morning at five O’Clock—
							Walked an hour and a half before Breakfast. Had morning visits from
								<persRef ref="raimbert-francois">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Raimbert</persRef>, and from <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierre de Poletica</persRef>, who was
							in America as the Secretary of Legation to <persRef
								ref="vonderpahlen-friedrich">Count Pahlen</persRef>— He was

							and came through England— He is now appointed to go to Spain, and is to
							depart in ten days or a fortnight. I had a conversation of nearly two
							hours with him, upon the affairs of America, Russia, France and England.
							His opinions and Sentiments are those now prevailing here— Of course
							anti-gallican, and anglomanian. That a Russian should abhor France, and
							adhere to England at this time is very natural and very proper.— With
							respect to American Affairs M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Poletica’s
							opinions, are favourable to the federalists—most of his acquaintance
							having been of that party.— He said he had intended to publish here a
							Statistical Account of the United States; and had collected materials
							for the purpose, but that he should now be obliged to postpone it untill
							after his return from Spain. He said there was an old Ukaze of <persRef
								ref="peter-the-great">Peter the Great</persRef>, forbidding every
							person employed in the Department of foreign Affairs, from associating
							with the foreign Ministers— And that he had asked <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> whether he might
							visit me—to which he received for answer that he might see me; but not
								<hi rend="italic">frequent</hi> me— He said the Chancellor had told

						<p><date>29. </date>A <persRef ref="u">Captain Myers</persRef>, master of an
							American vessel lying at Wyburg, called upon me this morning—to enquire
							whether I could give him any information concerning his prospects of an
							opportunity to go away from this Country before the Winter— I had none,
							but advised him to wait, supposing that in the course of a week or ten
							days, the state of affairs will be so far ascertained that he can
							determine conclusively what to do— I dined with <persRef
								ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> at <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris’s</persRef>— The Company
							consisted of <persRef ref="laval-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Laval</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Labensky</persRef>, the late Russian Consul-General in France; the
							Abbé<space/>and <persRef ref="rapatel-jean">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Rapatel</persRef>, formerly an Aid de Camp of <persRef
								ref="moreau-jean">General Moreau</persRef>, lately arrived from
							America— He has entered the Russian Service; and said he should endosser
							l’uniforme to-morrow, and go to join the army, in about eight days— At
							table he talked much and without reserve— Speaking of the <persRef
								ref="charles-xivjohn">Prince Royal of Sweden, <pb n="417" type="ms"
								/>Bernadotte</persRef>, he said, Il a une belle haine pour le
							Monstre; et je le sais déja depuis douze Ans— He added that the same
							Bernadotte, whom he saw a few weeks since at Stockholm, on his way here
							said to him “C’est moi qui ai été le premier à lever l’Étendard contre
							ce Coquin là.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laval asked him how it
							happened that the French Chargé d’Affairs remained at Stockholm— He said
							he did not know—“Mais c’est un imbecille”—which he certainly is not—
							This M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rapatel is supposed to be here, with
							a view to obtain the employment of General Moreau in the Russian
							Service— He spoke of the General’s remaining in America, as an
							uncertainty—saying, if he remained there he would probably build again
							his house at Morrisville, which was burnt down last Winter— After dinner
							I had some Conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laval— He is
							going with <persRef
								ref="laval-alexandra;laval-ekaterina;laval-pavel;laval-vladimir;laval-zinaida"
								>his family</persRef>, and <persRef ref="beloselsky-anna">Princess
								Beloselsky</persRef> and hers to Sweden— He told me that since the
							loss of Moscow, the very idea of negotiating for Peace was offensive to
							the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>; and so it would
							continue; unless his army should be defeated, which it has not yet been—
							If they should be victorious the perseverance in the War, would follow
							of course— But in case of one or two defeats; and one would very
							probably produce two, the change of Sentiment and of policy might be
							very sudden and complete; and the desire for Peace as strong as the
							aversion to it now. I asked him if he could tell me <hi rend="italic"
								>why</hi> the War was commenced— He said women! women! women!— Women
							had been the cause of all the late disastrous Wars against France— It
							was unquestionably the late <persRef ref="elisabethchristine">Queen of
								Prussia</persRef>, who had caused the Prussian War— It was the late
								<persRef ref="mariatheresa">Empress of Austria</persRef>, who had
							produced the last Austrian War, and it was the <persRef
								ref="catherinepavlovna">Grand Duchess Catherine</persRef>, who had
							occasioned this present War— I asked him how it was possible, that the
							proposition should have been made to France, to withdraw all the French
							troops behind the Elbe, as an indispensible preliminary to negotiation—
							Because, said he, it was feared that a more moderate proposal would have
							been accepted.— I said I had very much feared that such was the fact,
							and I was sorry to have it confirmed by him— He said that when the
							Emperor left this City for Willna in April, he intended and expected to
							have preserved the Peace— But when he got to Willna, <persRef
								ref="barclay-michal">General Barclai de Tolli</persRef> laid before
							him a long roll of the troops that had been assembled, and of the
							preparations of all kinds for the War— An extraordinary Confidence in
							his own power and resources was the first effect upon the Emperor’s
							mind— Then, it happened that just at that moment, <persRef
								ref="armfeldt-gustaf">General Armfeldt</persRef> had acquired a
							momentary influence (he had none now) which he had used to stimulate,
							and incense; and he had been a mere instrument of the Grand Duchess
							Catherine— Then unfortunately, <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
								>Napoleon</persRef> had sent to Willna, the <persRef
								ref="narbonne-louis">Count de Narbonne</persRef>, an old Courtier,
							of the old French Monarchy, under <persRef ref="louis-xvi">Louis
								16</persRef>— It would have been better, to accomplish the purpose
							of preserving Peace, if he had sent a Corporal— The very politeness, and
							courtly formalities of Narbonne, were taken as evidence that Napoleon
							was overawed by the greatness of the Russian force—afraid and unable to
							begin the War—the Spirit of exultation was at its height—and in the
							first twenty-four hours Narbonne was <hi rend="italic">couvert de
								Ridicules</hi> and dismissed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laval
							further told me in Confidence that they gave out they were going to
							England, but they should probably not go further than Sweden— At the
							times that might be approaching he had many motives for wishing to be
							absent.— He said if the Court should leave this place, which they should
							certainly do as late as possible, and for which he thought there was
							even yet no determinate plan, he supposed that I should be left at my
							option either to follow the Court or to remain here. But he spoke
							without any knowledge of what was intended— It was merely his own
							conjecture.— He asked me to call upon him to-morrow, and look at a fine
							Picture of <persRef ref="vernet-claud">Claud</persRef> which he has
							lately purchased, and will pack up in a few days. I promised him I
							would.— The occupation of Moscow by the French is at length officially
							announced by a Report from <persRef ref="kutuzov-mikhail">Prince
								Kutuzoff</persRef>, and by a Proclamation of the Government. It is
							attenuated into a Circumstance of trifling importance as to the ultimate
							issue of the War.— <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> had a note from
								<persRef ref="u">Madame Bezerra</persRef>; a substitute for taking
							leave— They went yesterday.</p>

						<p><date>30. </date>I called at one afternoon upon <persRef ref="laval-jean"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laval</persRef>— I found
								<persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Harris</persRef> there— <persRef ref="laval-alexandra">Madame de
								Laval</persRef> talked much about going to England— I saw the
							pictures, and the remainder of the Statues and Busts; all of which were
							packing up— The <persRef ref="vernet-claud">Claud</persRef> is called a
							Cascade of Tivoli; and is a fine picture— It is difficult to admire with
							sufficient fervency the last purchased picture of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> or Madame de Laval— Their extasies, are
							more moderate, when ever a new purchase concentrates them upon itself— I
							have witnessed a succession of these favourites, since my acquaintance
							at the house, and have seen the reign of six or seven of them superseded
							in turn by a new comer— But their owners can never endure a critique or
							even a suggestion of imperfection in any of them— This Claud, of a size
							to require a Carriage for itself, is to travel with them through
							Finland, and Sweden— I had some further Conversation with <pb n="418"
								type="ms"/>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Laval— He says there are
							dreadful accounts of the burning at Moscow, since the French entered it.
							There were two attempts made to burn the houses next to that where he
							had taken his Quarters—in consequence of which his troops set fire to
							the City, in many places at once, and it is feared that the whole City
							may be destroyed.— The <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor
								Alexander</persRef>, since the loss of Moscow, has said publicly at
							his own table “il ny a qu’un coquin, qui puisse prononcer actuellement
							le mot de paix.” His Spirit stiffens with Adversity— The situation of
							the French army, in the midst of their Triumphs is considered as
							absolutely desperate— It is supposed that <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef> wishes to Negotiate; and
							this is the strongest reason, for the determination not to negotiate
							here— But the Emperor Alexander is not satisfied with the conduct of his
							Generals; nor pleased that he made <persRef ref="kutuzov-mikhail"
								>Kutuzoff</persRef> a Field-Marshal, and gave him 100,000 Rubles,
							for a victory, the immediate result of which was the loss of Moscow—
							Kutuzoff says in his last Report that in the Council of War, by advice
							of which he abandoned Moscow, some of the principal Generals were of a
							different opinion— There were three—<persRef ref="benningsen-levin"
								>Bennigsen</persRef>, <persRef ref="konovnitsin-petr"
								>Konovnizyn</persRef>, and <persRef ref="dokhturov-dmitry"
								>Doktoroff</persRef>; for fighting another Battle— Bennigsen has
							written, that untill and including the Battle of Borodino, his advice
							was followed in every thing— Since then not at-all. The defensive and
							Fabian System is certainly painful and costly in its operation; and may
							perhaps not be calculated for a Country situated like Russia— But it has
							not yet had its full trial— The time of real danger to the invader is
							now but just commencing, and it is a species of warfare to which
							Napoleon is not accustomed, and for which he may not be prepared— If
							however the system is good for the old Russian Provinces, it is far more
							questionable for the recovery of Courland, and of Poland— After leaving
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laval I paid one or two visits and
							went to the shops— Passed the Evening at home.</p>
