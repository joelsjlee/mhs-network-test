						<p><date>2. </date>A prospective View of the political state of Affairs in
							Europe, and an estimate of their probable operation upon my private
							concerns induced me this morning to determine upon an arrangement, which
							required the agency of Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							<persRef ref="meyer-jc">Meyer</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bruxner-george">Brüxner</persRef>, I therefore called this
							morning upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meyer with my papers, and
							left them with him— I then paid successively visits to the <persRef
								ref="law-jacques">French Ambassador</persRef>, to <persRef
								ref="pardo-benito">General Pardo</persRef>, and to the <persRef
								ref="bray-francois">Chevalier de Bray</persRef>, with all of whom I
							had much Conversation— The Ambassador is in a state of great uncertainty
							as to the Event, and still professes to have hopes that the Peace
							between France and Russia will be preserved. He assured me with the most
							solemn protestation that no proposition of a derogatory nature had been
							made by France to the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor
								Alexander</persRef>— That indeed there had been no propositions
							at-all— Que la Negotiation est encore Vierge.— He spoke even with some
							appearance of expectation that there might be a negotiation for a
							general Peace, and that it might prove successful— I told him I had no
							hopes of that with the present British Ministry— The System on both
							sides was wound up too high.— Whenever there should be a serious design
							for Peace, both France and England must yield largely of their present
							pretensions— England much more than France; but both a great deal— But
							why (said he) should not they take the basis of <hi rend="italic">uti
								possidetis</hi>.— Let them keep the Colonies; and do what they
							please with Portugal, and we will keep Hanover and Spain— I did not
							think the present English Ministry would abandon Spain— Why not?— It
							would be precisely as it was before the French Revolution— France and
							Spain under one Family?— I did not know what another English Ministry
							might do, but the present one had pledged itself too much to their party
							in Spain, and to their own Country to retreat from that ground.— The
							Ambassador said the Accounts from Wilna were this day of a more pacific
							complexion than the last— The Emperor had sent <persRef
								ref="trubetskoy-sergei">Prince Trubezkoi</persRef>, an Aide de Camp
							General, with a letter to the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor
								Napoleon</persRef>, he supposed to Warsaw, in answer to that which
							had been brought by <persRef ref="narbonne-louis">M. de
								Narbonne</persRef>, also an Aide de Camp General to Wilna.— I
							mentioned the <persRef ref="gustav-iv">ex-king of Sweden’s</persRef>
							journey to Vienna, precisely at this juncture, as leading to conjectures
							that there might be a project for restoring him— Why not? said the
							Count— If the present Swedish Government choose to be at War with us,
							why should not we support the late king; who has certainly a strong
							party in that Country; and especially <persRef ref="gustavus-vasa">his
								Son</persRef>— I agreed with him that there was nothing to be said
							against the policy, and expressed my surprize at seeing the Swedish
							Government now falling into the identical political course which had
							hurled the late king from his throne— I asked the Ambassador to enclose
							a letter for me to Paris, by his next Courier; which he promised— I
							found General Pardo, recovering from his illness, but looking very ill—
							His disorder has been a nervous fever— He told me he was going to take
							the waters at Egra in Bohemia— That he should resign his office, and
							live as a private man, some where in the Austrian dominions— It was the
							only Country where he could reside— He did not chuse to go to France— En
							Espagne on ne veut pas de moi— The Climate of this Country was too
							severe for him— He did not like the English or their habits of Society;
							though he liked very well to read their writings— So that there was no
							part of Europe where he could live comfortably but in the Austrian
							Dominions.— The General’s situation is painful and distressing, and he
							has not energy of character adequate to the adversity which has befallen
							him— He told me some time ago that in case of the War, he was determined
							to stay here at all Events— As the crisis approaches, he sees the
							subject with other eyes; and on the subject of the War itself I have
							never heard him speak rationally untill this day.— He thinks it possible
							yet that the storm may blow over—though extremely improbable— Not that
							there would be much difficulty in finding terms for a compromise; but
							because both parties must yield more than they can easily reconcile to
							themselves; with such forces at their backs— Because they will come to
							the negotiation with an extreme distrust and jealousy of each other;
							because the Emperor Alexander, with the sentiment of his force will feel
							a Confidence that he had not before— Because the Emperor Napoleon, must
							make sacrifices for a compromise, not verbal and apparent, but great and
							real, to be seen and judged of by all Europe— But then he is not upon a
							Bed of Roses— He wants Peace, and must be ready to do much for obtaining
							it; and as to Russia, she has lost an immense advantage by adhering to
							her defensive system and not taking the line <pb n="382" type="ms"/>of
							the Vistula— That would have forced Prussia to an Alliance with Russia—
							Now she was on the other side— The position of Russia was much more
							unfavourable— “Et puis, tant bien que mal <hi rend="italic">cet
								homme</hi> (Napoleon) traine toute l’Europe après lui.” All this is
							very sensible, but totally opposed to every thing that the General has
							oftentimes said to me before— He said nothing of the Affairs in Spain— I
							found the Chevalier de Bray, in the midst of preparations for his
							departure— <persRef ref="bray-sophie">His wife</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="bray-otto;bray-caroline">family</persRef> are gone—last
							Wednesday. While I was with him the <persRef ref="brancia-francesco"
								>Chevalier Brancia</persRef> came in— Walk again in the Evening.</p>

						<p><date>3. </date>There were here this morning, several Sailors; Americans
							which came in the Monticello, a vessel seized and condemned for having
							come here last Summer, under the American flag and with false papers—
							They are unable to obtain payment of their wages, and have various other
							Complaints, which they have time after time brought to me though I could
							only refer them to the Consul, for the means of obtaining for them
							Justice or Relief— <persRef ref="stanwood-theodore">Captain
								Stanwood</persRef>, and <persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher</persRef> called upon me—
							Captain Stanwood wishes to go to Gothenburg, and came to ask if I could
							procure for him a Passport— I knew not whether a Courier’s Passport
							could be granted by <persRef ref="saltykov-aleksandr">Count
								Soltykoff</persRef>;—he is not authorized to grant others; and none
							can be obtained but by sending for them to Wilna.— <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>
							called on me— He had a letter from <persRef ref="sparrow-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparrow</persRef> at Cronstadt,
							concerning the American Sailors, and speaking of their claim, with
							censure, as if they were to blame in their demands.— He read me this
							passage of Sparrow’s letter; which displeased me; as the men claim
							nothing but their right; as they have been much injured men, and as I
							thought harshly treated, by Sparrow who as the Consular agent ought to
							have been their special and zealous protector. I expressed warmly my
							displeasure at the particular passage of Sparrow’s letter, which I
							thought unjust to the Seamen— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris took
							upon himself the whole of Sparrow’s proceedings, and became himself
							extremely warm— His temper provoked mine; untill I told him I thought he
							had always been too ready to disregard or slight the complaints of
							Common Sailors, and that in this instance they had repeatedly stated to
							me that measures were used to compel them to ship again in some of the
							vessels in which they came—false Americans; with false Colours and
							Papers—which the Captains or owners have contrived to get back;
							notwithstanding their seizure— That I had reason to believe other
							vessels than those that were seized had come here last year with false
							American Colours, and had been admitted— That if any of these Sailors
							should finally be forced to ship in those fraudulent vessels, I must
							make my report of it to the Government of U.S. as he would doubtless
							make his— That he knew how much I had been surprized at his proposal to
							take <persRef ref="u">Marks’s</persRef> Bond for the Papers of the
							Angerona, after I had told him I knew that Marks came with false Papers—
							That it was impossible for me to be ignorant of the immense trade
							carried on with England by his partner <persRef ref="meyer-jc">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Meyer</persRef>, in which he was of
							course personally interested; and that it was singular that of the
							vessels which were admitted last Summer, which I had reason to believe
							were false Americans, one or more had come addressed precisely to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Meyer’s House— These remarks, all true,
							and as I believe all proper to be made, were expressed by me with too
							much heat of temper— Harris treated them as imputations which he utterly
							disdained— He asserted that he was perfectly independent of any
							authority of mine, and not accountable to me—(which was true) He said he
							was <hi rend="italic">above</hi> every thing like the imputations I had
							cast upon him—that he scorned to answer them— That he would not suffer
							them from me— I told him, that on my part I disdained all Dissimulation
							with him— And that he might act his pleasure— He had already risen from
							his chair in great Anger— Our Conversation had become loud and highly
							irritated on both sides— He closed by saying with a very elevated look
							and tone “from this moment, Sir, all relations between you and me, have
							entirely ceased”—to which I answered with equal vehemence and anger
							“perfectly content, Sir”—your very humble “Servant”— He immediately left
							my chamber and my house— I went with the <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
								>Ladies</persRef>, and dined with the <persRef ref="bezerra-joao;u"
								>Chevalier and Madam Bezerra</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="betancourt-august">General Betancourt</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="betancourt-anna">his Lady</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="betancourt-adelina;betancourt-carolina">two daughters</persRef>
							were there. <persRef ref="colombi-maria">Madame Colombi</persRef>, and
							her <persRef ref="bode-frederica">Sister Frederica</persRef>. After
							dinner I had some Conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bezerra in his Cabinet— He had last Night received news, of the death of
								<persRef ref="desousacoutinho-rodrigo">Count Linhares</persRef> the
								<persRef ref="pedro-iv">Prince Regent of Portugal’s</persRef>
							Minister of Foreign Affairs; his particular and most intimate friend;
							and by far the ablest man at the Court of Brezil— So Superior indeed to
							all the rest, that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bezerra said he did
							not know what the Prince would do without him.— After dinner I called
							upon Count Soltykoff, to ask him if he would furnish me with a Courier’s
							Passport for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stanwood to go to
							Gothenburg, which he said he would do with pleasure. <pb n="383"
								type="ms"/>The <persRef ref="law-jacques">French

						<p><date>6. </date>A variety of circumstances, of little or no connection

							and received from him a fourth, proposing to call upon me to-morrow;

							Correspondence has now closed, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris
							having sufficiently apologized to me for his hasty conduct and language,
							and I having explained to him the occasion of the warmth of mine— In
							this dispute I have felt myself upon such immoveable ground as to the
							merits, and I had so strong provocation to the anger which I manifested
							that I have not thought myself required to offer to him any excuse or
							apology for it— I withheld even all explanation untill he had
							unequivocally acknowledged and suitably apologized for his own fault— I
							then gave him the explanation; but still without apology—because in any
							view of the subject I owe him none— To myself, I cannot so easily
							excuse, my want of Controul over my own temper— I do not recollect an
							expression, which I ought to recall— My wrong was in the tone, in the
							vehemence of manner and sharpness of voice and demeanour, a sin that too
							easily besets me, and which I have many years struggled ineffectually to
							subdue— This day another affair of a nature altogether domestic,
							occupied part of my time and reflections— I was asked by <persRef

						<p><date>19. </date>The two Sailors of the Monticello came to me again with
							complaints that they could not obtain their dues, either at Cronstadt,
							or from <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Harris</persRef> here, who had turned them out of his house— While
							they were here I received a note from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Harris concerning them, representing them as refusing a reasonable
							proposition for arrangement concerning their wages.— They denied the
							fact, and declared they would gladly accept the proposition— I called on
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris after Breakfast, and proposed
							to him to take the very words of the proposition in his own Note; and
							direct <persRef ref="sparrow-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sparrow</persRef> to make the settlement, as thus proposed, to which

							the terms said in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris’s Note to have
							been refused by the men, and requesting him to make the settlement
							precisely so— With which the men declared they would be satisfied.— I
							paid a visit also to the <persRef ref="law-jacques">French
								Ambassador</persRef>, who is yet very unwell— His complaint is now a
							severe and incessant head-ache which has afflicted him for several
							weeks— On political affairs I found him soured and exasperated,
							principally by the refusal to allow him Passports to go to Wilna— I
							asked him what reason had been assigned— The interruption of the
							Mails—for it seems the French commanding Officer at Memel or at
							Königsberg, about a fortnight ago, stopp’d the Post, going from Russia
							to Germany and the South of Europe, and kept all the letters.— He asked
							me if I had heard it mentioned as a reason, that Passports had been
							refused to <persRef ref="kurakin-aleksandri">Prince Kurakin</persRef>,
							at Paris— I said I had; and also that <persRef ref="lieven-christopher"
								>Count Lieven</persRef> at Berlin, had met with the same refusal— He
							said he knew nothing of the refusal to Count Lieven, but the case of
							Prince Kurakin was thus— On the departure of the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef> from Paris,
							Prince Kurakin had said, “I have nothing more to do here,” and had asked
							for Passports for himself and his family— The <persRef
								ref="maret-hugues">Duke de Bassano</persRef> had furnished him the
							Passports for all his family, including his <hi rend="italic"
								>pupils</hi> (natural children) but had urged him in an amicable
							manner, and for the sake of avoiding the conclusion which must
							inevitably be drawn by the Public from his departure, not to insist upon
							having his own Passport, unless he had orders to that end from his
							Court— The Prince had accordingly desisted. It was said that after the
							Emperor Napoleon’s arrival at Dresden, the Prince had again asked for
							his Passport, and had been again requested to say that it <pb n="386"
								type="ms"/>was by order of his Court, which he had declined— But his
							Passport was not refused; and the motive for urging him to wait was
							altogether amicable— Prince Kurakin was exceedingly esteemed at Paris,
							and not only every right due to his character, but every possible
							accommodation that he could wish would be afforded him— These facts shew
							at once the extreme jealousy, suspicion and distrust existing between
							the parties, and the reluctance they have to begin the War; with the
							anxiety on each side to throw the first act of aggression upon the
							other— The Ambassador told me that <persRef ref="saltykov-aleksandr"
								>Count Soltykoff</persRef>, had been to him in person to inform him
							of the Peace with Turkey, and to tell him how much satisfaction this
							Event caused here. “Oh! I congratulated him upon it; and told him that
							news of Peace was always good news.— And I shall go to the Te Deum—
							Though I suppose they will look at me, as they did last Year at the Te
							Deum for <persRef ref="kutuzov-mikhail">General Kutuzoff’s</persRef>
							affair at Rustshuk.— I saw them look at me, when I kneeled, as much as
							to say “Aye! if you pray, it is not for us!”— But after all they have
							not yet got the Ratifications of this Peace from Constantinople and
								<persRef ref="andreossy-antoine">General Andreossi</persRef> is
							there— And certainly by the very last Courier from Constantinople we
							were in high favour there— The <persRef ref="mahmudii">Grand
								Signor</persRef> may ratify the Peace and I suppose he will; but if
							he does it will not be of much importance to Russia, for they have not
							more than 25000 men on the Danube.— I said I had heard the Ratifications
							were already received; and that there was not only a Peace but an
							Alliance Offensive and Defensive— That is all Russian talk, said he— And
							they have filled poor <persRef ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi
									rend="superscript">t:</hi> Julien’s</persRef> head with such
							stuff— He came and told me just such a Story— But you may rely upon it
							they know nothing of the Conditions of the Treaty— All they have is a
							Courier sent by <persRef ref="balashov-alexander">Balacheff</persRef>,
							the Police-Minister, by the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> order, with a letter for the <persRef
								ref="elizabeth-alexeievna">Empress</persRef>, saying that the Peace
							was signed and the Pruth was to be the boundary— But they are waiting
							for the Ratifications, and that is the Reason why the Guns have not been
							fired, and the Te Deum is not to be next Sunday but the Sunday after.— I
							asked him if he had any news from Sweden— None— But he thought when the
								<persRef ref="gustavus-vasa">Prince Royal</persRef> had time to grow
							cool, and to reflect upon things, in the morning, abed, he would find it
							advisable to change his course a little— He was a man of fiery temper,
							and had shewn that at Vienna— But he dearly loved his bed, though he was
							a working man too; and the bed was a very good place for cool
							reflection— He would at last ask himself, what it would all come to, and
							what <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was staking upon the Event— He did not
							think it would come to extremities— I mentioned to him the Squadron
							ready to sail from Cronstadt.—and that it was said they were to land
							troops in Pomerania, and the Prince Royal was to command the joint
							expedition. Yes, he said, so he had heard— The Squadron were going to
							Sweaborg to take in troops there; but he did not believe the
							Prince-Royal would command them— He had even heard that <persRef
								ref="moreau-jean">General Moreau</persRef> was coming from America
							to join them, but neither did he believe that— At any rate however, if
							they were to land in Pomerania there were the <persRef
								ref="oudinot-charles">Duke of Reggio</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="ney-michel">Ney</persRef> and the <persRef ref="victor-claude"
								>Duke of Bellune</persRef>, <persRef ref="victor-claude">Marshall
								Victor</persRef>, each with thirty thousand men to receive them— And
							as for that one (the Duke of Bellune) he and the Prince Royal of Sweden
							“ne sont pas Cousins.”— He asked me about the late changes in the
							British Administration; I told him what I had collected from the papers
							to 26. May; he had no accounts so late— I asked him where the Emperor
							Napoleon was— He did not know— Perhaps at Warsaw— He heard the Russians
							had concentrated their forces, because they said the Emperor Napoleon
							always attacks the Centre— There it is; said he— They think, because he
							has done so before, he will do so again— But with such a Man as that,
							they will find their calculation fail them— He will do something that
							they do not expect— He does not copy himself, nor any other— He does
							something new.— It was near dinner time when I came home— After dinner I
							rode to Kammenoi-Ostroff with the <persRef

							the expences of his journey here— And as for an establishment (or

								ref="bray-francois">Chevalier de Bray</persRef>, who came here about
							the same time that he did, had received from the <persRef
								ref="maximilian-i">king of Bavaria</persRef>,
							<unclear>30</unclear>,000 franks for the expences of his journey, 42000
							florins for outfit, eight thousand ducats a year Salary, and a present
							of twenty thousand ducats besides— Of all this De Bray had shewn him the
							particular account; so that in four years time De Bray had received
							160,000 franks more than he had, which was not at-all pleasing to him.
							He told me also a number of other circumstances respecting his own
							family and private fortune— The Chevalier Bezerra is still in great
							distress on account of the decease of his friend <persRef
								ref="desousacoutinho-rodrigo">Count Linhares</persRef>, of which he
							had now received the confirmation— He came to look at my maps of Russia,
							and has the intention of going to Schlüsselburg, and up the Ladoga-Canal
							which he thought was the canal uniting the waters of the Caspian with
							those of the Baltic— I shewed him by the maps and by <persRef
								ref="coxe-william">Coxe</persRef>, that the Canal of Vishnei
							Voloshok was a different thing— I lent him the English papers to 26.
							May, which he returned me in the Evening.— <persRef
								ref="plumer-ernestus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Plummer</persRef> came and introduced to me <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Kimball</persRef> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>two Americans lately from Moscow;
							and who arrived last Summer at Archangel— These visits engrossed almost
							entirely the Morning— After dinner <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>we</persRef> rode out to the Whitsunday Catherinenhoff procession
							which was thinly attended, and from which we were obliged to return in
							the midst of a heavy shower of rain— There had already been one
							accompanied with thunder in the morning while M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bezerra was with me— The weather was so warm this morning
							that I had been tempted to lay aside my flannel garments; but was
							obliged to resume the waistcoat in the Evening, and suffered for my
							imprudent haste— It seems impossible to trust this climate for an hour.—
							I read the Sermons 7 and 8. Vol. 7. of the English preacher— The first
							on Anxiety—and the second on Envy— That on Anxiety, is by <persRef
								ref="atterbury-francis">Atterbury</persRef>— The text “Take no
							thought for the morrow” and contained many observations of which I felt
							the force— My own disposition has in it too much anxiety, and the
							experience of life has a great tendency to increase that propensity— The
							precept itself, as Atterbury Remarks is too strongly expressed in the
							English Translation— A father of a Family, in this world must take
							thought of To-morrow— Not for what he himself shall eat or drink, or
							wherewithal he shall be clothed; but for his wife and children— The
							situations in which I have been placed since the obligation of providing
							for others has become incumbent upon me, have been almost perpetual
							temptations, and stimulations to waste the means of provision bestowed
							upon me by the goodness of that Heavenly father who feeds the fowls of
							the air, and who clothes the lilies of the field— Had I not a constant,
							unabating, and unyielding thought for the morrow, my family would long
							ere this have been destitute, and <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa2;adams-george;adams-john2;adams-charles2">my
								children</persRef> without the means of obtaining a suitable
							education— With all the thought that I do bestow, and all the
							precautions that I can take resulting from it, frequent untoward events
							and unforeseen accidents disconcert all my prudence, and require new
							sacrifices of feeling, of pleasure, and even of indulgence to the
							thought for the morrow.— When life must be one uninterrupted struggle
							against impulses of every kind, to expence beyond income, what but an
							anxious thought for the morrow, can be adequate to maintain it?— But the
							guard upon my own disposition which it behoves me to seek, is against
							allowing this thought for the morrow to run to excess—and to prevent its
							degenerating into carking Care and distrust of Providence— The Discourse
							upon Envy, was not very striking to me— I am not conscious of being much
							afflicted with this vice—and though I cannot deny that I sometimes have
							felt more of it than was comfortable to myself, I cannot charge myself
							with ever having indulged it— I read also several Sections of <persRef
								ref="watts-isaac">Watts’s</persRef> Logic, and finished the first
							Part; on Perception or Ideas— I find in this Book which I studied
							twenty-seven years ago, and into which I had not since looked, untill
							this reperusal, much knowledge familiar to my mind, but which I was not
							conscious of having learnt from it— As I advance in years this
							experience multiplies upon me— The knowledge remains when the Memory of
							the Master from whom I learnt it has vanished— If I should ever have the
							opportunity to examine the progress of my Sons in this part of their
							Studies, I think I can suggest thoughts to them concerning it, which
							would have been useful to me, had they been pointed out to me when I
							first read this Book.— Its method, and its divisions, deserve to be
							noticed— The five properties essential to
							perception—clearness—completeness—comprehensiveness, extensiveness, and
							order are set forth in a variety of forms, and with illustrations which
							ought to have been better impressed upon my recollection. <pb n="388"
								type="ms"/>The application of these five properties to this Treatise
							of Logic itself, had escaped my attention heretofore— The remarks upon
							the definitions of names and things, and upon the distribution of ideas,
							deserved more reflection than I ever gave to them. It would perhaps be a
							good exercise for Students in this Art to make them give definitions of
							various objects, and to discuss their definitions according to the rules
							in the Book— The practice would I think have a tendency to make them
							think with precision; a want of which is one of the most copious sources
							of erroneous opinions, and of misconduct.— Accurate definition is
							perhaps a more difficult thing than any person would imagine, who never
							tried the experiment of formally defining.— I had thoughts of going out
							to see the Sun rise to-morrow; being the Morning of the Summer Solstice;
							but found myself too unwell.</p>

						<p><date>24. </date>I came in the course of my scripture reading this
							morning to Psalm 37.— Fret not thyself because of evil-doers &amp;c and
							was much struck with its excellent and profound morality— The duty of
							reliance upon the retributive Justice of God, without being staggered
							either by the transient prosperities of the wicked, or by the
							afflictions of the good is inculcated with a force of sentiment, and an
							energy of expression such as I have never met with in any of the profane
							writers. <persRef ref="plutarch">Plutarch’s</persRef> Treatise on the
							delays of divine Justice, and <persRef ref="juvenal">Juvenal’s</persRef>
								13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Satire are not comparable to
							it—they contain with more diffusion a part of the same doctrine— But
							this Psalm was written centuries before <persRef ref="homer"
								>Homer</persRef>, and a thousand years before Juvenal and Plutarch—
							There is not indeed in the Psalm any recurrence to the rewards and
							punishments of another life, and it leaves the argument entirely open
							for the sublime improvement of the Christian doctrine— But it is to be
							observed that one of its promises of blessedness (to the meek; for they
							shall inherit the Earth) is expressly quoted and repeated by our Saviour
							in his Sermon on the Mount. (Matt: V.5.) There is so much prosperity to
							the wicked in this world, and the good, as far as human nature can be
							called good, are followed by such great and manifold afflictions that
							some consolotary principle of trust upon divine Justice is necessary to
							the comfort of existence— I know of none equal to that in this Psalm,
							with the addition of the Christian faith— Morning Visit from <persRef
								ref="montreal-f">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Montréal</persRef>
							who told me that the <persRef ref="law-jacques">Ambassador</persRef> had
							now applied for his Passports to go away, for himself and all his
							family; but that he would not receive them untill <persRef ref="kurakin-aleksandri">Prince Kurakin</persRef> shall
							be on the frontier— Afterwards I had a visit from the Ambassador
							himself, who told me that Prince
								Kurakin having for the third time demanded his Passports,
							they had been sent to him, and that it appeared the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef> was determined not to
							negotiate at-all— That with his last demand for Passports the Prince had
							sent a Note, offering, on condition of the total evacuation by French
							troops, of the Prussian Territories, as a preliminary, that the Emperor
							Alexander would then do, what I, said the Ambassador have been urging
							and intreating them to do, these twelve-months; that is, send powers to
							treat about the Duchy of Oldenburg.— And the <persRef ref="maret-hugues"
								>Duke of Bassano</persRef>, has sent me an English Newspaper,
							printed before Prince Kurakin presented his Note, and containing not
							only the substance of it, but the very words, excepting that it <pb
								n="389" type="ms"/>says that if the French do not evacuate Prussia,
							the Emperor of Russia will have War— This the Prince’s Note does not
							say; but otherwise it is in the precise terms of the Article in the
							English Newspaper. As to the condition, how was it possible to suppose
							that we could comply with a preliminary dishonourable to ourselves— A
							proposition which after the Battle of Friedland we never thought of
							making to Russia on our part— <persRef ref="saintjulien-johann">Count
									S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Julien</persRef>, and all the
							Ministers of the Rhenish Confederation, have asked for their Passports
							also, and have received the same answer— <persRef
								ref="saltykov-aleksandr">Count Soltikoff</persRef> had told me
							before that he was authorized to grant passports for us Ministers; but
							now he tells me he has dispatched my demand to Wilna— I asked him how
							this happened after what he had assured me; but he said “Oh! mais a
							présent c’est autre chose”— So I suppose they keep us as hostages. As to
							Count S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Julien, he used to say to me [“]Ah!
							Monsieur l’Ambassadeur, you are going away, and I shall have all the
							women to myself.”— But he too has asked for his Passports— For my own
							part; as soon as I cross the line at Polangen, I shall turn round; put
							on my Uniform, and commence soldier again— I am sorry for it; for I
							should like, to be once for all one thing or another.— Thus it appears
							that the Rubicon is passed, and before this moment the dogs of War may
							be loose— The Ambassador asked me to take charge of some papers,
							relating merely to individuals, and which might even be delivered up if
							demanded— I told him I would with pleasure take them.— I walked after
							dinner in the Summer Gardens; and observed from the stand upon the Quay
							the setting of the sun. Our Italian footman was detected this Evening in
							thieving.</p>

								>Count Nicholas Soltykoff</persRef> the President of the Imperial
							Council, announcing the invasion of the Russian Territories by the
							French; and his Resolution never to make Peace, so long as an enemy
							remains in arms upon his territory— <persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher</persRef> came to me again with
							his Custom House Clerk; concerning the vessel from Lisbon, which is
							refused at the Custom-House to be admitted— I sent to enquire if
								<persRef ref="bezerra-joao">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bezerra</persRef> was at home that I might call upon him— He sent me
							for answer that he would himself call upon me; which he did— I mentioned
							to him the detention of this ship for entering from Lisbon,
							notwithstanding the renewal of the Treaty lately concluded with him— He
							said he would immediately go to the <persRef ref="gurieff-dmitri"
								>Minister of Commerce M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gourieff</persRef>, and if he could not see him would write to him,
							and if necessary to Count Soltykoff— The vessel is loaded with fruit,
							which has been very long on its passage, and is daily perishing— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bezerra wrote me afterwards that he had
							called on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gourieff, and seen not him but
								<persRef ref="gurieff-nikolai">his Son</persRef>, who said there
							could be no difficulty in the case, and that the order for its admission
							should be immediately sent— I had a visit from <persRef ref="u">Count
								Frohberg</persRef> the Wurtemberg Minister, who told me that he had
							not yet received his Passports, and did not how it was intended they
							should go— Some said they were to be sent off in a Frigate, and landed
							at Memel or Dantzig. Others that they were to be directed to take their
							course roundabout to the Turkish and Austrian frontier— It was wished
							that they might not have the opportunity to observe the military State
							of the Country, as it is supposed they would by passing through the very
							theatre of the War— The Count asked me to take charge of a small packet
							of Papers, which I promised him I would do— I paid a visit <pb n="391"
								type="ms"/>to the <persRef ref="law-jacques">Ambassador</persRef>,
							who is very anxious to be gone— <persRef ref="derayneval-maximilien"
								>Rayneval</persRef> went off yesterday as a Courier; with <persRef
								ref="derayneval-alexandrine">his wife</persRef>. The Count still
							thinks that the passage at Kovno was a surprize upon the Russians, and a
							“Superbe debut.”— We had Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>

							but sent excuses— I walked late in the Evening.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> Since the days have been at the
							period of their greatest length, and while there is no Night, I have
							found it impracticable to keep even so much regularity in the
							distribution of my time as I did in the Winter— There has hitherto been
							scarcely any warm, and very little fair weather— I have no temptation to
							walk in the morning, and seldom go out untill after dinner— I then
							usually ride out with my family seven or eight miles, and walk five or
							six of them home— This occupies the Evening untill past ten at Night;
							and an hour or two insensibly slips away, in amusements with <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, and conversation. Sometimes,
							with an occasional visitor— I rise proportionably late from seven to
							nine in the Morning— Most commonly about eight— As for the rest my
							occupations continue the same— I still hear Charles read in the first
							Volume of <persRef ref="dufief-nicolas">Dufief’s</persRef> Grammar, and
							in <persRef ref="berquin-arnaud">Berquin</persRef>— But he has been part
							of this Month so unwell that his lessons have suffered from it— He has
							read much less than last Month, and has made very little if any
							progress— His English pronunciation especially seems rather to fail than
							to improve in correctness— He speaks French always; even when we speak
							in English to him.</p>
