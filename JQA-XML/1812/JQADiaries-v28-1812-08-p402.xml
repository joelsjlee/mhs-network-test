							likewise read some pages in <persRef ref="watts-isaac">Watts’s</persRef>
							Logic; on the doctrine of Prejudices—which occasioned the reflection how
							excessively difficult it is to divest one’s self of prejudices; and how
							much more difficult still to discard prejudices, without falling into
							indifference with regard to important truth. I believe the best guard
							against prejudice is a frequent examination of our opinions, and a cool
							estimate of the arguments opposed to them— You must as <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> says identify yourself in
							imagination, first with your adversary and then with your judge—and
							above all you must have resolution to abide by the result even if it
							should be adverse to your preconceived opinions. The victory over

							before Breakfast— I attended from Noon, untill 4 in the afternoon, at
							the sale of the <persRef ref="bray-francois">Chevalier de

								ref="colombi-donfrancisco">Don Francisco Colombi</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="zeabermudez-donfrancisco">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Zea</persRef>, who informed me that <persRef
								ref="wittgenstein-peter">Count Wittgenstein</persRef> had totally
							defeated <persRef ref="oudinot-charles">Marshal Oudinot</persRef>, with
							great slaughter, and had taken his baggage, Artillery, and three
							thousand prisoners.— In Spain too he said all was going on well, and
								<persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Lord Wellington</persRef> was at
							Salamanca.— After dinner I had a visit from <persRef
								ref="gabriel-claude">Claude Gabriel</persRef>, the Black Man in the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef> service who went to
							America last Summer for his wife and children, and who is now come back
							with them— He complains of having been very ill-treated in America, and
							that he was obliged to lay aside his superb dress, and Sabre which he
							had been ordered to wear, but which occasioned people to insult and even
							beat him.— <persRef ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi
									rend="superscript">t:</hi> Julien</persRef> the late Austrian
							Minister, had a fancy for appearing in public here in the Vienna
							fashion— So he drove about the streets last Winter in a sleigh of a
							different appearance from those here used— It was a sort of
							Phaeton-body, hung upon runners, perhaps six feet high, and with
							clusters of sleigh-bells at the saddle-place of the two horses— He drove
							himself, with a footman carrying an enormous muff behind him on the
							sleigh— Although this is perhaps the spot of the globe, where varieties
							of dress, and of modes of appearing in public, are most common, and
							where they of course excite the least attention, there was yet something
							so ludicrously fantastical in this anomaly of Count S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Julien’s Sleigh, that he made himself the
							laughter of the Court and City by it. I was once mentioning to him how
							dangerous it was to appear in the Streets of London, in any mode or
							dress different from those to which the eyes of the people are
							accustomed— “Then I suppose[”] said he, [“]my Traineau would make a Riot
							there—[”] I told him I questioned whether he would ever have occasion to
							use it a second time in that City— It was said that he had asked the
							Emperor Alexander’s permission to exhibit this rarity about the town,
							and that the Emperor Alexander answered him, that <hi rend="italic"
								>he</hi> had not the slightest objection—but added; if the children
							in the Streets, should throw stones at it, I hope, Monsieur le Comte,
							you will not be surprized— There was so much sound sense in this remark,
							that I know not how the idea had not occurred to the Emperor, when he
							ordered Claud Gabriel to wear in public his magnificent gala Court
							dress, when he should arrive in America— After wearing them once at
							Providence and once at Boston, he says he was obliged to hide them; and
							he looks as if even that wearing had cost him five or six of his front
							teeth. He says however he told the Emperor that he had been well
							treated, and that he had worn the dress all the time.— I Rode with the
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
								>Ladies</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> to Kammenoi-Ostrof, and walked home alone—
								<persRef ref="groves-william">Captain Groves</persRef> had been this
							morning to ask my advice whether he should sail, under the prospect of
							War, between the United States and England— He is here with a vessel of
								<persRef ref="gray-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gray’s</persRef>; and all ready to depart— I advised him to wait for
							further information— <persRef ref="proud-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Proud</persRef> called three or four times to see me in
							the course of the day, but I was not at home— In the Evening I received
							a Note from him informing me that he had the Official Declaration of War
							by the American Government against Great-Britain; which was brought him
							by Express from Gothenburg— <persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> afterwards came in and
							had heard the Declaration was issued on the 18<hi rend="superscript"

							fourth year since we embarked at Charleston to come to Russia.</p>

							with that where he resides—from the police laws of the Country— There is
							indeed usually a good deal of indulgence on this subject in the practice
							of all Nations, in ordinary times, but every State must be the judge
							when its own interests require that this indulgence should be withdrawn—
							I did not think that in the present case, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Harris’s Consular Privilege, could extend to exempt frenchmen in his
							service, and residing in his house from the operations of the Police—

							Government a Passport, for the Pilot-Boat which came from New-York, and
							brought the American Declaration of War against Great-Britain— They wish
							to send her home with Papers which may protect her from British Capture,
							which if she took dispatches from this Government to their Minister in
							America, they supposed a Russian Passport would do— Though doubtful
							whether this Government would grant such a Passport, I promised to apply
							for it.— I received the Passports both from <persRef

								<persRef ref="hochschild-carl">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							belonged; and he would give me an answer in a few days— I told him how
							our relations stood with regard to England— While I was with him the
								<persRef ref="serracapriola-antonio">Duke de

							was heretofore Ambassador from the <persRef ref="ferdinand-i">king of

								ref="joachim-i">Murat</persRef> has been acknowledged here in that

							again. I called upon <persRef ref="bezerra-joao">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bezerra</persRef>, and conversed with him about two
							hours— A Portuguese Officer came in while I was there; a deserter from
							the French army, who has entered the Russian service— He was accompanied
							by a Spanish Officer— The <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>
							has received them very graciously and given them each fifty ducats— A
							packet was brought in from Count Soltykoff—letters for M<hi

							17. July containing the first three Bulletin’s from the French Army, on
							the commencement of the War with Russia. Also a Correspondence,

							called upon me, to know the success of my application for the Passport—
							I mentioned to them what Count Soltykoff had said to me, and promised

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tringham</persRef>, where we
							dined. The distance is thirty-five Versts, besides three to the Verst
							Stone within the City from which they begin their admeasurement. 25
							English Miles; which our horses ran without once stopping to rest or to
							drink— We had four horses in a line; driven by the Coachman; and two
							leaders, by the Postilion— Seven persons, including the two children in
							the Coach— At Oranienbaum we went to see the Palace, with its Gardens,
							and appendant buildings, which though smaller and less magnificent than
							those of Peterhoff, command a finer prospect, and are kept in better
							condition. There is nothing however very remarkable to be seen in the
							Palaces.— The Series of artificial hillocks, which I believe was
							invented and constructed in the time of the <persRef
								ref="elizabethpetrovna">Empress Elizabeth</persRef>, is now totally
							decayed, and ruinous; so that without an explanation it would be
							impossible to conjecture what was its original intention. It was entire,
							though I believe no longer used when I saw it before in January 1782.—
							There are some indifferent paintings, in some of the Apartments, and in
							the choice of the subjects there appears a predilection for such as the
							Judgment of <persRef ref="paris">Paris</persRef>, <persRef ref="venus"
								>Venus</persRef> and <persRef ref="adonis">Adonis</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="hercules">Hercules</persRef> and <persRef

								>Diana</persRef> and <persRef ref="endymion">Endymion</persRef>, and
							the like— There is a Billiard Room wainscoted with the Nine Muses.
							Tables inlaid with Mosaic— Collections of old China, Japan vases and
							Dresden Porcelain— The most ingenious of which is a concert of monkies,
							in porcelain figures. Each figure with a different instrument and
							attitude; and all caricatures of the various kinds of affected
							Melomania. The furniture is all very old, and exhibits magnificence in
							all its stages of decay, from the mere change of fashion, to the
							perishing rags and tatters of crimson satin curtains and chair-covers—
							We dined about 4. O’Clock, and returned in about the same time we had
							taken to go. We reached the City before eight in the Evening, and I
							walked from the Fontanka home. The road as far as Peterhoff is entirely
							plain; but from thence to Oranienbaum there are several hills and dales—
							The view of Cronstadt on the opposite side of the gulph is most pleasant
							between the two places.— The villages are both small and mean.</p>

								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Galloway, and received for answer
							that he was gone out of town for four or five days— We sent for
							Simpson—he was gone out of town to dinner, and was to return at
							Midnight— In the Evening about eleven, I sent the Carriage to wait at
							his house untill he should return, with a request that he would come
							immediately to see the Child. An hour afterwards the Carriage came back
							without him— He had returned home, and sent word he could not come this
							Night, but would come in the Morning to-morrow— I went then to him
							myself, and found him in bed— I told him the Circumstances of the
							Child’s situation, and prevailed upon him to come with me and see her.—
							He immediately prescribed an emetic and other things— I was up with her
							untill between two and three in the Morning—<persRef

							of the English Preacher; on the duty of Resignation, and against
							profaneness— Also several Sections in <persRef ref="watts-isaac"
								>Watts</persRef>— My Mind was too much agitated and absorbed by the
							Condition of my Child, to read with suitable improvement— The Sermon
							upon Resignation is by <persRef ref="leed-unknown">Leed</persRef>, and
							adapted to my feelings at this time— Resignation, I know to be a duty,
							and the considerations upon which the preacher urges it are just and
							forcible— But it is a painful duty; and which it requires aid from above
							to be able to fulfill— Profaneness is a vice without a motive— And as it
							was once fashionable among all Classes of People it was more to be
							preached against formerly than it need be now— Like Drunkenness it is
							now principally confined to the uneducated Classes of Society.</p>
