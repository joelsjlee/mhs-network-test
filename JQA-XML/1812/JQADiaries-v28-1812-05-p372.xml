							I dined with <persRef ref="severin-andrew">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Andrew Severin</persRef>, and after dinner, looked at
							some of his Collection of medals and Coins. It is a very large and
							costly collection, but not sufficiently arranged in order to be viewed
							with advantage— Of many hundreds it was impossible to look at more than
							fifty or sixty with attention, at one time— The most curious that I saw,
							were the medals on the death of <persRef ref="louis-xvi">Louis
								16</persRef>. and his <persRef ref="marieantoinette"
							>Queen</persRef>; of <persRef ref="charles-xii">Charles 12</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="gustav-iii">Gustavus 3</persRef> of Sweden— The seven
							Bell Thalers of Frederick Duke of Brunswick Lunenburg; and some antient
							Danish Coins of <persRef ref="canute">Canute the Great</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="margaret-i">Margaret of Waldemar</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="christiern-ii">Christiern 2</persRef> and others— His
							collection of Danish Coins alone, contains between three, and <pb
								n="373" type="ms"/>four hundred pieces— The whole Collection must be
							of more than two thousand— There was a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Krug</persRef> there; a German; and a
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James</persRef>, an
							Englishman, both of whom have also Collections— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Krug’s is confined exclusively to the Russian Coins, and we
							all agreed to go and look at it next Thursday morning— He had with him
							several of the leather Coins which were used in this Country in the 9<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> and 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							Centuries, before there was any Coinage of Metals, here—they are of
							various forms—square, triangular, round, and irregular; with various
							stamps upon them on one side, in the centre— They are about the
							thickness and hardness of sole-leather; all but one of smaller
							dimensions than an American dollar, and that not much larger— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Krug said they were so rare that it was
							impossible to say with certainty whether they were genuine or
							Counterfeit.— Came from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Severin’s,
							immediately home.</p>

							that the vessels all excepting one are to be restored as English
							property, to their real owners— The Captains want to ship men again, and

							now knows to be no American complained that he was threatened with being
							turned out of his lodgings, if he refused to ship with some of these
							Impostors— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris came in while they were

							dinner, stopp’d at the bookseller <persRef ref="u">Howert’s</persRef>
							and purchased a book, which I had promised to give <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>— After dinner I called at
								<persRef ref="bentzon-adrian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bentzon’s</persRef> lodgings, with letters which I wished him to

							Saltus</persRef>; who were however all abroad. I walked an hour
							afterwards on the Quays— Closed the Evening with Cards; untill the
							Cannon from the fortress announced the midnight Mass of Easter-Eve.
							Although fine, the weather was cold and deterred me from giving the
							whole Night to a sight of these Ceremonies.</p>

							which I read in 1785 and 1786. when at Haverhill, preparing for College,
							and which I have never looked into since— As the only formal Treatise

								>French Ambassador’s</persRef>— The company were about twenty-five—
							It was about half formal, a style of etiquette between full State and
							familiarity— <persRef ref="saltykov-aleksandr">Count Alexander
								Soltikoff</persRef> was there— I asked <persRef
								ref="derayneval-maximilien">Rayneval</persRef> if he had the

							to me, and accordingly did in the Evening— <persRef ref="bussche-calmor"
								>Count Bussche</persRef> next to whom I sat at table said this was

							the War is impossible, because the French horses are fed upon the roofs

							this breeds Epidemic distempers among the horses— That is, says the
							Count, not only your horse who has eat the thatch will die; but my horse
							who has not eat it, will die too, for standing along side of yours— Now
							I have calculated that there are in the Russian Army on the frontier
							about 200,000 horses—therefore there must be as many on the french side—
							The Country is already exhausted of forage, so that it cannot feed its
							own horses—how then is it possible it should feed 400,000 horses extra—
							Therefore <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef>
							<hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> begin the War before August— Therefore he
							will not have time for a Campaign long enough to finish the business
							this year— He wishes to make a short War of it— Therefore he will not
							begin this year— Russia will not begin at-all. Therefore there will be
							no War this year.— Thus much for Count S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
							Julien’s prophecy— I paid Evening visits at the <persRef

								<persRef ref="u">his Lady</persRef> was at home, and he came in

							corrupt and treasonable communications to Russian Diplomatic Agents— It
							was taken from the Journal de l’Empire of 15. April— I take both these

								<persRef ref="chernyshyov-alexander">Chernicheff</persRef> was the

						<p><date>15. </date>Morning visit from <persRef ref="montreal-f">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Montreal</persRef>— Walks in the
							Summer-Garden before and after dinner— There is still a remnant of the
							Ice from the Ladoga, floating down upon the river, and the atmosphere is
							at Summer-heat— I saw a tree in the open air, almost in full leaf— The
							grass has begun to shoot up, in the Summer Garden, and is entirely
							green— On returning home this Evening I found <persRef
								ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Julien</persRef> upon a visit. He persists in his opinion that the
							scarcity will prevent the War— The Count was perfectly good-humoured,
							and avowed his prejudices against the Class of Merchants, without
							reserve— He says they are the Cause of all these Wars, without ever
							taking part in them, or suffering from them— They fatten and grow rich
							upon the misery, and blood of Nations— That they have no Country, but
							their Counting-house— No God but Gain— That they will traffic with the
							Enemies of their Nation as readily as with their friends, and supply him
							with provisions, ammunition, arms, any thing that he wants to destroy
							their own Countrymen— He was a Nobleman, and it was natural he should
							not like Merchants— It was the <hi rend="italic">Caste</hi> of Society
							that he esteemed and respected the least of-all— He was a military-man;
							and there was a natural antipathy between the soldier and the pedlar— He
							had ransomed some towns, and burnt some villages, in the course of his
							profession, but there was a reason of public necessity for it— But the
							merchants, burnt and destroyed by little and little—they consumed by
							defrauding on all sides— It was nothing to them who was victorious or
							who vanquished; they made their profit with equal indifference out of
							all— He had seen them at Vienna, after the French had been in possession
							of the City— To them it was as if nothing had happened— They sold their
							goods as freely to the frenchmen, and took the money pressed out from
							the Contributions of their Countrymen, as gaily as if it had been a
							public Jubilee— This was all said in a careless, rattling, good humoured
							tone, and is a sample of Austrian, or High Dutch feelings Military
							Arrogance—and the radical prejudices of German Nobility— The Dark side
							of the commercial Character does present features by no means amiable,
							or respectable, and the Count seized them with sufficient sagacity— But
							the fair side, would present others which restore the balance of
							comparative merit; and in the estimate of impartial Justice place the
							Commercial <hi rend="italic">Caste</hi>, if not upon a level with the
							rest, at least by their side and not far beneath them— Had a sensible
							merchant been present, if he could not have justified his profession
							from the Counts reproaches, he might have turned the tables upon him,
							either as a Warrior, a Noble, a Courtier or a Diplomatist, all of which
							classes have vices of Condition, at least as odious as any that can be
							imputed to the merchants; and from those vices, the Count himself is by
							no means exempt— At my own house, and in the presence of my own family,
							only, I did not think it proper to discuss the subject with the Count,
							or to touch him in his tender parts, as the champion of the Merchants—
							When he charged the merchants with being the Causes of the present War,
							I asked him only, why he did not allow its share to the island of <hi
								rend="italic">Malta</hi>? The Count has a <hi rend="italic"
								>Commanderie</hi>, in the old order of Malta; and I knew it would
							give a different direction to the chain of his ideas. He did not at
							first understand me; for he had forgotten that the War began upon a
							question about Malta— But when reminded of it, he talked about the
							wisdom of <persRef ref="charles-v">Charles the 5<hi rend="superscript"
									>th:</hi></persRef> in giving the island of Malta, to the Order,
							so that it might be possessed by no territorial power; because small as
							it was, whatever territorial power should possess it must have the
							command of the Mediterranean— I finished the Evening, about 11 O’Clock,
							immediately after the Count went away.</p>

								>Sterne’s</persRef> Sermon upon the same text, for the purpose of
							comparison— The <pb n="377" type="ms"/>Doctrine, the general division of
							the subject, the stress of argument, and the conclusions are precisely
							the same in both— But Clarke’s is all cool reason, and Sterne’s is all
							animation— Clarke tells us that Pleasure—Riches and Honours are the
							ordinary pursuits of Mankind to obtain happiness—that they all terminate
							in disappointment; and that happiness is to be found only in the
							enjoyments of Religion— Sterne says the same thing, but he paints the
							men of pleasure, of wealth and of Ambition—describes their Condition,
							adventures and disappointments—varies the character of the monied man,
							modified as the miser or as the man of business, introduces the
							supplementary character of the philosopher, and concludes by an apt
							exemplification of his doctrine, in the person of <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon</persRef>, and a string quotation from him in the
							Ecclesiastes. Clarke gives a mere penciled sketch, and Sterne a finished
							picture, full of expression, and glowing with Colours. Perhaps the
							difference between the two Styles of preaching could not be shewn in a
							more forcible light than by these two Compositions— The 15<hi

						<p><date>21. </date>I attended alone this morning, at the second day’s
							examination at the school of Engineers— The eldest scholars were
							examined—young men of nineteen or twenty, who I presume are prepared to
							quit the Institution— They were examined in the highest parts of the
							mathematics— The Conic Sections, infinite series, and fluxions— They
							were generally ready, and quick in their solutions, but there was one
							instance of a failure, and several of some embarrassment in the
							procedure. The principal examiners were four French Officers, who have
							been engaged for this school, but who are now obliged to return to
							France. The whole Institution is under the direction of <persRef ref="betancourt-august"
								>General Betancourt</persRef> a Spanish Officer, who has been only
							about three years in the Russian service.— There were only <pb n="378"
								type="ms"/>four or five of the young Men examined, and it finished
							before two O’Clock.— <persRef ref="bezerra-joao">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bezerra</persRef> was the only foreign Minister who
							attended, besides myself, and he was not there more than half an hour—
							We did not partake of the Collation; but went and looked over the
							designs and drawings and plans of the young men, which were in another
							Hall.— They appeared to be all well executed, but the name of the
							professor was annexed to each of the designs, as well as of the pupil
							who executed it. <persRef ref="dethomon-jean">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thomond</persRef> the Architect is one of the
							professors, and all the designs of Architecture appeared to be his— The
							House where this school is kept was purchased of <persRef
								ref="yusupov-nikolai">Prince Yussupoff</persRef>, and is a
							magnificent building, with a large and elegant Garden— The Hall where
							the examination was held is spacious and is constructed for a large
							library— The book-cases are built all round the sides of the walls, and
							a gallery about 8 or 9 feet from the floor and extending round three
							sides of the Hall gives the advantages of two Stories in one Room— The
							Several Apartments are lettered at the top Alphabetically, and according
							to an order of Sciences. The theoretical order and arrangement of the
							Hall is ingenious and convenient for a library— But there are scarcely
							any books— The Cases are almost all empty— One of the doors opening to
							the next Hall is painted in imitation of Books— So that the whole Hall
							seems an emblem of promise without performance, and the imposture of
							learning— For such an Institution where the instruction seems
							exclusively confined to the Mathematics, a large library cannot be
							necessary— But Prince Yussupoff to whom the house belonged has a very
							voluminous library himself, which I suppose he kept in this Hall, and it
							has been left unaltered, since the purchase of the house— There is an
							immense expenditure upon this school, but like all the other foundations
							for Education here it is carried on by the means only of foreign
							teachers— Of nine or ten Professors who conducted this examination, one
							only appeared to be a Russian; and he was so continually interfering,
							and intermeddling with the demonstrations of the pupils, sometimes to
							help them when they did not want help, and sometimes disconcerting
							instead of aiding them, that General Betancourt, after repeatedly
							manifesting by looks and gestures his impatience and dissatisfaction, at
							last peremptorily ordered the professor to let the young men alone, to
							do their own work— I returned home and read untill dinner time— In my
							Evening walk I met and walked an hour with <persRef ref="krabbe-hans"

						<p><date>24. </date>Walking on the Quay of the Neva before dinner, I met
								<persRef ref="lowenhielm-gustaf">Count Löwenhielm</persRef>, who
							promised to send me a new Proclamation of the British Government
							respecting the Orders in Council, which he had received by a Russian
							Courier arrived last Night from Oerabro where the Swedish Diet is now
							assembled. He also told me that a new Proposition for Peace had been
							made by France to England which had been rejected, and that he
							considered the War between Russia and France as more certain than ever.—
							I asked him if he had any particular news from the Diet— Oui—tout va
							bien— From Paris?— The Swedish Chargé d’Affairs had been prevailed upon
							by the <persRef ref="maret-hugues">Duke de Bassano</persRef>, not to
							present the Note, from Sweden—but had sent back the Courier with some
							unsatisfactory answer <pb n="379" type="ms"/>His conduct had been highly
							disapproved in Sweden, and the note had been sent back to him with
							peremptory orders to present it— In Spain, Badajos was taken by the
							English— The Siege of Cadix raised— <persRef ref="ballesteros-francisco"
								>Ballasteros</persRef> at Seville, and <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-joseph">Joseph</persRef> retiring into France.—
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef> was doing every
							thing in his power to avoid a War; but it was now too late. . . After
							dinner I sent to the Count’s lodgings for the Proclamation, which he
							sent me— It is in French, and refers particularly to the United States,
							but appears intended really to cajole Sweden— I returned it to him this
							Evening, as he requested— Rode to the Summer-Gardens, and walked in both
							of them with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>— We met and
							walked with <persRef ref="boit-john">Captain Boit</persRef>— On
							returning home I found <persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingraham</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>
							afterwards paid us a visit.— I wrote to <persRef ref="gray-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray</persRef> this day; and read
							Sermons 1. and 2. Vol. 7. of the English Preacher—the first by <persRef
								ref="tillotson-john">Tillotson</persRef>, on the proportion of
							religious duty to knowledge—and the second by <persRef
								ref="foster-james4">Foster</persRef>, on the natural progress of
							Vice, and the true guard of Innocence; exemplified in the conduct of
								<persRef ref="peter">S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Peter</persRef>,
							and his denial of his Lord. I distinguish this as one of the best
							Sermons in the Collection— I read in the Bible this morning 1 Chronicles
							XXII.14. that <persRef ref="david">David</persRef> said to <persRef
								ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>, “Now, behold, in my trouble, I have
							prepared for the house of the Lord an hundred thousand talents of Gold,
							and a thousand thousand talents of silver[”] &amp;c—now according to the
							value fixed in my Bible the talent of Gold was equal to 24261 dollars 40
							Cents and the Talent of Silver to 1516 dollars 26 Cents 8 Mills. by this
							Estimate the gold and silver said by David to have been prepared by him
							in his trouble was no less than three thousand nine hundred forty two
							millions, four hundred and eight thousand dollars—more than the whole
							present National debt of Great-Britain— David may have spoken
							figuratively; meaning only to say a very large sum—but this is a weak
							conjecture— The Estimate of the Talents may be incorrect—more probably.—
							The numbers in the manuscripts may be inaccurate—which is most likely—
							But either or all these suppositions is more credible than that David
							should have collected such masses of silver and gold to be expended upon
							one house— From the enumeration of the People made about the same time,
							the population of the twelve tribes appears to have amounted to about
							seven millions and a half, and certainly could not exceed eight
							millions</p>

							read this day in the English Preacher Vol. 7. the Sermons 3 and 4. On
							Humility.— Plain and Sensible Discourses, on a Subject of importance,
							but concerning which my mind is not settled to its own satisfaction—
							Humility, as this preacher Remarks is a <hi rend="italic">mediate</hi>
							Virtue, between the excesses of Pride, and Pusillanimity. He also well
							observes, that although between those two Vices and perfectly distinct
							from them both, it resembles the latter more than the former, and that
							the former is the more general and predominating vice than the latter—
							He expatiates well upon the nature of Humility— Its excellence as a
							Christian Virtue; and the duty and proper means of cultivating it.— But
							the great difficulty with regard to all these intermediate moral
							Qualities, is in applying the principle to the practice of Life. I
							cherish the Virtue of Humility, in proportion to the scarcity of it in
							the world— When associated with active and energetic powers, it is truly
							admirable— But there is great danger in that Humility, which implies the
							sacrifice of one’s own Judgment to the opinions and wishes of others— In
							all the relations of Life, public and private, I have found this
							difficulty constantly recurring, and when compelled to decide, have
							erred sometimes in following the dictates of my own mind, and sometimes
							in yielding to the persuasions of others. The only true reliance is from
							above.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> Differs from that of the last

							establish the practice of early retirement at night, and early rising in

							health, as age is creeping with insensible stealth upon me— Orderly and
							regular hours are becoming objects to me of the first necessity. I do
							not yet however find it practicable yet to accomplish my intentions
							entirely— The time that I allow for <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> instruction increases— Taking the whole result
							from the time when we came into the City last Autumn untill now, and his
							progress in reading French has been considerable— It is now more than a
							month since I began with him the reading of English— I can scarcely say
							that he has made any progress in that— Sometimes for a week or ten days
							together he seems to fall back instead of advancing—listlessness,
							languor, inapplication, weariness and disgust at the pain of learning,
							with all this a teacher must be patient and all this he must overcome by
							perseverance— There is not unfrequently too in Charles, and I observed
							it before in <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, a sort of
							perverseness which <hi rend="italic">relucts</hi> at amendment— He often
							persists in reading or pronouncing words wrong, when he knows perfectly
							well the right— This is the severest trial of temper— The only way that
							I find effectual for keeping my good homour, is by reflecting how much
							of the same indolence, inapplication and indocility, I had, and still
							have in myself. Another encouragement and consolation is the thought of
							a result which has been obtained.— He reads a lesson of two pages in
								<persRef ref="dufief-nicolas">Dufief’s</persRef> Conversations, and
							one in <persRef ref="berquin-arnaud">Berquin</persRef> of six eight or
							ten pages, every day— The exceptions this month have been, if any,
							certainly not more than two or three— He begins to understand some parts
							of what he reads, and discovers symptoms of taking some interest in it—
							This afternoon of his own accord he asked to continue a scene in
							Berquin.</p>
