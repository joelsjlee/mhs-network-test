							confined three weeks to his chamber, and part of the time to his bed,
							with a nervous fever, which has exceedingly reduced him, but from which
							he is now convalescent— He had some English Newspapers, which he sent me
							in the Evening. I dined at <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
								Romanzoff’s</persRef> with a Company of about forty persons; among
							whom were the Ladies of the celebrated Generals, who are now dispelling
							as <persRef ref="litta-ekaterina">Count Litta</persRef> remarked, like a
							fog before the Sun, the immense armies of the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>, and levelling
							with the dust his Colossal Military Reputation— <persRef
								ref="kutuzova-yekaterina">Princess
								Kutuzoff—Smolenski</persRef>—<persRef ref="wittgenstein-antonia"
								>Countess Wittgenstein</persRef>, <persRef ref="bennigsen-maria"
								>Baronesses Benigsen</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="winzingerode-ferdinand">Winzingerode</persRef>, and several
							others. The day was rendered peculiarly joyous to them, by the news of a
							fresh <pb n="434" type="ms"/>splendid victory over the Corps of the
							French Marshals <persRef ref="victor-claude">Victor</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="oudinot-charles">Oudinot</persRef>, by <persRef
								ref="wittgenstein-peter">Count Wittgenstein</persRef>, which arrived
							this morning. Within the compass of ten days the Russian armies have
							taken between forty and fifty-thousand prisoners—with Cannon, baggage
							and ammunition in proportion— There is nothing like it in History since
							the days of <persRef ref="xerxes">Xerxes</persRef>— I sat at table next
							to <persRef ref="u">Admiral Kutuzoff</persRef>, a nephew of the <persRef
								ref="kutuzov-mikhail">Prince of Smolensk</persRef>; le vainqueur du
							vainqueur de la Terre; who entered into conversation with me, and told
							me some anecdotes of his uncle; who he says is as good as he is great.
							He has been more than fifty years in the service—employed in important
							military and diplomatic stations, successively by the <persRef
								ref="catherinethegreat">Empress Catherine</persRef>, and the
							Emperors <persRef ref="paul-i">Paul</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Alexander</persRef>.— He said that just before the
							Prince went away on this last appointment, he the Admiral was
							enumerating the multitude of military commands and important embassies,
							upon which he had been for so long a series employed; when the old
							Prince, with a grave countenance told him that he had forgotten one of
							his high Offices— what was that?— Director of the German Theatre— It was
							remarkable, the Admiral observed, that Napoleon’s present disasters were
							owing to his having despised his enemy, and Prince Kutuzoff’s success,
							might be due to the opposite cause—for he was an enthusiastic admirer of
							Napoleon’s military genius, and on going away last Summer told him, that
							when he considered whom he was going to oppose, he felt overpowered by
							the magnitude of the responsibility he was taking upon himself— And he
							had lately written him, that notwithstanding he had now the pleasure of
							beating day after day, the first Captain of the Age; and notwithstanding
							the honours that were heaping upon him, he longed for the time when he
							could return here, to his friends.— The Admiral told me that there had
							been here an <persRef ref="bentinck-william"
								>English Admiral named Bentinck</persRef>, a vain glorious bragging sort of man, and he
							and <persRef ref="stael-anne">Madame de Stael</persRef> one day said
							to him that Prince Kutuzoff was destined to be a second <persRef
								ref="wellington-arthur">Wellington</persRef>— But they were much
							mistaken in supposing he should take it as a Compliment— If his uncle
							had done nothing more than Wellington; he would sink low indeed from the
							summit of his merited fame— I said that the English, were apt to make
							much of small successes by land; but I thought they might be allowed a
							little pride upon the Battle of Salamanca— Thanks, said he to the random
							shot that carried away <persRef ref="demarmont-auguste"
								>Marmont’s</persRef> arm, just before the battle began— But here is
							Wellington, with his whole Army stop’d for weeks before a paltry little
							fort at Burgos, with a garrison of 2000 men, which he cannot take— And
							if it were not for our Victories in the North I would lay a wager the
							French would be now again in Madrid— The Admiral was equally severe in
							his remarks upon the Spaniards, and was peculiarly sarcastic upon
								<persRef ref="zeabermudez-donfrancisco">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Zea</persRef>, who sat opposite to us at table— He first asked me
							who he was— I said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Zea, the Spanish
							Minister— Spanish Minister? what?—<persRef ref="bonaparte-joseph">Joseph
								Bonaparte’s</persRef>— “No—<persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">Ferdinand
								the Seventh’s</persRef>— The Minister of the Cortes; who had signed
							a Treaty with <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
								Romanzoff</persRef>—” “Oh! Yes! the Garçon de Comtoir of Colombi,
							the merchant— Why, what a Diplomatic tone he assumes!— You smile I see—
							But I am no diplomatic man. I say just what comes into my head[”]— I
							said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Zea had been connected with the
							House of Colombi; but that I believed he had been a diplomatic character
							sub rosa, even then; as <persRef ref="colombi-antonio">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Colombi</persRef> himself had been
							while he lived.— That his <persRef ref="colombi-maria">widow</persRef>
							had since his death been made a Countess by the regency, for his
							services— Upon all which the Admiral spoke with as little respect for
							Ferdinand 7. and the Cortes, as he had of the English and of Lord
							Wellington. I told him that I had witnessed, with interest and
							admiration the Spirit manifested by all Classes of people, in this
							Nation; under the struggle, from which they are issuing with such
							triumphant glory— That I had never entertained a low idea, of Russia;
							but that the conduct of the Nation upon this severe trial, had far
							exceeded my expectations— He said, Monsieur—La Russie, bien gouvernée,
							est faite pour commander à l’Europe—I think she will not lose the
							opportunity— I observed however that the circumstance which appeared
							most to gratify the Admiral in speaking of the conduct of the Nation,
							was that the peasants had not shewn the least disposition to avail
							themselves of the occasion to obtain their freedom— I see that this is
							what most touches the feelings of all the Russians with whom I have
							conversed on this subject— This was the point upon which their fears
							were the greatest, and that upon which they are most delighted to see
							the danger past— The Admiral, whose name I did not know untill upon
							enquiry after dinner I ascertained it, professed to be so pleased with
							my remarks, that he told me he hoped to have the opportunity of
							introducing me personally to his uncle when he should come home— Count
							Romanzoff told me that he had sent the last letter I wrote him to the
							Emperor, who had been well pleased with it.— I asked him if he had
							received any answer from England, on the proposal of Mediation— He said
							it had not been rejected, but they had intimated an opinion, that it
							would not be acceptable to the American Government— That they expected
							something might be done after the new Election in America; by which the
							Count said he understood them to mean that <persRef ref="madison-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef> after being
							re-elected would be more pacifically inclined than he is at present— I
							said the English Government were much misinformed concerning American
							Affairs— I believed the Emperor’s <pb n="435" type="ms"/>proposal would
							be very acceptable, whatever the Event of our election might be.—
								<persRef ref="cathcart-william">Lord Cathcart</persRef> also said to
							me that the Elections for the new Parliament in England were now over;
							but said he they are more anxious there I believe about <hi
								rend="italic">your</hi> Elections than about our own— I said that
							our Election was of a different description from their’s; it being not
							only of members of the Legislature but also of the head of the Executive
							Department— He said he was glad to observe that there did not appear to
							have been any thing to excite rancour on either side— I told him, from
							the complexion of the Newspapers, I thought there was more of that in
							England than in America— I came home early, and employed the Evening
							with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>.</p>

						<p><date>7. </date>On returning this morning from my walk, I found a Note
							from <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef>,
							proposing a change of the time and place which he had fixed for seeing
							me; and asking me to call upon him between one and two O’Clock this
							afternoon at the Hotel of foreign Affairs; which I accordingly did. I
							told him that my motive for asking this Conversation with him was, that
							since I saw him last, I had received from my Government official notice
							of the Declaration of War by the United States against Great-Britain,
							together with a letter from the <persRef ref="monroe-james">Secretary of
								State</persRef> dated the first of July—that I had not received any
							instruction to make an official communication on the subject to this
							Government; but the Secretary of State had explicitly expressed the
							views of the American Government at that juncture, on several points,
							which I thought it important to communicate to him— The first was the
							desire of the United-States, that this War might be confined to them,
							and Great-Britain; that no other power might be involved in it— That the
							United States wished to preserve unimpaired their relations of Amity
							with all other powers, and that <pb n="436" type="ms"/>this wish was
							declared in a particular manner with regard to Russia.— That the War
							between Russia and France, though it could not then be known in America,
							to have commenced was anticipated as inevitable, and was a subject of
							great regret to the American Government.— That the state of our Affairs
							with France was said to be in an unsettled Condition, and there was not
							much expectation of any speedy settlement of them satisfactory to us—
							But that whatever course they might take, the American Government did
							not contemplate any more intimate connection with France; nor was it
							aware of any occurrence whatsoever, which could induce them to enter
							into any such connection— This sentiment I said was expressed in terms
							as strong as language could employ, and the desire of the United-States
							to maintain in their full extent the friendly and commercial relations
							with Russia, was in terms of equal earnestness— The Count said he was
							obliged to me for the Communication, which he was sure would be
							peculiarly agreeable to the Emperor, before whom he should lay the
							substance of it— That the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef>
							desire to maintain the friendly and commercial relations with the
							United-States were entirely reciprocal to those of the American
							Government; and it was the apprehension that they might be interrupted
							by the English, which had made him wish so sincerely the termination of
							this War— That we might be assured that no circumstance whatsoever could
							induce the Emperor to interrupt the friendly relations of Russia with
							the United States; even if he were prepared to enter into more intimate
							engagements than he is at present inclined to form with any power
							whatsoever— And with regard to the assurance that the intention of the
							American Government was not to form any more intimate connection with
							France, as it would afford particular gratification to the Emperor, he
							wished to ascertain precisely whether he had understood what I stated as
							having been expressed to me in the Communication from my Government.— He
							then repeated over in substance, and correctly, what I had said; and I
							assured him that he had perfectly understood me— He asked me whether I
							had any objection to his communicating to the <persRef ref="cathcart-william">British Ambassador Lord Cathcart</persRef> this part of
							what I had said to him— I answered that far from having any objection, I
							thought it might do good, and could not believe it would produce any
							unfavourable effect— That in the discussion of our differences with
							Great-Britain previous to the War, the British Ministers had frequently
							believed or professed to believe that the American Government were
							partial in favour of France, and were actuated by a French influence in
							opposition to England— If they really entertained such a prejudice, this
							frank and explicit declaration of my Government’s intentions, after the
							declaration of War against them, and precisely at that time, must if
							they were capable of giving it a candid consideration, tend to remove a
							prejudice, and to produce a more pacific disposition— The Count replied
							that he did not mean to say he thought this the only obstacle to the
							restoration of a good understanding between the United-States, and
							England; but he thought it a great one, and that it would be a
							favourable Circumstance to have it removed— He then asked me whether I
							had any late Intelligence from America, indicating the determination of
							the American Government, after the revocation of the orders in Council
							was known— I said I had not; but that although I was satisfied if that
							Revocation had been known the Declaration of War would not have been
							made, yet War being once declared there were other points of collision
							upon which an accommodation became essential, for the restoration of
							Peace; and upon the chief of these; the impressment of Seamen from our
							merchant vessels, it appeared the British Government would listen to
							nothing— I then explained to the Count the Nature and character of this
							practice, as exercised by the British naval Officers—the impossibility
							that any Nation having a sense of independence, and of the protection
							due to its own citizens should submit to it—or endure it without
							indignation; and I told him that two several proposals had been made by
							our Government to the British for a suspension of hostilities— The
							orders in Council to stand revoked; and they stipulating to discontinue
							the practice of impressment from American Vessels; the United States
							prohibiting by Law the employment of British Subjects either in their
							public ships or in private Merchant service— He said he thought the
							latter part of the stipulation could not easily be carried into
							Execution— I told him I did not think it could meet with much
							difficulty; but that at any rate the American Government having made the
							proposal would have been responsible for its execution.— The British
							Ministers however had rejected it; and untill they should be willing to
							come to some accommodation upon this point I saw no prospect of a Peace—
							I was aware, and did not wish to disguise that there was an inherent
							difficulty, which made the British adverse to a compromise— The Count
							asked if they did not complain that they lost great numbers of their
							Seamen, by their becoming naturalized as Americans— I said it was not
							exactly that— There were very few British Sailors who ever were or could
							be naturalized as Americans; and I mentioned to him the Conditions of
							naturalization by our Laws, and the character of them, which makes it
							sure that few foreign seamen can avail themselves of them— But I said
							the American Sea-service, public and private was more attractive than
							the British.— For our common Seamen were better fed, better paid, and
							better treated than English <pb n="437" type="ms"/>English seamen are
							wont to be in their own service— It was natural therefore for English
							Sailors, to prefer our service to their own, and to seize every
							opportunity they could of entering it— This the English Government
							consider and complain of as seduction, and they have no other remedy
							against it than that violent and tyrannical practice of their naval
							Officers of stealing men from our merchant-vessels. I did not know that
							it would be possible ever to come to a compromise with them upon it; but
							I hoped if we could not hit upon any expedient for arranging it, he, the
							Count would furnish us with one— He said “il faudra travailler à
							cela”—and concluded by promising to give the Emperor an account of this

						<p><date>10. </date>On returning this morning from my walk I received a Note
							from the Chancellor <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
								Romanzoff</persRef>, requesting me to call upon him at 12 O’Clock,
							at Noon, which I did— He said he had sent for me to shew me the draught
							of a despatch to <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count
								Lieven</persRef>, the Russian Ambassador in England; which he had
							prepared to lay before the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>
							for his approbation; and as its object was to communicate to Count
							Lieven the substance of what I had said to him in our last Conversation,
							he wished me to peruse it, and to point out any inaccuracy or variation
							from what I had said, and that he would immediately correct it— I found
							there were several passages differing from the ideas I had intended to
							convey to him, which he immediately struck out of the draught inserting
							others in their stead exactly conformable to what I now repeated and
							explained as having said or intended to say before—the Count observing
							that he was desirous of not using one expression either stronger or
							weaker than I had meant to use— The first variance was that he had
							written Count Lieven that I had called upon him <hi rend="italic">by
								order of my Government</hi>, to communicate to him the Declaration
							of War by the United-States against Great-Britain— I had on the contrary
							said to him, that my Government had not ordered me to make any Official
							Communication here of this Declaration; but that having just received
							it, together with a despatch from the <persRef ref="monroe-james"
								>Secretary of State</persRef> indicating the views of my Government
							on this occasion, in relation to other powers, and particularly to
							Russia, I had felt a duty to communicate the substance of it to him.—
							The second difference was that in reporting what I had mentioned of the
							state of our affairs with France, he had used expressions of resentment
							and reproach; such as that France used us as ill as Great-Britain—that
							she gave us nothing but “de belles paroles,” which I told him might be
							very just inferences from the facts, and might even express my own
							sentiments, but which I had not intended to use because my object had
							been merely to state the purport of the despatch I had received, in
							which no such expression of asperity, no sentiment even of irritation
							was to be found— It simply said that the principal subjects in
							discussion with France remained unsettled, and that there was little
							reason to expect a settlement of them satisfactory to us. On the third
							point I observed that the Count’s expressions were not so strong as
							those I had repeated from the Secretary of States letter— He had
							accurately noted the determination of the American Government, not to
							enter into more intimate connections with France, even if a satisfactory
							adjustment of those differences should be obtained; but he had omitted
							the additional assurance that they did not foresee any Event whatever,
							that could produce such a result. The Count immediately struck out every
							one of the passages which I noticed, as inaccurate, and inserted others
							in their stead exactly conformable to my present repetition and
							explanation of what I had said to him in our last <pb n="438" type="ms"
							/>Conversation— I then told him that in consenting to the making of this
							Communication, to the British Government I was aware that it might
							possibly produce an effect different from that which he intended, and
							which I desired— That supposing the British Ministers should be actuated
							by dispositions, which might without any breach of candour be imputed to
							them, the certainty that the American Government would in no Event seek
							or accept a community of Cause with their most dreaded enemy, might
							render them more careless or indifferent to a pacification with us, as
							leading them to think less formidably of our hostility— That I believed
							however, the operation of this intelligence upon their minds, would be
							of an opposite kind—that its tendency would be to promote the Spirit of
							conciliation, and that I was in this respect happy to have the
							concurrence of his judgment— The Count said there was a possibility that
							the effect might be contrary to his wishes and intentions; but he
							trusted it would not— That his instruction to Count Lieven was to inform
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> of this
							Conversation with me, with the purpose of removing the prejudices
							entertained by the British Government; and of promoting the peace which
							he, Count Lieven knew the Emperor had much at heart; as believing it
							most for the interest of both powers, as well as of his own Empire— That
							he had not told Count Lieven that he was authorized by me to repeat this
							Conversation, but appeared to relate it altogether without my privity—
							That as the Affairs of the British in Spain were now not so prosperous
							as they had lately been, they would probably be under the necessity of
							making further efforts there, and might therefore be more disposed to
							accommodation in another quarter— He was quite anxious he said to hear
							from England— He had no accounts from thence later than 3 November, and
							now the only course of information even with regard to the internal
							state of France, was through England— I asked him if there was no
							communication through Sweden and Denmark— He said there was but very
							precarious and dilatory, for even before the war between Russia and
							France, the usual course of the Post between Paris and Copenhagen was
							through Moscow. I spoke to the Count of the answer the English
							Government had given to the Emperor’s proposed Mediation— He said they
							had neither accepted nor rejected it; but had hinted that it would not
							be acceptable in America—that they thought the time was not yet come—
							But it appeared they had sent out <persRef ref="warren-john2">Admiral
								Warren</persRef>, with powers to negotiate—did I know what the
							result had been of this?— I said I did not; but I augured very little
							from this mode of Negotiation— Admiral Warren had been known here, in a
							mere diplomatic capacity, and I had heard his personal character spoken
							of as amiable and conciliatory— But there he went also as commander in
							chief of a hostile squadron of ships, a character in itself far from
							portending conciliation— If we were vanquished indeed, an Admiral might
							signify to us the terms to which we must subscribe as well as any other;
							but untill then it was no good aspect for judging favourably of the
							proposals; to be offered from an Admiral making his first appearance in
							hostile array, with ships of the line and frigates— The Count replied
							that was true; but that to the amiable and conciliatory disposition of
							Sir John Borlase Warren he could bear ample and willing testimony— He
							was as free from pride, and from prejudices both personal and National
							as any Englishman he had ever known. At an early period of his Embassy,
							here, he, Count Romanzoff had told him that the commercial relations
							between Russia and England might be continued on a foundation of mutual
							advantage to both Nations; but not upon the basis of former times—not by
							viewing things under the varnish of the English factory— Not on the
							scale of maintaining here a dominion something like that they had in
							India— Supposing the Russian Commerce upon the Black Sea, were to become
							important? was the English factory to say that there must be none but at
							Petersburg?— It could not be endured— It was absolutely necessary to
							remember that times and things had changed— Sir John did not say any
							thing in answer to this at the time; but afterwards when he was going
							away, he told the Count that he had remembered that conversation, and
							was fully satisfied of the correctness of his opinion.— From the general
							tenor of the Count’s remarks I conjecture that he does not now very
							cordially harmonize with the <persRef ref="cathcart-william">English
								Ambassador</persRef>, or fall into the present commercial or
							political views of the English Government— He said that he was happy to
							find that the British Ministers did full Justice to the Sentiments of
							the Emperor Alexander— More Justice indeed said he to the Emperor, than
							they do to his Chancellor— He told me that <persRef
								ref="zeabermudez-donfrancisco">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Zea</persRef> had lately sent him a despatch of an old date, from
								<persRef ref="dashkov-andrei">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Daschkoff</persRef>, and asked me whether I knew how it came to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Zea’s hands— I suppose M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Daschkoff sent it through the Spanish
							Minister by a Cartel-ship to England, from whence it was transmitted to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Zea, by a Courier.— After returning
							from Count Romanzoff’s I took a ride with <persRef
								ref="smith-catherine-johnson">Catherine</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>— The cold continues
							inflexibly severe; and this Evening had penetrated into my Cabinet so

								rend="superscript">th:</hi> Psalm; or rather of the first part of
							it.— The French and English Poetry are beautiful; but there is a sublime
							simplicity in the original Psalm itself, more energetic than any thing
							in either of the imitations— Addison says that there is no real voice or
							sound in the firmament, and stars— I am not sure that the Psalm says so—
								<persRef ref="plato">Plato’s</persRef> idea, of the music of the
							Spheres does not appear to have struck the Psalmist— But the Psalmists
							idea that they declare the glory and handy-work of God, was above the
							reach of Plato— <persRef ref="shakespeare-william"
								>Shakespear’s</persRef> idea that they sing choiring to the
							young-eyed Cherubims is almost inspiration.— Addison’s Astronomy is
							adapted perhaps to the age when the Psalm was composed, and may pass for
							poetical Astronomy in any age; but the Psalm does not say that the stars
							and planets move round the Earth. In the 23<hi rend="superscript"
								>d:</hi> Psalm, Addison’s introduction of the Crook displeases
							me—fainting in the sultry glebe, is aukwardly expressed; and faint will
							not rhyme with pant either to the ear or to the eye— In both the
							versions the thoughts are weakened by expansion and by repetition— Yet
							the twenty-third Psalm in Addison’s poetry is delightful by its rural
							imagery, and the 19<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> is elevating by its

							supposed that they were the work of some English clergyman of the same
							name— But upon perusing them I find so many internal marks of the
							author’s character as I have always heard it spoken of, and so many
							sentiments peculiar to the region where the Doctor lived and died, that
							I have no doubt that they were written by him— They are very good
							discourses; in a plain, unornamented style, abounding with strong sense,
							and virtuous principle— Earnest, even to harshness in their manner;
							interspersed with occasional strokes of severe Satire; too blunt for
							wit; and too serious for sarcasm— The popular right of resistance
							against tyranny is introduced and asserted with a spirit which I
							consider as one of the proofs of the place where the sermons were
							delivered— The author is more bitter in his censures upon the quakers,
							and other fanatical sectaries, than upon the Romish Church. There is a
							critical note on a passage from <persRef ref="paul">S<hi

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> I have risen every morning this
							month, before day light— Usually between 6 and 7— The state of Health in
							my family has effectually prevented me from establishing and observing
							the rule which I should wish to follow, of rising every morning at five—
							The severity of the Season presents another obstacle; for my chamber is
							too cold in the morning, for writing or reading with comfort— This
							difficulty however would not be insuperable without the other— I begin
							the day by reading five Chapters in the Bible— Write the Journal of the
							preceding day— Each of which occupations employs from half an hour to an
							hour— Walk five or six Miles— This however I sometimes omit— Breakfast
							about ten— Hear <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> read
							English, and learn to recite—and sometimes teach him to write cyphers
							upon his slate— This engages two full hours— Read or write, or arrange
							household concerns untill dark; which is now before 3 in the afternoon—
							Walk another hour— Return and read or write untill 5. dine— From 6 to 9.
							I bestow again upon Charles;—and chiefly to his amusement— Nine is the
							hour of the <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
								>Ladies</persRef> for tea— After which we sometimes pass an hour or
							two at Cards, and sometimes I retire immediately to bed— I scarcely ever
							visit or dine abroad; and am very seldom interrupted by visitors or have
							Company at home.</p>
						<p>I offer to a merciful God at the close of this year, my humble tribute of
							Gratitude, for the blessings with which he has in the course of it
							favoured me, and those who are dear to me— And I pray for a continuance
							of his Goodness— Above all I pray that He who worketh in us both to will
							and to do, may grant to me and mine that temper of Heart and that
							firmness of soul, which are best adapted duly to receive all His
							dispensations whether joyous or afflictive— It has pleased him in the
							course of this year to lay his chastening hand upon me, and to try me
							with bitter sorrow. My endeavours to quell the rebellion of the Heart,
							have been sincere; and have been assisted with the blessing from above—
							As I advance in life; its evils multiply. the instances of mortality
							become more frequent, and approach nearer to myself— The greater is the
							need of fortitude to encounter the woes that flesh is heir to, and of
							religion to support pains, for which there is no other remedy— Religious
							Sentiments become from day to day more constantly habitual to my mind—
							They are perhaps too often seen in this Journal— God alone can make even
							Religion a Virtue; and to him I look for aid that mine may degenerate
							into no vicious excess. For the future time may the favour of God, which
							passeth all Understanding rest upon <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail;adams-john">my Parents</persRef>, my Wife and
								<persRef ref="adams-john2;adams-george">all my Children</persRef>;
							my kindred, friends and Country; nor at this moment can I forbear to
							include in my petitions the welfare of all Human Kind.— For myself, may
							the divine Energies be granted to perform fully all my duties to God, to
							my fellow mortals in all the relations of life, and to my own Soul—</p>
