						<p><date>2. </date>I returned again to the attempt at early rising, and read
							this morning by Candle-light, about an hour; after which I took the long
							walk before breakfast— As I pass’d by the Palace on my return, I saw the

							I had a visit from <persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Fisher</persRef>— Dined with <persRef
								ref="vonblome-otto">Baron Blome</persRef>, and a Company of 23
							persons, mostly the foreign Ministers and their Secretary’s. I met here
							also a <persRef ref="u">Prince Gargarin</persRef> with whom I had dined
							more than two years ago, at <persRef ref="einsiedel-george">Count
								Einsiedel’s</persRef>— Soon after my arrival here— <persRef
								ref="bentzon-adrian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bentzon</persRef> too was of the Company— Baron Blome was very
							inquisitive whether I was going to England. He told me that the Turks
							had agreed in the negotiation for Peace, to cede as far as the Siret
							River; and would have given money; but that there was a difficulty about
							the frontier in Asia— <persRef ref="pardo-benito">General
								Pardo</persRef> assured me from the best authority— Not <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Romanzoff</persRef>, or any of the
							subaltern’s—that <hi rend="italic">the man</hi>, was determined for War—
							He meant me to understand that he had it from the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> himself, which I doubt— But
							neither of these Gentlemen could tell me, whether <persRef
								ref="nesselrode-karl">Count Nesselrode</persRef> would or would not
							be sent to Paris— In the Evening I paid a visit to <persRef
								ref="bezerra-joao">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bezerra</persRef>,
							who is <pb n="341" type="ms"/>confined with the gout and erysipelis,
							ever since the day of the Court, upon the Balcony. I found the <persRef
								ref="serracapriola-antonio">Duke of Serra-Capriola</persRef> with
							him, and a french emigrant Officer, whom I met last Spring at <persRef
								ref="stedingk-kurt">Count Stedingk’s</persRef> came in soon after—
							The Duke was more talkative than ever— I left him there, having myself
							made a visit of two hours— After I came home we had visits from <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="plumer-ernestus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>4. </date>Rose read and walked before Breakfast— And again trifled

								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> according to his
							appointment.— He apologized to me for receiving me in his full dress;
							which he said was occasioned by his having just received a deputation of
							Cabardinians.— And I excused myself to him for <hi rend="italic"
								>not</hi> being in full dress; at which he took no displeasure. I
							began by informing him, with my thanks to him for the packets which he
							had sent me, brought by the Courier from Paris, that I had received in
							them despatches from the <persRef ref="monroe-james">Secretary of
								State</persRef>, and a letter personally from the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">President of the United States</persRef>— That
							the President according to the request, which my inability to return to
							the United States last Summer had made necessary, on my part, had
							nominated another person to the judicial office, which had been
							previously designated for me, and had instructed me to remain here; a
							circumstance which I thought it proper to communicate to this
							Government; which was one of my motives in requesting the Conference
							with him.— The Count very civilly expressed his satisfaction at this
							arrangement, with which he said he was the more gratified, as he had
							seen paragraphs in the English, and German Gazettes, stating that I was
							to be removed to England— He had mentioned it to the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef>, and had thought it probable, as
							there appeared in England a manifestation of conciliatory dispositions
							towards the United States. I told him that the paragraphs in the English
							Newspapers, were probably taken from some of the American papers; where
							it was much the fashion to announce appointments by anticipation, which
							never came to be realized— That I had not the slightest insinuation of
							an intention of the President to remove me to England; but from the
							tenor of my despatches I had every reason to believe, that no
							appointment of a Minister to England would be made; unless England
							should make further, and far more important advances towards
							conciliation than she had yet made or appeared disposed to make— He said
							that on the other hand it was understood at Paris that in France; a
							better Understanding with America was intended, and even professed—that
							the entire revocation of the decrees of Berlin and Milan, so far as
							concerned the United States was confirmed, and that with regard to
							American Vessels, which should arrive in France, there would be little
							or no difficulty made, as to whence they came; or as to the nature of
							their Cargoes. That in the general view of the Russian policy, this was
							very agreeable to him, because it shewed something like a relaxation in
							favour of Commerce; but he referred me to our former Conversations, in
							which he had given me his opinion upon the character of the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>— He did not
							think that the permanency of <hi rend="italic">any thing</hi> to which
							he should assent, concerning Commerce could be relied upon; every
							resolution, every act, was the result of an impulse of the moment—the
							effect of an occasional impression— To day the impression was of one
							sort, and the measure corresponded with it—to-morrow, the impression
							would be of an opposite nature, and the measure would follow that too—
							To make them consistent was not in the nature of the Man— He never
							looked at Commerce with commercial eyes— He never considered that
							Commerce was an interest in which all mankind were concerned— He saw in
							it nothing but the trade of a certain class of individuals— But in truth
							said the Count, Commerce is the concern of us all— The merchants, are
							indeed only a class of individuals, bearing a small proportion to the
							mass of a People— But Commerce as the exchange of mutual superfluities
							for mutual wants, is the very chain of human association— It is the
							foundation of all the useful and pacific intercourse between Nations— It
							is a primary necessity to all Classes of People— The Emperor Napoleon
							will never see it in this light, and so his Commercial regulations and
							promises, will never be systematic or consistent— You can place little
							dependence upon them— I said that his present measures appeared
							obviously dictated by a political interest— As he saw the situation in
							which the English Government had chosen to place themselves with respect
							to America, he was taking advantage of it by assuming a course of an <pb
								n="342" type="ms"/>opposite character— And I believed the British
							Government alone could prevent his succeeding in it completely. And in
							order to defeat him they must adopt measures to which they did not
							appear at-all inclined; and of which I had little hope— He said that he
							should not dissemble to me, that he had seen the English Newspapers to
							the 7<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of January, which had been sent to
							him from Stockholm— That the English <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince
								Regent’s</persRef> Speech at the opening of the Session of
							Parliament was in them— That it spoke of the State of the <persRef
								ref="george-iii">king’s</persRef> health— Said nothing at-all about
							the North of Europe— Mentioned that the affair of the Chesapeake frigate
							had been amicably arranged with the United-States— That several other
							topics remained in discussion with them, upon which the most
							conciliatory disposition was entertained by him— I observed that the
							profession of conciliatory dispositions had always been sufficiently
							made by the British Government; but they had been so long the only
							things we had experienced from England that were conciliatory, that now
							something more would be necessary to produce the effect; and of this I
							was sorry to say I could scarcely discern any prospect— The Count said
							there were some intimations that a messenger had been sent over from
							France to England— It was even reported that he was charged with
							overtures for a pacific Negotiation— But that might perhaps be an
							ostensible measure, to excite the opinion here of a Negotiation between
							France and England—which in the great and extraordinary armaments said
							to be now making in France and destined against Russia, might be thought
							calculated to produce a certain effect here— I said that as to
							Negotiations between France and England, I did not much believe in them,
							or in their success if really attempted; but that I had heard there were
							prospects of War between France and Russia which I lamented— He had
							mentioned the Emperor Napoleon (The print of him, in all his Imperial
							accoutrements as Napoléon le Grand, was hanging at the side of the wall,
							over the sopha upon which we were sitting) and how much was it to be
							wished, that it were possible the <hi rend="italic">Will</hi>, of Peace
							and Tranquillity could be inspired into his heart! The world might then
							be allowed to enjoy a little Peace— The Count shook his head, and said
							No!—it is impossible— Tranquility is not in his Nature— I can tell you
							in Confidence that he once told me so himself— I was speaking to him
							about Spain, and Portugal; and he said to me—I must always be <hi
								rend="italic">going</hi>— After the Peace of Tilsit, where could I
							go, but to Spain— I went to Spain, because I could not go any where
							else; and this said the Count was all that he had to say in
							justification of his having gone into Spain and Portugal— And now as
							perhaps there he is not quite satisfied with his going, he may intend to
							turn against us; from the same want of any other place where to go— I
							said that one would think Spain and Portugal still furnished, and were
							likely long to furnish him quite room enough to go in, without making it
							necessary to gratify his Passion in another quarter— The Count replied
							that there was no political consideration whatsoever, upon which he
							founded a hope that Peace might yet be preserved— But there was a
							consideration of a different nature which might have its weight, and
							upon the effect of which he still rested some expectation— It was the
							scarcity of grain— He understood it was considerable at Paris— I said I
							had heard the same, and that the price of wheat and flour had much
							advanced—though not that of Bread, which the Government kept down by
							payments of their own to the Bakers— He said the scarcity was so great,
							that there had been recently several riots at the doors of the Bakers,
							both at Paris and at Lyons— And as large armies could not be put in
							motion without very large supplies of such provisions, he still hoped
							that as the months of April and May should come on the inconvenience and
							difficulty of procuring such supplies for those armies, would ultimately
							arrest their march—for which however, added the Count, the Circumstances
							have rendered it proper for us to place ourselves in a state of
							preparation as we have accordingly done—</p>
						<p>I then passed to another subject, observing that it ought perhaps to have
							been the first with which I should have commenced— The removal of
								<persRef ref="pahlen-peter">Count Pahlen</persRef> from the Russian
							Mission in the United States to that of Brezil— I observed that my
							despatches from the Secretary of State made it my duty to express to the
							Emperor, the sentiments entertained by my Government, and their strong
							sense of the friendly policy constantly pursued by His Majesty towards
							them, and I had a letter from the President himself mentioning that
							Count Pahlen had taken leave, and speaking in terms of the highest
							satisfaction, of his deportment during the whole period of his
							mission—with the assurance that he had conciliated by it the universal
							esteem and regard of all who knew him— That it gave me peculiar pleasure
							to communicate to <pb n="343" type="ms"/>him this information, as I was
							persuaded it must be pleasing to the Emperor— He said it certainly
							would, and that such a testimonial would contribute to raise yet higher
							the Emperor’s good opinion of that officer— That his letters had
							constantly spoken in the highest terms of the treatment that he had
							received from all Classes of People in America; and that he would quit
							the Country with the warmest regard for it. I observed that his mission
							to Brezil would place him in an advantageous situation for observation;
							not only in regard to that Country itself, but to the Scenes which were
							passing, in the other parts of South-America—particularly the Spanish
							Provinces— He asked me whether our Government had taken any measures
							respecting them, and in what light they were considered, by us; and
							whether they had any Ministers in the United States— I said I was
							informed by my despatches, that there were deputies at the seat of our
							Government from the Province of Venezuela— That the Government of the
							United States, considered with favourable sentiments the change which
							was taking place in those Provinces; believing it would prove generally
							advantageous to the interests of mankind; and that I readily confided to
							him these views of my Government, because from former Conversations that
							I had held with him, and from other Circumstances of which I had heard,
							I thought there was the most perfect coincidence between his views on
							this subject, and those of my Government— He said they were the same—
							There was only one doubt left on his mind, which gave him some concern—
							The People of those Provinces had been kept in such a state of grievous
							oppression that he was afraid they would in accomplishing their
							emancipation, exhibit examples of that sort of violence, and those
							scenes of cruelty, which experience had proved to be too common in such
							Revolutions— He hoped however it might be otherwise— He had been for
							opening a free Commerce between them and this Country, which would have
							implied a recognition of their new State, and he had made a proposition
							to that effect (in the Imperial Council.) Mais en cela j’ai echoué— The
							apprehension of those disorders to which I have alluded, prevented my
							success— <hi rend="italic">On pourra cependant revenir sur cet
								objet</hi>.— I next told him that I had received a letter from
								<persRef ref="rush-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef>, to whom I had transmitted by a safe hand the ring,
							which his Majesty had directed to be sent to him in his name;—which he
							had received with the strongest expressions of gratitude, and the wish
							that the Emperor might be made acquainted with the profound sense which
							he entertained of the honour conferred upon him by this Present— The
							Count said he would not fail to make this known to His Majesty who he
							was sure would be gratified to hear it.— I made my excuses to the Count
							for the <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
								>Ladies</persRef> and myself, for not attending at the Evening
							party, to which he had invited us for the day after to-morrow; and
							mentioned to him the painful intelligence we had lately received from
							our family in America— Upon which he assured me of his sentiments of
							regret and sympathy, with his customary civility. I returned home, and
							had a visit from <persRef ref="hazard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hazard</persRef>— At five, I went and dined with
								<persRef ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t:</hi> Julien</persRef>— It was a dinner given to <persRef
								ref="schenck-hans">Count Schenk</persRef>, late Minister from
							Wurtemburg, who is to take his departure to-morrow or the next day— But
							half the Company failed; the <persRef ref="law-jacques">French
								Ambassador</persRef> having also given a dinner this day, and there
							were only thirteen persons at table.— <persRef ref="laval-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Laval</persRef> who was there told me
							that he should open his house next Tuesday, for which we should receive
							Cards to-morrow; but I mentioned to him that we should not be able to
							attend; owing to the news we had lately received from home— He said he
							wished me to see his house, and particularly some late purchases that he
							had made of antiques—being the Cabinet of <persRef ref="u">General
								Hitroff</persRef>.— He asked me therefore to come and dine with him
							en petit Comité, next Saturday—which I promised to do.— In the Evening I
							paid visits to <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Krehmer</persRef>, at his new dwelling-house on the Wasili-Ostroff,
							and afterwards to the <persRef ref="bezerra-joao">Chevalier
								Bezerra</persRef>, who is still confined with the Gout; and with
							whom I again found the <persRef ref="serracapriola-antonio">Duke de
								Serra-Capriola</persRef>— They had the French Courier de Londres, of
							7. January containing the substance of the <persRef ref="george-iv"
								>Regents</persRef> speech to Parliament, which the Duke read with
							great satisfaction— After returning home, <persRef ref="fisher-miers"

							to mark it down upon my Book. At last I gave it up as irretrievable, not
							without strong suspicions that it must have been stolen from my desk or

							so, two or three hours— Our dinner was altogether disconcerted— Soon

							a week or ten days since, and there I found Bills to the amount of 950
							Rubles— They must have been there at least a fortnight, and probably
							three weeks— When and upon what occasion I put them into the pocket I
							have no distinct remembrance— The Bills are commonly made up in quires
							of one thousand rubles each— I must have had a payment of 50 Rubles to
							make, and have taken it from this quire at some time when a visitor
							came, and instead of locking it up in my draw have put in into my

							the French army; which he said laughing was following the example of
								<persRef ref="frederick-ii">Frederick 2</persRef>.— And of the

							worthy of the Orator— I am not sure that Auger’s conclusions are right
							in either case— Demosthenes might speak of himself slightingly to avoid
							suspicion as author of the speech against Theocrinus— Nothing is said of
							him in the speech which could have been very offensive to him.
							Theocrinus is accused by <persRef ref="epichares">Epichares</persRef>,

							funeral Oration, is a <hi rend="italic">demonstrative</hi> discourse and
							naturally of a different cast from the contentious character of all the

							He certainly did deliver a funeral Oration upon that occasion, and this
							Oration is published among his works— It is not equal to the funeral
							Eulogies of <persRef ref="Isocrates">Isocrates</persRef>— But the
							Demonstrative Oratory was the Element of Isocrates, as the Judicial was

							be too much studied. Auger’s Translation, is altogether an excellent

							regular to this hour, I have risen by it on the average of the Month— In
							fair weather I walk the six miles round before Breakfast, which we now
							have before or about 10.— I read as usual, write my Journal, and hear
							Charles read— Weights, Measures and Visitors with an hour’s walk before
							dinner occupy me untill 5. in the afternoon;—when we dine—from seven
							untill ten in the Evening, I read or hear <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef>, or talk with him to amuse and instruct him— Then
							have an hour or two of Cards or Conversation in the drawing room; and
							from eleven to twelve find the time for retirement— I have sometimes
							dined and sometimes spent the Evening abroad— More seldom have Evening
							Company at home.— Too much of my time is still wasted.</p>
