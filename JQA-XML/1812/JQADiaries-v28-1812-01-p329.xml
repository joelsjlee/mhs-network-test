						<p><date>1. </date>I rose shortly after six this morning, and immediately
							began upon my customary occupation— Finished reading the Book of
								<persRef ref="tobit">Tobit</persRef>, and began the Wisdom of the
							Son of <persRef ref="sirach-joshua">Sirach</persRef>. I observe that the
							German Translation of the apocryphal Books is from originals altogether
							different from the English translation— The foundations of the stories
							are the same, but they seem to be told by two different persons.— The
							Ecclesiasticus is the best of the apocryphal Books, and worth more than
							all the rest put together. My next care was to bring up the remaining
							arrears of my Journal, and close the record of the departed year— After
							accomplishing this, I walked to the Summer Garden Bridge, and
							breakfasted immediately after my return— Heard <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> read his fable, and closed
							the account of the last-year in my Book of family Expences— Prepared
							also my quarterly account, to be sent to the <persRef ref="monroe-james"
								>Secretary of State</persRef>; and began a letter to <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef>— During the twilight, I took
							a ride with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and
							Charles, and walked an hour within doors after my return. We dined at
							five— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Krehmer</persRef>
							sent me some English Newspapers with which I wasted a long hour after
							dinner— In the Evening I finished reading the Oration of <persRef
								ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef> for the Crown— I am not
							worthy to admire it, as it deserves— His methodical arrangement is not
							so obvious as that of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>, and
							he does not so well observe the rule of <hi rend="italic">Unity</hi>—
							But <persRef ref="aristotle">Aristotle</persRef> had not then given his
							laws, and I am not sure that the architecture of discourse had been
							taught upon the same principles in the prior schools— Auger says there
							is a <hi rend="italic">latent</hi> concatenation in the various parts of
							the harangues of Demosthenes— I shall endeavour to find it out— As to
							the merits of the Cause, on the first and third points of the accusation
							against <persRef ref="ctesiphon">Ctesiphon</persRef>, the defence
							appears to me complete: but on the second, the place of proclamation;
							though he produces a law, authorizing it in express terms, <persRef
								ref="aeschines">Eschines</persRef> I think has proved that this law
							did not apply to the case. But the point itself was not proper to be
							made—it was a captious law-trap of a special pleader.— Who could endure
							the thought that such a Cause, should have been decided on a question
							whether the crown should have been proclaimed at the Pnyx, or upon the
							Theatre? <persRef ref="auger-athanase">Auger</persRef> says that
							Demosthenes was <hi rend="italic">not strong</hi> upon this Article— I
							think the letter of the law was against him— But on the great issue of
							the Cause, the merits of his administration, he comes out gloriously
							triumphant. It is impossible now, reading him in a translation and in
							cold blood, not to be carried away with the exalted sublimity of his
							sentiments, and to kindle with the fire of his patriotism— On the whole
							in comparing the two Orations, there appears to me less superiority of
							talent, than of character in Demosthenes over his rival.— The palm of
							genius it might perhaps be difficult to assign— But the soul of
							Demosthenes was higher toned. The personal ribaldry that each of them
							pours forth against the other is extremely disgusting— Our very
							newspapers at present are not so bad. Eschines repeats at least twenty
							times the reproach that Demosthenes had fled, at the battle of Cheronea—
							Demosthenes takes no direct notice of the charge, and only in one
							passage, asks if he was to have been able by himself alone to overpower
							the whole army of <persRef ref="philip-ii-macedonia">Philip</persRef>?
							The passage where he undertakes to prove that even if the disastrous
							issue of his policy could have been foreseen with certainty, it would
							still have been the duty of Athens to have pursued it, is a model of
							reasoning as well as of sentiment— Demosthenes was lavish of figures—
							Eschines ridicules several of his expressions, which are harsh but full
							of meaning; such as that the Priestess at Delphi <hi rend="italic"
								>Philippized</hi>—and that Eschines and others like him had <hi
								rend="italic">tippled</hi> away the liberties of Greece at Philip’s
							table— The figures of Demosthenes are short, obvious, and taken from
							objects not of profound Science, but of common observation— It is not
							necessary to suppose him to have been a man of any considerable
							learning.— I had just finished the Oration for the Crown when I was
							called in to <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Galloway</persRef>— The German and French newspapers were brought in
							about eleven at Night, and I sat reading them untill between twelve and
							one.— Part of the <persRef ref="madison-james">President’s</persRef>
							Message at the opening of the Session of Congress was in the Hamburg
							Correspondent.</p>

						<p><date>2. </date>It was after Sunrise this morning when I rose; and I had
							long morning visits from <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nancarro</persRef>, lately arrived from America— From <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ecky</persRef>, just returned

									>r</hi> Fisher</persRef>, and from <persRef ref="woodward-c2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodward</persRef>— The weather
							being stormy, and a remnant of my cough kept me confined to the house— I
							wrote nothing but the journal of yesterday, and in the Evening read part
							of the Oration of <persRef ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef> upon
							the Embassy— <persRef ref="auger-athanase">Auger</persRef> calls it the
							prevarications of the Embassy— The latin translations call it the false
							Embassy— The Greek work is not susceptible of translation.— It would
							properly be called the Impeachment of <persRef ref="aeschines"
								>Eschines</persRef> for Bribery and Corruption, in receiving money
							from <persRef ref="philip-ii-macedonia">Philip</persRef>, and betraying
							his trust as an Athenian Minister—the charges are that Eschines had 1.
							deceived the people by false official reports 2. had prevented them from
							learning of Demosthenes, the truth 3. had counselled them to measures
							contrary to their interests 4. had executed none of their orders 5. had
							been purposely guilty of delays pernicious to the Commonwealth, and 6.
							for all these acts of treachery had, together with <persRef
								ref="philocrates">Philocrates</persRef>, been paid by Philip.—
							Philocrates he says acknowledged and gloried in having received Philip’s
							money— Nothing like proof of this offence is produced against Eschines,
							but the whole issue of the Cause is <pb n="330" type="ms"/>rested upon
							presumptions and conjectures. To understand this harangue as well as all
							the other political Orations of Demosthenes it is necessary to be
							minutely acquainted with the History of Greece at that time— I met with
							an occurrence this day which gave me some concern— A man who keeps a
							fruit-shop brought me a bill of near 300 Rubles for fruit, due some of
							it more than a year, and the greatest part seven or eight months—which
							had been regularly charged to me in <persRef ref="u"
								>Waldstein’s</persRef> monthly bills, and which I had as regularly
							paid him from month to month.— It is among the inconveniences of my
							residence here, and of my ignorance of the language, that I have been
							compelled to trust to this man— Many of the shop-keepers cannot write
							and therefore can give no Bills— I cannot read or understand the Bills
							of those who can— And this fellow has thus, and in several other cases
							that I have detected misapplied the money that I have paid to him to
							discharge these Bills, and left them thus to be demanded again of
							me.</p>

						<p><date>3. </date>I was up again about 7. O’Clock, and read, wrote and
							walked before Breakfast, according to the regulated distribution of my
							time. I also wrote two short letters this day— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lange</persRef> a French Merchant who
							is going to America, came to request letters of recommendation, and
							brought me one from the <persRef ref="law-jacques">French
								Ambassador</persRef>, soliciting them in his behalf.— The
							fruit-seller came again to dun for the money due him by <persRef ref="u"
								>Waldstein</persRef>; which I promised that I would make him pay, or
							have him sent to prison— We have also been obliged to dismiss the woman
							who furnished us with butter, milk and cream—on discovering, that she
							had lately got into the habit of furnishing about three pounds, and
							charging me for five, every week— I mention these Circumstances, because
							they and many others of a like kind, force themselves upon my attention
							and time to my great annoyance.— In the Evening, I finished the Oration
							of <persRef ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef> upon the Embassy,
							and began the answer and defence of <persRef ref="aeschines"
								>Eschines</persRef>— The Attack is <hi rend="italic">much</hi>
							inferior to the Oration for the Crown, which indeed was delivered
							thirteen years after— The method is imperfect, and not well observed— As
							to the merits the cause of Demosthenes was weak— The charge of bribery
							is the only substantial one of the accusation, and it is not proved by
							any evidence adduced— The personal invective is incessant; the jokes
							about Eschines as a Stage-player of third rate parts heavy, and repeated
							to satiety— The private anecdotes, particularly that of the Olynthian
							woman, insulted by Eschines, at table and in drink, disgusted even the
							Athenians— On the whole I think differently from Auger, when he says
							this is not the least pleasing performance of the great Orator; though
							it is the longest.</p>

								J. W. Patterson</persRef> called upon me this morning to ask for a
							Passport to go to France; upon which he has at length again concluded.
								<persRef ref="raimbert-francois">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Raimbert</persRef> also paid me a morning visit, and brought with
							him a present of porcelain for <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef>, and for <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef>; and another for myself, of which he requested
							our acceptance— I gave him many thanks for us all, and assured him that
							being fully sensible of his kindness and attention, I should feel an
							additional obligation to him if he would take them back—it being a
							principle which I had found it necessary to adopt from the first day
							that I became a public man, never to accept for myself or my family,
							while I held any public Office, a present of more than trifling value,
							from any person— That this principle was not only the result of my own
							sense of propriety, but was altogether conformable to the general
							Sentiment of my Country, which was more punctilious on this subject than
							any European Nation, and which was peculiarly strict with regard to
							their Ministers abroad. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Raimbert
							accordingly took the things home with him again— He appeared to feel a
							little mortification, but he expressed his approbation of my motive. The
							refusal of presents is one of the occasions on which I have found it
							most difficult ever since I have been in the public service to act with
							perfect propriety; and that difficulty becomes not a little aggravated,
							when they are offered to my family and not to myself— Were it possible
							for me to prevent it, not the value of a dollar should be offered by any
							body to any of us; but those who forbear presenting any thing to me
							sometimes address themselves, where refusal may not be thought my duty,
							and those who begin with trifles, which it would be affectation, rather
							than virtue to reject, rise gradually to articles of Cost and value
							which render it indispensable to recur to the standard of spotless
							integrity— I have heretofore accepted from M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Raimbert presents of fruit and other small things, which it
							would have been ridiculous to reject on the ground of a scruple, and
							which I could not refuse on any other— But this time the gift would have
							been of a value which I could not have received without feeling uneasy,
							for it hereafter— The perfect line between self-denial and
							self-indulgence may not always be clear, but the principle of temperance
							has self-denial for its essence; and even excess on that side is better
							than the slightest deviation upon the other.— I dined at the <persRef
								ref="law-jacques">French Ambassador’s</persRef> with a Company of
							about fifty persons, <pb n="331" type="ms"/>the common diplomatic
							company— My next neighbours at table were <persRef ref="bussche-calmor"
								>Count Bussche</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="naryshkin-dimitri"
								>Grand-Veneur Narishkin</persRef>— <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai"
								>Count Romanzoff</persRef> told me that he had received a Courier
							from Paris, and that there were two letters for me, which if I had not
							already received, would be sent me this Evening.— That he had the papers
							containing <persRef ref="madison-james">President Madison’s</persRef>
							Message, which recommended serious and energetic measures, but
							complained alike against both France and England— It also mentioned
							Russia; but in terms peculiarly gratifying to him.— I came home
							immediately after dinner was over, but was disappointed in the
							expectation of receiving the letters which the Count had promised me— I
							finished reading the Oration of <persRef ref="aeschines"
								>Eschines</persRef> upon the Embassy, and also read over again
								<persRef ref="plutarch">Plutarch’s</persRef> life of <persRef
								ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef> in <persRef
								ref="langhorne-john;langhorne-william">Langhorne</persRef>. Setting
							prejudice aside I think Eschines upon the Embassy, superior to his
							rival. It is generally considered unquestionable, as it was believed by
							the Athenians that Eschines had really been bribed by <persRef
								ref="philip-ii-macedonia">Philip</persRef>, and if he was the
							accusation of Demosthenes was just— But take nothing but the two
							Orations as the foundation for a Judgment, and you must pronounce in his
							favour— He strenuously denies the bribery— He appeals to the knowledge
							of his hearers against many of the material facts, alledged by
							Demosthenes, and disproves by testimony all the others— His narrative
							sheds ridicule upon Demosthenes without measure. His argument is more
							compact and methodical—his tone of discourse milder and more
							temperate—his appeals to his own services and those of his family, in
							the style of conscious innocence; his peroration as <persRef
								ref="auger-athanase">Auger</persRef> says a Master-piece of the
							pathetic. He vouches <persRef ref="phocion">Phocion</persRef>, as one of
							his official defenders— Plutarch doubts whether these discourses were
							ever delivered, but others say that Eschines was acquitted only by a
							majority of thirty votes— <persRef ref="fisher-miers">M<hi

								>Auger</persRef>—Vol. 4. The Oration of <persRef ref="demosthenes"
								>Demosthenes</persRef> against the Law of <persRef ref="leptines"
								>Leptines</persRef>— This law, abolished all the exemptions from
							certain burthensome charges, enjoyed by certain individuals, under
							grants from the People.— Leptines made an exception only for the
							descendants from Harmodius and Aristogiton. It is an admirable Harangue,
							though in a style altogether different from that of the political
							harangues— He reasons upon the general principle—the <hi rend="italic"
								>wisdom</hi> of granting exemptions as rewards for public
							services—upon the <hi rend="italic">usage</hi>—the practice of Athens
							from the eldest times— From the <hi rend="italic">injustice</hi> of
							taking back immunities from individuals, to whom they were become as
							absolute property— From the policy, of maintaining the character for
							generosity and magnanimity, which had <pb n="332" type="ms"/>always
							belonged to the Athenian name— He gives instances of several persons by
							name, who enjoyed these exemptions, and who could not without the
							highest injustice be deprived of them— He engages to propose another
							Law; a better remedy for the abuse which that of Leptines was intended
							to correct—which was, to authorize public accusation against any person
							who should obtain public exemptions without having deserved them.— He
							considers and refutes the arguments in favour of the Law of Leptines— In
							short this discourse contains every thing that eloquence can perform;
							excepting method— I was so weary and drowsy when I read it, that many of
							its merits doubtless escaped me— My power of application was feeble— I
							closed the Evening before ten O’Clock.</p>

							one of the best— I think it inferior to that on the Law of <persRef
								ref="leptines">Leptines</persRef>— Midias had struck Demosthenes, at
							the public Theatre, while Demosthenes was in the exercise of his Office
							as Choregus— He had also outraged him in many other particulars—
							Demosthenes urges that these offences were so numerous and aggravated
							that Midias deserved to be punished with Death, or at least with the
							Confiscation of all his Estates; which were great; for one of the topics
							most frequently recurring in the Oration, is the injustice and danger of
							suffering rich men to be guilty of such acts of violence with impunity.
							This Oration however was never delivered, for in that against <persRef
								ref="ctesiphon">Ctesiphon</persRef>, <persRef ref="aeschines"
								>Eschines</persRef> reproaches Demosthenes for having compounded for
							this insult, with Midias for a sum of Money. This office of Choregus was
							a burdensome charge, which Demosthenes had voluntarily assumed, upon a
							principle of public Spirit— He expressly says that he was then only
							thirty-two years of age. He represents the Choregus as a sacred
							character, and the offence of striking him as a species of Sacrilege— It
							is remarkable how the antient Greeks associated in their manners the
							practices of religion with those of amusement— Their theatrical
							performances and other sports were all religious solemnities— The
							Christian religion has assumed a different spirit— It retains nothing
							but music as an appendage of festivity to religious rites; and music
							only of the grave and solemn kind— The Choregus among the Athenians
							whose business was to superintend and direct the musical performances at
							the Games, was thus a very important personage; and the public
							amusements were as essential in the estimation of the people, as their

							a long ride with <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> in the
							sleigh— We cross’d the river, and went round by the house where we
							resided last Summer; the snow beyond the river appears to be between two
							and three feet deep, and the roads through the lanes are scarcely
							passable— After returning home, I took a long walk before dinner—
							Employed the Evening in writing and reading— Read the Orations of
								<persRef ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef> against <persRef
								ref="conon">Conon</persRef>, and against <persRef ref="androtion"
								>Androtion</persRef>— The first is a case of what our law would term
							assault and battery; the complainant’s name was <persRef ref="ariston"
								>Aristo</persRef>, and according to the usage of that time the
							Oration is in his name, though composed by Demosthenes— It is short, and
							consists of the same topics which we often hear urged in causes of the
							same description, in our own Courts— The Orator in this and in all his
							orations upon individual accusations, cautions the judges to guard
							themselves against the supplications and tears of the other party— He
							speaks with horror of Conon’s proposition to swear by the head of his
							children; but does not say to swear what.— The Cause against Androtion
							arose peculiarly from the manners and Institutions of Athens— It was a
							question about a Crown like the famous case of <persRef ref="ctesiphon"
								>Ctesiphon</persRef>— Androtion had solicited a Crown, for the
							Senate of the preceding year— A Law, ordained that a crown should not be
							demanded for any Senate; unless during their year of service, they had
							equipped Gallies (no number is mentioned) for the Commonwealth— That
							Senate had equipped no gallies— The question was whether notwithstanding
							the Law, the People had a discretionary power to grant a Crown, if they
							pleased— Demosthenes contended they had not— There is more subtlety than
							solidity in his reasoning; and he mingles with it incessant invectives
							against Androtion. It is said to have been laboured by the author with
							extraordinary care— There are good passages in it, but it is wanting in
							interest— Demosthenes wrote it, not in his own name, but in that of one
								<persRef ref="diodorus">Diodorus</persRef>, of whom nothing is
							otherwise known.</p>

								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lange</persRef>

								>Aristocrates</persRef>— This man had proposed a decree, that

							alliance with Athens— Demosthenes in the name of <persRef
								ref="euthycrates">Euthycrates</persRef> opposes the adoption of this
							decree— He makes three points. 1. That the decree would be contrary to
							the Laws. 2. That it would be pernicious to the public interests— 3.
							That Charidemus is unworthy of such a favour— This is the most regular
							and methodical division that I have yet met with in the Orations of
							Demosthenes— His argument on the illegality of the decree, is logical,
							and acute— He shews it to be incompatible with several Laws on the
							subject of homicide— He reasons excellently from the Spirit of the Laws,
							and marks with precision the peculiar force of their expressions—
								<persRef ref="auger-athanase">Auger</persRef> says it is one of the
							finest of the Orator’s Harangues— The specific question is so much at
							variance with modern manners, that we can scarcely form a conception how
							it should ever have been made— But the discussion of principles, the
							legal disquisition, and the reasoning from general justice and policy,
							are adapted to every age, and every Country.</p>

							Itinéraire, the Chevalier had told me that he had been more interested

							interesting People of antiquity than the Hebrews— I had taken the other
							side of that question too; and said that without intending to derogate
							in the least from the merits of the Greeks, I thought that the Hebrews,

							interesting people of antiquity. This had led us into a considerable
							discussion of the subject, and the Chevalier had mentioned the
							Conversation to General Watzdorf who said he was on my side of the
							question, generally; but he believed that the Greeks had excelled in the
							Arts; especially in Eloquence— We had much conversation upon this, in

								>t</hi> George, and next into the Hermitage we went in to supper
							soon after eleven O’Clock.— The Theatre room where the tables were laid
							was ornamented exactly as it had been last year— The Table of the
							foreign Ministers was not quite full— The Emperor went round the table,
							and spoke to each of the guests according to Custom. The supper was over
							in about one hour, and we returned home immediately from the Hermitage
							without going back to the dancing Halls. The weather has at length set
							in for Cold— <persRef ref="six-willem">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>Reaumur’s</persRef> Thermometer was at about 5 degrees below 0. and
							before midnight it had sunk to 15. It was from 10 to 15 all this day—
							But the Halls at the Palace were of a heat almost insupportable— The

							thrown open as usual, but scarcely sufficed to refresh the air

								>Waldstein</persRef>, the last fortnight has been or pretended to be
							so sick that he could not leave his chamber to come into mine, whenever
							I sent for him, and yet has been almost every day going out two or three

							have detected him in so many of these frauds that he has found no means
							left to deny them, and sent me last Saturday a written statement
							admitting that he has 800 Rubles amount of debts, without a copeek to
							pay them— Every day since then he has been going out and passing the
							Nights and greatest part of the days abroad, and then coming back and
							being too ill to leave his bed. I had directed him to give up all the
							keys he had in his care to <persRef ref="thomas3">Thomas</persRef>— To
							take the account of the wine in the cellar, and the number of the
							bottles he should deliver— But as he had been always too ill to take the

								Woodward</persRef> to dine with us— I directed Thomas what wines to
							take from the Cellar; and after he came from it, Waldstein was sent to
							the cellar again— He was out all the Evening as he had been all the
							morning— After our Company was all gone Thomas came and called me to go
							down to the cellar— The doors of it had been drawn to open, though
							double locked, by a bolt within to the folding door, being unbolted—
							Thomas declared he had left it bolted. I now learnt for the first time
							that the keys to both the outward house doors, one opening to the arch
							and one to the Street, were lost some time ago— The Cellar doors are
							just within the entry, and near both the house doors— The Mooshick said
							that as he came down the Stairs of the Entry, to shut the outer house
							doors, he saw some person pass suddenly from the cellar, out at the
							street door— Thomas went to the House where <persRef
								ref="waldstein-marie">Waldstein’s wife</persRef> lives, to find him;
							but the gates were barr’d, and he could not get in. He came back, and
							broke open Waldstein’s chamber, but neither the key of the cellar, nor
							the cellar-book were to be found— The cellar was fastened for the Night
							by a Padlock, and the street door guarded as well as it could be for the
							Night— I could not ascertain without the cellar-book whether any and
							what wine was missing.— It was past one in the morning before I could
							retire to bed— I had taken a walk before dinner, but the rest of the day
							was so engross’d that I had time neither to write nor read much—

								type="ms"/>Evening I finished reading the Oration of <persRef
								ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef> against <persRef
								ref="timocrates">Timocrates</persRef>— It is an accusation for
							attempting to obtain a Law, contrary to the Laws— A singularity which I
							knew not how to account for in reading some of the former Orations, but
							which in this is fully explained. There is a long passage repeated from
							the Harangue against <persRef ref="androtion">Androtion</persRef>, who
							was also in some sort a party to this case— The object of the Law
							proposed by Timocrates was to exempt certain debtors to the Treasury,
							and to Minerva, from imprisonment, provided they could offer bondsmen
							for security— Demosthenes in this as in all his other accusations urges
							for the punishment of Death, against the accused. He generally adds
							however, or the severest penalty that can be inflicted.— <persRef
								ref="auger-athanase">Auger</persRef> in the summary remarks that
							Demosthenes seldom restricts himself to any regular method in his
							discourses; and often departs from that which he himself announces.</p>

							Speeches of <persRef ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef> against
								<persRef ref="boeotus">Beotus</persRef>—two—both in behalf of
							Mantitheus—one on account of the name, and the other for the maternal
							dowry— Beotus was a spurious half-brother of <persRef ref="mantitheus"
								>Mantitheus</persRef>, and had assumed his name— He had obtained
							legitimation by an artifice of his Mother’s— She had proposed to be put
							upon Oath concerning her marriage, or rather on the question whether
								<persRef ref="mantias">Mantias</persRef> was the father of Beotus,
							and had promised to refuse taking the Oath, and to get Beotus adopted by
							her brother— But when in consequence of this engagement the Oath was
							tendered to her she took it in due form, and Mantias was compelled to
							provide for the child— On the <pb n="339" type="ms"/>death of Mantias,
							Beotus and another brother, took jointly with Mantitheus, the legitimate
							son, equal shares of his Estate— He also usurped the name of Mantitheus;
							who sued, in one of these cases to prevent his using the name, and in
							the other to recover one talent as his Mother’s dowry, to be set off
							from the paternal Estate, before it should be divided between them in
							equal parts.— The speech against <persRef ref="spudias"
								>Spudias</persRef>, is also on a question between two brothers in
							Law, whether a house which had been mortgaged to the husband of one
							Sister, should be divided between the two, without deducting first ten
							mines to discharge the mortgage. The name of the opposite party, for
							whom Demosthenes wrote does not appear.— against <persRef
								ref="apaturius">Apaturius</persRef>— The name of the party here too
							does not appear— Apaturius sued him as security for <persRef
								ref="parmeno">Parmeno</persRef>— He pleads in Bar, as would be said
							at Common Law—that is he contends that the action of Apaturius against
							him ought not to be sustained— Against <persRef ref="zenothemis"
								>Zenothemis</persRef>—this is in the name of <persRef ref="demon"
								>Demo</persRef> the uncle of Demosthenes.</p>

						<p><date>29. </date>While I was writing the above, and as I had reached thus
							far, I received a large packet from <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai"
								>Count Romanzoff</persRef>, enclosing three packets brought from
							Paris, by a Courier and numbered 1. 2. 3. they had been forwarded by
								<persRef ref="barlow-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barlow</persRef>, through the kindness of the <persRef
								ref="kurakin-aleksandri">Russian Ambassador Prince
							Kurakin</persRef>.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barlow in his letter
							to me mentions six packets, but supposes four of them contain nothing
							but Newspapers and pamphlets, and that they are too bulky to be sent all
							by one Courier.— The first letter that I opened was from <persRef
								ref="forrest-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richard
								Forrest</persRef>, a Clerk in the Department of State, and the first
							information it gave me was of the Death of <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife’s</persRef> mother, <persRef
								ref="johnson-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Johnson</persRef>, the 29<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of
							September last, and of <persRef ref="buchanan-andrew">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Andrew Buchanan</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="frye-carolina">Caroline Johnson’s</persRef> husband, a few days
							after. A letter from <persRef ref="hellen-walter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hellen</persRef>, gave a melancholy
							confirmation to this intelligence— Next came one from my dear and
							excellent <persRef ref="adams-abigail">mother</persRef> repeating the
							same news, and adding to it that of the decease both of my <persRef
								ref="cranch-richard;cranch-mary2">uncle and Aunt Cranch</persRef> on
							the 15<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> and 16<hi rend="superscript"
								>th:</hi> of October—and the further account that <persRef
								ref="smith-abigail">my Sister</persRef> had undergone an operation
							for a Cancer in the breast.— I had upon receiving these packets so
							strong a presentiment upon my mind that they would contain tidings of
							sorrow, that I opened them with a hand more unsteady and faltering than
							became me— I was prepared to be told of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Cranch’s decease, having known for several months that her recovery was
							despaired of— That of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cranch was
							unexpected, though at his great age, (at least 85) it could not surprize
							me— But M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Johnson had enjoyed many years
							of health, and was scarcely beyond the middle age of life—and of my
							whole circle of relations and friends in America, there was not one of
							whose end I could less have expected to hear, than of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Buchanan’s—he was in the very meridian of
							life, and apparently of an athletic Constitution, formed for a long
							career of health and vigour— In these multiplied instances of mortality
							among my kindred and friends, God grant that I may learn duly to
							estimate the frail tenure of human existence, to improve by wisdom and
							virtue the few remaining days that his Providence may have allotted to
							myself; and to be also ready for that change through which we must all
							pass. I pray also to be inspired from above with that firmness which may
							be needed to meet my own dissolution whenever it may come, or even that
							of all the dearest friends from whom I am destined, by their departure
							or my own, still to be separated— In the hands of a merciful God, are
							the days and destinies of all human kind— May his dispensations be dealt
							to us in mercy, and the strength to support them be bestowed with
							gracious indulgence— I was obliged to communicate the knowledge of M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Johnson’s death to both <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">her daughters</persRef>, who were both
							deeply affected by it— There was a letter for <persRef
								ref="smith-catherine-johnson">Catherine</persRef>, from her sister
							<persRef ref="hellen-adelaide">Adelaide</persRef>; and after the very little preparation that the circumstance
							admitted I shewed them the letters to me from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hellen and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forrest, and
							from my Mother— The last was the soothing voice of an Angel.<space/>There
							were besides these several other letters to me public and private— One
							from <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Madison</persRef>, the President of the United States, directing me
							to stay here in my official character, and thus removing that state of
							suspense in which I have been living, upwards of twelve Months— Two from
								<persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef>, the Secretary of State; with instructions to the
							same purpose; and expressing the President’s approbation of my public
							conduct here.— One from <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, the Secretary of
							the Treasury, enclosing one from the Treasurer <persRef
								ref="tucker-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tucker</persRef>,
							with a Bill of exchange drawn by <persRef ref="poletica-pierre">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Poletica</persRef>, upon the brothers
								<persRef ref="livio-gebruder">Livio</persRef>— And one from <persRef
								ref="plumer-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Plumer</persRef>
							of New-Hampshire— There were also letters enclosed to my care for
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Poletica’s
								brother</persRef>, for <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Ivanoff</persRef>, two, for <persRef ref="u">Princess
								Gagarin, née de Condoidy</persRef>, for <persRef
								ref="vonrall-alexander">Baron Rall</persRef>, two; and for the
								<persRef ref="brzozowksi-tadeusz">General of the Jesuits
								Brzozowski</persRef>— Also a packet from the Department of State for
								<persRef ref="hazard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hazard</persRef>— It became necessary to present the Bill of
							exchange for acceptance— I called for that purpose at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Livio’s, and saw him— He accepted the
							Bill, which being at 30 days sight, he said would be payable the <unclear>6<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi></unclear> of February O.S. I left the letters for
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ivanoff at Count Romanzoff’s house;
							those for Baron Rall at his own house, and that for the Abbé Brzozowsky,
							I went and delivered in person. From Baron Rall’s house I walked home—
							In the Evening I read the proceedings and Report of the Court of
							Enquiry, on <persRef ref="rodgers-john">Commodore Rogers’s</persRef>
							conduct, and part of the Documents transmitted to Congress with the
							President’s Message, at the commencement of the Session— These, with the
							National Intelligencer of 26. 28 and 30. Nov<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> and a few sheets of the Journal of the House of
							Representatives were all the printed part of the packets I received— I
							had not got through the reading of my letters <pb n="340" type="ms"
							/>when <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Harris</persRef> came in, with an eagerness of curiosity, and a
							struggle to suppress it, which affected his voice and in some degree his
							breathing. I had nothing to tell him which could gratify his
							expectations.— He asked me if I had not received a packet from Count
							Romanzoff with despatches from America— I said I had, and that I had
							seen by the Messengers Book, there was also one for him— He gave me to
							understand that he had not received it, having gone out from home, about
							two hours before— But I had seen his receipt on the Messengers Book,
							when he had brought my packet— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris’s
							agitation is nothing very extraordinary— He has indulged the hope of
							succeeding me in my Office here, and seems to have felt very confident
							that I should have been definitively removed, and have had the knowledge
							of it at this time.— He wishes no ill to me; but he supposed I should
							have been called away to a destination more agreeable to myself than
							this, and thus made way for his further elevation here—</p>
