						<p><date>3. </date>The weather began at length to moderate, and first began
							this day to thaw— It snowed however all the morning. I pass’d the day
							without interruption; and walked before dinner— In the Evening we had
							Cards— After the weights and measures I have come to the part of
								<persRef ref="paucton-alexis">Paucton’s</persRef> Book which treats
							of Coins— He cites many of the antient Classics, and the Bible
							continually; but it is impossible to reconcile the statements of the
							various authorities together, and he sometimes proposes a various
							reading, sometimes charges his authority with inaccuracy, error, and
							even worse, with stupidity or want of critical acumen, sometimes hazards
							his own conjectures, and often resorts to the confusion which has arisen
							from the practice of calling different things by the same name— This has
							been indeed the source of infinite errors and innumerable difficulties—
							The term <hi rend="italic">pound</hi> for example in English, designates
							three different measures—the pound avoirdupoise—the pound Troy, and the
							pound sterling— Of these, the pound sterling has varied in quantity and
							value through a succession of ages and has meant at one time one thing
							and another at another— When the practice of calling the measures of one
							Country by the names belonging to <hi rend="italic">different</hi>
							measures of another is added the confusion increases— Thus English
							writers speak of the French <hi rend="italic">Pint</hi> and <hi
								rend="italic">Bushel</hi>, though the Pinte held more than two
							English Pints, and the Boisseau less than 1/3 of the Bushel. But with
							the fashion of writing down numbers in antient manuscripts, the
							imperfect knowledge we can have of what any of their measures were
							compared with our standards, and the ignorance and errors of the writers
							themselves, it becomes perhaps an inextricable labyrinth— I adhere
							however to the study of Paucton; and this day again lost the hours for
							writing by abandoning them to him.</p>

							thought of the affair of <persRef ref="speransky-mikhail"
								>Speransky</persRef>— I did not exactly tell him all I thought of
							it— I wrote nothing this day— But having found in <persRef
								ref="paucton-alexis">Paucton</persRef> a table of specific gravities
							marking a difference of nearly 1 1/2 per Cent in the weight of distilled
							water and river or well water, and of about 6/1000 between these and
							rain Water, I compared the weights of two of them by an experiment— I
							weighed the same bottle full of Neva Water, and then of Snow Water
							melted by the warmth of this day’s air— Their weight was exactly the
							same; but the river Water was at a temperature of 7 or 8 degrees, and
							the snow Water at 2 or 3.— The French kilogram is a weight of distilled
							water at a temperature of 3 degrees 3/10 of <persRef ref="reaumur-rene"
								>Réaumur</persRef> which was ascertained to be that of the maximum
							of Water’s density, and it was weighed in vacuo— Paucton’s table gives
							69. french pounds for the weight of a cubic foot, french, of distilled
							water in summer and 69.56 in Winter— He takes 69.28 as the weight of a
							mean temperature— <persRef ref="u">Lalonde</persRef> says that a cubic
							foot of distilled water at 10. degrees of Reaumur, weighs 69.89. and at
							20 degrees of heat would weigh 878 grains less— According to the
							definitive French metrical system, the Cubic French foot is assumed at
							70.02424.— Now if according to Paucton’s tables the same quantity of
							Rain Water weighs 1/2 a pound, and River or Well Water, a whole pound
							more, a proportional allowance must be made for the weight of the Water
							that I have to weigh.— My experiments and my Calculations wasted the
							whole day.</p>

							would go in two or three days for London, and would take letters.
								<persRef ref="kozlovsky-peter">Prince Koslofsky</persRef> paid us a

								>Children</persRef> are very unwell, and <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> has a violent and obstinate
							cough— I read this day the remaining Chapters of the first part of
								<persRef ref="watts-isaac">Watts’s</persRef> improvement of the
							mind. The 17<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> Chapter, on improving the
							Memory, is precisely on the subject of one of my lectures, and contains
							so many of the same thoughts, that any impartial reader of my Lecture
							would certainly suspect me of having borrowed freely from the Doctor.— I
							never read that chapter of his Book untill this day— Almost all his
							observations are just, but there is occasionally an ejaculation of
							piety, which he might as well have omitted— His argument against
								<persRef ref="cooper-anthony">Shaftesbury’s</persRef> test of
							ridicule as applicable to sacred subjects is decisive; and his
							comparison of the principle with that of persecution is very just and
							ingenious. The Chapter on the Sciences and their use in the Professions
							is full of sound sense and solid instruction. The caution against
							wasting time upon studies very laudable in themselves, but which cannot
							be pursued without encroaching upon necessary occupations, I feel at
							this moment with peculiar force. If I do not profit by the advice my
							fault will be the greater— The recommendation of poetry has the warm
							sensibility of a Poet— The opinion that Epic Poetry would have been more
							perfect if interspersed with Elegiac and Lyric Odes, may be
							controverted; but that it would have rendered the Poems of <persRef
								ref="homer">Homer</persRef>, <persRef ref="virgil">Virgil</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="tasso-torquato">Tasso</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="milton-john">Milton</persRef> more interesting I do fully
							believe— The advice to young men of lively genius and a poetical turn to
								<pb n="361" type="ms"/>write poetry, if they cannot possibly help it
							has some pretension to pleasantry.— I read also the Sermons 14. and 15.
							Vol 5. of the English preacher—on Subjection to Civil Authority, and on
							the Crown of Righteousness for Christian Fortitude— This morning I read
							from Levit: XX to XXV and particularly fixed by attention upon Chapter
							23. containing the directions for the several feast days prescribed to
							the Jews— They were the Sabbath—every seventh day throughout the year—
							The Passover—the feast of unleavened bread, which was the day after;
							when the first fruits of the Harvest, a wheat sheaf was offered, and
							unleavened bread was to be eat seven days—the Pentecost, fifty days
							after, when loaves of Bread, from the new Harvest were offered— The
							feast of trumpets the first day of the seventh Month, when the beginning
							of the Civil year was proclaimed— The feast of atonement or expiation,
							when the scape-goat <persRef ref="azazel">Hazazel</persRef> was sent
							abroad—the tenth day of the 7<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> month— And
							the feast of tabernacles, beginning the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							of the 7<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> Month, and lasting seven days;
							during which the People were to dwell in Booths— The Sabbath, has been
							adopted, (only with a change of the day) by all Sects of Christians— The
							Passover and Pentecost, by almost all— The three others have been
							considered as abolished by the Christian dispensation— The Jubile was
							proclaimed on the expiation day, every fiftieth year— The Jubile was an
							excellent institution, which operated at once as an agrarian Law, and a
							Law against Slavery— The tenure of lands was equivalent at most to a
							lease for fifty years, nor could the service of a Hebrew be engaged for
							a longer term. The precept to let the lands lay fallow every
							seventh-year, and again on the year of Jubile, is more difficult to
							account for, and in mere human institutions could not be admitted— I do
							not recollect that in the subsequent history of the Nation there is any
							notice of its effects.</p>

							was nearly a Month ago— He asked me whether it was the same M<hi

								<persRef ref="krehmer-sally;krehmer-anna;krehmer-sebastian"

								>Venning</persRef> families were there, <persRef ref="greig-alexis"
								>Admiral Gregg</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">Captain Guedes</persRef>
							and some other Gentlemen— We came home early in the Evening— I had been
							nearly two hours in bed, when I was called up by my wife, who was in
							extreme alarm, owing to a violent bleeding at the nose, and she thought
							at the mouth, which followed a severe and sudden fit of coughing, with
							which <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> had awaked— I sent
							immediately for <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Galloway</persRef>, who came soon after and assured me, that the
							bleeding was only one of the symptoms of a catarrhal Cough, and had
							nothing in it to excite uneasiness— <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> herself was excessively ill, for two or three hours—
							I was too much affected by the scene— Too much, because I had neither
							composure of mind nor physical strength left, adequate to the occasion—
							I pray God, that not even my Affection for my wife and children, may
							deprive me of that self-possession most necessary, upon the severest
							trials— That it may not at moments of danger to them, disqualify me for
							the exertion by which alone they may be assisted or relieved. I often
							think that an excessive attachment to <persRef
								ref="adams-george;adams-john2;adams-louisa2">my children</persRef>
							may be an offense in the eye of Heaven, and dread that they may be taken
							from me for my punishment— For their preservation, and for the
							improvement of my own Fortitude, I have no reliance but on the blessing
							of Providence— Between three and four this morning I retired again to my
							bed, my wife and child being both in some measure recovered, and quieted
							to rest. Catherine whose attendance to them was kind and affectionate
							left them after me.</p>

								Ecky</persRef> paid me a visit this morning, and took his Passport—
							He intends leaving this City for Vienna in about ten days.— I walked
							before dinner to the Foundery— The weather is fine and mild, but the
							Streets bad for walking— This is the first day that wears the appearance
							of the breaking up of Winter.— I finished reading the second part of
								<persRef ref="watts-isaac">Watts’s</persRef> Improvement of the
							Mind, and began his discourse on the Education of Children and Youth.
							The second part is on the Communication of useful knowledge—much shorter
							than the first, and not equal to it.— Watts was a dissenting clergyman—
							He is cautious never to say any thing that could give offence to the
								establish<unclear>ed</unclear> Church, but he indulges his passion
							with so much the more freedom against the Roman Catholics— With
							transsubstantiation it seems as if he never would finish— He insists
							strongly upon the distinction between things <hi rend="italic">above
								reason</hi>, which as mysteries of religion, may and ought to be
							believed, and things contrary to religion, which he says must be false:
							but I doubt whether this distinction will avail, for the maintenance of
							any religious creed— For any part of the Christian faith I am persuaded
							it will not.— The Trinity, the Divinity of Christ, the whole Doctrine of
							Atonement, all Miracles, the immaculate conception of Jesus, and a devil
							maintaining War against Omnipotence appear to me all as contrary to
							human reason as the <hi rend="italic">real presence</hi> of the
							Eucharist— Religion as it appears to me is one of the <hi rend="italic"
								>Wants</hi> of human Nature— An appetite which must be indulged;
							since without its gratification human existence would be a burden rather
							than a blessing— Reason may serve as a guard and check upon the
							religious appetite as well as upon our bodily necessities, to prevent
							its leading us into pernicious excesses— But it is presumption in human
							reason to set itself up as the umpire of our faith— My own Reason is as
							fallible as that of the Pope—and probably much more so than the
							collective Reason of an Ecclesiastical Council— I cannot reject a
							doctrine merely because my Reason will not sanction it— I must appeal to
							a higher tribunal; and <pb n="363" type="ms"/>believe, what I want to
							believe; am taught to believe, and may believe without injury to myself
							or others— The argumentum ex absurdo, is conclusive only upon subjects
							of a finite nature— Excellent for Mathematics and Geometry, but
							incompetent for infinity— It is not the absurdity of the doctrine of
							transubstantiation that proves its error, but as I conceive it is its
							pernicious tendencies; to enslave the human mind; to subject it to the
							arbitrary dominion of the priesthood—weak, corrupt and fallible men like
							ourselves.— Could I once bring myself to believe that by a special power
							from Heaven, a Priest can turn a wafer into a God and a Cup of Wine into
							the Blood of my Redeemer, the next and natural step would be to believe
							that my eternal weal or woe depended upon the fiat of the same Priest—
							That the keys of Heaven were in his hands to lock and unlock at his
							pleasure, and that the happiness or misery of my existence in the world
							to come, depended upon the chance of propitiating not the Deity but his
							Minister— All these tenets of the Romish Church are streams from the
							fountain of transubstantiation— The doctrine is pernicious—one motive
							for disbelieving it— Then I may examine it by the test of Reason— The
							doctrine is not necessary for the general system of Christianity— It is
							countenanced by <hi rend="italic">the letter</hi> of Christs Words Matt:
							XXVI.26. Mark XIV.22. Luke XXII.19. (In <persRef ref="john">S<hi
									rend="superscript">t:</hi> John’s</persRef> Gospel it is not at
							all mentioned as an occurrence at the last Supper, but with much more
							detail upon another occasion. John VI.26–66.) and it appears that the
							words when spoken even by himself shocked his disciples so much, that
							many of them, from that time; walked no more with him—though he told
							them by way of explanation that “his words were Spirit”—that is, as I
							believe—that they were to be understood in a spiritual, or figurative
							sense— This of itself is sufficient to settle the question in my mind—
							If the words were figurative there is no real presence— If they were
							not—if he performed a miracle, and the bread and wine of the last Supper
							were really his flesh and his blood, it does not follow that the same
							miracle can be repeated by every Priest, at every Commemmoration of that
							Event— He promises no such thing— I trace the Doctrine therefore
							directly to Priestcraft, to the obvious purpose of the Priests to
							establish their dominion over the minds of Men, under the mask of holy
							Mystery— I see that by the History of Christianity such has been its
							effects— That its consequences have been anti-christian in the highest
							degree—and that it is a mystery above though not contrary to my reason,
							why Divine Providence has permitted the weakness and folly of men to
							turn the very words of Christ to such dreadful abuses— Such is my
							opinion of transubstantiation— Its abstract inconsistency with my reason
							is not my principal ground for disbelieving it— The Doctor’s remarks
							upon preaching are as his Editors remark partly out of date. There is
							some Satirical humour in them— His principles respecting the influence
							of human authority are a little embarrassed about the settlement of a
							difficult boundary— The Chapters on writing Books for the Public and on
							writing and reading Controversies, are mere loose thoughts scarcely
							skimming the surface— But the active, thinking and judicious mind appear
							in them all— I read also Sermons 4 and 5 Vol. 6. of the English
							preacher—on the unenviable condition of the Wicked; and the wisdom of
							regarding Counsel. This was my Son <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George’s</persRef> birth-day, and brought again the grateful
							recollection of the joy, which this day eleven years ago, brought me.—
							Laus Deo— May it never be obliterated from my heart! <persRef

							in Gallicia, by a Cession from Austria— Russia he said was always
							temporizing; always on the watch for expedients; never ready to take a

							Austria she would have prevented the last War between Austria and
							France— If she had now seriously threatned Sweden, there would not have
							been the danger <pb n="365" type="ms"/>of the present War— When several
							powers were engaged in a common Cause they must be responsible for one
							another,—he did not know for what Russia was going to War— They said it
							was not for the duchy of Oldenburg— <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai"
								>Count Romanzoff</persRef> was certainly desirous of Peace; but they
							would not give any explanations— The <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor
								Alexander</persRef> had declared he would send <persRef
								ref="nesselrode-karl">Count Nesselrode</persRef> to Paris— It had
							not been asked of him— It was his own determination— Nesselrode had

								>Chernicheff</persRef> had been sent here with a letter from the
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>
							himself— This letter it was admitted manifested pacific at least if not
							amicable dispositions— Yet five or six weeks had been suffered to pass
							before any answer to it had been sent— As to Austria, he himself had
							witnessed how they felt towards Russia— He had been at Vienna at the
							time of the marriage— He arrived there five days before the <persRef
								ref="berthier-louis">Prince of Neufchatel</persRef>— From the moment
							of his arrival, <persRef ref="shuvalov-pavel">Count
							Schuvaloff</persRef>, who was then the Russian Envoy was deserted—
							Nobody would go near him— But he, Lauriston, walked about with him arm
							in arm, to get him better treatment. The Austrian Officers all told him
							they hoped soon to have in concert with France a War against Russia— In
							Prussia too, they had talked to him about Russia’s having accepted at
							Tilsit one of their Provinces—taken from their own <hi rend="italic"
								>ally</hi>!— How could Russia expect friends in those quarters?— I
							mentioned to him the <persRef ref="maret-hugues">Duke of
								Bassano’s</persRef> late Report to the Emperor Napoleon, and told
							him that the British Ministry now adhered to their orders in Council, as
							I believed only because they thought they would produce this War between
							France and Russia— He said that as to the <hi rend="italic"
								>Principle</hi> in the Duke of Bassano’s Report, that vessels
							navigating under an Enemy’s Convoy must be considered as Enemies, there
							could be no doubt of that— But then Circumstances were to be taken into
							Consideration— The necessity of having some trade; the impossibility of
							having any if all convoyed vessels were excluded, all this was ground
							for discussion, explanation, Negotiation—and that was what Russia now
							withheld— I also called upon <persRef ref="pardo-benito">General
								Pardo</persRef>, who is yet weak, recovering from a severe nervous
							fever. His opinions run in a very different channel from those of the
							Ambassador— He says the Treaty was signed by <persRef ref="karlphilippe"

								>th:</hi> of March—a renewal of the Treaty of 1758.— That it was
							communicated to Sweden, with certain offers, and instantly rejected;
							Sweden immediately gave the information to Russia— And as it was
							expected by the Emperor Alexander, it will have no effect whatsoever on
							his measures— Austria is in too bad a condition herself for a serious
							War, and hates the French too much to join cordially with them— The
							General was bitter in his remarks upon <persRef ref="metternick-klemons"

								>Watts’s</persRef> Discourse on the Education of Children and Youth—
							He gives a contrasted description of the excessive rigour and severity
							with which children had been usually brought up, about a Century before
							he wrote, and of the most profuse and unlimited liberty indulged to
							children in his age— Watts died before the middle of the last Century;
							and this Discourse must have been written some years before his death—
							The indulgence of fashionable education has become much more profuse and
							unlimited than it was when he complained of it as excessive, and it is
							much to be wished it were turned again towards rigour— Not perhaps to
							the extreme of the seventeenth Century; but to much more than I am able
							to practice. Watts himself inclines to the system of severity, and from
							my own experience I concur altogether in the opinion, with him.— The
							Sections upon Self-Government, on collecting rules of Prudence, and on
							the Sports and Diversions of Children— He undervalues I think the
							Languages, both antient and modern— But the course of my life has
							probably led me to overrate them— He prohibits Plays, Masquerades,
							Assemblies and the Gaming-Table; all of which excepting the last have
							now <unclear>ac</unclear>quired such an ascendancy that no writer upon
							Education would venture to proscribe them— Gaming as a positive Vice
							must always be forbidden by prudent Instructors, and avoided by prudent

						<p><date>20. </date>I had received last Evening a note from <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> requesting me to
							call upon him at 11. O’Clock this morning. I accordingly went— <persRef
								ref="chernyshyov-alexander">Count Chernicheff</persRef> was with him,
							and I was requested to wait a few minutes— Chernicheff soon after pass’d
							through the antichamber where I waited, and as he pass’d stop’d to ask
							me, if I was not about to dispatch a Courier to Paris— I suppose he knew
								<persRef ref="smith-john14">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John W.
								Smith</persRef> had come as a Courier, and expecting I should send
							him back wished to send something.— There were some books laying in the
							Chairs— A Projet pour un Code de Commerce by <persRef ref="u"
								>Boucher</persRef>— A Manuscript as I conjecture, and from its folio
							form and magnificent red Morocco binding I conclude, a present from the
							author— Also two sets of <persRef ref="derayneval-maximilien">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rayneval’s</persRef> Book de la
							Liberté des Mers— The Chancellor came in after a very few minutes, and
							told me that the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> had fixed
							upon to-morrow for his departure; that he himself should be very soon
							afterwards obliged to follow him, and as there might perhaps be before
							his return some discussions in which the interests of the United States
							as well as those of Russia might be involved, from his wish to defend
							and support both he wished to know, as far as I was informed and might
							think proper to confide to him, what was the precise state of the
							relations between the United States, and France or England, or both; and
							he had been the more desirous of this information before he should go,
							as he knew the Courier I had expected from Paris was now arrived. That
							some time ago <persRef ref="kurakin-aleksandri">Prince Kurakin</persRef>
							had written that there was to be a Treaty between France and the United
							States; and that arrangements favourable to America had actually been
							settled in France— But lately there seemed again to be some uncertainty
							upon the subject, and he had seen in one of the last Journaux de
							l’Empire, an Article dated at Baltimore, which seemed to hold out an
							angry and irritated language towards the United States— I told him that
							since my last Conversation with him, I had received no Communication
							from my own Government, of a more recent date than I had then; nor had I
							any information from which I could infer that any change had occurred in
							the state of our political relations, from that in which I had then
							suggested to him— That with respect to France, all that I could say from
							the letters I had received from <persRef ref="barlow-joel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Barlow</persRef>, was, that no
							definitive arrangement had yet been agreed upon; and with respect to
							England none had taken, nor as I believed was likely to take place— I
							had heard that late English Newspapers contained articles of
							intelligence from New-York to the 14. February; and that they said
								<persRef ref="foster-augustus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Foster</persRef> the British Minister was in Negotiation with our
							Secretary of State <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Monroe</persRef>; and it was expected that a Treaty
							would be concluded. I could say nothing on this subject from my own
							Government; but my own opinion was that no such Treaty could be
							concluded— I was perfectly sure it could not, unless the revocation of
							the British Orders in Council should be one of its explicit conditions—
							If M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Foster is authorized to stipulate for
							the revocation of the orders, a Treaty is possible— The Count asked how
							I thought France in that case would take it? I said I did not know; but
							I believed the American Government would not enquire whether France
							would take it well or ill. It was the right of the United States as a
							neutral Nation to trade with France that the American Government was
							bound to protect—it was denied them by the British Orders of Council,
							and unless restored by the revocation of those orders, I had no doubt
							but the United States would vindicate it by War— But I did not
							anticipate a Declaration of War by the United States at present. The
							measures that had been taken this Winter, were measures of preparation—
							Upon the ocean we could do nothing— If hostilities were to commence
							there, they must come from the part of England, and not from ours— To
							attack the British upon our Continent we must be prepared— A Bill for
							raising 25000 men had been passed by Congress. They must be raised by
							voluntary enlistment for we had no system of conscription. It was a
							difficult, and slow work to raise, organize and discipline 25000 men— I
							did not think it could be done in less time than the present year; nor
							should we commit the folly of commencing or declaring War before we
							could do something to maintain it.— But unless the orders in Council
							were revoked, a War eventually must be their result— Did I think it
							probable they would be revoked?— No—every present prospect was to the
							contrary— I thought their existence now depended solely upon that of
								<persRef ref="perceval-spencer">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Perceval</persRef> as prime Minister in England?— Did I think M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Perceval would remain Prime Minister?— I
							believed he would— Was it not probable the <persRef
								ref="wellesley-richard">Marquis of Wellesley</persRef> would come in
							again; after the Catholic question shall be disposed of?— I thought not—
							But how was it possible that the <persRef ref="george-iv">English
								Regent</persRef> should be so fascinated (said the Count) by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Perceval, un homme a ce qu’il me parait,
							assez Mediocre, in preference to Wellesley, whose Career has been so
							much more brilliant, and who appears to have rendered real services to
							the Nation— A man especially so important to the affairs in Spain?— I
							said I had my suspicions that the Catholic question was little more than
							the ostensible cause of Lord Wellesley’s retirement, and that a much
							more efficacious real cause, was the state itself of affairs in Spain.
								<pb n="367" type="ms"/>But how so?— There was a good deal of
							misunderstanding between the British Government, and that of the
							Spaniards at Cadix.— It had already proceeded so far that the English
							had threatened to abandon them— Lord Wellesley must before this time
							have strong misgivings about the ultimate issue of their Cause in Spain—
							He may be glad to retire from his particular stake upon it, while it has
							yet the shew, of being unimpaired— The Count said he thought it very
							probable and that the motive would be a very rational one— I then asked
							him if he expected very soon to leave the City?— Very shortly—within two
							or three days— The Emperor had finally resolved to go, and review the
							situation of his army on the frontiers— He should very shortly send me a
							written notice that during his absence, the business of the Department
							of foreign Affairs would again be entrusted to <persRef
								ref="saltykov-aleksandr">Count Soltikoff</persRef>, as it had been
							heretofore— A person of great merit; and very deserving of the choice
							the Emperor had fixed upon him— I said that I could not but regret his
							the Chancellor’s own absence, and wish that it might be short; but that
							if that must be, it would have been impossible for any appointment of
							the Emperor’s choice to have fallen upon a person whom I esteemed and
							respected more than Count Soltikoff, or with whom it would be more
							agreeable to me to have the usual official relations— He said that his
							own departure was necessary; though he regretted it much; and he
							intimated that his advice had been not to go— But the Emperor had
							decided otherwise— The forces which were assembled on the frontiers,
							were immense— On both sides— There was in History, scarcely any thing
							like it.— It was like Romance— What it would come to he knew not— That
							perpetual restlessness and agitation of the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>, was such that
							it was impossible to say how it would terminate— And the most
							extraordinary of all was that there was no Cause of War.— On the part of
							this Country, the affair of the Duchy of Oldenburg was the only object—
							Russia had made a Declaration in that case reserving her rights, but in
							that very Declaration had explicitly stated that she did not consider it
							as a cause for renouncing the Alliance or for changing the course of her
							policy.— I said that from the late Report of the <persRef
								ref="maret-hugues">Duke of Bassano</persRef> to the Emperor
							Napoleon, it would seem that the principles assumed by France, went to a
							total exclusion of all Commerce from the Country of her friends, as the
							English orders of Council went to a total exclusion of all commerce from
							France itself— But, said the Count a total exclusion of all Commerce is
							impossible— You might as well set up a total exclusion of all air to
							breathe, or all food to subsist upon, from a whole Nation, as a total
							exclusion of Commerce— You must have Commerce in some shape— Either
							lawful and regular, or by contraband, and licences.— The system of
							licences is founded upon falsehood and immorality— A Sovereign who
							countenances such vices is no longer a sovereign— It is a virtual
							abdication of his authority— He is a sovereign for that very purpose to
							maintain justice and morality— And to give his sanction to falsehood and
							injustice, is in substance ceasing to reign— I urged this very argument
							to the Emperor in a case of individual concernment, but which in
							principle I consider as exactly resembling this practice of navigating
							by licences— On that occasion the Emperor did me signal Justice— The
							person particularly interested was incensed against me to extreme
							bitterness, but as he appears now altogether to have forgotten it, and
							treats me in a friendly manner, I can without impropriety mention his
							name. It is <persRef ref="razumofsky-gregory">Count Alexis
								Razumofsky</persRef>. (N.B. this man is the Minister of Public
							Instruction—the Superintendent of the Schools, Universities, and
							scientific Academies throughout the Empire.) the Count is upon bad terms
							with <persRef ref="razumofsky-henriette">his wife</persRef>; and has for
							several years lived with a woman of low Condition; <persRef
								ref="razumofsky-therese">a French woman</persRef>; by whom he has
								<persRef ref="razumofsky-elisabeth;razumofsky-leon">several
								children</persRef>, who have received letters of nobility; which is
							very well— But Count Rasumoffsky sometime ago wrote a letter to a friend
							of his, saying that he would give to a certain public University a sum
							of one or perhaps two hundred thousand Rubles; if letters of Nobility
							could be obtained for this woman. This letter was laid before the
							Emperor, who merely referred it to the Council; under its former
							organization, to report their opinion upon it— Every member of the
							Council was for complying with the proposition, and I saw the moment
							when it was about to succeed— I could not withstand the force of my
							impressions, and wrote to the Emperor, that the open sanction of the
							Sovereign to a public scandal, bargained for money; letters of nobility,
							sold notoriously to a woman of ill-fame, appeared to me inconsistent
							with the very nature of Supreme Power— The establishment and protection
							of virtue and morality was the very essence of Sovereignty; and to set
							them at such open defiance was equivalent to a renunciation of dominion
							itself— To illustrate my idea I further urged that if the Sovereign sold
							his favourable distinctions to vice, he surely could not refuse to sell
							his refusal of it to virtue; and I put the case as a supposition, that
							Countess Razumofsky, in opposition to her husband’s proposal, should
							offer to the same University, double the sum that he had been willing to
							give, to ennoble his mistress, upon condition that his request should be
							rejected—and I asked what figure the Council would make in deliberating
							between the two propositions. It resolved itself into the famous sale of
							indulgences by the Romish Church, under which all the most infamous
							crimes might be <pb n="368" type="ms"/>committed at a regular and
							settled price.— The Emperor read my remonstrance, and told me that I had
							given him such a lesson of his duties that the pen had fallen from his
							hand— He could not accept the proposition of Count Razumofsky; and it
							was accordingly rejected— Now the system of formally proscribing
							commerce in general terms, and then allowing it by a sale of special
							licences, appeared to him to be of the same nature, as it would be to
							sell indulgences for crimes, or letters of nobility to infamy— I
							concurred entirely in this opinion; but observed that it was the English
							who had set the first example of this political profligacy, which he
							said was true. But by which party soever practiced it was equally
							scandalous and unjustifiable. He then spoke to me of this M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith, who had lately arrived as a
							Courier, to me, and who I observed to him had been ill on the road, and
							was yet, I feared, very dangerously so— The Count smiled, and said he
							had understood that he was on the contrary in very good health, and had
							brought with him a fair companion— I said I had transiently heard that
							he travelled in company with <persRef ref="u">a lady</persRef>; but I
							knew not whether she was fair or ugly; and had supposed she was merely a
								<hi rend="italic">traveling</hi> companion— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Smith was certainly not in a condition of health to indulge
							himself much with a fair one. The Count said he had mentioned the
							Circumstance to me, because he did not know how the woman had procured
							her Passport, or whether she had come in, as included in that of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith— That she was a woman well known
							here, and of no reputable character— She had been the mistress of many
							persons— Among the rest of a certain <persRef ref="deponthon-charles"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Duponthon</persRef> who had
							been here with the <persRef ref="law-jacques">French
								Ambassador</persRef>, and whom she had inveigled into a
							determination and promise to marry her. This affair had made a great
							noise, and on account of it she had been obliged to leave this Country—
							As she was a woman of suspicious character, and the time of her
							returning here was somewhat critical, the Count wished to know, whether
							her coming with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith was merely from
							politeness on his part, or whether it was the consequence of an
							attachment— If M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith had brought her with
							him as his friend, it was a matter with which the Government had no
							concern, and which would require from them no further notice; but if
							there was no such connection, and she had come from other motives, it
							would be necessary to have an eye upon her. I told the Count that I
							could not speak on the subject with certainty, but I would immediately
							obtain the information, and let him know— He said he would ask <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Borel</persRef> to call upon
							me, and I could mention to him the result of my enquiries which would
							save the trouble of writing.— I asked the Count if he should expedite a
							Courier to Paris before he left the City— He said he should not; but
							doubtless immediately after the Emperor’s arrival at Wilna he should,
							and if I wished to write and would send my dispatch to Count Soltykoff
							it would be forwarded to him and he would take care of it— He also
							offered to send any letter for me by a Courier going to Sweden— I left
							the Count, and after returning home a few minutes went and called upon
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith; I found him at <persRef
								ref="u">Walbezky’s</persRef> and complaining that he was still very
							ill. <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingraham</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="plumer-ernestus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Plummer</persRef> were with him; and <persRef ref="harris-levett"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef> came in while I
							was there— I mentioned to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith in
							private the notice which the Government had taken of his travelling
							companion, and the enquiries to which she had given rise— He said that
							he had never seen her untill two days before he left Paris— That after
							he had his Passport and was preparing to depart, his servant <persRef
								ref="victor">Victor</persRef>, (the same who went with <persRef
								ref="jones-thomas3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="gray-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gray</persRef> from this place to France) had told him there was a
							Lady of respectable character, who had her husband here, and wished to
							come to S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg.— She was to pay an
							equal part of the expence of the Journey, and the motive of saving 400
							Dollars to <persRef ref="thorndike-israel">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l:</hi> Thorndike</persRef> induced M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Smith to consent to take her— The next day Victor expressed
							a doubt whether she had any money to pay for her journey, but M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith ascribed that to Victor’s
							unwillingness to ride outside of the Carriage. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Smith was hesitating about what to do, untill a friend of
							his, a <persRef ref="derumilly-gauthier">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rumilly</persRef>, who lodged at the same Hotel, offered, though
							himself a total stranger <hi rend="strikethrough">himself</hi> to the
							Lady, to go with him and see her. (Jones more than once mentioned this
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rumilly to me, and told me he had
							been extremely intimate with <persRef ref="armstrong-john">General
								Armstrong</persRef>, while he was in France; hinting at the same
							time that Rumilly was secretly a Plenipotentiary of the Police
							Department of Paris.) They went accordingly; the Lady agreed to pay and
							actually paid him in advance 1200 francs, and referred him for her
							character to <persRef ref="kurakin-aleksandri">Prince Kurakin</persRef>,
							and the Russian Embassy— She had a Passport from Prince Kurakin,
							entirely separate from that of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith— The
							Prince himself only said to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith in
							English, she is very pretty; but the Secretary of the Embassy, of whom
							he made his enquiries told him she was a respectable woman— He was
							however now extremely mortified at his having consented to take her, for
							he had now reason to believe and had heard she was not a respectable
							woman— To him she had been as sacred as if she had been a Princess— He
							had always prided himself upon the regularity of his moral character—
							His business here was such as required that the Government should have
							at least no personal indisposition towards him and he saw that his
							reputation would suffer from his having had this woman in company with
							him— Unfortunately they had been great part of the way from Berlin here
							travelling also in company with <persRef ref="lieven-dorothea">Countess
								Liewen</persRef>, the wife of the <persRef ref="lieven-christopher"
								>Russian Minister at Berlin</persRef>, who was returning home; and
							she had repeatedly seen this woman— She is an Italian, named Giuliani. I
							told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith that I should explain the
							Circumstances, in the manner as he had stated them to me— That the light
							in which it was viewed by the Government was totally different from that
							which affected him— Their notice was attracted by political suspicions,
							and they would have paid no more <pb n="369" type="ms"/>attention to it,
							if the Lady had come only as his particular friend— He was very anxious
							that they might be rightly informed in this respect; but said the Lady
							still owed him about 300 rubles which he hoped still to receive from
							her— I advised him then to get it as soon as he could; for I thought it
							not improbable she might have occasion shortly to return whence she
							came— I paid a visit to <persRef ref="laval-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Laval</persRef>, whom I found in deep
							affliction— He has within these few days lost a <persRef
								ref="laval-pavel">child</persRef>— His second Son—a boy about 6 1/2
							years old.— I did very warmly sympathize with him— It was a favourite
							child, to a man most affectionate to all his children. He told me it was
							impossible to conceive the feelings of the moment, when the lurking
							hopes, that still cling to the heart, untill the last instant of life,
							are all extinguished by the event—that every thing preceding is
							comparatively speaking pleasure— There is no supporting such Trials but
							by strength from above— After sitting with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Laval about an hour, I walked— Met and walked with <persRef
								ref="woodward-c2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodward</persRef>—
							In the Evening I received letters from <persRef ref="russell-jonathan"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell</persRef>, in London,
							and <persRef ref="anderson-james2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Anderson</persRef> at Gothenburg, both of which had been opened, and
							sent to me from the Post-Office, without being sealed up again.</p>

							that the principles asserted in the <persRef ref="maret-hugues">Duke of Bassano’s</persRef> late Report to the
							Emperor Napoleon, were such that if pursued in their rigour they must
							produce War— Their effect would be the total annihilation of the trade
							to the Baltic— Swedish and Russian— This it was impossible they should
							agree to— Neither of the Governments could accomplish it— No Government
							could accomplish it— France and England were perfectly agreed in the
							theory, of excluding all Commerce between each other— And yet both were
							compelled to admit it again by the means of licences— He said, therefore
							it was that Russia ought to come into some explanations on the subject—
							The principle undoubtedly was as laid down by the Duke of Bassano— But
							Russia might insist upon exceptions and relaxations which she might shew
							to be necessary— So might Sweden— France would no doubt accede to such
							of these as should be reasonable. The object merely was to discuss, and
							not substitute obstinacy, or temper in the place of reason— He told me
							the adventure of <persRef ref="u">Longuerue</persRef>, whom he sent off
							as a Courier, and <pb n="370" type="ms"/>and who on the last Stage
							before he arrived at Riga, fired pistols at two Carriages successively,
							which were going the same way, and the drivers of which attempted to
							pass him. The first was a merchant, <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Amburger</persRef>, and it was said
							one of his horses was wounded— The second was a Courier of the Russian
							Government, who pushed on, in spite of the pistol shot, which Longuerue
							said he had fired in the air— The Courier however had complained of him
							at Riga, and Longuerue on his arrival went to the <persRef
								ref="lobanov-dmitry">Governor Prince Labanoff</persRef>— He said to
							justify himself that by the usage, nobody could pass by a Courier— This
							was to be sure the usage in France; but it did not follow it was the
							usage here— Prince Labanoff hesitated for a moment whether he should not
							stop Longuerue; but he did not— And the Emperor who knew it would
							mortify him (the Ambassador) and forbidden that any notice should be
							taken of it to him— So that for more than a week the Ambassador had
							disbelieved the whole Story— It had mortified him beyond all expression—
							He had not only utterly disavowed Longuerue’s conduct, but declared that
							it was in direct opposition to his Instructions, which were that he
							should conduct himself with peculiar reserve and discretion upon the
							road— He had sent Longuerue off, by the Emperor’s knowledge and
							approbation, immediately after a long Conversation the Emperor had had
							with him, and for the purpose of reporting it to his Government.— And he
							was the more vexed at Longuerue’s foolish adventure; because it had
							placed him, the Ambassador (Longuerue is his nephew) under the
							appearance of owing obligations to them here— I told him I had heard so
							many reports about Longuerue’s being arrested on his way &amp;c— that I
							had disbelieved them all— We also talked about Sweden, and I told him
							there was but one way of explaining her present situation and accounting
							for her conduct to my Mind— When I saw a French man, a French General, a
							family relation of the Emperor Napoleon, taking such a decisive part
							against France, the only possible way of explaining it was, by observing
							the harshness with which France treated every foreign Nation negotiating
							with her— The total disregard to their interests and feelings, the
							perpetual sentiment of her own strength to which she resorted, left it
							impossible for any person in another Government to be her friend— She
							did so every where— We had experience of it in our own Country— He said
							that <hi rend="italic">Subjects</hi> were treated no better than
							foreigners— But I must own the <persRef ref="joachim-i">Prince of Ponte
								Corvo</persRef>, or <persRef ref="charles-xivjohn">Prince Royal of
								Sweden</persRef>, was un peu <hi rend="italic">Bouillon</hi> too— Un
							peu <hi rend="italic">Bouillon</hi>, (he did not say Brouillon) and his
							adventure at Vienna was a proof of it— That I told him, <hi
								rend="italic">they</hi> ought not to reproach him with— Why not?
							said he— It was a great indiscretion—an Imprudence—and has always been
							so considered in France as well as elsewhere— Supposing I should do such
							a thing here now—what would you call it?— I certainly should not
							consider it as very prudent— Well said he—Bernadotte had no Instructions
							for what he did at Vienna— He did it of his own head; and it is a proof
							that he is un peu Bouillon— The Ambassador took in perfect good humour
							all the remarks I made, upon the harshness of the french Negotiations,
							though I expressed myself in terms as strong as could with decorum be
							used—we parted very amicably— The <persRef

							of the Servant’s been to <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							mistake— On the former occasion M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kocheleff

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Severin, he had enquired of <persRef
								ref="bezerra-joao">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bezerra</persRef>,
							who was well acquainted with him, whether it had not been by mistake— I
							had told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bezerra it was, but I new not
							how— This day M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kocheleff received me, and
							it was only on meeting him that I discovered the mistake— He appeared
							rather more ruffled at the accident than I thought necessary— I made an
							apology to him for the blunders of my servant, which he did not receive
							with much courtesy. <pb n="371" type="ms"/>When I finally found out M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Severin’s I spent about two hours with him
							examining his collection of Russian Coins.— He has them from the time of
								<persRef ref="peter-the-great">Peter the Great’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="michael-i">Grandfather</persRef>— And a great variety of
							them.— He has also a large collection of foreign Coins, which were
							packed up, as he is about to move into another house— I therefore could
							not see them— He shewed me however his <persRef ref="cromwell-oliver"
								>Cromwell’s</persRef> Guinea, which looks perfectly new, and has a
							head of the Protector, extremely well executed, and a great likeness—
							The greatest curiosities of his Russian Coins are the Roubles, with the
							heads of Peter and <persRef ref="ivan-v">Ivan</persRef> on one side, and
								<persRef ref="sophiaaleksekyevna">Sophia</persRef> holding the

								3</persRef>. with the head of <persRef ref="catherinethegreat"
								>Catherine 2</persRef>. struck, over that of Peter, whose profile is
							still discernible upon it.— He has a Bank of England Dollar with similar
							remnants of the Spanish coinage apparent upon it.— He has a Ruble with
							the head of <persRef ref="paul-i">Paul</persRef>, which he suppressed
							because he found it too ugly; and seven different samples of the present
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef> head which he never

						<p><date>29. </date>I finished reading this morning with <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, the Fables of <persRef
								ref="lafontaine-jean">La Fontaine</persRef>, which have furnished
							his regular daily reading lesson, exactly five Months— Notwithstanding
							the frequent interruptions occasioned by his occasional illness and my
							own his progress has been as favourable as I could expect, and he now
							reads with facility, though not yet correctly— When we returned <hi
								rend="strikethrough">from</hi> into the City last October he
							scarcely knew the letters of the Alphabet.— It was then however nearly
							two years since I began to teach him— I shall now begin to teach him
							English reading, of which he knows nothing; and resumed <persRef
								ref="berquin-arnaud">Berquin’s</persRef> Ami des Enfans; which he
							can at present read with ease, and whose Stories he begins to
							understand— La Fontaine’s fables have served the purpose of teaching him
							to read, better than any other book I had, because the Edition I have
							used has a wooden Cut, before every Fable which has proved a lure to his
							curiosity and attention. But there are very few of them, which he could
							understand at all, and the less he has understood the more difficult I
							have found it to fix his attention. I had never regularly read through
							myself before, the twelve Books of this Fabulist, whom the French
							Critics extol as the most perfect writer of Fables, of any age or
							Nation— There is a mixture of careless simplicity, and shrewd sagacity,
							of indulgent good-humour and sly severity, of vulgar phraseology; and
							elevated poetical beauty <pb n="372" type="ms"/>which perhaps no other
							fabulist possesses in so high a degree, and which are peculiarly adapted
							to this particular species of writing— His versification is negligent
							and seldom harmonious— But that also is excusable for these popular
							unpretending Stories, written for children, and for the ignorant— He has
							no merit of invention; for he took his subjects from any body; even from
							the <persRef ref="louisjosephxavier">Duke de Bourgogne</persRef>, a
							child, of eight years old— The point in which he appears most deficient
							is precisely that which I deem the most essential— I mean the morality—
							It is either the old, and hacknied moral of his predecessors from whom
							he takes the story; or a half-indulged and half-suppressed Satire upon
							kings, nobles and Priests (which I believe more than everything else has
							contributed to his <hi rend="italic">excessive</hi> reputation in
							France;) or frequent repetition of common place axioms—or
							inconsistencies with himself—or finally and worst of all, questionable
							or false principles— Examples of all these defects might easily be
							adduced; nor would the number be small of feeble and insignificant
							conclusions, not worthy of a story built upon them.— La Fontaine in
							short teaches very little virtue of any kind; and perhaps more vice than
							virtue—of elevated or heroic Virtue, he seems not to have had a
							conception— His great merit is as a story-teller and not as a moralist—
							The two Pigeons for instance has a false moral— Its doctrine is; never
							travel for improvement; because you may meet with disasters and may be
							separated from your friend or lover— But it is full of charming strokes
							of tenderness and affection— Not conjugal affection; for the pigeons are
								<hi rend="italic">brothers</hi>— Nor yet fraternal affection, for
							the Poet applies himself his moral to <hi rend="italic">happy
								lovers</hi>—boasts how much he has loved once; and laments that he
							is too old to love again— It is therefore licentious love that he
							substantially recommends; and he has expressly and unnaturally avoided
							to make his pigeons <hi rend="italic">mates</hi>, lest it should be
							mistaken for a case of marriage— He was tormented it is said with a
								<persRef ref="lafontaine-marie">termagant wife</persRef>— And he
							expressly disavows all respect for marriage— He disavows too paternal
							affection; and according to an anecdote related of him, did not know his
								<persRef ref="u">own son</persRef>, when introduced to him, at
							twenty-five years of age.— He is said to have died profoundly penitent
							for his tales, which are indeed much more grossly licentious than his
							fables, but which perhaps do not shew more moral laxity of mind— His
							flattery of <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis XIV</persRef>. of the
								<persRef ref="louisdauphin">Dauphin</persRef>; the Duke de
							Bourgogne, the <persRef ref="armanddebourbon">Prince de Conti</persRef>,
							and even of <persRef ref="pardaillan-francoise">Madame de
								Montespan</persRef>, may be excused; for when you are obliged to say
							“let <persRef ref="horace">Horace</persRef> blush, and <persRef
								ref="virgil">Virgil</persRef> too,” it would be requiring too much
							of La Fontaine, not to let him pass in the throng— On the whole
							therefore La Fontaine is the first of Story-tellers, but not of
							fabulists— As to his famous two Pigeons; Moores “Sparrow and Dove[”] may
							be placed in opposition to it, and in my estimation would bear the palm
							from it in every respect— I walked morning and Evening— <persRef
								ref="smith-catherine-johnson">Catherine</persRef> spent the Eve at
								<persRef ref="colombi-maria">Madame Colombi’s</persRef>. I received
