							The anecdote concerning <persRef ref="alexanderofpherae">Alexander of

								>Gisborne’s</persRef> principles of Moral Philosophy, and his
							Remarks on a decision in the British House of Commons in April 1792 on
							the abolition of the Slave-Trade— He is a very zealous advocate for this
							abolition, which has been since legally decreed in England as well as in
							America— Whether it will eventually be abolished in fact is yet a
							problem— The trade is beyond question, an abomination, disgraceful to
							the human character, but there are so many powerful passions and
							interests concurring to support it, and the efforts to obtain its
							abolition are themselves so much composed of fashion and faction that I
							still doubt whether the abolition will be accomplished. I say the
							motives of the abolitionists were in a great degree fashion and faction;
							for the Impressment of Seamen is to all intents and purposes a practice
							as unjust as immoral, as base, as oppressive and tyrannical as the
							slave-trade. It is in all its most heinous features identically the same
							crime— In some particulars it is more aggravated— And yet the same
							members of the British Parliament who have been the greatest zealots for
							abolishing the Slave-trade, are not only inflexible adherents to the
							practice of impressments among their own people, but are now waging a
							rancorous War against the United States, to support the practice of
							their Officers in impressing men from American Merchant vessels on the
							high-seas— Every particle of argument that can bear against the slave
							trade bears with equal force against impressment.— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Gisborne is at least consistent— He
							admits that the Impressment of Seamen is a violation of the general
							principles of the English Constitution— And he speaks of it even as
							applied to British Subjects with disapprobation— He says nothing of the
							abuse of extending the practice to Americans, and upon American Vessels—
							And even his censure upon it as applied only to British Subjects is very
							faint and cold compared with his fervour of passion against the
							slave-trade. I also read in <persRef ref="smith-adam">Smith’s</persRef>
							Essays on Philosophical subjects part of his History of Astronomy.</p>

							useful— I rested however afterwards, and untill broad day-light this
							morning— This day I find unequivocal benefit from the Bath— Walked
							before dinner; read a few pages in <persRef ref="gisborne-thomas2"
								>Gisborne’s</persRef> duties of Men—heard <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> in the Psalter, and his
							English Story-Book; and passed an hour at Cards. <persRef
								ref="florance-john">Captain Florence</persRef>, Master of one of the
							American Vessels at Cronstadt, came to ask my advice what to do with his
							men;—whom he is obliged to maintain and keep on wages— He dared not sail
							before Winter on account of the War between America and England. He is
							here upon freight, and his portage bill has already swallowed up almost
							the whole proceeds of his Cargo— There is no prospect, that he will be
							able to go next Summer—his resources are nearly absorbed, and he knows
							not where or how to obtain relief.— I could give him none; but advised
							him to wait untill the approach of summer, as at all Events he must; and
							perhaps in the interval some thing might occur of which he could avail
							himself to extricate him from his very unpleasant situation.</p>

								<persRef ref="stquentin-dominique">S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Quentin’s</persRef> Grammar— I am however convinced that he will
							soon stop short in this pursuit— The plan appears to me excellent for a
							school; where there are several fellow-learners to stimulate the
							curiosity and industry of one another— But for a single pupil especially
							of Charles’s age, I fear it will not succeed— I cheerfully devote to my
							Child, all the time that I can properly require of him to apply to his
							own instruction;—though it diverts many hours which I might perhaps
							better appropriate to my own instruction, or to the production of
							something more important than teaching a Child the first Elements of

								Adams</persRef> was very unwell the whole day—confined to her bed. I
							nevertheless read prayers to her; and <persRef ref="sterne-lawrence"
								>Sterne’s</persRef> Sermon 9. upon the character of <persRef
								ref="herod">Herod</persRef>. It was preached on Innocents day, and
							its purpose is to argue the authenticity of the scriptural account of
							Herod’s massacre of the Innocents from the character of the Man— It is
							like the rest of these discourses so ingenious and interesting that one
							wishes it longer. I have never read any other Sermons that possess this
							sort of attraction so strongly as Sterne’s. I also read <persRef
								ref="mayhew-jonathan">Mayhew’s</persRef> third Sermon to Young
							Men—on Sobriety of Mind as implying humility and repentance— These
							Sermons are of a character very different from Sterne’s, although like
							them they occasionally contain a stroke of Satire. In the Evening I
							finished reading Vol 1. of <persRef ref="gisborne-thomas2"
								>Gisborne’s</persRef> duties of Men, which is much like a Sermon
							too— A very useful book of practical morality, written in plain and easy
							language, and replete with sound sense and honest sentiment— I walked
							twice this day; and gave the usual portion of time to <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>.</p>

							One walk before dinner— I began to task Charles with learning <persRef

								23<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi> Psalm— This was one of the first
							things that I ever learnt by heart myself; and I remember it from the

							recitations by heart, he is very reluctant at this new toil; I could not
							prevail upon him perfectly to acquire this day even the first Stanza of
							six lines.— But after keeping him about half an hour to it, postponed
							the remainder of the lesson untill to-morrow.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> My State of health during the Month now just

							for many Months before; but <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> absorbs it more and more— I have now very seldom
							any interruption from visitors, and still more seldom go abroad into

							with those who have come to take their places, the Circumstances of the
							times forbid me to associate— Time, when I enjoy the blessing of health
							and the use of my eyes, can never hang heavy upon my hands— I have now
							scarcely any thing but leisure, and if I bestowed on some important
							pursuit two thirds of the time I allow to Charles, I should have little
							cause for self-dissatisfaction— As it is, I cannot escape from
							self-reproach for losing so many hours in unprofitable occupation; and
							for indolence which I have not strength of mind to overcome.</p>
