							He came from Lisbon with a Cargo of Wines; but having a few prohibited
							Articles on board, they have not only been confiscated, but he has been
							arrested, and is still detained— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gourieff that I could not pretend to interfere with the operation of the
							Laws of the Country; but that I hoped it might be possible to release
							this unfortunate man, who states that his offence was unintentional and
							arose solely from his ignorance that the articles were prohibited— He
							said he would enquire into the matter, which would he thought be
							adjusted with little difficulty— The Laws must necessarily be rigorous
							against the introduction of prohibited goods, but there were always
							cases to which some indulgence should be extended; and he should
							consider this as one of them; and do what was in his power to have the
							man discharged— I thence went and called upon <persRef ref="laval-jean"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laval</persRef>; he was not at
							home, and I went to <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Harris’s</persRef>— He mentioned to me his intention of
							sending <persRef ref="harris-john">his nephew</persRef> home to America,
							by the way of England, and asked me to obtain for him a Courier’s
							Passport; for which I promised him that I would apply. While I was
							there, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laval sent me word that he had
							returned home, and I called on him again. I had drawn his Certificate
							according to a form which he sent me; being the same that had heretofore
							been used by the French Consul— But it purported that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Laval’s Acte de Naissance, had been
							presented to me; and I accordingly asked him to shew it me— He said he
							had given it to <persRef ref="lesseps-jean">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lesseps</persRef> who had not returned it— I observed
							that I could not then <hi rend="italic">Certify</hi> that it had been
							presented to me— He thought those were mere words of form, and that I
							might certify, in Confidence upon his Statement— In the form M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lesseps had used those words were
							underscored and minuted as indispensible— I told M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Laval that my Confidence in his assertion was perfect, but
							it could not justify me in certifying what was not the fact. I would
							either omit the words, or insert in their stead “deposited at the French
							Consulate in this City[”]— He preferred the latter, and we appointed
							seven in the Evening for me to call upon him with the new Certificate—
							At seven I accordingly went with it— And he signed it— I left it with
							him to be signed by four witnesses, as the french Law requires— It is
							for an annuity which his <persRef ref="laval-jeanne">mother</persRef>
							receives upon his life— <persRef ref="laval-alexandra">Madame
								Laval</persRef> was present, and <persRef ref="demaistre-joseph"
								>Count Maistre</persRef> was there— They are to go in five or six

							convinced that <persRef ref="kutuzov-mikhail">Kutuzoff</persRef> had
							really won the Battle of Borodino, though the world will never believe

								Montréal</persRef> called upon me this morning.— The Government has

								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> out to walk with me
							before dinner— Read prayers, and <persRef ref="sterne-lawrence"
								>Sterne’s</persRef> Sermon upon the House of Mourning and the House
							of Feasting.— I had read one by <persRef ref="foster-james4"
								>Foster</persRef> upon the same text, three weeks since— The
							argument is nearly <pb n="421" type="ms"/>the same in both— But Sterne’s
							manner is more lively and affecting. In this Sermon particularly there
							are appearances of levity, both at the beginning and end of the
							Discourse, too inconsistent with its own drift and purpose— He begins by
							a trick upon his Auditory, and upon his reader— By seeming flatly to
							deny his text, as soon as he has given it out. Afterwards you perceive
							it is not the preacher who denies, but a supposed collocutor with him; a
							man of the world who is to argue the point against him; and whom he no
							otherwise introduces than by repeating his part of the imaginary
							dialogue, as well as the preacher’s replies.— This is a sort of
							theatrical artifice for which the pulpit was not the proper place— At
							the end there is not only an admission which seems to weaken much of
							what had been said concerning the uses of sorrow, but a sarcasm upon
							gravity perfectly misplaced; and apparently introduced to excite the
							hearer’s laughter— The Body of the Sermon is serious, forcible,
							animated, pathetic—in short an admirable and unanswerable vindication of
							the text— The first and last sentences are fit only for a Harlequin—the
							rest of the Sermon is worthy of a Saint and a Martyr— Such are many of
							Sterne’s Discourses— I also read Sermons 9 and 10. Vol. 9. of the
							English preacher— One a Charity Sermon; upon Liberality—the other a Fast
							Sermon, against Avarice.</p>

						<p><date>15. </date>I received this morning a Note from <persRef
								ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count Romanzoff</persRef> requesting me to
							call on him at his house on the Quay, at seven O’Clock in the Evening.—
							I accordingly went; and he said he wished to consult me as to the manner
							of sending to the United States dispatches to <persRef
								ref="dashkov-andrei">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Daschkoff</persRef>, containing the proposal of the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander’s</persRef> Mediation, between
							the United States and Great-Britain— That with regard to my dispatching
							a Courier directly, he had spoken to the <persRef ref="cathcart-william"
								>English Ambassador</persRef>, to ask if he would furnish a passport
							or paper to secure such a person from being taken by the British—which
							Lord Cathcart answered he would readily do, provided the Courier should
							go by the way of England— But the Count said he had replied that he
							could not propose to me to agree to such a Condition— I thought it not
							advisable on my part to agree to it; but mentioned to the Count that I
							should in a few days apply to him for a Courier’s Passport, for an
							American whom I should charge with my dispatches, and who would take his
							for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daschkoff, if he thought proper to
							trust them to this conveyance— He said his dispatches were all ready,
							and the Passport could be furnished as soon as I should ask for it— He
							asked if there would not be an opportunity to send, direct to the United
							States from Archangel— I told him I believed it was too late. He said
							upon reflection he believed it was, and it reminded him of an answer of
								<persRef ref="chichagov-pavel">Admiral Tchichagoff</persRef> after a
							visit he had made to Archangel, to the Emperor, who asked him how long
							he had stayed there. He said he had spent the whole Summer there— The
							Emperor, knowing his absence had been very short, said with some
							surprize, how so?—the whole Summer!—three days, Sire, said the Admiral—
							I told the Count that I should probably ask for the Passport, towards
							the close of the next week— The Courier would probably be obliged to go
							through England— If he was stopp’d <pb n="422" type="ms"/>the English
							Government might perhaps read the despatches—for that, I could not
							answer— The Count said that as to his dispatches, it would not be of any
							consequence—they would only read over again in the identical words the
							same proposition that had been made to themselves— I asked him if he had
							any good news from the armies; he said none of any consequence— Nothing
							but what was in the Bulletin’s— He enquired concerning a report
							circulating here that a suspension of hostilities had already taken
							place between U.S. and England— I mentioned my information from <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef>, directly to the contrary; and that a proposition
							made by him to that effect had been rejected by the English Government—
							He said this would not discourage him from the proposition of the
							Russian Mediation, but on the contrary would rather make him more
							earnest in the proposal; from the confirmed opinion, that an indirect
							negotiation, would not be liable to the mutual irritations which had
							attended the direct attempts— He also mentioned the Account he had seen
							in the newspapers that the American troops had taken the town of
							Sandwich in Canada— I told him that was nothing more than that they had
							entered the Province— There had been no fighting.— I was with the Count
							about half an hour, and spoke to him of <persRef ref="fulton-robert"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fulton’s</persRef> letter to me,
							with his wish to obtain an exclusive privilege for constructing
							steam-boats in Russia— I asked him if exclusive privileges were granted
							here to the inventors of useful machines—he said they sometimes were;
							not by a general law, but by special grant from the Emperor, of which
							there was one recent example. I explained to him the nature of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fulton’s Steam-boats—the very advantageous
							experience of them in America, and my own perswasion that the
							introduction of them between S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg
							and Cronstadt would be not only useful but important to the Commerce of
							this City— He asked if I had any Memoir upon the subject from the
							inventor; which I could give him, to shew to the Emperor, after
							consultation with the <persRef ref="detraversay-ivan">Minister of the
								Marine</persRef>. I told him I had only a letter from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fulton himself, and I would send him an
							abstract of his proposals in that— The Count appeared well disposed to
							favour an application of this sort, and asked some questions respecting
							the operation of our patent Laws— As whether they did not give frequent
							occasion to litigation, as to the fact of a new invention— How the
							claims to Patents were examined, and upon what conditions they were
							granted— He asked also whether M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fulton’s
							steam-boat, could stem rapids in rivers, as well as currents— I said I
							believed not— That he said, would be a most important invention indeed
							to this Country, where owing to a few very insignificant falls of water,
							they were obliged to break up, and burn for common fuel all the boats
							that brought merchandize down their rivers.— After leaving the Count I
							passed the remainder of the Evening at home.</p>

							returned four or five days ago— It was rumoured when he went that he was

							finished reading <persRef ref="gisborne-thomas2">Gisborne</persRef> on
							the Duties of the female sex— A sober and moral discourse; containing
							many sensible remarks, and much judicious advice— It deals perhaps too

								rend="italic">inevitable</hi>. Making every allowance for the
							exaggerations <pb n="425" type="ms"/>of prejudice and passion, it is
							obvious they are in great and imminent danger; and their inaction so
							long after the occupation of Moscow, is very unlike the former practice
							of Napoleon.— Paulucci said that he had committed the same imprudence in
							1797, and had extricated himself from it by the Peace, which he was
							compelled to ask, and to which Austria then assented. But for that he
							was then perdu sans ressource— I have often heard this before— But he
							had then, and has now his greatest of all resources—a Battle— His
							fortunes and existence are staked upon that; and he has so long abused
							the favours of Fortune, that she will certainly finish by jilting him—
							Or rather Providence, (such is my belief) after using him for the
							purposes he is destined to answer, will exhibit him like another invader
							of Russia, “to point a moral or adorn a tale.”— I called upon <persRef

							will inevitably be destroyed: but he thinks the present prospects of the
							Russian Cause superb— He still dreads the genius and resources of
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef>, more than they
							deserve— The accounts are so numerous and so uniform, that his army is
							famishing; that he has proposed to <persRef ref="kutuzov-mikhail"
								>Kutuzoff</persRef> by <persRef ref="law-jacques">Count
								Lauriston</persRef> an armistice, that his retreat through Smolensk
							is impossible, that they are no longer mere rumours. Kutuzoff has
							received a reinforcement of 24 regiments, <unclear>18</unclear>000 men— Don Cossacks— The
							Novogrod armament 80000 men are rapidly advancing to Moscow from this
							side— Many of Napoleon’s Couriers, and Mails with letters have been
							intercepted; all complaining that they are in want of every thing— One
							from the Bavarian General to the <persRef ref="maximilian-i">King of
								Bavaria</persRef>, in which he complains that the <hi rend="italic"
								>allies</hi> are not allowed to forage, and that they are starved
							that the french soldiers may be fed— Kutuzoff has reorganized the army,
							and filled up the vacancies in the Regiments, from the Moscow Armament—
							The answer to the proposal for an armistice, was a mere reference to the
							Emperor Alexander’s declaration at Wilna—that he would not make Peace
							while an armed Enemy should remain on the Russian Territory.— Such is
							the change from despondency to confidence effected by the storm of
							Polotzk— I read prayers and <persRef ref="sterne-lawrence"
								>Sterne’s</persRef> Sermon 4. On Self-knowledge—<persRef

							had a letter from <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef>, who was with

							Harris yesterday to take to me a paper with bad news— I congratulated
							him on the occasion of the Te Deum, which he said it was to be hoped
							would be followed by important consequences; and especially that it
							would correct some opinions concerning the Russians which had been
							industriously disseminated. I suppose he alluded to the reputation of
							the Military skill of their Generals— The music of the Te Deum was
							remarkably fine— After it was finished the Emperor the <persRef
