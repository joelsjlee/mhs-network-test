							and the other on the pursuit of Wisdom— They are in the calm, reasoning

							great elegance, and urging serious truths with ingenuity, accurate
							observation of human nature, and a highly polished style.— In the
							Evening I read several Sections of <persRef ref="paley-william"
								>Paley’s</persRef> Horae Paulinae; in which there is great research,
							close examination of all <persRef ref="paul">Paul’s</persRef> Epistles;
							an acute comparison of different passages of them together, for the

							their authenticity; and an high eulogium of the Apostle—</p>

							a long time;—and he supposed we walked at different hours— I told him
							that I had adopted the practice of walking in the morning early; and
							sometimes saw his Majesty window open, in very cold weather— He said
							that he always made it a rule to rise in the morning, and dress with his
							window open— I asked if he did not suffer from the Cold— He said on the
							contrary he found it enured him better than any thing to the Cold— That
							in the time of the <persRef ref="catherinethegreat">Empress
								Catherine</persRef> it had been very much the usage to be shut up
							and confined in hot apartments; and in that of the <persRef ref="paul-i"
								>late Emperor</persRef>, on the contrary to be continually out at
							the parades, and there were not as at present large buildings where the
							exercises were held— He had then worn a flannel waistcoat; but he found
							it irritated and fretted the skin so much, and made him so delicate that
							he could not endure it— A Physician therefore advised him to leave it
							off, and told him that either he would die under the <pb n="351"
								type="ms"/>operation of the change, or would have his health much
							better— He left off therefore the maudite veste de flannelle; he did not
							die; but has had his health much better; and been wholly free from
							certain rhumatic complaints that he had been subject to, before. You are
							not of my opinion said he, about flannel?— I said that I had so long
							been in the custom of wearing it in Winter; that I believe if I should
							leave it off, I should die under the operation— But, said he, there are
							now many physicians here who think, that flannel is a bad thing for
							wear— I was not interrupted at home—made some further progress in
							Paucton; and wrote part of a letter— Cards at the close of the
							Evening.</p>

						<p><date>6. </date>The invitation to the examination of the young Ladies of
							noble families at the Convent was with notice to begin at 9. O’Clock. in
							the morning. I went with <persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef>, before ten, and found
							they had already begun— The examination was then in Geometry; after
							which followed experimental philosophy; French Rhetoric and
							Literature—German language— Then the Company were introduced into
							another Hall, where were the samples of drawing, painting, needle work,
							embroidery, and artificial flowers, worked by the young Ladies— Then we
							returned to the Examination Hall, and the musical performances
							commenced; after which succeeded the dancing, and the whole concluded
							about four O’Clock— Part of the Company then went into another
							apartment, where a Collation was provided, and the young Ladies
							presented the plates round to the guests— The examinations were
							precisely the same, as at the Institution of <persRef
								ref="stcatherineofalexandria">S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Catherine</persRef> last year; and chiefly if not altogether by the
							same Masters— The music, especially the singing I thought better now
							than then—the dancing, and the works of art, not so good— The Geometry,
							Physics, Literature and Languages much the same—lessons learnt by heart,
							and generally well repeated— All spoke French well, and with evident
							facility— Several compositions were distributed, of which I received
							three; two of them however by the same person—one a <hi
								rend="strikethrough">friendly</hi> letter to a friend, with topics
							of consolation upon the loss of an Aunt, and her Fortune—one a
							sentimental eulogy of Benevolence—and one a short argument upon the
							existence of deity, founded on the visible things of Creation— The
							hand-writing very good, and entirely formed— The style correct and
							easy—they are in the French language— The number of young Ladies who
							quit the school and whose names were on the Programme of the exhibition
							was 104.— There is also a certain number of <hi rend="italic"
								>demoiselles Bourgeoises</hi>, that is not of noble families,
							educated at this same Seminary; but their examination is to be
							to-morrow, and the foreign Ministers are not invited to attend it— They
							are educated nearly in the same manner, with the omission of Logic,
							Geometry and experimental philosophy— It was observed now as well as
							last year, that there were very few handsome girls among them, and
								<persRef ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t:</hi> Julien</persRef> next to whom I sat remarked that they
							had all ignoble <pb n="352" type="ms"/>countenances— But he said there
							was no nobility in this Country— That as the Government was a mere
							despotism, every man was all or nothing as the Sovereign smiled or
							frowned— Birth was nothing.— But as he came from the Court of Vienna,
							where Birth was in high estimation, it was natural for him to entertain
							different opinions— This produced a Conversation between us, upon noble
							blood and noble faces, in which I did not much indulge the noble Maltese
							Commandeur’s pride of Birth; and in which he indulged himself with it to
							his own satisfaction; acknowledging at last that there was too much
							truth in the reasons which I assigned to him, for not thinking that the
							alliance between noble blood and noble countenances was universal or
							even general, in any part of Europe— There were some Cabardinians,
							Tartars, there in the dresses of their Country, two with large white
							turbans, and the rest with sharp pointed velvet caps, like those in
							Chinese pictures—Georgians, Circassians, Mingrelians, Turks, and so
							forth as usual— <persRef ref="watzdorf-carl">General Watzdorf</persRef>
							soon retired, it being his Post-day— On returning home I found <persRef

								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>

							General of the Jesuits <persRef ref="brzozowksi-tadeusz"
								>Brzozowsky</persRef>, to deliver him a letter I had received for
							him from New-York—from one of the fathers he sent out last Summer— I
							found the old father reading his Breviary, and he made me excuses for
							asking me to wait untill he had finished; which he did in a few minutes.
							I told him that <persRef ref="malou-peter">father Malou</persRef> who
							inclosed to me the letter for him had also written to me, mentioning
							that they had commenced a school, but were in great want of more
							teachers— The General answered that he could not supply them— That from
							all quarters he was called upon for fathers, and had none to spare— The
							Ecclesiastical life was now pursued by very few persons; the military
							Career was the only one in favour— He spoke to me about Waldstein;
							saying he had heard I had been robbed by a servant; and asked if he was
							a Russian. I said a Livonian. Ah! said he, and so a Lutheran!— But
							observing I suppose that I was not pleased with the remark, by my looks,
							he added that it would have given him great pain if he had been a
							Catholic; because those who were Catholics ought to prove themselves
							worthy of their religion— It was evident however that the old man thinks
							a man’s being a protestant is a solution for every enormity committed by
							him— Madame de Bray the other day attributed it all to <persRef ref="u"

						<p><date>12. </date>The <persRef ref="brancia-francesco">Chevalier
								Brancia</persRef> called upon me this morning, and read to me all
							the official Correspondence that has passed both at Naples, and here
							respecting the duel between <persRef ref="u">Prince Dolgorucki</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="durantdemareuil-joseph">Baron Durand</persRef>, the
							Russian and French Ministers at Naples; and he told me what he had done
							here on the occasion— It was at the Diplomatic Circle, on New-Year’s
							day— The Neapolitan Minister of foreign Affairs relates the transaction
							in an instruction to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brancia— That on the
							new year’s day, when the Corps Diplomatique was passing from the Salle
							des Ambassadeurs to the Salle du Trone, preceded by the Maitre des
							Ceremonies Prince Dolgorucki and Baron Durand were going first, side by
							side, and the Prince having the right hand, when they came to the door
							of the Salle du Trone, before the Grand Maitre des Ceremonies had taken
							the king (<persRef ref="joachim-i">Murat</persRef>)’s orders to
							introduce them, and before the door-keeper had opened the door, the
							Prince pushed it open and entered, which Baron Durand attempting to
							prevent, the Prince in presence of the king, struggled to keep his
							place, and laid his hand upon his sword—he maintained his place— The
							king had presence of mind to avoid manifesting his indignation at this
							indecent scene, but addressing both the Ministers said that he could
							only ascribe what had pass’d to their eagerness, each to be the first to
							present his felicitations to him; and then conversed with them both on
							other topics; but as soon as the levee was over, he expressed his
							displeasure in the most energetic manner, and directed depositions to be
							taken, and enquiries of the other members of the diplomatic Corps who
							had been present, to be made, concerning the facts, and finding them
							attested to be as above stated, although he had on all other occasions
							been perfectly satisfied with the conduct of Prince Dolgorucki, he could
							not overlook a proceeding so offensive, and had forbidden Prince
							Dolgorucki’s appearance at Court, untill the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor’s</persRef> orders could be taken—the latter then
							instructed Brancia, to demand the Prince’s recall— He omitted reading
							the instructions— With it were enclosed the depositions to the facts,
							and the Correspondence between the Neapolitan Minister of foreign
							Affairs and Prince Dolgorucki on the subject— The former stating to the
							Prince, the king’s displeasure at the scene that had taken place,
							observing that if the king had not assigned to the foreign Ministers
							their respective ranks of precedence, that he had a right to treat as a
							family representative the Minister of his august brother the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor of the French</persRef>, and that
							he could not but express his resentment at an insult offered to him—
							That the king therefore had determined to demand of the Emperor the
							Prince’s recall, and in the mean time had directed the Minister to
							signify to the Prince that it would be proper to abstain from attendance
							at Court— The Prince in his answer expresses his great regret that the
							king should have taken displeasure at any thing in his conduct. Says
							that he was bound not to submit to any pretension of precedence by the
							French Minister; and appeals to the express letter of an Article in the
							Treaty of Tilsit stipulating the most perfect reciprocity between the
							two powers— That he, the Prince having been at the right hand, and
							having on a former occasion declared his intention to take his
							precedence of the French Minister in turn, had advanced up to the door
							of the Hall, when the French Minister had thrown himself in his way,
							attempted to seize the handle of the door-latch, and to stop his
							passage, saying Ah! pour cela—cela ne sera pas— That he therefore was
							the cause of the struggle, in which the Prince necessarily was drawn to
							keep his place, and that if he had laid his hand upon his sword it was
							merely to disengage it from between his legs— That as to precedence on
							the principle of family representation it was allowable only to
							Ambassadors, and could not be pretended to by Ministers of the second
							order.— On receiving these papers, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brancia requested an interview with <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai"
								>Count Romanzoff</persRef>; which he deferred one day later than
							usual, and in the mean time received a Courier from Naples, with Prince
							Dolgorucki’s own account of the transaction— On this he sent M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brancia, a Note, before the Conference;
							stating that the Emperor had learnt with much concern the dispute which
							had happened between Prince Dolgorucki, and the French Minister at
							Naples; and regretted that the king of Naples had thought proper,
							instead of simply asking his recall, to forbid his appearance at Court—
							That the Emperor might have used <hi rend="italic">reprizals</hi>, but
							that consulting only his magnanimity and his amicable dispositions
							towards the king of the two Sicilies, he had resolved to continue his
							friendly relations with him as heretofore; and he the Count was ordered
							to declare to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brancia, that he should
							continue to be received and treated at Court as he had been heretofore,
							and as if the unfortunate occurrences at Naples had never happened— When
							the interview took place, Brancia found Count Romanzoff, still dwelling
							upon Prince Dolgorucki’s exclusion from the Neapolitan Court, and
							expressing himself concerning it with some ill humour— He thought <pb
								n="354" type="ms"/>it therefore necessary to answer the Count’s
							Note, stating to him that it was not on account of the duel, (the Count
							had spoken of that, as the occasion of what had happened) but of the
							outrage committed in the king’s presence, that the measure had been
							taken, of interdicting the Court to Prince Dolgorucki—and quoting a
							passage from <persRef ref="vattel-emer">Vattel</persRef>, as authority
							for interdicting the Court to an offending foreign Minister, or even
							ordering him away from the Country— After this Count Romanzoff sent for
							Brancia again; and told him that his Note had been laid before the
							Emperor, who had weighed the observations contained in it, and
							recognizing that there was solidity in them, he had given orders that
							Prince Dolgorucki should be recalled, and had appointed <persRef
								ref="vonbudberg-andreas">Baron Budberg</persRef>, to reside at
							Naples, in his stead; as Chargé d’Affaires.—and thus this matter is
							terminated— The duels were both subsequent to the interdiction of the
							Court, to Prince Dolgorucki— The day afterwards, Baron Durand sent
							Prince Dolgorucki a challenge— The Prince answered him that while
							invested with a diplomatic character, he did not think it proper to
							fight—but that he had already written home offering his resignation to
							the Emperor, which he had no doubt would be accepted, when he should
							readily meet the Baron— The Baron replied, that the Prince’s excuse for
							not fighting was not sufficient—that as they were <hi rend="italic"
								>both</hi> diplomatic characters, that circumstance took away the
							impropriety of a meeting between them in single combat, upon which he
							again insisted— The prince then yielded—they fought, and were both
							slightly wounded— A French General there at the time, likewise sent a
							challenge to Prince Dolgorucki; to which <persRef
								ref="beckendorff-konstantin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Benkendorf</persRef> the Secretary of the Russian Legation answered,
							that Prince Dolgorucki could not be expected to fight all the Frenchmen
							at Naples—but if the General was very desirous of a duel; he Benkendorf
							was ready to meet him in the Prince’s stead— They fought accordingly,
							and they too were both wounded— The two duels were on the same day—
							Benkendorf has since had the order of <persRef ref="vladimir">S<hi
									rend="superscript">t:</hi> Wladimir</persRef> conferred upon him
							by the Emperor— I intended to have written this day to <persRef
								ref="engstrom-lars">Baron Engeström</persRef>, but spent the day
							idly— In the Evening I was unwell.— By idleness I understand trifling
							with researches of weights and measures.</p>

					<div type="docbody">
						<p><date>13. </date>This morning I finished the perusal of the German Bible,
							which I began 20. June last— There are many differences of translation
							from either the English or the French Translations— Some of which I have
							compared in the three versions— Many passages obscure and even
							unintelligible to me in the English are clear in the French and German—
							Of the three, the German I think has the fewest of these obscurities—
							But the eloquence of <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
								Paul</persRef> strikes me as more elevated and sublime in the
							English than in either of the others. In the German New Testament there
							is a transposition in the arrangement of the Books— The Epistle to the
							Hebrews being separated from the rest of S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
							Paul’s, and placed after those of <persRef ref="peter">Peter</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="john">John</persRef>— There is a difficulty which
							obviously often embarrassed all the Translators; it was how to render
							the significant proper names which abound in the Bible— For instance in
							the text where <persRef ref="adam">Adam</persRef> says in the English Bible that <persRef ref="eve"
								>Eve</persRef> “shall be called <hi rend="italic">Woman</hi>,
							because she was taken out of man” the name does not correspond with the
							reason assigned for giving it— II. Gen. 23.— The French Bible has it “on
							la nommera <hi rend="italic">Hommesse</hi>, car elle a été prise de
							l’homme”— The name and the reason here correspond, but <hi rend="italic"
								>hommesse</hi> is not the french word for woman—there is no such
							word in the language—the German Bible resorts to the same expedient of
							coining a word, and says she shall be called <hi rend="italic"
								>Männin</hi> if the English translators had taken the same liberty
							they would have called her <hi rend="italic">Manness</hi>— In
							expressions of this sort the English Translators whenever they can
							retain the very Hebrew word; and sometimes they give as proper names,
							words which the other translators render as things— The more I read the
							Bible the more I feel that it ought to be accompanied with critical and
							explanatory Notes— There are Commentators and Expositors enough; but
							they are too voluminous; and almost universally sectaries: whose labours
							are devoted not to explanation but to controversy— The German Bible has
							one very useful kind of annotation. It is that after every verse
							throughout the Book, all the other verses having reference to it are
							marked down— This is peculiarly convenient for consulting the mutual
							references between the Old and New Testament—the Prophecies and their
							fulfilment— The German New Testament also besides the division of the
							Books into Chapters marks the festivals at which particular Epistles and
							Gospels are to be read; at the passages themselves. There is at the
							commencement both of the French and German Bibles an excellent discourse
							upon the manner and dispositions in which the Scriptures should be
							read—that of the German Bible is the best.— <persRef ref="montreal-f"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Montreal</persRef> paid me a
							morning visit— The <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
								>Ladies</persRef> spent the Evening at <persRef ref="colombi-maria"
								>Madam Colombi’s</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> was left with me.— I find it difficult to employ
							his time, and when with me he entirely engrosses mine— I endeavour to
							amuse him, and at the same time to convey instruction to his mind
							through the medium of every thing that happens— But it is not always
							easy to discriminate between the knowledge suitable to his age, and the
							solid nourishment of maturer years— He often asks questions, which it is
							impossible to answer to his understanding; as do all children of good
							natural parts— My rule is, to answer them always truly; and as I should
							to a grown person; explaining what I can make him understand, but freely
							using terms which I know he cannot, when they are necessary to the
							definition— If he does not <pb n="355" type="ms"/>take the whole idea,
							he usually gets part of it, and seldom pushes the enquiry any further. I
							believe that all complex ideas must be thus acquired by parts at a time;
							and that they can only be completed, by the frequent repetition of their
							recurrence— By giving however some of these fragments, much beyond the
							comprehension of a Child, they are apt to associate themselves in his
							mind with the ideas which are lodged there, and the combination produces
							absurdities which may be liable to run eventually into errors of
							judgment or paradoxical opinions— <persRef ref="socrates"
								>Socrates</persRef> says in one of <persRef ref="plato"
								>Plato’s</persRef> dialogues, that he is only a midwife to the minds
							of his disciples— This Talent is perhaps the most essential of all that
							can contribute to form an accomplished teacher— How much I would wish to
							possess it— I give Charles a large portion of my Time; and I would fain
							have it prove profitable to him— He had the whole of this Evening.</p>

								Strugowtshikoff</persRef> my landlord called upon me this morning—
							He is a Russian of the Class of Society between the principal nobility
							and the mere common People—a Class by no means numerous in this Country;
							and of which he is in truth the only one I know; for the <persRef
								ref="glukoff-martin2;glukoff-alexander">Glukoff’s</persRef>, are in
							some respects above, and in others below it— This man speaks French and
							German, well but with difficulty— And he inclines to talk with
							considerable freedom about public affairs— I paid him half a year’s rent
							in advance, and he told me that in a few days he should have to pay
							almost the whole of it as a tax, to the <hi rend="italic">City</hi>. The
							House was rated at 110000 Rubles, and taxed at 1 per Cent on that sum,
							and he had to pay both for the last year and the present, with six per
							Cent interest upon the last years payment— The tax had formerly been
							only 1/2 per Cent, and payment might be delayed for years, incurring
							only the interest of 6 per Cent for the delay— Now the tax was doubled,
							and payment was to be enforced on the penalty of confiscation— He also
							complained that the Brandy-farmers cheated the people, by selling them
							Water instead of Spirits— I asked him if there was no inspection— He
							said yes; but the inspectors were bribed— That the system of bribery was
							graduated from the highest to the lowest officers, and the poor People,
							were the victims of them all.— I took <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> out with me to the Gachellies, upon the river—
							They are the same that are exhibited at Easter time on the Isaac Square—
							The tight-rope dancers— Chinese Shadows and Transparent Arabian
							fire-works— Charles, who was frightened at them last Easter-week so that
							I was obliged to send him home, was now so much pleased with them that
							he urged strongly to see the fourth— But they had not opened their door
							for entrance, and it was drawing towards five O’Clock. I had engaged
							company to dinner, and was obliged to come home— The ice-hills, opposite
							the fortress were very much thronged— Those below the winter-Bridge, not
							so much— The procession of sledges round the corner of the Palace, was
							longer than I had seen it before.— We walked home— <persRef

								>Charles</persRef> before dinner.— It was the last day of the
							Russian Butter-week, when they partly fast, and partly frolic—when
							Mascarades and Plays follow in succession from nine in the morning till
							Midnight. I saw little of it, the procession of sledges not having
							commenced when we rode out— <persRef ref="plumer-ernestus">M<hi

								Cutts</persRef> again from Archangel paid me a morning visit.— I
							read Sermons 8 and 9. Vol. 5. of the English Preacher— On the frailty of
							human Nature; and on Self-Government— Also several chapters in <persRef
								ref="watts-isaac">Watts’s</persRef> improvement of the mind— A book
							so highly commended by <persRef ref="johnson-samuel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson</persRef>, and which I have
							been at least seventeen years intending to read, whenever I could find
							time— From the part of it which I this day read, I think it will fully
							answer my expectations— The style is agreeable, and sufficiently
							ornamented; with a frequent introduction of fictitious characters to
							illustrate observations upon faults and vices, which give the work a
							sort of dramatic effect— The language is sometimes incorrect; but the
							author never completed his plan, and the second part of the Book is a
							posthumous publication— I should have mentioned yesterday that I began
							the second reading of the French Bible, with <persRef
								ref="osterwald-jean">Ostervald’s</persRef> reflections after each
							chapter— Some of these reflections are just and as hints for
							improvement, may be useful— But they scarcely ever explain any thing,
							and sometimes to guard against irreverend inferences they are not
							altogether consistent with truth— They speak for instance of the <hi
								rend="italic">marriage</hi> of <persRef ref="abraham"
								>Abraham</persRef> with <persRef ref="hagar">Hagar</persRef>; though
							afterwards they call <persRef ref="keturah">Keturah</persRef> Abraham’s

							and minute accuracy with which every thing is described, but the
							grandeur and sublimity of imagination, (if that word may be used) in the
							whole design— The profound impression of reverence and solemnity in the
							sacredness of the recess where the ark of the Covenant was to be
							deposited— The incitements to love as well as to adore the Creator, in
							the idea of placing the Mercy-Seat upon the ark— The attachment of the
							Nation to the Ministers of their Sanctuary and of the Priesthood to the
							Nation, inculcated by the precious stones engraved with the names of
							each of the twelve tribes of Israel, which he wore upon his shoulders,
							and in the Ephod upon his breast— The inscription Holiness to the Lord,
							on the front of his Mitre, and the <hi rend="italic">Urim</hi> and <hi

							/>seems to me calculated to take a stronger hold of human affections,
							and human reason than the whole system of Greek mythology, put

							Zareth or Span—the Hin, and the Shekel of the Sanctuary, a measure of
							length, a measure of liquids, a weight and a Coin—besides a tenth <hi
								rend="italic">deal</hi> of flour— I recurred to <persRef
								ref="paucton-alexis">Paucton</persRef>, who discusses all these

							was nearly 1 1/2 Gallon English wine-measure, and he says the Jewish

							expressly quotes Rabbi <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef> upon 29.
							Exodus for this. The <hi rend="italic">log</hi> he states at 0.4704
							Paris Quarts—which is 27.444. Cubic inches, 1 1/2 Cubic inches short of
							an English pint.— But either the Egg-shells must have been conventional
							egg-shells, or the hens of Palestine must have laid larger eggs than
							those of Russia, or the estimate is too large— I made the experiment
							with an Egg shell this morning, and found it to contain <unclear>2 7/18</unclear> Cubic
							inches of Water. it would take therefore nine of them at least for the
							log, and 108. for the hin if they were of the capacity in Paris Quarts,
							(Pintes) mentioned by Paucton.— I also read the Sermons 12. and 13. Vol.

						<p><date>31. </date>At 9 O’Clock this morning <persRef

								Smith</persRef> went with me to attend the funeral of the late
								<persRef ref="dolgoroucky-basile">Prince Dolgorucki</persRef>. We
							first proceeded to the house, and thence went in procession to the
							Monastery of <persRef ref="nevsky-alexander">S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t:</hi> Alexander Newsky</persRef>— The funeral service was
							performed by the <persRef ref="podobedov-amvrosy">Metropolitan
								Ambrose</persRef>, and resembled in every respect that for <persRef
								ref="beloselsky-alexander">Prince Beloselsky</persRef>— The only
							part of the ceremony that I now observed, and which had before escaped
							my attention was that just before the closing of the Coffin, the
							Metropolitan threw a small spoonful of dust into it— This is also the
							usage at interments according to the forms of the English Church— The
							Snow was so deep in the burying-yard, that the body was not carried out
							to it, but deposited in a chapel adjoining that where the ceremony was
							performed. It was about 2. O’Clock when we got home— I soon afterwards
							went out again, and paid a visit to <persRef ref="kozlovsky-peter"
								>Prince Kosloffsky</persRef>— Called likewise at the <persRef
								ref="law-jacques">French Ambassador’s</persRef>, and at <persRef
								ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Julien’s</persRef>, to get their endorsements on the Passports of
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ecky</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="woodward-c2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Woodward</persRef>; but neither of them was at home.— I then walked
							untill nearly dinner time— <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> absorbed the Evening.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>—</date> The distribution of my time remains in
							general like that of the preceding Months— I rise about seven O’Clock—
							Read five Chapters in the Bible, and walk an hour and a half— Breakfast
							between ten and eleven— From which time untill five, our dining hour, my
							purpose is to do the business of the day— But the family concerns,
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> lessons, visits to
							receive or pay, newspapers, idleness and procrastination fill it up so
							constantly that it terminates in doing Nothing— The Evening has become
							equally barren of all profitable employment— I spend it in endeavouring
							to amuse and instruct Charles.</p>
