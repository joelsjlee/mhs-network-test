								Montréal</persRef> came to see me this morning, and told me that
								<persRef ref="woodward-c2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Woodward</persRef> was again very ill with a fever— I had a visit
							also from <persRef ref="jenison-franz">Count Jenison-Walworth</persRef>
							the Bavarian Chargé d’Affairs, one of those who depart with the <persRef
								ref="law-jacques">French Ambassador</persRef>— He told me that he
							and his family had lost their whole fortune, by placing it in public
							National funds— It had been partly in the French funds, annihilated by
							the French Revolution—partly in Austrian funds, which the Austrian
							Government had now nearly reduced to nothing at-all; and finally, the
							rest in a Swedish loan in Holland, of which for the last three years no
							interest had been paid, and which now the Swedish Government had
							declared they would not pay, on account of their quarrel with France—
								<persRef ref="u">Count Frohberg</persRef> had told me much the same
							thing of himself— He was an Alsacian, and had been a page of <persRef
								ref="louis-xvi">Louis 16</persRef>. <persRef ref="u">His
								father</persRef> emigrated, and all his Estates were confiscated— He
							then had entered the Austrian service, and had served in it more than
							ten years— In 1803. He obtained admission into the Teutonic Order, and
							soon afterwards a Commandery in it. He is now a subject of Wurtemburg— I
							dined with the <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;smith-catherine-johnson"
								>Ladies</persRef> at the French Ambassadors.— <persRef
								ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Julien</persRef>, <persRef ref="vonblome-otto">Baron
							Blome</persRef>, <persRef ref="bussche-calmor">Counts Bussche</persRef>
							and Frohberg, Barons <persRef ref="vongremp-anton">Gremp</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="mareschal-wenzel">Maréchal</persRef>, and the <persRef
								ref="brancia-francesco">Chevalier Brancia</persRef>, were there—
							They are all going except Blome, who told me that he did not know
							whether he should finally go or stay— Probably the course of Denmark
							would depend upon that of Sweden, which was not yet definitively
							settled— <persRef ref="u">Signeul the Swedish Consul at Paris</persRef>
							had carried the last Propositions from France to Sweden, inviting the
							Alliance— That offer was, Finland to the Neva—seven Millions of franks
							in cash to equip a Corps of 25000 men, and one Million monthly to
							maintain them. This offer had been rejected by Sweden. She insisted upon
							neutrality.— But at the same time <persRef ref="lowenhielm-gustaf"
								>Löwenhielm</persRef> here had been pushing to the utmost for War,
							and Sweden had been urging England for a joint invasion of the island of
							Sealand, which England had not yet consented to, and probably would not—
							Perhaps Sweden might be allowed to remain neutral; and in that case
							Denmark would be so too.— After returning home we paid a visit at the
								<persRef ref="bezerra-joao">Chevalier Bezerra’s</persRef>; but
							neither he nor <persRef ref="u">his Lady</persRef> was at home— We rode
							out to Kammenoi-Ostrof; and I walked from the Summer Garden home.

							between them— I told him I regretted it also exceedingly, and that the
							American Government had been brought to it with extreme reluctance—but I
							now saw no reason to hope it could be averted. He mentioned the
							formation of the new Ministry in England, and spoke in very favourable

								<persRef ref="vansittart-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Perceval</persRef>, and that it was
							greatly to be lamented that <persRef ref="wellesley-richard">Lord
								Wellesley</persRef> had not joined them— I called at the (late)
								<persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">Ambassador’s</persRef>— He told
							me he had this time for the third time written to demand his Passports—
							Perhaps they thought it a point of etiquette as <persRef ref="kurakin-aleksandri">Prince
								Kurakin</persRef> had three times asked for his, to make him do the
							same thing— So he had done it. But the difference was that the Prince’s
							demands were before a declaration of War, and his own now, were after
							it— He had also written to <persRef ref="saltykov-aleksandr">Count
								Soltykoff</persRef> requesting him to send some person to receive
							the house in the City, and the Country-Seat at Kammenoi-Ostrof (both of
							which were provided by the Emperor Alexander) The Count had answered
							that he would see to this; but had received no Instructions upon the
							subject— The Ambassador said if he was to be detained, he should take
							lodgings at the Hotel du Nord— He made some remarks upon the publication
							concerning the War in yesterday’s Gazette, and still considered the
							positions of the Russian armies as dangerous and very much exposed— But
							he did not exactly account for the five days, lost by the French after
							their passage of the river, without attacking any of the Russian Corps—
							He said that in the positions stated by the publication, the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor Napoleon</persRef>, wherever he
							might chuse to attack would have two men to one. He said too that there
							was not upon Earth a General so particular in making his arrangements
							for the contingency of a defeat— That whenever he went into Battle, you
							would suppose he reckoned upon nothing but being beaten— His retreat is
							always secure— He said he saw the plan of the Russians— Their point of
							defence was a chain of mountains— But those mountains were not
							insuperable, and to take them they were obliged to abandon all Courland—
							I paid a visit at <persRef ref="u">Count Frohberg’s</persRef> lodgings
							but he was not at home— Called at <persRef ref="woodward-c2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodward’s</persRef>— He has had a new
							and violent attack of a fever, but is again better.— I settled with him
							a matter in which <persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> was concerned— After I
							came home I had a visit from <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hall</persRef>, and <persRef ref="willing-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> R. Willing</persRef>— In the Evening I

						<p><date>9. </date>A Sailor from the crew of the Monticello, named <persRef
								ref="drew-charles">Charles Drew</persRef> came to me again this
							morning, complaining that he had not yet received any part of his wages;
							and that <persRef ref="sparrow-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sparrow</persRef> now refused to pay him any— Sparrow wrote me five
							days ago that he had entirely settled with the whole crew— The further
							this affair proceeds the worse it looks. I called upon <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>
							and shewed him Sparrow’s letter, at the same time telling him that Drew
							still insisted that he had received nothing, and that only one man of
							the crew had really been paid— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris
							shewed me an Account sent him by Sparrow, stating a payment of nearly
							three thousand Rubles, to these men of the Monticello, for which he says
							he had taken receipts on stamped paper, and charging Drew, by name with
							341 Rubles 46 Copeeks of this Money— I took this Account home with me
							and shewed it to Drew. The fellow’s astonishment and indignation were
							inexpressible— He solemnly protested and swore that he had not received
							a Copeek, and he indulged himself in reflections upon Sparrow and
							Harris, natural enough upon such an occasion, and which though I did not
							encourage them, I could not blame— Drew says that Sparrow promised him
							and the rest of the crew, to pay them, but insisted that they should
							first ship in vessels bound home— That he Drew, has ship’d accordingly
							in a vessel bound to New-York, which is to sail in two or three days,
							and that if he does not get paid he shall lose this chance, and the time
							that he has already worked on board of her— But Sparrow now refuses the
							payment, saying he had <hi rend="italic">new Orders</hi> from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris— From Harris’s Conversation with
							me, I saw evidently enough that since his written promise to me, and the
							consequent orders he had given to Sparrow, he has really shrunk from his
							engagement, and limited again Sparrow’s payments— Drew says that he came
							up here without Sparrow’s knowledge and that Sparrow has repeatedly
							attempted to prevent him from coming up— Harris avowed to me in the
							dispute we had on that subject, that he did once give Sparrow orders to
							that effect— To prevent these People from troubling him and me any more,
							with their Complaints— By the Laws here, the Captains are personally
							responsible for the wages of the Seaman, and the foreign Consuls have
							the summary power of immediately confining them when they refused
							payment— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris when first called <pb
								n="394" type="ms"/>upon by the men, says that he forbore to arrest
								<persRef ref="u">Captain Saul</persRef>, solely at the request of
								<persRef ref="cayley-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cayley</persRef> an English Merchant, the Agent or Factor of Saul or
							his owners— And now Saul is sick, and like to die; and he cannot confine
							him— I told him that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cayley, by
							requesting him to suspend the exercise of his Official duties, in which
							the interests of individuals were involved, had made himself, as a
							Gentleman, in my opinion responsible to him for all the demands, which
							he had at that request forborne to enforce— And that he himself by the
							indulgence to Saul, I thought had made himself answerable for the
							payment of the men’s wages— The whole of this transaction has an aspect
							which I find it difficult to look at with patience— Drew is only a
							common Sailor; but he has an intelligence above his condition, and a
							stubborn perseverance in the pursuit of his right which has been very
							thoroughly tried, and without which he certainly would have been
							deprived of it.— I paid a visit to <persRef ref="saintjulien-johann"
								>Count S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Julien</persRef>; who was at
							home; but sent me an apology for not receiving me. I called on <persRef
								ref="law-jacques">Count Lauriston</persRef>, at the Hotel du Nord,
							where he has a good suite of Apartments— I met <persRef
								ref="bussche-calmor">Count Bussche</persRef> there— The Ambassador
							said he had applied to <persRef ref="saltykov-aleksandr">Count
								Soltykoff</persRef> to be informed whether he was to consider
							himself detained as a hostage or as a prisoner— Count Soltykoff had told
							him that he was perfectly innocent— That he received himself no answers
							from Head Quarters, not only on this but on any subject.— Talking of the
							War, Bussche said he had been yesterday to purchase some fusees to make
							sport for his children— That he had seen a very large board painted with
							a Fame and Trumpets, and many Military trophies, as a transparency for
							an illumination— He asked what it was, and was told it had been ordered
							by the <persRef ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress-Mother</persRef>— Ay! said
							the Ambassador!—they prepare for illumination before hand— I know they
							will illuminate, let the Event be what it will— But I shall look the
							next day after upon the map, to see where the Head-Quarters are; and

								>Emperor</persRef> had judged it suitable that they should embark
							and depart by Sea, for which purpose a public ship would be provided for
							them; to land them at such Port as they should fix upon— And that they
							should be furnished with accommodations at the Palace of Oranienbaum,
							from whence they might embark.— Brancia was deeply exasperated at this
							treatment, and said he had written to Count Soltykoff, expressing his
							surprize at it, and demanding a guarantee from the Emperor that he shall
							not be taken upon his passage by the English, with whom his Sovereign is
							at War— The Ambassador told me he had done the same thing.— I asked him
							what they had done with regard to <persRef ref="derayneval-maximilien"

							that his Majesty the Emperor having <hi rend="italic">disapproved</hi>
							his having given a Courier’s Passport to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Rayneval, he did not know what to say, respecting him.— They will
							probably not in fact be molested by any English ship of War; but the

							Maritime Principles, their protection will depend altogether upon the
							English Captain’s Discretion and forbearance.</p>

								Hillard</persRef> this morning; the Captain was much dissatisfied
							that I refused to lend my aid officially to deceive the Russian
							Government, and prevail upon them to deliver up a ship seized for a
							breach of their laws and liable to confiscation— The case stands thus
							upon the Papers sent me by <persRef ref="hazard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hazard</persRef> with the request for
							my interposition— In September 1809. <persRef ref="thomas-john4">John
								Thomas</persRef> a merchant of Baltimore, made over to one <persRef ref="u">Worthy</persRef>,
							of Liverpool in Great-Britain a ship called the Thomas, owned by him,
							and a Sea-letter ship.— But instead of giving Worthy a Bill of Sale, he
							gives him a power of Attorney <hi rend="italic">irrevocable</hi> to
							dispose of her, and makes Worthy Supercargo— The ship goes then to
							Madeira, and returns to New-York in January 1810— In February she sails,
							for Archangel, taking S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Michael’s and
							Madeira in her way— Worthy purchases at New-York, of <persRef
								ref="talcott-noah">Noah Talcott</persRef>, a Cargo, as the Agent,
							and as for account of John Thomas, but pays Talcott, by bills of
							Exchange upon the House of <persRef ref="u">M’Surr</persRef>, M’<space/>and
								<persRef ref="u">M’Corksdale</persRef> of Liverpool. Worthy comes
							from New-York to Archangel, as Supercargo, and with a Passport, as a
							Citizen of the United States, (real or forged in the name of <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt Clinton</persRef>, Mayor of New-York)
							The Ship enters at Archangel, as an American in the name of John Thomas,
							with Worthy, as a Citizen of the United States, for her Supercargo— She
							was admitted as an American; sold her Cargo; took in a Cargo as if to
							return and sailed in the Autumn of 1810. But being driven back by the
							weather, wintered in Archangel; and before she could sail in 1811— was
							seized, by the Russian Government, upon information lodged by a Sailor
							that the property and the Voyage, was really for account of the House in
							Liverpool, and that the ship was bound thither from Archangel, and not
							to New-York. While the ship was under seizure, Worthy’s bills in favour
							of Talcott were returned from Liverpool to New-York, protested— Talcott
							sent to Archangel, and got the ship mortgaged to him by Worthy, for
							security, and afterwards got a Bill of sale of her in form from John
							Thomas at Baltimore— And now sends out Captain Hillard, with a Crew, on
							the expectation of having her restored, to take charge of her, and carry
							her to New-York— <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Harris</persRef> had pursued the claim of this ship last
							Summer, and now continued it, considering the property, and Worthy
							himself as american—and he had also claimed very heavy damages for her
							detention— But the Commission for neutral Navigation, not manifesting a
							disposition to restore the ship; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hazard
							wrote to me and sent me the papers with a suggestion that nothing but my
							interference could get the ship released this year— On the face of the
							papers Worthy appeared in the double capacity of a British Subject,
							owner of the ship, and of an American Citizen, Supercargo, for John
							Thomas— There was a notarial declaration and Certificate that Talcott
							was a native American, and the same of John Thomas, with his Declaration
							that he was heretofore sole owner of the ship, and that she sailed with
							a Certificate in lieu of Register in 1809. The papers all concurred to
							shew that the property and the Voyage were on British Account, and that
							John Thomas gave only the cover of his name— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Harris shewed me the sentence of the Commission of Neutral
							Navigation here by which it appears that since the seizure both Worthy
							and the Captain ran away from Archangel, and that among Worthy’s papers
							were found letters to him from his wife and from the House at Liverpool,
							proving their interest in this ship and in another, which Worthy
							dispatched from Archangel, under American Colours— I declined
							interfering at all in the Case; and have received three letters from
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hazard, on the subject.— The Captain
							asked me to give my refusal, in writing—which I told him I had already
							done to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hazard— He said too that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris told him, that if he had not
							applied to me, he would before this have had the ship— He complained
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hazard had been three Post-days,
							without receiving my answer to his first letter— He gave another example
							of what I have before more than once remarked, that men who ask
							dishonest favours are apt to be insolent upon finding them refused— I
							gave him the papers on his promise to be answerable for them, and on
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisher’s answering for him— And I
							dismissed him with little Ceremony.— <persRef ref="u">Count
								Frohberg</persRef> called, and took leave. I gave him at his request
							a receipt for the packet he has deposited with me— In the Evening we
							rode out six Wersts on the Moscow road, and on returning, I walked about
							seven, home.</p>

						<p><date>29. </date><persRef ref="u">Captain Phelps</persRef> was here again
							this morning, on the business of his Cargo, which is not admitted for
							want of Certificates of origin, executed by Russian Consuls— I promised
							him to speak concerning it to <persRef ref="gurieff-dmitri">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gourieff</persRef>, the Minister of
							Commerce, which I accordingly did— I called on him by appointment at One
							O’Clock— Stated to him the Circumstances under which the ship Maria
							Theresa, had arrived— The difficulty with regard to the admission of her
							Cargo; and the importance to the parties interested that it should be
							decided upon as speedily as possible—the goods being already damaged,
							and daily perishing— He took the name of the ship; and promised
							immediate attention to it. I mentioned again the complaint and
							application from <persRef ref="hazard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hazard</persRef>, the American Consul at Archangel. He
							said he had already dispatched orders to the Custom-House there, to use
							the utmost expedition in the examination of the Papers produced for
							Vessels under American Colours, and that immediately after the
							examination they should be returned to their Captains or persons
							producing them— This I suppose is all that can be necessary for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hazard, or that I can require. I spoke
							likewise of the wages due to the sailors of the vessels seized and
							confiscated for having come here, with forged American Papers,
							concerning which <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Harris</persRef> has made repeated applications to him—
							He said he had written to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris, that
							this was a matter of judicial resort to the tribunals, and not belonging
							to his Department— The Consul had however renewed his application, to
							which he should shortly send an answer— He had supposed at first that
							the Government might be willing to discharge from the forfeiture itself
							the wages due to the Seamen, but upon enquiry he found this was a thing
							that never had been asked for before— The vessel being seized and
							condemned as forfeited, it was impossible for the Government to assume
							upon itself the charges and expences which she had incurred in coming
							here, or the accounts and claims which might be brought against her. I
							said that the claims of the Sailors for their wages, were of a peculiar
							character— That by the maritime Law, which was part of the Law of
							Nations, the body of the ship was answerable for them— That they were in
							other Countries, in mine particularly in mine, and I presumed in this
							recoverable by a summary process, before the maritime or commercial
							tribunals— But that these seizures stood upon a different basis— They
							were ordered by a special Ordinance of the <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor</persRef>, and submitted to a special Commission appointed
							only for these cases— The remedy for the Sailors of resorting to the
							tribunals, was therefore taken from them; and when the Government seized
							the vessel to which they belonged, without having participated in the
							Offence for which she was taken, it seemed but just that the Government
							should take her charged with the debt due to them for wages, which was
							the easiest thing in the world to ascertain and adjust, and was by no
							means like a complicated account of expenses, which it <pb n="401"
								type="ms"/>might be found inconvenient to settle— He said he could
							only repeat that this was an affair out of his department. He would
							answer M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris’s last Note, and then the
							subject might still be liable to discussion diplomatically— For his
							part, he detested the whole thing; of seizure and confiscation— He
							wished it was entirely done away— But that was neither here nor there—
							So he found the law, and so he was bound to execute it— I observed that
							after learning the principle assumed by this Government, I was aware
							that my recourse was to another department; and that I had applied to
							him in this case only in consequence of the encouragement he had
							formerly given me, for such informal applications— He answered that he
							hoped I should continue to make them, whenever it might be in his power
							to serve me; and he should always be happy to prove to me as he had
							always wished to do, his disposition to accommodate my wishes. . . I
							asked him if the Peace with England was concluded?— He believed not— He
							was extremely anxious and impatient for it—for, said he, there can be no
							question now, but that we are at War with France, and having a common
							Enemy, it is highly desirable that we should have the benefit of
							co-operation— He said he was happy to see that the late measures in
							England, were of a tendency to remove the prospect of War, between that
							Country and the United States; in which sentiment I very cordially
							concurred.— On leaving him I called at the house of the <persRef
								ref="bray-francois">Chevalier de Bray</persRef>; but he was not at home—
							I then went and sat an hour with <persRef ref="bezerra-joao">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bezerra</persRef>, whom I found with a
							lame foot—a touch of Gout, for having stood so long on the stone floor
							of the Cazan Church— No Rose without a Thorn— I asked him about the
							dispatches sent by <persRef ref="zeabermudez-donfrancisco">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Zea</persRef>—he it seems left them at
							Stockholm; not then intending to go to England himself— This Resolution
							he first took at Orebro; but the packets were left and did not go,
							untill the next Courier passed through— His last Courier too it seems
							was a swindler who has taken up money, and attempted to get much more on
							account of being his Courier, though not authorized to draw for a
							shilling— He had and shewed me french translations of the Emperor’s
							proclamation, at Polotzk, and of that issued here by the Holy Synod.
							Both have some remarkable features— He said it was strange, the Peace
							with England was not made; and it was a proof there had been no previous
							Understanding between the parties— I told him I thought that must be
							understood with some qualification— He said it had been universally
							supposed by all parties, that he had been charged with overtures from
							the British Ministers— He supposed few people would even now believe
							him, if he denied it— But he solemnly gave me his word of honour, (which
							he repeated more than once) the British Ministry had never opened their
							lips to him about this Country— He had not been however in this Country
							a fortnight before he found there were persons who said this and that as
							from the British Ministers to this Government, and who found means of
							conveying this and that in return— But all irresponsibly; and he
							believed all without adequate authority on either side— Merely officious
							meddlers— I think it probable this was really all the intercourse,
							before the discussions at Stockholm; between <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Foster</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="suchtelen-jan">General Van Suchtelen</persRef>— He said he
							wondered the British Government had not a person here, as the Spaniards
							had Zea—with powers; and on the watch for the favourable moment. It was
							dangerous to lose so much time— We had much other conversation and upon
							various topics— Their dinner table was laid before I came home— A heavy
							thunder shower continuing at intervals from our dining hour untill near
							Midnight, detained us at home in the Evening. I had bathed and walked
							before Breakfast this morning. Had visits from <persRef
								ref="woodward-c2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodward</persRef>,
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris; who told me the Grand-Duke
							was gone to Moscow, at which the <persRef ref="mariafeodorovna">Empress
								Mother</persRef> was displeased— There was a perfect harmony between
							Generals <persRef ref="benningsen-levin">Bennigsen</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="barclay-michal">Barclai de Tolli</persRef>, and the
							Battle was hourly expected— The French were said to be at Smolensk, and
							the <persRef ref="joachim-i">king of Naples</persRef> had suddenly left
							the French army, to go and quell some disturbances in his own
							kingdom.</p>

							of Dorpat, of whom <persRef ref="krusentern-adam">Captain
								Krusenstern</persRef> had spoken to me, called on me this morning to
							make enquiries, respecting his purpose of going to America— His object
							would be, either to practice Law, or to go into some family as the Tutor
							of a Young Gentleman, finishing his Education— I mentioned to him the
							difficulties which he would probably encounter in both these pursuits—
							For the practice of the Law, the language— The Codes of the Country and
							forms of process different from those with which I supposed him
							acquainted; and the time which must pass before he could become a
							Citizen of the United States— There might be some means of obviating
							this last; examples of exception in favour of foreigners having
							occurred. For the project of becoming a Tutor, the manners of the
							Country— The Education of Children in the United States, partook of the
							nature of the Government— It was gregarious— In Schools, Academies,
							Colleges, and University— As the head of such an Institution, or a
							teacher connected with it, his prospect of success would be better than
							in that of obtaining a place of Governor to a single young man in a
							private family— He thanked me for the information, and for the opinions
							I had given him, which he saw were not encouraging to his object— He
							balanced he said between going to England or to America.— He should
							prefer the last if the prospects there should be equally favourable— He
							could yet stay here if he pleased; but his inclination was to go, and he
							had always wished to visit America— I told him if he finally concluded
							to go there, I would give him letters, and any other assistance in my
							power— <persRef ref="u">Captain Hillard</persRef> was here, for a
							Certificate upon his Passport which I gave him. After dinner we road out
							on the Wyburg Road and returned by Kammenoi-Ostrof— Walked with <persRef
								ref="smith-catherine-johnson">Catherine</persRef> &amp; <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> in the Botanic-Garden, and
							then home alone— I found <persRef ref="lewis-john">M<hi

								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell</persRef> at
