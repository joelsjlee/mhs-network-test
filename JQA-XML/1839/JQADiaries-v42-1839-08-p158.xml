                        <p>Fine cool, clear, almost autumnal day; such as by my experience always
                            comes at Washington City between the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
                            and 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of this month— I filled a flower
                            Pot 8. with fresh Earth, and sowed in it white strawberries, white
                            currants, and huckleberries. I have repeatedly made the experiment of
                            raising red and white strawberries and currants from the seed to
                            ascertain if they would reproduce each its own kind— I have raised
                            strawberries, and currants, but they have all proved red— The black
                            currant I know, reproduces itself— There is a perseverance of pursuit
                            directed to the same object in all experiments to raise plants, in which
                            I am lamentably deficient and from which I suffer continual
                            disappointment— I have never succeeded in raising huckleberries from the
                            seed— They grow wild upon low bushes among the rocks, but are never
                            cultivated in gardens—and the attempt to raise them is Shandean— I
                            finished my Letter to <persRef ref="smith-gerrit">Gerrit Smith</persRef>
                            and that was the labour of the day— A man by the name of <persRef

                            accommodating fishing parties. We went out in small row boats about two

                            with little success, but caught a few haddocks and perch—my portion was
                            one hake, and one small cod. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker took
                            the largest that was caught—a cat fish weighing perhaps ten
                            pounds—black, goggle eyed and with a dorsal fin six inches high— Our
                            boatman cautioned us not to approach too near his jaw, or he might take
                            off one of our fingers— We returned to land between one and two O Clock,
                            and dined upon Chowder, Claret and Champagne— After dinner we went upon

                            fortune— In the space of an hour and a half I took only two— At 4. P.M.
                            the tide was up and the perch ceased to bite— We took a second dinner of
                            fried perch: and at the earnest invitation of M<hi rend="superscript"

                            had a dark ride home, not without danger of running foul of Chaises and
                            Carryalls travelling the other way. The Quincy Curfew Bell of 9 P.M
                            struck as we were approaching it, and when I reached home I found

                            appropriated for Indians at Dartmouth College— They feel a particular
                            solicitude for the remnant of the Seneca tribe, still lingering in the
                            western part of the State of New-York, but upon whose lands a land
                            company in that State have fixed their fangs, and whom the Government of
                            the United States by a Schermerhorn Treaty are driving like a herd of

                            been with these two Gentlemen to Hanover, New Hampshire and had seen at

                            the Seneca Indians was hopeless. That a fraudulent Treaty coaxed, and
                            bullied and bribed out of perhaps one tenth part of their chiefs and
                            Warriors, was already sweeping them away beyond the Mississippi, and
                            that there would soon be no trace of them left in the State of New-York
                            as there is nothing left of the most powerful tribe of the Cherokees in
                            Georgia. Such is the inexorable Law of the white man and the

                            been bullied, and bribed away beyond the Mississippi—had sold their
                            Lands, themselves and their tribe to the abomination of Schermerhorns
                            Treaty, and had paid the forfeit of their treachery with their lives—
                            But the expulsion of the tribe from Georgia has been consummated, and
                            they have gone to be finally exterminated beyond the Mississippi— They
                            said the young chief at Dartmouth College, had expressed the same
                            apprehension, and had told them that he had himself been offered five
                            thousand dollars for his assent to the cession to the New-York land
                            company and to the removal of the tribe West of the Mississippi— They
                            seemed inclined to flatter themselves that the case was not quite so
                            desperate as I believed it; but they were not sanguine in hope. I told
                            them it was painful to me to speak of the treatment of the Indians by my
                            countrymen; but it was in vain to disguise or suppress the truth— An
                            inflexible determination to extirpate the race of Indian Savages was the
                            white man’s law on this continent, and I feared would be so till the
                            race itself shall be exterminated from the face of the Earth— These

                                Lunt</persRef> this morning from 1. Corinthians 10–31. “Whether
                            therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of
                            God.” It was communion day and an occasional sermon— The Communion was
                            administered jointly, by <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef> and M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt. The afternoon discourse was from 1
                            Corinthians 12.6. [“]And there are diversities of operations; but it is
                            the same God which worketh all in all.” It was a discourse upon the
                            power of religion in the heart of man— Well written—well reasoned and
                            especially towards the close, animated and eloquent— The efficacy of
                            religion in accomplishing all the great works of improvement in the
                            condition of man throughout all ages was expounded with great elegance,
                            and much classical illustration— I read the second of <persRef
                                ref="parker-nathan">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Parker’s</persRef> Sermons—on the distinction between Saints and
                            Sinners—and there was nothing in it that made much impression upon my
                            mind— There is a test to judge of the merit of Sermons, more effective
                            than any critical standard, and that is what I remember of it. I think
                            it doubtful whether I shall remember anything of D<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Parker’s Sermons In this Discourse he takes no small time of
                            his auditory to convince them that they are, and necessarily must be
                            either Saints or Sinners— It would seem to be hardly worthwhile to print
                            a book of Sermons to prove this—for after all, there may be an
                            intermediate class having no pretensions to peculiar sanctity and yet
                            who cannot be classed exclusively with Sinners— He gives a judicious
                            caution against excessive severity in estimating the characters of
                            Sinners, and excessive indulgence to the Saints— He might have added
                            that there is much of the Sinner in the holiest of this world’s Saints—

                            penetration, a strong will and a weak judgment; too well fitted to be
                            made an instrument of mischief in the hands of more crafty fanatics, who
                            know how to turn their benevolent enthusiasm to the promotion of their
                            private interest. </p>

                        <p>Yesterday was the anniversary of my departure for Russia in 1809— Since
                            which thirty years, one generation of human life has passed away.— My
                            Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, then an infant, two
                            years old, has now <persRef ref="adams-charles7;adams-john17">four
                                children</persRef>, the <persRef ref="adams-henry4"
                                >youngest</persRef> of which has passed that age— The <persRef
                                ref="adams-louisa3">eldest</persRef> is within one week of eight
                            years old.— I had then <persRef ref="adams-george;adams-john2">two other
                                sons</persRef> both of whom lived to man’s estate, but whom it has
                            pleased Heaven to transfer to the world of Spirits before their father—
                            I think of them with infinite delight, and agonizing pain: submitting
                            with resignation to the will of God, which has taken them from me, and
                            living in humble hope of meeting them in bliss hereafter— With fervent
                            supplication to Providence that, when I shall be taken away from the
                                <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna;adams-mary4">orphan
                                daughter</persRef> of my beloved child, they may not be left
                            destitute of a protector, a guardian, and friend on earth or in Heaven—
                            This day twenty two years have elapsed and the 23<hi rend="superscript"
                                >d.</hi> has commenced since my last return to my native Country—
                            The eight years of my absence formed the most eventful and most
                            prosperous period of my life; though strewed with bitter Afflictions—
                            After my return I was 8 years Secretary of State; and four years
                            President of the United States— These too were years of
                            prosperity—though darkened with the decease first of <persRef
                                ref="adams-abigail">my mother</persRef>—then of <persRef
                                ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>, and finally by the desertion
                            and treachery of a heartless world— The last ten years have been bound
                            in shallows and in miseries—a perpetual struggle against the wind and
                            tide of Fortune, and against all the baseness of the Times; unable to
                            accomplish any of the good to my Country and to mankind which I have
                            intensely desired, and unceasingly laboured to effect, alternately
                            buffeted by all the political parties; occasionally bedaubed with
                            fulsome flattery by those whom my opinions happen for the moment to
                            suit, but hated and dreaded alternately by them all— During all this
                            time the years of my natural life are drawing to a close— The world is
                            departing from me, and I am not yet prepared to renounce the world— Work
                            for your living was the motto to the day of my birth, and I must fulfil
                            my destiny.— I think prospectively of the Hymn to Adversity, and for
                            consolation repeat as <persRef ref="quincy-edmund4">Edmund
                                Quincy</persRef> did last Evening, the Stanza of the Castle of
                            Indolence—“I care not, Fortune what you me deny.” I saw the Sun rise
                            from Charles’s porch at 4:57—he set beclouded at 7:14.— day 14 hours 17
                            minutes M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt was here this morning, and
                            borrowed a few more books for his centennial Sermon on the 29<hi

                                ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> spent the Evening here. I
                            took up again and wrote a few lines in the biography of my father— I had
                            sent a copy of my Jubilee of the Constitution to <persRef

                                Otis</persRef>, and received this day an acknowledgment from him
                            with remarks in that style of hyperbolical praise which he is accustomed
                            to use, and in which he is not conscious of insincerity but which it is
                            incumbent upon me to consider not as deliberate opinion, but as
                            gentlemanly courtesy— The reception of that Discourse by the public is
                            one of the multitude of events, even in this dark and declining stage of
                            my existence, for which I can never be sufficiently grateful to God.</p>

                            made his Will— On this hint I applied at the probate Office, and
                            obtained this copy of the Will; to which Samuel Sewall’s name is
                            appended as a subscribing witness— The testator describes himself as of
                            Boston in the County of Suffolk in New-England, Goldsmith— There are in
                            this Will, and in the very few incidents of Daniel Quinsey’s life which
                            I have been able to collect circumstances deeply affecting, and leading

                            marriage Daniel was the only one who lived to be married— His father did

                        <p>Clear morning. I went up the hill, half an hour before sunrise to
                            ascertain if Sirius would be visible— Rigel, Betelgeuse and the belt of
                            Orion were the indicators where he would rise, but he was not
                            discernible till the Stars in the belt were lost in the dawn. <persRef

                            come of age or be married; and then he bequeaths his house in Boston to

                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> A.M from Jonah 4.9.
                            [“]And God said to <persRef ref="jonah">Jonah</persRef> Dost thou well
                            to be angry for the gourd? and he said I do well to be angry even unto
                            death.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt commented upon the whole
                            book of Jonah, which he said was rather a history of the prophet than a
                            prophesy— He spoke of the difficulties, of the narrative of facts; and
                            of the conjectures of commentators to solve them— That it was an
                            Allegory—or a Parable like those in which Christ was accustomed to
                            convey instruction— That the whale was an Inn where Jonah was confined,
                            after his <unclear>confinement</unclear>, and the like— All this was
                            perfectly immaterial to the moral lesson taught by the whole book—which
                            is as precious as any other portion of Scripture of the same extent.—
                            The lesson is two-fold— Of obedience, and of resignation to the Will of
                            God— Jonah was an Hebrew, but his prophesy was against Nineveh, the
                            Capital of Assyria— The prophesy of Jonah is said to have been 802 years
                            before Christ. The captivity of the kingdom of Israel by <persRef

                            prophesy of Jonah is mentioned 2. Kings 14:25. but that related to the
                            restoration of Hamath to the kingdom of Israel, by <persRef
                                ref="jeroboam">Jeroboam</persRef> the second. M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s afternoon Sermon was from Mark
                            7:11. “But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is
                            Corban, that is to say a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited
                            by me; he shall be free.” There appears to be no difference of opinion
                            as to the meaning of this passage, but in the original the sentence is
                            incomplete, and all the translators interpolate words to make it
                            intelligible— There is some obscurity with regard to the import of the
                            word <hi rend="italic">Corban</hi>, which is used in no other passage of
                            the Bible—but the meaning is to be settled by the context— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt remarked upon the extreme severity of
                            the reproaches of Jesus upon the Pharisees contrasted with his habitual
                            tenderness and indulgence to repenting Sinners. All the bitterness of
                            his censure for the self righteous, and hypocritical— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt dwelt with great emphasis and
                            solemnity of manner upon the obligations of filial duty and upon the
                            baseness of neglecting them upon the pretence of religion— At home I

                            merely from an overruling desire to see me— His conversation was strange
                            but not interesting; and although not entirely disjointed and foolish
                            yet of so little spirit that it left me in doubt whether he was fuddled
                            or half-witted— He said he had led a wandering life the last 13 or 14
                            years, never six months in the same place— That he came three years
                            since from the State of Illinois, and was roaming about the Country— I
                            asked him if he preached. He said, yes, when he could get an audience;
                            which was not often— But he occasionally had addressed numerous
                            assemblies. As he was going away he said that in his youth he had been a
                            student at Harvard College— On looking into the Catalogue, I found his
                            name in the Class, graduated in 1825 of which my Son, <persRef

                            word of that to me— About Sunset I went to Charles’s house, and took a
                            ride with him to Braintree— He and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his

                            Braintree, except a tract of about 40 Acres, to <persRef

                            survivorship in fee— And in the event of his dying without issue—all the
                            Estate not disposed of by him by Deed or Will, is given to his Grandson
                                <persRef ref="quincy-john">John</persRef>, son of <persRef

                            also to John, then in his ninth year two hundred pounds; but in the
                            Event of the real Estate’s coming to him the two hundred pounds, were to
                            be distributed in seven equal parts between the seven surviving children
                            of the testator, or their heirs or assigns, not including those of

                            had died in 1675—the other two were of these seven devisees—but the
                            device never took effect. Elizabeth wife of the Testator; and her son
                            Edmund are appointed Executrix and Executor of the Will; she to have
                            full power to act alone until he shall come of Age. The reserved 40 acre
                            lot was given to the Testator’s daughter Ruth Hunt. 105 pounds to his
                            youngest daughter Mary. His negro boy <persRef ref="peter3"

                            and the whole administration committed to her until her son Edmund shall

                        <p>A man by the name of <persRef ref="clarke-peleg">Peleg Clarke</persRef>,
                            a sort of literary sailor very shabbily attired came and brought with
                            him a folio manuscript volume of his own writing, apparently a diary;
                            which he said he intended to publish, and of which he expected to sell
                            2000 copies— He was a Seaman in a public ship, in the last War, with
                            Great-Britain, and was taken in a privateer, and confined in Dartmoor
                            prison— He said he had in his book an exact account of what was called
                            the Dartmoor Massacre, which was no Massacre at-all— The whole affair
                            had been grossly falsified, but his book would rectify it all, by his
                            testimony as an eye witness of the whole transaction.— He said he had a
                            petition before Congress praying an allowance of <hi rend="italic"
                                >wages</hi> for privateersmen from the Seamans fund, in which by a
                            report from the Secretary of the Navy, it appeared there was 50,000
                            dollars with only five pensioners quartered upon it— He gave me to read
                            in his book, what he said was a copy of his petition; but it was in the
                            form of a statement respecting the navy pension fund, and an argument
                            for the application of it to the payment of wages to privateersmen— Of
                            the standard of his literary qualifications it may serve as a sample
                            that in discoursing about the definitive Treaty of Peace he uniformly
                            calls it the indefinite Treaty of Peace— He said his petition had been
                            presented in 1836 by <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Dutee J. Pearce</persRef>, and referred to the Committee
                            of naval affairs—but nothing further had been done with it;—that last
                            winter <persRef ref="cranston-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Cranston</persRef> had the charge of it with no better success— He
                            said perhaps it might be better for him to prepare a new and different
                            petition, to give Congress the pleasure of variety.— I told him that was
                            unnecessary; but if he desired it, I would at the next Session, call his

                        <p>Cold, dull, dry, easterly storm; and the day passed off like almost all
                            others, in what is no better than absolute idleness. After dinner, I
                            took my Town and County, and Parish tax-bills to the Town hall, where
                            the Selectmen, and Assessors hold meetings every Saturday afternoon from
                            4 to 7. O’Clock, to ascertain the particulars upon which the bills were
                            made up— The town and county tax is 414 dollars<space/>and the Parish

                            different; chosen by the several congregations; but M<hi

                            him my parish tax to have the particulars endorsed upon it; and the bill

                            for the same purpose— I am to call upon them for the bills next
                            Saturday. My town and County tax is for 15000 dollars of real Estate,
                            and 75000 personal. but I am yet to enquire 1. what was the sum voted by
                            the town to be raised for the service of this year; and of the last. 2.
                            The Law for the Assessment of the tax— The amount which they have added
                            to my valuation the present year— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Duggan
                            said it was 1000 dollars to the personal property and no more— And the
                            reason assigned for this was that the Assessors concluded that my income
                            made addition to my property; at the close of the year.— D<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Duggan said the town had foolishly voted
                            to raise a sum this year fifty per cent more than that of last year— I

                            before that the communion would be then administered. I asked him if a
                            vote of the Church would not be necessary.— This had not occurred to
                            him; but he said it might be easily taken, by asking the members of the
                            Church to stay after the morning service, a fortnight before the day—

                            afternoon for New-York and is to embark in the Liverpool Steam-packet

                            information that I might desire concerning the condition of the English
                            Islands where Slavery has been abolished. I had much conversation with
                            him— His reports upon the condition of the Island, and all rose-coloured
                            as to the results of emancipation; but he is evidently a prejudiced, and
                            interested witness— As to the ultimate issue, he admitted that the
                            Islands must finally pass into the exclusive possession of a mongrel
                            half-breed of African and European blood from which the white race will
                            gradually retire; but will not be expelled: and that as a further
                            necessary consequence the Colonial Supremacy of England over them will
                            cease— I spoke of the despotic measures of the English Ministry,
                            suppressing the Legislature of the Island of Jamaica, to carry through
                            the emancipation Laws, and of the convulsions in the English Government
                            itself occasioned thereby— He said that it was all occasioned by the
                            intractable obstinacy of the Legislative Assembly of Jamaica in
                            resisting an act of Parliament for the reform of the Prison— The
                            proposal had only been to suspend the Legislative Assembly of Jamaica,
                            for two years and a half, to which it had been reduced from 5 years— The
                            bill had finally passed in the house of commons by a majority of ten;
                            but had been thrown out, with the exception of a single Section by the
                            House of Peers— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Scoble was much
                            dissatisfied with the compensation granted by the British Parliament to
                            the emancipated Slaves masters, which he said was carried entirely by
                            intrigue, against the will of the abolitionists.— The conversation was
                            animated, but good humoured, and we parted with all the forms of
                            politeness, and civility— This afternoon, <persRef ref="prince-james3"

                            meeting of Congress, this year— I acknowledged the promise, and said I
                            would endeavour to perform it— I felt myself bound to except Braintree
                            from the general rule which I have been obliged to prescribe to myself
                            of declining all invitations, to deliver Addresses, Lectures and
                            Orations.— Braintree was the name of my native town; and although Quincy
                            has since been detached from it, I still consider Braintree as my own
                            mother town; having claims upon me possessed by none other— I requested

                            political subject, and that no notice should be taken of it in the

                            bordering upon that part of Pennsylvania—perhaps Morgantown. I declined
                            subscribing, as I am often compelled to do, from absolute destitution of
                            means, and persisted in my refusal though urged with great importunity
                            by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wheeler— He said he was originally
                            from Massachusetts and lived in Boston till the Chesapeake frigate was
                            taken by the Shannon in the summer of 1813— Since then he has lived,
                            settled as a methodist preacher at Washington Pennsylvania, and is now
                            to be a teacher at this College in Virginia. He had also a Letter from

                            I told him I could not recommend to my friends what I declined to do
                            myself.— He asked me to return him the Letter from M<hi

                            when Sirius would have been visible if the weather had been clear—but
                            there has not been a clear morning before Sunrise since the 11<hi

                        <p><persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef> called here this
                            morning just as I was finishing breakfast, to converse with me upon
                            sundry concerns of the University— First of the nominations for the
                            Doctorates; upon which I told him that the Committee had agreed to
                            report the confirmation of them all— Then he said he was about to
                            propose and to undertake the erection of an Astronomical Observatory at
                            Cambridge; and to engage the services of <persRef ref="bond-william"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bond</persRef> as an Observer—
                            That he had conversed with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bond on the
                            subject—who was willing to engage upon moderate terms; and was now
                            engaged in making Astronomical Observations for the Government of the
                            U.S. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy said he proposed to commence
                            upon a small scale, and should offer a Subscription Paper, without
                            reference to the offer heretofore made by me, which was a subscription
                            of 1000 dollars— But for that and various other reasons he should
                            present the subscription paper first to me— I told him I rejoiced and
                            was exceeding glad, that he had taken this matter in hand— That he would
                            have my hearty good wishes for the success of his undertaking, and I
                            would subscribe to the extent of my ability, which was not now quite
                            equal to what it was when I made the former offer— I had morning visits

                                Noah Curtis</persRef> who is the Town Treasurer and ex officio
                            Treasurer of the Supervisors of the Temple and School fund— At the last
                            meeting of the Supervisors which was in 1835. M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Thomas Greenleaf and myself were appointed a committee to
                            examine and report on the Treasurers accounts— There was then a balance
                            short of 500 dollars in his hands, which has now accumulated to more
                            than one thousand— They consist principally of Notes upon interest from
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis himself as Treasurer of the
                            Town, and he was much puzzled to settle whether he could sue himself. I
                            should think that an investment in some other stocks yielding six per
                            Cent would be preferable to Town Treasury Notes.— We found the accounts
                            properly kept and correctly cast up, and so certified on the back of the
                            leaf upon which the Accounts were entered— We returned home about 6. and
                            I promised to inform M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf of the day
                            of the week in the week after next when I wish the Supervisors of the

                            authority the College Freshman is appointed, and whether by releasing

                            abolished— Finally the proposed repeal was confirmed, with a

                            proposals of change in the Laws were presented— Particularly that after
                            the Freshman year, the pursuit of Classical Studies of Greek and Latin

                            of William Ting, who signed the Indenture of 28. March 1661— I found
                            entries also of the admission to the Church of <persRef ref="tyng-mary"

                            book— If there was a fifth daughter she must have died in childhood.— At

                            brought me a warm Letter of recommendation which he sent to me by the
                            Mail. It was from <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">Christopher

                            His manners are gentlemanly; but his face and form are the caricature of
                            an ideal Irishman. I left the company about Sunset, and asked to speak a

                        <p>The oppressive heat of the whole Summer has been concentrated upon this
                            present week— This is the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> day upon
                            which <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> has been at
                            and over 90— For the first time this Season, I bathed and swam about 5
                            minutes at <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf’s</persRef> wharf, taking <persRef
                                ref="kirk-john">John Kirk</persRef> with me. The bath was as
                            pleasant to me, as it has been in former years, but a distrust of its
                            subsequent operation upon the body was warranted by repeated experience
                            of late years. A heavy drowsiness followed by profuse perspiration after
                            my return—continuing till dinner time and for two hours after,
                            disqualified me during that time for all intellectual exercise of
                            reading, writing, or meditation— But towards the close of the afternoon
                            I recovered spirit to <unclear>write</unclear> about an hour and a half—
                            I went to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house to see
                            the Sun set, but he was veiled in a thick cloud. His rise in the morning
                            had also been intercepted by light vapours such as almost always cover
                            the dawn of morning in the greatest summer heats. My Diary more that
                            consumed the Day— <persRef ref="newcomb-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> James Newcomb</persRef>, one of the Assesors of the
                            Parish Tax, brought my tax-bill, which I had left with him at the town
                            Hall last Saturday— The particulars of the tax are now upon it—
                            Homestead 2. Acres, Barn, orchard lot and farmhouse 5000 dollars— Penn’s
                            Hill farm in part, viz 50 Acres wood, 7. Marsh an dwelling house with1/2
                            acre 3500. 190 acres woodland— 5500. Mount Wollaston Farm 22000. Real
                            Estate in Boston and other parts of the Commonwealth 10,000. Personal
                            Estate 74000— Sum total 120000 dollars; upon which an assessment of 17
                            1/2 cents to the 100 dollars has been laid— It makes a tax of 210
                            dollars for the year— Upon the Town and County tax M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Newcomb told me the Assessment is 46 cents
                            to the 100 dollars— He asked me some questions upon the construction of
                            the Laws relating to the Assessment of taxes for the Schools, which I
                            was not able to answer—the law is so ambiguous, respecting the
                            Assessment on the Lands of non-residents that it is possible the term
                            non-resident may refer either to the Town or to the School District— I
                            thought the application was only to the Town, and that was the safer
                            construction for the Assessors— Charles and <persRef
                                ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> spent the Evening here—
                                <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> was unwell
                            all the morning and kept her bed, till near time— I have at last turned
                            to reading <persRef ref="prescott-william2">Prescott’s</persRef> History
                            of <persRef ref="ferdinandofaragon">Ferdinand</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="isabella-i">Isabella</persRef>— The two introductory Sections
                            upon the previous history of Castile and of Arragon, before their Union
                            by the marriage were so dry and uninteresting that before reading them
                            through I became discouraged and had abandoned further reading of it
                            altogether— But about a fortnight since, I took up the first volume
                            again, and having waded through the two preliminary Sections, the moment
                            I came to the personal history of Isabella, I found the interest highly
                            excited, and now read from 25 to 40 pages of it every morning— There are
                            many resemblances between the situation of Isabella in early life and
                            that of <persRef ref="elizabeth-i">Elizabeth</persRef> of England— She
                            was like Elizabeth the daughter of a <persRef ref="isabellaofportugal"
                                >second wife</persRef>, and inherited the throne of Castile, after a

                                >Alfonso</persRef>, and in a competition with an ostensible daughter
                            of Henry, <persRef ref="beltraneja-joanna">Joanna Beltraneja</persRef>—
                            The Succession of Ferdinand to the crown of Arragon was alike
                            precarious, and their marriage was accomplished against obstacles
                            seemingly unsurmountable, has all the interest of a romance.</p>

                            swam 5 minutes at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">Daniel Greenleaf’s</persRef> wharf. This
                            ablution is still so grateful to me, that I relinquish it with extreme
                            reluctance; but I feel that the nervous agitation consequent upon the
                            bath for the remainder of the day and the subsequent night is much more
                            trying than it was in former days— This afternoon after leaving with the

                            particulars, as they appear on the Assessment Book, which are Homestead
                            House, 1/2 barn, Farm house, Orchard, 5100 dollars— Penn’s Hill farm in
                            part, consisting of 50 Acres Wood, 7. Marsh, with one house and 1/2 Acre
                            of Land, occupied by William Baxter, (now empty[)] 3500, 190 Acres of
                            Woodland 6100. Personal Estate 75300—whole amount 90000 dollars upon

                            dollars.—The Parish tax adds to this 22000 dollars for the Mount

                            the Assessors of the present year— The excessive charge is for personal

                            would considerably reduce the charge upon my personal Estate— For the

                                Francis</persRef> of Watertown, this morning from Acts 17:31.
                            [“]Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world
                            in righteousness, by that man whom he hath ordained.” This is a part of
                            that ever memorable discourse of <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef> at
                            Athens. The light in which it was considered by M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Francis was original and ingenious—perhaps somewhat refined.
                            An appointed day of judgment, by a man ordained to judge— A <hi
                                rend="small-caps">man</hi> to judge the world in righteousness!—
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis did not include in his text,
                            the remainder of the verse—“whereof he hath given assurance unto all
                            men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.” Here is the distinct
                            assertion, that god hath appointed a day in which he will judge the
                            world in righteousness by the <hi rend="italic">man</hi> Christ Jesus—
                            And as a demonstration of this to all mankind, he, God, had raised that
                            man from the dead— Is it not amazing that after language so distinct and
                            explicit as this, nine tenths of the Christian world believe that this
                            man, whom God raised from the dead to prove that he should be the judge
                            of the world, was himself almighty God? and how can he who believes
                            this, scruple to believe that a wafer mystified by the incantation of a
                            Priest is turned into God almighty, and then swallowed by the
                            communicant? Of all this M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis took no
                            account—but the improvement of his discourse was that the Christian, who
                            will one day be judged in righteousness should so live as to consider
                            every day of his life a day of judgment. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Francis dined with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>,
                            and his afternoon text was from Acts 21:11. “And when he was come unto
                            us he took Paul’s Girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said,
                            thus saith the holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man
                            that owneth this girdle”—the verse adds, and shall deliver him into the
                            hands of the Gentiles; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis left
                            these words out of his text— The discourse was upon <hi rend="italic"
                                >the language of action</hi>. It was the first Sermon upon this
                            subject that I had ever heard, and I have often wondered how it happened
                            that the discussion of the figurative language of the Scriptures has
                            been so little attended to by the writers of Sermons— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis began by the very obvious remark
                            that action was a vehicle of thought and of feeling as effective as
                            speech— He referred to the frequent employment of this mode of
                            communication, by the prophets of the old Testament, and to the use of
                            it by Jesus Christ in the new. He spoke of it as an Oriental usage; but
                            it belongs to the nature of man— <persRef ref="demosthenes"
                                >Demosthenes</persRef> said that all eloquence consisted in
                            action—action—action—and Speech itself is but a modification of action—
                            And this is a key to the intelligence of the Scriptures the ignorance or
                            neglect of which has caused more absurd and senseless doctrines to be
                            wrought up into creeds and to kindle the fires of persecution, than all
                            the other blunders of the human imagination put together— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis noticed particularly the emphatic
                            act of Jesus to rebuke the ambition and thirst for place of his
                            disciples, by taking and placing a little child in the midst of them—
                            After Meeting I read <persRef ref="parker-nathan">D<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Parker’s</persRef> 5<hi

                            she returned to Medford— She took a sketch of our dwelling house, and
                            borrowed that which <persRef ref="quincy-eliza2">Miss Eliza Susan
                                Quincy</persRef> gave me some years since— She asked me also for my
                            signature for a friend of hers a collector of Autographs; and I added to
                            the signature a Sonnet to a Sun dial, which I wrote some years ago; and
                            which no reader but my self ever thought good for any thing; and which I
                            think good for much.— <persRef ref="phelps-abner">D<hi

                            intense study— He seems to be an intelligent youth. I asked <persRef
                                ref="phelps-charles">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Phelps</persRef>
                            what had become of Anti-Masonry— He said it had accomplished its
                            destiny. Masonry was extinguished in this Commonwealth except for the
                            management of its property— And he had thought when Masonry was extinct
                            there was no longer any necessity for keeping up an antimasonic party. I
                            asked him how he stood about the democracy and the 15 gallon law— He
                            said he took no interest in them; nor any part in Politics— The Doctor

                            Braintree came and informed me that the County Commissioners were to
                            meet this afternoon for a final determination upon a Petition to open a
                            road from Braintree through at least 200 rods of my land— The
                            Commissioners had already decided to lay out the road, if the cost of it
                            should not exceed 500 dollars, and this would probably depend upon the
                            amount of damages that I should claim and obtain— He intimated a wish
                            that I should attend or send some person for me to attend the Meeting— I
                            told him that every road laid out through my lands was an injury to my
                            property— That the Commissioners never allowed me damages adequate to
                            the injury That I did not wish to interpose my private interest against
                            any road which would be useful and desirable to the people of Quincy or
                            of Braintree and therefore I should let the County Commissioners decide
                            as they think proper, and if they did not allow me adequate damages I
                            must put up with the loss. <persRef ref="thayer-minot">M<hi

                            it is impossible for me to say anything new— He said the <pb n="187"

                            speaking had closed the judges returned to the President’s study and
                            awarded the two first prizes to <persRef ref="harlow-robert">Robert

                            the delivery, and was an ingenious elaborate and eloquent discussion of
                            some of the prevailing projects of political reform—of the claim of
                            political rights of women—of perpetual Peace by the means of a Congress
                            of Nations—Non-resistance and no Government the ones all of which he

                            composition of the discourse was rather negligent, aiming rather at the
                            tone of unpremeditated conversation than at the studied organization of
                            periods in the closet. He spoke not from the pulpit but before a table

                            year— Another temptation.— At the Commencement yesterday, sixty one
                            youths were graduated bachelors of Arts. Thirty one of whom had parts to
                            perform— President Quincy told me that the performances were
                            satisfactory, and the speaking better than usual— One only of the
                            graduates of yesterday had a part and declaimed this day for a prize.

                            accent. He is quite distinguished as a scholar, and spoke so well that
                            he would have taken a prize; but that he made two or three long aukward

                            rule, no prize can be taken in any case of failure of memory.</p>

                        <p>I had engaged if the weather should be this day fair, to go to Hingham
                            for a fishing party with <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi

                            violent North-eastern gale and storm, which had been two days gathering
                            and came on so gradually this morning, that <persRef
                                ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> with whom I had promised to
                            go, came to enquire what I had concluded to do— The gale had been heavy
                            in the Night without rain— A clear streak of sky along the eastern
                            horizon, with dark super impending clouds over the whole hemisphere
                            besides, portended a stormy day. It was no time to go upon salt water to
                            take fish— Charles nevertheless went into Boston, and returned to dine.—
                            There were light sprinklings of rain all the morning, not amounting to a
                            shower, and not sufficient to lay the dust till about 2. P.M. when a
                            steady driving rain set in which continued without abatement of the
                            gale, and the torrent and the blast still continued when about ten at
                            night, I betook myself to my rest— We had a fire in the dining room from
                            noon, and I felt the want of one in my library but did not indulge
                            myself with it.</p>
                        <p>I finished reading the first volume of <persRef ref="prescott-william2"

                            exceedingly well formed; and from the moment he comes to the birth of
                            Isabella 22. April 1451 at Madrigal, all is liveliness and Spirit— One
                            of the most remarkable phenomena in the natural history of man is the
                            production of such a person as Isabella— <persRef ref="johnofcastile"

                            something might come; but from such a birth, such an education, and such
                            family co-temporaries, she seems like a diamond glancing to the Sun in
                            the midst of a Sandy desart— The work is divided into two parts— The

                            and the melancholy tale of the establishment of the modern inquisition,
                            while it detracts from the estimation we have formed of the almost
                            spotless character of Isabella leads us but to lament the bigotry of the

                        <p>The storm raved through the night, and rivetted me to my Couch till 5.
                            O’Clock this morning— When I rose the rain was still rattling at my
                            Northern and Eastern windows, and the gale was driving with unabated
                            fury: after Sunrise however the torrent first subsided and the tempest
                            gradually lulled—the clouds slowly dispersed— By Noon the Sun peered out
                            for a few minutes and veiled himself again, with clouds— Alternations of
                            shade and Sunshine succeeded till the setting of the orb of day in a
                            clear sky— But the storm had left the wreck of many a fruit-tree snapped
                            off in the midst—uprooted hundreds of hills of unripened Indian corn,
                            and scattered bushels upon bushels of green Apples, Pears Peaches and
                            Plums upon the ground. The damage done is great and irreparable for the
                            present year— I made the rounds of my garden, nursery, Orchard and
                            Seminary, to witness the desolation of my trees, and the ruin of many of
                            my hopes— I began reading the second Volume of <persRef
                                ref="prescott-william2">Prescott’s</persRef> History of <persRef

                                ref="isabella-i">Isabella</persRef>; after dinner walked to the
                            Bookbinder <persRef ref="gill-caleb">Gill’s</persRef>, and left the
                            Reports on the Commerce and Navigation of the United States for the last
                            8 years to be bound in two Volumes— Returning home I stopped at <persRef
                                ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house, and while I was

                            <persRef ref="adams-ebenezer">Ebenezer Adams</persRef> came, and

                            Estates of <persRef ref="gill-moses2">Governor Gill</persRef>, and of
                            the late Moses Gill to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller, for the
                            settlement of the Gill claim on the sum recovered from the French

                            draught of the Petition— After dark two young Ladies brought me a note
                            from the Ladies of Quincy inviting <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"

                            a full half hour to wash and dress I water my potted seedling plants,
