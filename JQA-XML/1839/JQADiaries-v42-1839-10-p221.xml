							which had belonged to <persRef ref="flint-josiah">Josiah Flint</persRef>
							of Dorchester and his son <persRef ref="flynt-henry">Henry
								Flint</persRef>, for half a century a Tutor at Harvard College, and
							which she had sent me— I answered an invitation of a Committee of the
							Citizens of Springfield, to a public dinner to be given there on the
								3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of this month upon the occasion of
							the opening of the railroad from Boston to that place, through
							Worcester; and the project of which imports a continuance of it to the
							Hudson river— I declined this invitation. But that which now absorbs
							great part of my time, and all my good feelings is the case of 53
							African Negroes taken, at sea, off Montauk point, by <persRef
								ref="gedney-thomas">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Gedney</persRef> in a Vessel of the United States employed upon the
							survey of the Coast; and brought into the Port of New-London— These
							Negroes were a fresh importation of Slaves from Africa into the Havana,
							against the Laws of Spain; and her Treaties with Great-Britain—purchased
							there under the nose of the joint Commission of Britain and Spain
							sitting there for the suppression of the Slave-trade— Shipped from the
							Havana, for another port on the Island, by two Spanish Subjects,
								<persRef ref="ruiz-jose">Ruiz</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="montes-pedro">Montes</persRef>, the purchasers of the Slaves—
							When four days out, the Negroes revolted; killed the <persRef
								ref="ferrer-ramon">Captain</persRef> and <persRef ref="celestino"
								>Cook</persRef> of the ship; took possession of the ship; spared the
							lives of Ruiz and Montes, and ordered the latter, skilful in Navigation
							of, which they were ignorant, to steer for Sierra Leone. He deceived
							them by changing the course of the ship every night from that which they
							understood enough of navigation to make it necessary for him to steer by
							day— By this double process, they had as it were finally drifted upon
							our coast and being finally boarded by Lieut<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Gedney, he at the request of the two white men took
							possession of the vessel, without resistance from the negroes, and
							brought her into New London. 49 of the Negroes were claimed by Ruiz as
							his property. 4 Children—3 girls and a boy, by Montes as his property—
							But they charged the Negro men, with murder and Piracy, for killing the
							Captain and cook and taking the ship; and yet claimed all the Negroes as
							their property; and Lieutenant Gedney libelled the ship and Cargo,
							including the Negroes for Salvage— The <persRef ref="deargaiz-pedro"
								>Spanish Minister</persRef> too, at Washington, has laid claim to
							the whole ship, Cargo and Negroes, to be restored to the owners, by
							virtue of the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article of the Treaty

							the 49 negro men to be tried at the Circuit Court at Hartford on the
								17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September, and the four

						<p>I received last Evening an invitation from the Massachusetts charitable
							mechanic association to attend at their triennial festival this day to
							conclude with a public dinner at Faneuil Hall— I went with <persRef
								ref="dumphy-thomas">Thomas</persRef> in <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> Chaise, and at 10 O’Clock
							attended at the Doric Hall of the State House, and met the President of

									>r</hi> George Darracott</persRef>, and the Secretary <persRef
								ref="rogers-jgorham">J. Gorham Rogers</persRef>— There among the

								ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb Cushing</persRef>, <persRef

							the processions moved from the Representative Hall of the State House to
							the Odeon— I walked with Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Dearborn— The
							order of services was 1 Voluntary on the organ 2. Chorus—Glory be to God
							on high. 3. Prayer by <persRef ref="blagden-george2">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> George Blagden</persRef>: 4. Original
							Ode, written by <persRef ref="lunt-george">George Lunt</persRef>—a
							luxuriant picture of the autumnal Season, of which the following
							couplets are worthy of being embalmed in Memory</p>
						<lg>
							<l>The teeming earth with treasur’d stores in rich profusion crown’d</l>
							<l>The cattle on a thousand hills, by Summer’s Sun embrown’d</l>
							<l>The Forest deck’d with glorious hues, the flocks that throng the
								vale</l>
							<l>And Nature’s universal heart, the year of plenty hail—</l>
							<l>And well may Man whose living soul the breath of God inspires</l>
							<l>To grasp the shadowy things to be, with uncontroll’d desires.</l>
							<l>Well may he bring the skilful works, his master hand hath
								wrought,</l>
							<l>And join with Nature’s festival, the harvest-home of thought.</l>
							<l>His said hath found the farthest isle, that crowns the ocean wave</l>
							<l>His hand hath sought the sparkling gem in earth’s profoundest
								cave</l>
							<l>His car along the smoking track, the courser’s speed outvies</l>
							<l>And swifter than on Eagles wings, along the deep he flies—</l>
						</lg>
						<p>There are three Stanzas more, not equal to these but yet very good— Next
							was the Address by <persRef ref="austin-james">James T.
							Austin</persRef>; an hour and a half long, without a tedious moment to
							the Auditory.— It was a spirited and eloquent vindication of the natural
							and unavoidable inequalities of human Society, and of the blessings of
							luxury. The Doctrine of <persRef ref="mandeville-bernard"
								>Mandeville’s</persRef> Fable of the Bees set forth in the gorgeous
							attire of ambitious Oratory. After the Doxology to the tune of old
							hundred, and the benediction by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Blagden,
							the procession marched again: passing through Quincy Hall over the
							Aerial bridge into Faneuil Hall where about nine hundred persons sat
							down to a most sumptuous dinner followed by toasts and songs, and shouts
							of exultation and of laughter, all with the most perfect sobriety
							decorum and order— The second toast given by the President M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Darracott was my name with the appendage
							of a fulsome and disgusting compliment— It was received with loud and
							universal shouting and huzzas so mortifying that they totally
							disconcerted me.— But I was doomed to make a Speech; and muttered a few
							incoherent stammering sentences, without either a joke or a point to
							keep up the good humour— The shout and clapping that followed it was a
							substitute of civility for applause: President Quincy, and the <persRef
								ref="eliot-samuel3">Mayor of the City</persRef> responded better,
							and the Orator of the day, and Caleb Cushing better still— I left the
							table about 7. O’Clock with President Quincy, and our departure from the
							Hall was honoured with the farewell of three hearty Cheers— I got home
							about 8. and joined our Ladies who were at Charles’s— We came home
							however before nine, <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef> being slightly indisposed. </p>

						<p>Last night and this morning the sky was clearer than I ever saw it in any
							part of Europe, and more remarkably so than I had ever observed it in
							this hemisphere— The multitude and brightness of the Stars was dazzling,
							and I specially remarked this morning the waning crescent of the moon,
							the last of her days but one, before the change, with a distinct
							luminous line round her whole disk. The Star horizontally West about 3
							Sun’s disks from Sirius, and that perpendicular about the same distance
							above Procyon seemed almost of the first magnitude— I had intended to be
							quite industrious this day, and began a Lecture to be delivered before
							the Braintree Lyceum; but nearly the whole day was taken from me—
								<persRef ref="otis-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George

							severe critique upon his translation of the Tusculan of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>, which the critic says will be

							that if it had been presented to me as the original I should have
							acknowledged it without an instant of hesitation as my own, but for a
							notification at the bottom of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> page
							in characters so small as to be scarcely legible with the naked eye that
							it was lithographed for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hackett. And with
							this Letter there was a packet containing three lithographic portraits

							and one in the character of <persRef ref="falstaff-john">Falstaff</persRef> in Henry

							of Elseneur; of the Palace of Rosenberg and Cronberg Castle, all
							peculiarly interesting to me, from the associations left on my mind by
							the few days that I passed in the Harbour of Elseneur in September 1809—

							that he has very recently heard of an analysis by me of the tragedy of

								<persRef ref="mann-horace">Horace Mann</persRef>— But that which

						<p>Ride to Scituate— S. A. Turner’s. Quincy.</p>
						<p>I had promised <persRef ref="turner-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Samuel Adams Turner</persRef> of Scituate that I would
							go and take a farmer’s dinner with him this day, and examine the spot
							where they are desirous of obtaining an appropriation from Congress for
							the improvement of their harbour— Accordingly at half past seven O’Clock
							this morning, I took <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							four wheel chaise, with one of my horses and <persRef
								ref="dumphy-thomas">Thomas</persRef> to drive me; stopped at
								<persRef ref="thayer-minot">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Minott
								Thayers</persRef> and told him that if convenient to the people of
							Braintree I would fix upon the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of this
							month at 3 O’Clock in the afternoon to deliver the Lecture which I have
							promised to their Lyceum— I travelled over the Braintree and Weymouth
							and then the Scituate Turnpike and as I had promised reached M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Turner’s house precisely at ten; about 16
							miles— I then went with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Turner in his
							Chaise about 4 miles farther to the harbour which is low and small—
							There I met <persRef ref="jenkins-cumings">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Cumings Jenkins</persRef> the Inspector of the Port,
								<persRef ref="jones-ezekiel">Captain Ezekiel Jones</persRef>,
							Captain of a Revenue Cutter, but upon furlough being out of health
								<persRef ref="beal-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John

									>r</hi> Young</persRef> inhabitants of the town— We stopped
							perhaps a quarter of an hour at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jenkins’s
							house and partook of a luncheon with a temperate glass of cold water— We
							then rode back to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Turner’s, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jenkins and Captain Jones being of the
							dinner party— On the way M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Turner pointed
							out to me the course where they were desirous of having a Canal opened,
							to keep the channel of the river sufficiently deep— But there is another
							project petitioned for by certain inhabitants of Marshfield, which these
							Gentlemen, particularly M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Turner thought
							would be rather injurious than beneficial to Scituate. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Turner gave me a map upon which he marked
							the line where they wished the canal to run— <persRef ref="turner-lydia"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Turner</persRef>, and his
								<persRef ref="u">daughter</persRef>, a young woman from 18 to 20,
							were at table— The dinner was plentiful and good.— There was white wine
							of which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Turner and I took each one glass
							and no one else any. I called twice to visit the <persRef
								ref="may-samuel">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Samuel J.
								May</persRef>, a next door neighbour of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Turner, but he was gone to Plymouth— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Turner shewed me a large printed sheet of the descendants
							from <persRef ref="turner-humphrey">Humphrey Turner</persRef> who
							settled at Scituate in 1626. a numerous family— He was a large
							Landholder—but his descendants still hold all the lands that he
							possessed and more— We rode by the house and farm which was the
							residence of the worthy judge <persRef ref="cushing-william">William
								Cushing</persRef> in his lifetime— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Turner said that forty years ago, when he was a boy seven years of age,
							the judge had his house new painted and the fences round it renewed; and
							he then thought it the most magnificent mansion in the world. But he had
							since then seen more splendid places. It looks now, much in decline, and
							somewhat dilapidated— It belongs to a nephew of the judge, a lawyer at
							Boston named <persRef ref="u">Elwyn</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Turner told me also of <persRef ref="cushing-nathan">Judge
								Nathan Cushing</persRef>, and of <persRef ref="otis-cushing">Doctor
								Cushing Otis</persRef>, old acquaintances of mine, and both of whom
							lived and died at Scituate— They seemed under some apprehension that
							their Light house would be suppressed, and thought the was a project for
							erecting one on the Minot’s or Cohasset rocks— Soon after 3. O’Clock, I
							left M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Turner with his friends, and
							returned to Quincy by the same way that I had gone. I reached home at 6.
							P.M. Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> spent

						<p><persRef ref="spear-william">Deacon Spear</persRef> called here this

								Son</persRef> and him this afternoon to view my wood lot at the foot
							of Penn’s Hill, where he has been persuading me to sell the standing
							wood— I agreed to go with him, but a sprinkling of rain which came on
							just at 3. O’Clock, the time when we had to go, prevented him from
							coming and the party was postponed— <persRef ref="hardwick-frederick"
								>Frederick Hardwick</persRef> came with a small bill for fencing
							between his yard and my Quincy Meadow. Seven years ago in 1832. as I was
							passing by there, he stopped me, and shewing me that the fence was
							somewhat dilapidated, offered to have the division between us measured
							and to have the whole fence repaired if I would pay half the cost, to
							which I agreed and thought no more about it— Some four or five years
							afterwards be stopped me again and reminded me of the old debt which I
							had always been ready to pay at his call— This day he brougt me a bill
							for 2. dollars and a half, and 1. dollar and 10 cents for seven years
							for interest, and half of 1 dollar 50 cents for measuring the ground— I
							paid the bill without asking a question or starting an objection— He
							could have no possible claim to the interest; and very little to the
							principal, upon which I think he has not spent the value of half a
							dollar—but here was wherewithal to make an argument and a dispute, which
							I would always give double the money to avoid— In questions of small
							amount with persons of small means, it is policy to submit to opposition
							rather than get into a quarrel— Hardwick told me he had now <persRef
								ref="u">a son</persRef> dangerously ill of a bilious fever, and that
							last December he lost <persRef ref="hardwick-edward">a Son</persRef>,
							sixteen years of age, found dead in his bed one morning, with no other
							warning than a slight head ache the night before— I could not cavil
							about a dollar with a man, who could tell such a piteous tale with a dry
							eye— I had 30 seedling Apple trees taken out of the S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Germain Pear-tree bed in the garden, and
							set out in the Orchard behind the house— I sowed the seeds of these
							trees in 1834 and 1835. and they have encroached so much upon the
							kitchen garden ground that I must now remove them to leave space for
							raising vegetables for the table. Many of them are very fine trees, but
							what will be their fate in their new habitations I shall perhaps not
							know, or if I do, only to my disappointment. My plantations of peaches
							have indeed this year yielded abundant and excellent fruit, and although
							seven or eight of them have broken down by the violence of the gale or
							by the weight of their own exuberance I have yet numbers in full bearing
							and younger trees of excellent promise and of every successive year to
							the present time— My transplanted and budded apple-trees are just
							beginning to bear— Of the Ash, the while elm, the button wood and sundry
							kinds of Oaks, and the white Maple— I have raised enough to know that if
							I had thirty years of life before me I could raise forests which would
							more than repay all the time and toil and cost— But this is all— Charles
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> and <persRef

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Storrs’s</persRef> meeting house in
							Braintree at 3. O’Clock in the afternoon, and M<hi rend="superscript"

							be on the subject which he had suggested to me—Education— And if it
							was—I should treat it in a manner somewhat different from that in which
							it is usually considered— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hollingsworth
							asked me to shew him Mount Wollaston which I did— He said there was a

							indulged since the division of the town, to give the present town of

						<p>Boston. Dinner at Abbott Lawrence’s— Quincy.</p>
						<p>I went into Boston this morning with <persRef ref="dumphy-thomas"
								>Thomas</persRef>, in <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> chaise and one of my own horses. I called
							immediately at <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> George Parkman’s</persRef>, but he was not at home— I
							then went to the City Council chamber in the old Townhouse; where I
							found the Mayor, <persRef ref="elliot-samuel3">Samuel A.
								Elliot</persRef> the Clerk of the city Council <persRef
								ref="mccleary-samuel">Samuel F. M’Cleary</persRef> and several other
							members of the City Government— I examined several volumes, of the town

							found entries of the birth of the four daughters of <persRef

						<p>I found entries also of the birth of nine children of <persRef

							numerous entries of the births of the name of Adams, having apparently
							no relation to <persRef ref="adams-henry">Henry Adams</persRef> of Mount
							Wollaston and Braintree— There are four children of <persRef
								ref="adams-alexander">Alexander</persRef> and <persRef

							of <persRef ref="adams-nathaniel2">Nathaniel</persRef> and <persRef

							specially to Henry Adams, for ten heads 40 acres at a rate of 3

							of each of my essays on certain characters of <persRef

						<p>Yesterday Morning about 4. O’Clock I was awakened by the ringing of
							Bells, and on rising found it was a fire blazing in the direction of
							Quincy point, which proved to be the English goods Store of <persRef
								ref="whitney-john3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Whitney</persRef>—which had been broken open, robbed and then set on
							fire— His loss is heavy, and said to be without insurance— He is a very
							worthy, respectable man, whose neighbours sympathise with him in his
							misfortune— <persRef ref="parkman-francis">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Francis Parkman</persRef> preached here this morning
							from Philippians 2.5. [“]Let this mind be in you which was also in
							Christ Jesus: 6. Who being in the form of God— 8 and being found in
							fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death,
							even the death of the cross— 9. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted
							him, and given him a name which is above every name”— The Discourse was
							upon the excellent Christian virtue of humility—but this is a much
							controverted passage, and D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman omitted
							from his text part of the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and the whole
							of the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> verse— The words in the common
							English Bible thought it not robbery to be equal with God, <persRef
								ref="thomson-charles">Charles Thomson</persRef> translates did not
							think it robbery to be like God— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman
							dined with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>, and
							preached in the afternoon from 1. Corinthians 15.33. [“]Be not deceived—
							Evil communications corrupt good manners.[”]— This discourse was
							introduced with some account of the peculiar character of <persRef
								ref="paul">Saint Paul’s</persRef> preaching, his learning, his
							acquaintance with the Hebrew Law, and the Grecian Literature, and his
							address in always adapting the arguments of his speeches to the feelings
							and prepossessions of his auditory— The Sermon however, upon the dangers
							of evil communications, was eloquent, pathetic and peculiarly adapted to
							the young— Among the cruel and dreadful consequences of evil
							communications, he touched upon those which led to infidelity; and
							related an illustration of it the case of an aged woman upon whose death
							bed he attended; and who in bitterness of Soul told him that she found
							it utterly impossible to form a conception either of the Love or the
							fear of God— There was also in this discourse an affecting and elaborate
							description of the process of depravation as it takes place in an
							unguarded young man going from a country village into a populous city
							and falling into bad company— <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> E. Price Greenleaf</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> spent the Evening here—
							Having omitted last Sunday to read a Sermon of <persRef
								ref="parker-nathan">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Parker’s</persRef>, I read this Evening two—the 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> on Solicitude for the revival of
							Religion; which he considers not with much favour; as an indication that
							the revival has been preceded by criminal neglect—and the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> upon amusements—preached at the annual
							thanksgiving of 1828. His sentiments in favour of innocent amusements
							are liberal.</p>

						<p>Boston— Probate Court— G. Fuller— Quincy.</p>
						<p>Heavy rain, almost the whole day— But I had promised to meet <persRef
								ref="fuller-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Fuller</persRef> at the probate Office in Boston this morning, and
							went accordingly with <persRef ref="dumphy-thomas">Thomas</persRef> in
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> Chaise and one of
							my own horses— I called first at the probate Office, then at Charles’s
							Office for a few minutes where I met <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Spooner</persRef>; then again at the
							probate Office where M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller shortly
							afterwards came in— I presented my third account as Administrator de
							bonis non with the will annexed of <persRef ref="boylston-thomas2">Thomas Boylston</persRef>— I presented to the
								<persRef ref="phillips-willard">judge</persRef> all the documents in
							my possession, shewing the proportion of the sum recovered for the old
							accounts of the Cargo of the fair lady, to that which is equitably due
							to the Estate of Governor Gill, and the Representatives of his Nephew.
							There is no evidence whatever of the right of <persRef ref="gill-moses2"
								>Governor Gill</persRef> to any part of the money except that which
							is produced by me; and neither M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller nor
							the judge could even suggest the precise amount to which the
							representatives of the late <persRef ref="gill-moses">Moses
								Gill</persRef> have an equitable claim— But when I suggested that
							the note from the late Moses Gill should be deducted from the amount,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller said he supposed that note
							must be presented to him ad administrator, and the judge said that he
							did not think he had any authority to direct its allowance— I enquired
							whether having recovered the money not only as administrator of Thomas
							Boylston, but as attorney with a full power of the late Moses Gill, I
							had not such a lien upon it as would enable me to reserve so much of the
							sum recovered as would enable me to pay the note to <persRef
								ref="boylston-alicia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Boylston</persRef>— The judge hesitated; and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Fuller said the heirs of the late Moses Gill were under an
							impression, that he had been wronged— That at the time when the note is
							dated he was non compos mentis— And he said he himself had believed that
							Gill was then under guardianship— In this however he added he found he
							had been mistaken— I said I had never heard a surmise or whisper that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gill was under guardianship, or I
							never should have received from him a power of attorney— The judge
							finally proposed that we should fix upon some other than a probate day,
							and when he would not be disturbed by the business of other persons, and
							when he might deliberately consider the whole subject. We accordingly
							agreed upon to-morrow week, the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of this
							month at 10. O’Clock— I then called at <persRef ref="loring-ellis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellis Gray Loring’s</persRef> Office—
							He told me that he should very shortly reply to my Letter; but that he
							had only yesterday received answers from <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sedgwick</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Staples</persRef>, to the
							enquiries he had addressed to them in consequence of my Letter, and
							their answers did not entirely agree together— As to the act of 15. May
							1820. he was informed there had been a decision by <persRef
								ref="baldwin-henry">Judge Baldwin</persRef> in the U.S. Circuit
							Court of Pennsylvania, that this act gave no jurisdiction to the Courts
							of the United States in cases of Piracy committed on board of a
							foreign-vessel— I came home to dinner under a heavy rain, which
							continued till Night— Call at Charles’s about Sunset. </p>

						<p>Copious, but moderate rain, all Night and the whole of this day.— This
							was the day of the autumnal exhibition at Harvard University, which I
							had been summoned to attend, as a member of the Committee of the board
							of Overseers— I had intended to have gone into Boston with <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>; and thence in the hourly
							omnibus to Cambridge;—but the weather and a severe cold prevented him
							from going to Boston, and I concluded to confine myself to the house and
							write— My grand-child <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny</persRef>
							was unwell, and confined this Evening to her <persRef ref="hellen-mary"
								>mother’s</persRef> chamber— <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C.
								Smith</persRef> cannot leave hers, and was this day notwithstanding
							the storm visited by <persRef ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Holbrook</persRef>— I went at the dusk
							of evening up the hill to see Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4"
								>his wife</persRef>, confined with Colds— I retrieved one day of
							arrears in this diary, still leaving two— Wrote two pages of a wretched
							address upon Education to be delivered next week at Braintree, and in
							the evening wrote a Letter to <persRef ref="andrews-john2">Doctor
								Andrews</persRef> of Newbury-Port, to send with the Letters from
								<persRef ref="boylston-edward2">Edward Boylston</persRef>’<hi
								rend="strikethrough">s Letters</hi> to <persRef
								ref="wigglesworth-edward5">Edward Wigglesworth</persRef> which he
							had lent me— I received a day or two since, a long Letter from the
								<persRef ref="bigelow-andrew">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								Andrew Bigelow</persRef> of Taunton, enclosing, a slip from a late
							Boston Courier in which is published a Letter from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow to <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2"
									>Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> H. A. S. Dearborn</persRef>,
							respecting a discovery by <persRef ref="dixon-joseph2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Dixon</persRef> of that town,
							of an art of transferring copies of prints, engravings, and books by a
							lithographic process, similar to the taking duplicates of manuscripts
							with a copying press—upon which however it is a great improvement,
							inasmuch as it takes off a perfect copy, without any apparent injury to
							the original, and by the means of the lithographic stone, can multiply
							the number of copies ad libitum— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow
							sent me also two specimens of this mode of transfer—one of a page from
							an arabic grammar, and the other of a card of <persRef
								ref="gillott-joseph">Joseph Gillott</persRef> the Steel pen-maker—
							In the Letter to Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Dearborn, there is an
							extract from a Paris public journal of the present year announcing as a
							new discovery in the arts precisely the same invention by a French
							printer named <persRef ref="dupont-paul">Dupont</persRef>— But M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dixon claims his invention as having been
							published in 1832.— I had already received some weeks since a Letter
							from <persRef ref="marston-john3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Marston</persRef> of Taunton, with a page of the Arabic Grammar
							transferred by the same M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dixon—and the
							lithographic copy of my Letter of<space/>February last to <persRef
								ref="hackett-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hackett</persRef>
							sent me by him from London appears to have been made by the same or a
							similar process— I have also received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="bowen-dijah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dijah
								Bowen</persRef> at Brighton enclosing a Letter to him of 5. October
							1839. (of 29. Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1830) from <persRef
								ref="gedeon-pierre">Peter Gedeon</persRef>, authorising him to
							recover the Land to which Gedeon supposed himself entitled; and to
							dispose of it for the benefit of his wife— This is no competent power,
							and will not serve as an authority for a petition to Congress— Another
							claim perhaps more likely to succeed, and certainly as equitable, is
							commended to my care, by <persRef ref="hayward-nathan">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Nathan Hayward</persRef> of Plymouth
							in a Letter of 7. Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> for the extension of
							the benefit of the Pension Laws to the warriors who served in the Indian
							Wars, from 1783 to 1795— He was at that time a Surgeon in the Army. </p>

							incurring of any expense for the celebration— The fear was that I should
							be chosen to deliver the Address. They finally by a vote of 28 to 22
							appointed a Committee of 7. to confer with Committees from the towns of
							Braintree and Randolph, upon the expediency of holding a joint
							celebration by the three towns.— Charles his wife and <persRef

								>children</persRef> dined with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"

							and one horse in which he, and Charles and I—and Charles’s boys, John
							and Charles went to the pine hill grove—open examination of which we
							found about one third of the trees had been cut down, and carried away;
							it is impossible to ascertain by whom I found a few black and white oak
							acorns, and a few shagbark walnuts; and I determined to have the whole
							grove close shaven to the ground— Charles and his wife spent the Evening
							with us. </p>

							several months past Mary has repeatedly consulted a female physician in
							Boston by the name of <persRef ref="hunt-harriot">Hunt</persRef>, for
							the complaint of her daughter in the ear, which affects her with
							deafness— I advised her last Evening to consult <persRef

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newcomb told me also of the

							the centennial celebration, is from a fear that my Address would
							propitiate favour to me among the people, and make it more difficult to
							displace me at the next ensuing election. But it is extremely doubtful
							to me, whether I can or ought to accept the appointment to deliver the
							address even if it should be proposed to me, for it must be delivered
							towards the close of the next Month of May, in the busiest days of the
							next Session of Congress— I received nearly a month since a Letter from
								<persRef ref="hall-frederick">Frederick Hall</persRef>,
							corresponding Secretary of the American Historical Society at
							Washington, with a resolution of that Society, inviting me to prepare
							and deliver a discourse for the Society, at some time during the ensuing

							President of that Society— I am ashamed to say I have not yet answered
							that Letter— Three days since I received a Letter from <persRef

							Mechanic Apprentice’s Library Association, in behalf of the Lecture
							Committee of that Society, inviting me to deliver a Lecture before them
							on the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> or 14<hi rend="superscript"

							Anti-Slavery Society of that City propose to hold a fair in the latter
							part of the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> month, the proceeds to be
							applied to the furtherance of the Anti-Slavery cause in that State— And

								<persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> and <persRef

							beautiful seedling trees fruit and forest, from 5 to ten years old, not
							one in twenty of which will survive the next summer— I have parted with

								>Beale’s</persRef> house, and which I might have lived to see bear

							and forest trees from the seed; and to see all my labours of twelve
							successive Summers scattered to the winds before my eyes— For this and
							the two preceding days I have been buckled down to incessant labour in

						<p>Heavy Rain great part of the night and all the morning of this day, with

							enormously dull, upon Education to be delivered next Thursday afternoon,
							in <persRef ref="storrs-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							kind, depress my Spirits, rob me of time which should be devoted to
							useful and pleasing studies, waste the small faculties which God has
							given me for better purposes, and gratify by weak compliance with
							unreasonable requests idle and foolish curiosity, by the most thankless
							of labours— This is my deliberate judgment— Yet I have not firmness
							inflexibly to resist every such application, and the first of my duties
							is neglected— I suffer my vanity to be wheedled by flattery into a hope
							that these Discourses will last, though no second Edition of any one of
							them has been called for, from the Oration at Quincy in 1831. to the
							Jubilee of the Constitution at New-York last April— I had intended to
							finish the one upon which I am now engaged to morrow; but am so
							entangled with it, that I fear I shall not be able to bring it to a
							close within one or two days more— I went this afternoon to the Quincy
							Stone bank—deposited the Bills received from <persRef
								ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef>, and made a draught for
							small bills— The Pennsylvania Bank of the United States, and all the
							Banks in Philadelphia have suspended Specie payments— The Banks of
							Baltimore, of the State of Delaware and of the District of Columbia have
							followed the example— So have those of Providence, Rhode-Island. Those
							of New-York and Boston have not—and have determined that they will not.—
							A Resolution which it appears to me they will not be able to carry
							through. On the morning upon which I received <persRef
								ref="whittier-john">John G. Whittier’s</persRef> Letter, I saw
							Venus, just risen dazzling bright as morning Star. The thought occurred
							to me of taxing her for some lines for the Philadelphia female

						<p style="text-align: center;">To the Morning Star— Seen rising 5. A.M— 16.
							October 1839.</p>
						<lg>
							<l>Bright Star of Morning! welcome to mine eyes!</l>
							<l>More lovely, than at even-tide’s decay.</l>
							<l>For now thou comest with the dawning ray;</l>
							<l>And soon the glorious lord of light shall rise.</l>
							<l>Anon his splendor shall emblaze the Skies:</l>
							<l>And thy own flame in his shall melt away</l>
							<l>But mingled with his radiance, thine shall play.</l>
							<l>With lustre, though unseen, that never dies.</l>
							<l>Oh! Morning Star, of Man’s immortal Soul!</l>
							<l>When shall thy beams irradiate the pole.</l>
							<l>Redeeming Earth from Midnight’s ebon sway?</l>
							<l>Dispel the gloom of Slavery’s deadly shade—</l>

							<l>And glow with promise of unclouded day? </l>

						<p>A great change from warm and sultry weather last Night to severe cold and
							a Northeastern gale which swept the sky this day. Heard <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>,
							this morning from Isaiah 25:15.— “We have made a covenant with Death.”
							It was a funeral discourse on the occasion of the decease of two young
							men in this town in the course of the last week: the <persRef ref="u"
								>youngest son</persRef> of the late <persRef ref="phipps-thomas"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Phipps</persRef>, about 19. of
							consumption, and <persRef ref="adams-josiah3">Josiah Adams 3<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi></persRef> son of <persRef
								ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi></persRef> of Dysentery after 3 days illness aged 17. There
							was a mere transient allusion to these incidents, which scarcely
							admitted of more; although the untimely, sudden death of one of these
							youths and the lingering extinction of the other, furnished occasion for
							much of the common place lamentation upon the uncertainty and
							disappointments of human life. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt did
							not take that course, but I have never heard a sermon from him, which
							left so little impression upon my mind as this upon the covenant with
							death. But his afternoon Sermon made amends—from Proverbs 4:7. [“]Wisdom
							is the principal thing, therefore get wisdom.” This was excellent, and
							practical— He remarked on the several different senses in which the word
							Wisdom is used in the Scriptures: tho’ he did not perhaps fully remark
							the difference between the sense in which it is used in the old and in
							the new Testament— The fear of the Lord in <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon’s</persRef> proverbs is the beginning of Wisdom— Solomon
							personifies her, and gives her the combined attributes of Piety and of
							Prudence— In the new Testament there is the wisdom from above and the
							wisdom from beneath— In its derivation it seems to be synonymous with
							knowledge; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt discriminated between
							them; as also between knowledge and the kindred properties of Learning
							and Genius.— His analysis of these several qualities was ingenious and
							judicious— After enlarging upon all the excellent uses of wisdom, and
							the duty of cultivating it he pointed out the several sources from which
							it is to be acquired—from the exercise of the reason—from self
							command—from the conversation of the wise—from experience—from
							prayer—from books, and especially from the Bible—concluding as he had
							begun by repeating his text— Wisdom is the principal thing—therefore get
							Wisdom— Returning home over the Hill from the afternoon service, I saw a
							ship coming into the harbour of Boston from Sea, under full sail and
							with a ten knot breeze. I read the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Sermon of <persRef ref="parker-nathan">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Parker</persRef>, the second on Amusements; from which in this he
							seems to dissuade, though he appeared quite indulgent to them in the
							former one— He cautions young men and women against the excess of them
							with great fervour— I was unable as I feared to finish my Braintree
							Lecture though I toiled upon it, great part of the day— I have been
							obliged to examine the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Books of <persRef
								ref="robertson-william3">Robertson’s</persRef> History of America—
							Much of <persRef ref="hutchinson-thomas">Hutchinson’s</persRef> first
							Volume— <persRef ref="winthrop-john2">Winthrop’s</persRef> Journal, and
							all the Colonial, Provincial and Commonwealth Laws upon the subject of
							Schooling and Education— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> here this Evening.

								ref="boylston-alicia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Alicia
								Boylston</persRef>, of 5. Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1830. for

							to remit the interest— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Curtis promised

						<p>My morning was so much absorbed, as the last Evening had been, in
							reviewing the correspondence of <persRef ref="boylston-thomas2">Thomas
								Boylston</persRef>, relating to the Fair Ladies Cargo, and in
							computations to ascertain the just amount of the proportion due to the

								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came to take me in
							his Chaise into Boston— It was a bitter cold ride, though with a clear
							sky and bright Sun; and the 8 miles were run in three quarters of an
							hour— I called first at Charles’s Office, where I saw <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spooner</persRef>; and at ten
							O’Clock went to the probate Office where successively came in the
								<persRef ref="phillips-willard">Judge of Probate</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="fuller-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nathaniel Curtis</persRef>.— The judge settled the principle of the
							proportion, of the sum recovered as the proceeds of the Fair Lady’s
							Cargo, which will be due to Governor Moses Gills’ Estate, but in making
							the computations, could not come to the precise and specific sum— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller did not accede to the proposition
							of compromise made by <persRef ref="u">his wife</persRef>. He said it
							was necessary for him to proceed cautiously— That others besides himself
							were interested in the transaction, and that he must not commit himself
							by chances to precipitation— He thought it necessary to have for the
							sanction of what he should do, the approbation of the judge of probate
							for the County of Worcester, from whom he received, his Letters of
							Administration. It was therefore proposed by the judge that his decree
							in this case should be postponed till next Saturday fortnight the 9<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of November; and in the meantime he gave
							an order that I should advertise in a public newspaper, for which I
							named the Boston Courier, the presentment of my Account of
							Administration. I then said that I had hitherto presented no claim of
							allowance to the Administrator, and should now leave it without argument
							to the judge to decide what it should be— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Fuller said he hoped I would consider that the heirs of the late Moses
							Gill were poor persons I said that as the agent and Attorney of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gill I should make no charge at all— That
							my claim was for administration upon the Estate for which I had given
							bonds in the penalty of eighty thousand dollars— The judge said this was
							the most favourable statement of the claim, for the heirs of Gill that
							could be made—and would save them 100 dollars— After some consideration
							of the case he said that 600 dollars was the lowest sum that he could
							allow for the charge of administration, and asked if I should be
							satisfied with that— I said entirely—he fixed it therefore at that—and
							informed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller that the proportion of it
							upon the Gill claim would be 46 dollars— I called again at Charles’s
							Office, and came home with him to dine— <persRef ref="foster-charles3"

							of 20 June last given for my pew N. 74. in the Stone Temple—he paid in
							the Bills of the Quincy Stone Bank, which I immediately went and
							deposited there. I shall withdraw it all within a few days— The Banks in
							New-York and Boston hold out firm appearances of determination not to
							suspend their specie payments, but as this must depend on the will of
							others, and not their own, I can have no confidence in them— I saw the
							Sun rise this morning from the Southeast corner of <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house; and my Chronometer
							agreed to the fraction of a minute with the American Almanac. Charles,

								ref="jarvis-leonard">Leonard Jarvis</persRef> took tea with us, and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett delivered at the town Hall,
							before the Quincy Lyceum a lecture upon the literary character of the

								>r</hi> Everett had delivered this Lecture two years ago at some
							college— It was then printed, and he had sent me a copy of it— After he
							finished this evening, he said to me, that it must be an old affair to
							me— I said I had read it with pleasure, renewed by his repetition of it
							now— He repeated it altogether from Memory, as is his usual practice,
							and that of his brother <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward</persRef>.
							It was received with great and unremitted attention by a very crowded
							hall; two thirds of the auditors at least being women— After dropping us
							at my house, they proceeded to their own home at Roxbury— <persRef
								ref="sampson-rachel">Miss Rachel Sampson</persRef> the seamstress of
							65 was all last week at Charles’s, and since yesterday morning has been

							two American Potatoes given me by <persRef ref="colman-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Colman</persRef> the State
							Commissioner of Agriculture— Several Oxen two or three weeks since were
							let into the enclosure where these Potatoes were planted, and the whole
							Night, had trampled down uprooted and devoured them. Yet there is at
							least a bushel from the French, and half that quantity from the American
							seed; all as large, and looking as well as the seed that was put into
							the ground. </p>

								Southard</persRef> and <persRef ref="lawrence-amos">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Amos Lawrence</persRef> were here just
							at noon; and as <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and I
							were preparing to go to Braintree— Their visit was short— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard had come all the way from Jersey
							City, to deliver this Evening an introductory Lecture before the Boston
							Lyceum. He said that the thought had not occurred to him till after his
							arrival at Boston yesterday morning— That he had then asked himself what
							he came for, and he had answered it was because he was a fool— This same
							feeling has been one of my motives many times for declining to go
							hundreds of miles to deliver an Oration or Address— But I went this day
							with Charles to Braintree— We dined at one with <persRef
								ref="thayer-minot">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Minott
								Thayer</persRef>—and instead of two or three friends as I had
							expected there was a company of about 30 persons, and a dinner for at
							least 60. He said it was all the produce of his own farm; but there was
							Turkey, Mongrel Goose, Ducks, Ham Squab pie, a large variety of
							vegetables— Apple and cranberry sauce, and lemonade to drink, but
							neither wine nor cyder— Of the company there were <persRef
								ref="storrs-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Storrs</persRef>, <persRef ref="perkins-matthew">Matthew
								Perkins</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">Hitchcock</persRef>, and sundry

								ref="thayer-stephen">Doctor Stephen Thayer</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hollingsworth</persRef> I
							knew— The rest of the company were strangers— After a short and
							temperate dinner, we repaired to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Storrs’s
							Meeting house, where the services of the day were performed— First an
							Anthem—then a prayer by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Blagden, then
							another Anthem. Then a Lecture or Address by me upon Education—then a
							prayer by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Storrs—another Anthem and the
							benediction— I was an hour and twenty-five minutes in the delivery of my
							discourse; having omitted about as much as would have occupied
							twenty-five minutes more— The attention of the auditory was unremitted,
							and I witnessed no appearance of weariness or dissatisfaction— The house
							was just conveniently filled, but without being crowded, and there was
							room for more— At least two thirds of the auditory were women— After the
							service I went by invitation of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Storrs to
							his house, where I saw <persRef ref="storrs-anne">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Storrs</persRef>, and met several of
							the neighbouring clergymen and their wives.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Storrs urged us to stay to tea, but I declined, and we
							reached home just at Sunset.— Found Charles’s <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">wife</persRef> at <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">our</persRef> house and <persRef

								>Fanny</persRef>— Her <persRef ref="hellen-mary">mother</persRef>
							after much reluctance has consented to consult him, and the child is
							severely indisposed. Charles spent the Evening here, but his wife went
							home— The day was fine; of the precise kind commonly called Indian
							Summer.— My voice held out uncommonly well; but I found myself hoarse in
							the evening and much fatigued— The relief of a heavy burden removed was
							ample compensation for this, and at the close of Evening I retired with
							a grateful heart </p>

						<p>Another Indian Summer day— I had no fire in my chamber but towards
							evening it grew so cold again that it was uncomfortable for writing.
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thomas Greenleaf</persRef> and <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef> were here with new
							leases of Town lands to <persRef ref="hayden-solomon">Solomon
								Hayden</persRef>, and<space/><persRef ref="u">Whicher</persRef>,
							prepared by the Selectmen— That to Hayden was conformable to the rule
							agreed upon with the Selectmen; but the Deed to Whicher had a clause
							inserted stipulating that if at the end of the term the parties should
							not agree to renew the lease, the Grantors—the town, should pay for all
							fruit- and ornament trees raised on the ground, at an appraisement. No
							such stipulation had been proposed or mentioned, and we all agreed not
							to assent to it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf said that
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marden</persRef> had
							made application for a half an Acre of the land on Mount Ararat; and the
							question was what ground rent should be required and for what term of
							time, the lease should be given— Both the gentlemen thought that half
							the price paid for the half-acre on the Hancock lot would be a suitable
							estimate for a house lot of the same dimensions on Mount Ararat—but I
							recommended that if that should be assumed as the standard the lease
							should be only for 50 years;—and that if the lease should be for 99
							years the ground-rent reserved should be twenty dollars a year to which
							they agreed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf spoke also of the
							late Town-meeting to consider the question of celebrating next May the
							second centennial anniversary of the incorporation of the town of
							Braintree. A party opposition to it has been gotten up and the vote in
							favour of it was 28 to 22. A committee of 7 were chosen, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> T. Greenleaf Chairman, to confer with
							Committees from the towns of Braintree and Randolph— But the Committee
							are all whigs. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf said the
							Committee were to meet next Tuesday— I said there had been several
							intimations in the Newspapers and otherwise that the towns might think
							of charging me with the duty of delivering the centennial discourse— I
							wished him to inform the Committees that it will not be in my power—
							They both said they thought the best thing will be to drop it altogether
							and have no celebration. I said I hoped not— I thought the celebration
							would be gratifying to the People, and useful for preserving a memorial
							of a history of the three town. But independent of the fact that the day
							falls at the very busiest period of the Session of Congress, and when it
							may be impossible for me to absent myself, if I should deliver the
							address I should feel it my duty to give a particular account of the
							history of each of the three and should need the whole winter to look up
							and search out the documents of all three—a work which it would be
							utterly impossible for me to perform— And finally I would in no case
							perform at such a celebration with a party opposition against it—
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> went to Boston this
							morning—returned to dine, and were here this Evening— <persRef
								ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Holbrook</persRef> is here, and is treating <persRef
								ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny</persRef> for a severe bilious fever—

							his <hi rend="italic">general</hi> professions of a disposition to aid

								>Preston</persRef> and <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy

							proved by the encouragement which they gave to the mean and selfish
							project of <persRef ref="robbins-asher">Asher Robbins</persRef> to make
							a University for him to be placed at the head of it, the investment of
							the whole fund, more than half a Million of dollars in Arkansas and
							Michigan State Stocks; and the dirty trick of filching ten thousand
							dollars from the fund last Winter to pay for the charges of procuring
							it, are all so utterly discouraging, that I despair of effecting any
							thing for the honour of the country or even to accomplish the purpose of
							the bequest the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men— It is
							hard to toil through life for a great purpose with a conviction that it
							will be in vain; but possibly seed now sown may bring forth some good
							fruit hereafter— In my report of January 1836.— I laid down all the
							general principles upon which the fund should have been accepted and
							administered. I was then wholly successful— My Bill passed without
							opposition, and under its provisions the money was procured and
							deposited in the Treasury in gold— If I cannot present the disgrace of
							the Country by the failure of the testator’s intention by making it the
							subject of a Lecture, I can leave a record for future time of what I
							have done, and what I would have done to accomplish the great design, if
							executed Well— And let not the supplication to the author of all good,
							be wanting. </p>

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="cunningham-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cunningham</persRef> of Dorchester; in the morning from Matthew
							22.12. “And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither, not
							having a Wedding garment? and he was speechless.” The discourse began,
							by a reference to a doctrine of the followers of <persRef
								ref="swedenborg-emanuel">Emmanuel Swedenborg</persRef> that the Soul
							of every individual after death, will range among the spheres till it
							shall find a place for the special enjoyments for which it is fitted.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cunningham remarked that this was a
							mere conjecture, concerning our condition in a future state, of which we
							know absolutely nothing— But he said that such was undoubtedly the
							condition of the Soul in the present world, and that no man could have
							any other enjoyments than those for which he is fitted, and that without
							the wedding garment, he cannot partake of the marriage feast— And that
							as there was no evidence that any moral revolution or change was
							effected upon the Soul by the mere operation of death, there was good
							reason for the Swedenborgian opinion, on this point— I believe this
							doctrine neither peculiar to Swedenborg nor original with him— I have
							heard it preached long before the name of Swedenborg was known in this
							Country— But I know not whether the selection of the text was in
							absolute good taste— The parable alludes to manners and customs familiar
							to the age and country in which it was delivered but not strictly
							applicable now— Wedding garments that is dresses more costly than those
							usually worn are now common, for the parties to the marriage; but they
							differ from them by no peculiar distinction, nor do the guests of the
							feast wear them at all. Court dresses are still worn and required in the
							palaces and presence of kings, but not in this Country, though we have
							still military uniforms— But even at this day, a king who should send
							his servants into the high ways, when the wedding was ready, to bid as
							many as they should find to the feast, and then upon seeing one of them
							without a Court dress, should call him to account, and order him to be
							bound hand and foot and cast into outer darkness, would not pass for a
							good king. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cunningham dined with us—and
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> who was his
							Classmate at Cambridge. The afternoon Sermon was from Ecclesiastes 3.1.
							“To every thing there is a Season.” The illustrations of this thought
							throughout the whole chapter are so numerous and so diversified that it
							would seem as if nothing could be added to them. But the most earnest
							part of the discourse was an admonition to the auditory that there is
							not only a time to be born, but a time to die, a consideration,
							peculiarly incumbent upon a man at my time of life to ponder— I read a
							Sermon of Barrow, upon the text thou shalt love thy neighbour as
							thyself—full of thought and closely argumentative—but the style is
							obsolete and the reasoning is dry and crusty, as if it were the solution
							of a problem in Algebra— <persRef ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi

								<persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">E. Price Greenleaf</persRef>,

								Smith</persRef> of North Bridgewater came with a Letter from
								<persRef ref="whitman-eliab">Eliab Whitman</persRef>, Chairman of
							the Town Committee of whigs of that town, stating that for several weeks
							past their whole community has been disturbed and agitated by the
							discussion of political subjects, and as the annual State election
							approaches, the excitement increases and pervades more or less the whole
							community— That the democratic party having been for several years past
							in a minority, have of late become exceedingly active in making
							proselytes, and that they have recently procured a gentleman to lecture
							on the currency; and that there is to be a second, and a third Lecture—
							That the whig citizens of North-Bridgewater have recently determined to
							meet their enemies in their own way, by a lecture touching the general
							features of the National Administration and also those of this State,
							and that immediate application should be made to me to perform this
							Service— He refers me for particulars to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Smith, who for the last two years has been a Representative of the Town
							in the general Court, and urged me very earnestly to comply with this
							invitation— I said to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith that I was
							grateful for the confidence manifested by my fellow-citizens of
							North-Bridgewater; and regretted that my engagements, and the short time
							within which it would be necessary for me to proceed to Washington made
							it impossible for me to comply with their request— I said further that I
							approved generally of the principles and measures of the Administration
							of the State; and disapproved of almost every thing done by the federal
							Administration— But that I had always professed not to be a party man,
							and wished to preserve that character to the end— That I had sometimes
							supported important measures of the administration against the general
							opinions of the whig party; and that even now upon the subject of the
							license Law, to which they were devoted, I had already given the opinion
							that it would be desirable it should be modified— I made sundry other
							observations to shew that some other person would be more suitable for
							this service than me— He then asked me if I could recommend any person,
							but I knew of none— He finally said he would go and consult <persRef
								ref="winthrop-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert C.
								Winthrop</persRef>, and I thought he could do no better— He said
							that his business would not admit of his going to the General Court next
							year and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitman who was an able lawyer
							would be the whig candidate to go in his place— He took M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitman’s Letter to shew to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Winthrop, and said he would send it to me
							to-morrow— I received also a printed circular from Washington City
							signed <persRef ref="butler-joseph3">Joseph Butler</persRef>, with a
							Prospectus for a Newspaper to be called the Washington whig and
							solicitation of patronage— <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My
								wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							went to Boston this afternoon, and returned in the Evening— He went in
							the morning and returned to dine— I dined with him; and from after
							dinner till dark visited My seminary and Orchard where I planted a row
							of Acorns, shagbark walnuts and Peach stones— Almost all my seedling
							trees in the garden have been uprooted and transplanted— </p>

							the Town of Braintree— That the Address should be delivered in the Town
							of Braintree; and that I should be requested to deliver it. I told them
							that I was very glad they had agreed that the commemoration should be
							held, and perfectly satisfied that it should be in Braintree. But I
							regretted that it would be impossible for me to deliver the Address in
							as much as the day would be the 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of May,
							at the very busiest period of the Session of Congress when upon full
							consideration I had come to the conclusion that I could not be justified
							in absenting my self from my duty in the House of
							Representatives—besides which there was much information respecting the
							history and Statistics of the three towns, which the speaker for the day
							should be collecting through the whole succeeding winter, but which
							would be altogether impossible for me. Doctor Alden then said it would
							be quite immaterial that the Discourse should be delivered precisely
							upon the day of the anniversary— If this should happen on a Sunday, it
							would necessarily be postponed till the next day; and if for one day it
							might as well be postponed to any reasonable time— He asked if I would
							undertake to deliver the discourse on some day after the close of the
							Session next Summer or fall, I said I would, and they are to report this
							to the committee, of the three towns— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thayer remained and took tea here, after the other Gentlemen went away—
							He presented me a vote of thanks from the inhabitants of Braintree in
							Town Meeting on the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October, for my
							discourse of the preceding day, and a request of a copy of it for
							publication; and a vote that it be printed— <persRef

						<p><persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef> called upon me
							this morning, with a subscription paper to raise two thousand dollars
							for the erection of an Astronomical observatory at Cambridge, to be
							connected with Harvard University. He said he had made it a point of
							honour to offer this paper first to me, and I subscribed for one hundred
							dollars— The condition of the subscription was that the amount
							subscribed should be at least two thousand dollars— He said he had no
							doubt of raising the money, and should subscribe one hundred dollars
							himself— That they had already fixed upon the spot for the building, and
							that <persRef ref="bond-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bond</persRef> was engaged upon the work— This has been many years
							an object of earnest desire to me, and of long regret that I had not the
							means of founding such an establishment myself— I once offered 1000
							dollars towards it; but the design was of a larger establishment, and
							the subscription could not be filled— <persRef ref="cranch-christopher"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pearce Cranch</persRef>, and
							<persRef ref="greenleaf-mary2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Mary

								Torrey</persRef> who keeps the school where our children usually
							attend; though the sickness of <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna"
								>Fanny</persRef> still very severe has now confined her a full week
							to her bed—and her Sister <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Mary-Louisa</persRef> was sent up the hill this evening, to sleep
							at <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house— <persRef

								Stebbins</persRef>, with <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C.

							at <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beale’s</persRef>— Soon after <persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams</persRef> came in and
							called out Charles’s <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">wife</persRef>. She
							had been in to Boston this morning alone, and consulted <persRef
								ref="warren-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Warren</persRef>,
							about a complaint under which she has been some time suffering, but
							concealed— He informed her that it was a schirrous cancer and that it
							must be immediately removed. She came back and determined to have the
							operation performed the day after to-morrow. But she wishes it may not
							be made known, to her daughter Elizabeth, or to Mary W. Harrod who is
							now here with her— And she wishes equally to conceal it from her
							daughter <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								John Angier</persRef> at Medford— Her purpose is therefore to induce
							Elizabeth and Miss Harrod to go the day after to-morrow on a visit to
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Angier at Medford, and to send a
							note to-morrow to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Warren, to come the
							next Morning at ten O’Clock to perform the operation— M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles Adams is to write the note, and I
							am to take it to Boston to-morrow.— <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles are to go to the House to be
							there when D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Warren is to use the knife,
							but M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stebbins only is to be with her
							Sister— This is a sudden and a severe trial— I am now kept almost
							constantly in the house and cannot even visit my Garden, Nursery
							Seminary and Orchard— As I approach the close of the paper I had laid
							out for my lecture upon the Smithsonian beques, I find that one Lecture
							will not contain all that I wish to say upon the subject— I must
							overflow into a second—</p>

						<p>Boston— Historical Society, Meeting— Quincy</p>
						<p>I went into Boston this Morning, in <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> Chaise with one of my own horses and <persRef
								ref="dumphy-thomas">Thomas</persRef> to drive me— I went immediately
							to the chamber of the City Council in the old Town-house and examined
							the fair copy of the most antient town records— I wished to find the
							entries respecting Mount Wollaston and Braintree; but they were so
							numerous that I could only copy three or four, and could even read only
							a few pages, and noon came, and I was obliged to repair to the Meeting
							of the Historical Society.— The <persRef ref="winthrop-thomas">President
								Thomas L Winthrop</persRef> was in the Chair—I returned <persRef ref="marshall-john3">Fairfield’s</persRef>
							journal, and the Manuscript Sermons of <persRef ref="wheelwright-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wheelwright</persRef> and of
								<persRef ref="fiske-moses">Moses Fiske</persRef> which I had

								ref="bradford-gamaliel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gamaliel</persRef> Bradford who died suddenly since the last

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel D. Barnard</persRef> to his
							election as an honorary member of the Society was read, and with it he
							sent nine of his discourses and addresses to literary Societies—
								<persRef ref="harris-thaddeus">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thaddeus Mason Harris</persRef> my Classmate after reading a report
							of his late proceedings as Secretary of the Society resigne that office
							stating that he was going to the South to be absent several Months— He
							told me he was writing a life of <persRef ref="oglethorpe-james">General
								Oglethorpe</persRef> for publication and was going to Georgia to
							collect materials. And he asked me for a Letter of recommendation—
								<persRef ref="berrien-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Berrien</persRef> the President, and <persRef ref="tefft-israel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tefft</persRef> the Secretary of

								ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> P. C.

							Letter and Documents I have received from him respecting the Adams
							family, and promised to send him the genealogical table of <persRef
