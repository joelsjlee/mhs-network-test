								ref="furness-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Furness</persRef> of Philadelphia, who preached from 1. John 4.1.
							[“]Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits, whether they
							are of God.” The main argument of the discourse was an exhortation to
							try the Spirits of others, to make us acquainted with our own— <persRef
								ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet Welsh</persRef> there— Immediately after
							the morning Service, Charles took me home to Quincy, and his boy
								<persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef> with us— After
							dinner we heard M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt, from Luke 6.31.
							“And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them
							likewise”—a discourse exhibiting the true character of Christianity.—
								<persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> took the occasion explicitly to declare his
							disapprobation of Slavery, though in very mild and moderate and in the
							discharge of what he believed his duty as a minister of religion—
							Shortly after the Service Charles returned with his Son to Boston— I
							read the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon of the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef>; upon the covenant of God with the Israelites— His
							text is 29. Deuteronomy, from the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> to
							the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> verse—preached on the afternoon of
							a communion day; and the drift of his argument is that the covenant of
							Christians with God by the communion, is the same as the covenant of the
							Israelites with God, as recorded in that chapter of Deuteronomy— I had
							occasion to use this incident in my late Discourse to the New-York
							Historical Society; and might perhaps have taken some hint form this
							Sermon if I had read it before— I visited with <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E. Price
								Greenleaf</persRef>, the seedling trees, in my Nursery Garden and
							Seminary— The succession of four or five frosty mornings, has been a

							peach, cherry, plum, pear and apple trees— I found it impossible this

							thought that would apply to claims for revolutionary service, but it
							manifestly does not; as it expressly refers to what the deceased would
							have been entitled to in 1835.— He said however that his Grandfather
							besides his service in the Hancock frigate, had also served two years
							before on land; but he could not tell whether the whole of both services
							amounted to six Months— I promised to examine the pension Laws, and
							write to <persRef ref="white-albert">Albert White Esq<hi

								<unclear>his</unclear> Son Thomas Arnold would now be entitled to a

						<p>Showery morning, and day, which confined me to the house— 2<hi

								<persRef ref="otis-george">G. A. Otis’s</persRef> third Tusculan
							upon grief— The French Translation by <persRef ref="bouhier-jean"
								>President Bouhier</persRef> excellent. The Dialogue of the

							introduced, all in the same manner, and the auditor is a mere

								>th.</hi> Book of <persRef ref="horace">Horace</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="lollius-marcus">Lollius</persRef>— I wanted very much the other

								>Pope’s</persRef> version of the vixere fortes ante Agamemnona, but
							I could not remember it— I am enquiring now why Pope took only two of
							the passages of that Ode for imitation— I tried it myself, and was all
							day hacking at these lines.</p>
						<lg>
							<l>Think not because I drew my birth</l>
							<l>From rugged rocks, and barren earth</l>
							<l>My verse is doom’d to die— </l>
							<l>The deathless musings of the mind </l>
							<l>To torrid climes are not confin’d.</l>
							<l>Or <hi rend="strikethrough"><unclear>. . .</unclear></hi> Greece’s
								cloudless sky—</l>
							<l>Of Antient Poet’s tis confess’d</l>
							<l>The Bard of Smyrna sings the best</l>
							<l>Yet not alone he sings—</l>
							<l>The Teian Minstrel tunes his lyre</l>
							<l>The Lesbian lass’es lip is fire—</l>
							<l>The Theban spreads his wings</l>
							<l>List! Romans list—to <persRef ref="virgil">Maro’s</persRef>

						</lg>
						<p>and here I stick on the borders of nonsense— But how many hours of this
							day I wasted in rumination to proceed with this Ode— I believe Pope gave
							it up in despair—for he has left out the final passages of the whole
							composition—and his last four lines are tautological repeating the same
							thing twice over. <persRef ref="francis-philip">Francis’s</persRef>
							translation of this Ode is beautiful; but the translation by <persRef
								ref="duncombe-william">Duncombe</persRef> senior and the imitation
							by <persRef ref="duncombe-john">the younger</persRef> are both very
							indifferent— The Ode is said to be in three parts, between which there
							seems to be no natural connection. The Lollius to whom it was addressed
							is also to have been very unworthy of the praise which it lavishes upon
							him.</p>

						<p>Morning visit from a young man named <persRef ref="u">Pierce</persRef> of

								ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> came out from Boston, but
							returned home to dine— He brought out with him his son <persRef
								ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef>, and left him here— I
							labour painfully with my Letter to the Petitioners, and hammered out of
								<persRef ref="horace">Horaces</persRef> Ode 9 Book 4. as follows</p>
						<lg>
							<l>The crispy curls of <persRef ref="priam">Priam’s</persRef> boy</l>
							<l>Seduced the Spartan bane of Troy.</l>
							<l>And many a Maid beside</l>
							<l>And myriads, on the roll of fame</l>

							<l>Who for their Country died.</l>
							<l>Long before <persRef ref="agamemnon">Agamemnon’s</persRef> days</l>
							<l>Heroes deserv’d the meed of praise,</l>
							<l>And sparkling Glory’s crown—</l>
							<l>But perish’d in the Abyss of time—</l>
							<l>No bard had they with lay sublime</l>
							<l>To herald their renown</l>
							<l>The pebble on the beach out shines</l>
							<l>The Diamond sleeping in the mines</l>
							<l>And hidden from the day—</l>
							<l>The Virtue that remains conceal’d</l>
							<l>And Dulness in broad light reveal’d</l>
							<l>Alike forgotten lay.</l>
						</lg>
						<p>There are many ideas in this Ode, that I find it utterly impossible to
							manage; and yet I cannot shake off the desire to turn out an imitation
							of it— The vegetation of my Nursery Garden and Seminary has taken a
							start from the rain of yesterday, but of my last autumnal plantations,
							nothing but apple-seedlings appear and among these none of any promise—
							Several of my seedling budded Apple-trees, and one Cherry, put forth
							this Spring their first blossoms. Many of the Peaches are in full bloom;
							but I cannot yet ascertain how much of the fruit has been nipp’d in the
							bud by the frost. I wrote to <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph

								ref="lollius-marcus">Lollius</persRef>, excepting the last Stanza,
							which had escaped my recollection in bed but which contains too
							beautiful an idea to be omitted— What a magnificent panegyric upon his
							friend! What consciousness of his own transcendent powers! what a
							sublime conception of the gifts of poetical inspiration! But then what a
							sad falling off that all this praise was bestowed upon a worthless man!—
							A misfortune to me is that I cannot enjoy the music of this ode— The
							harmony of all the metrical Stanzas of Horace is lost to my ears
							excepting the Sapphic. It is remarkable that Horace who avows himself a
							very swine from the sty of <persRef ref="epicurus">Epicurus</persRef>,
							whenever he inculcates virtue resorts to the Stoic fountain— His Lollius

							had imitated the whole of it, nothing that he ever wrote would have been
							more exquisite— In watching my seedlings, I took up a young elm of the
							third years growth, leaning too much on the seminary fence next the
							gate; and set it out in the Northern border of the Orchard— I likewise
							cut off a shoot from the old stump of an elm in the orchard, with one
							root adhering to it, and set it out on the Northern border, with a view
							to ascertain whether it will live in its separate state, and whether the
							old stump will survive—an experiment repeated from that of the black

						<p>I finished my second Letter to the Petitioners which I intended to make

							promised however and cannot consistently withhold my reasons for being
							opposed to the immediate abolition of Slavery in the District of

							method in the composition of this paper, which will not give
							satisfaction to any party—and there is in it perhaps too little respect
							for persons.— The obligation of meeting adversaries face to face, and
							the admonitions of Prudence are greatly at variance with each other—
							This Letter weighs much upon my Sprits—but it must go— I visited my
							Garden, Nursery, Seminary, and Orchard— My cherry seedlings yesterday
							transplanted have an unpromising appearance— I went to the large Elm
							just beyond the turn of the corner towards <persRef

						<p>Foul weather. A cold Northeast storm confined me to the house almost the

							is such seduction in a library of good books that I cannot resist the
							temptation to luxuriate, in reading, and because I have so much to write

							The remark of Junius that the arguments of tyranny are as despicable as

								Morison</persRef> of New-Bedford preached this morning from Acts
							17.23 “For as I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar
							with this inscription—<hi rend="small-caps">To the unknown God</hi>”
							This is a very common text, but the application of it, by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Morison, was peculiar to himself; for he
							said that this altar inscribed to the unknown God was the human heart—in
							other words that religion was a natural <hi rend="italic">want</hi> of
							man universally felt— That the revelations of the Holy Scriptures were
							bestowed to supply that want, and that the natural man, without that
							supply was always groping for it in the dark— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Morison is a graduate of Harvard University of 1831, and
							looks consumptive, as do almost all the young clergymen in this part of
							the Country— He dined with us and preached after dinner from Luke 15.24.
							“And they began to be merry”— His application of this text was as
							unusual as that of the morning. It is taken from the parable of the
							prodigal Son; but the substance of the Discourse was an argument to
							refute a prejudice very common especially among young persons that
							religion is dull and gloomy— I read the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							Sermon of the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>—a thanksgiving Communion,
							remarkable for some very democratic observations upon kings and
							royalty—which at this day it would be dangerous for any minister to make
							in monarchical Governments, and he adds that what he says of kings is
							equally true of Republics— I wrote half a page of the introduction to an
							Essay upon Astronomy, of which I fear that I shall make nothing. Copied
							also some of my own verses— Saw the Sun just risen, and saw him set from

							subscribed for one copy and paid a dollar for the year’s subscription—
							Charles spent the Evening here, and it set in for a steady rain— At the

							for October 1834. a record of solitary morning walks of 4 and 5

							I took up my manuscript first pages of <persRef ref="adams-john">my

							accomplish any important public good— Charles was here this Evening
							without his wife— I found one shagbark seedling walnut shoot 20 inches
