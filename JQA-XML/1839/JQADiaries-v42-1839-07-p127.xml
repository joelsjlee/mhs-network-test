                            their celebration, and informed them that I had declined several
                            invitations elsewhere, and proposed to pass the day at home— We had much
                            conversation upon the abolition of Slavery; the right of petition, the
                            license law, and phrenology, upon all which our opinions, were very
                            discordant; but which we discussed in perfect good humour— <persRef

                            it has brought me into collision with all the whimsicals of that school.

                            law, which is raising an insurrection in the State— I asked these
                            Gentlemen to excuse me for speaking to them without reserve, and gave
                            them freely my opinion that it is a vain attempt to enact Laws against
                            the strong current of public opinion— I told M<hi rend="superscript"

                            could not be carried into execution. He said there had been 60000
                            petitioners for the law, and only 15000 against it— I said that
                            throughout the American Revolutionary war, there had been about 500
                            members of the British House of Commons for the acts which had produced
                            it, and from 40 to 50 against them— The great difficulty of unpopular
                            Laws is not in the enactment, but in the Execution— <persRef

                        <p>Independence day. 63.</p>
                        <p>Spent at home, and only hearing in quietude all the distant din this
                            world can keep— I visited my garden, Nursery, Seminary and Orchard, and
                            worked in them sufficiently for the exercise of the day. I topped three
                            of the most luxuriantly growing seedling peach trees of the present
                            year, in the Seminary plats, and observed that some of the white, black,
                            red, chesnut and English white Oaks, are just now putting forth new
                            shoots, while others are stationary. Some of the walnuts are forming top
                            buds to open next Spring as the horse chesnut has done.— The Ash, the
                            Elm and the Maple grow without intermission; and above all the Maples
                            from the Philadelphia seed— The growth of apple and pear seedlings is
                            almost universally stunted by aphides or green lice gathering round the
                            leading shoot at the top, followed by swarms of ants; while the curculio
                            or beetle bug prowling in the darkness of Night tops the Oak and the
                            walnut— The same or another nightly bug perforates the leaves especially
                            of the Apricot trees, till every leaf upon the tree is reticulated and
                            decussated with interstice betwixt the intersections like <persRef
                                ref="johnson-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Johnson’s</persRef> net work— The Ash, Elm and Maple are less
                            annoyed with insects and therefore grow more freely.— The growth of the
                            maple is beautiful— The leading shoot like the stem of a round spire of
                            grass, throws out at alternate right angles a pair of symmetrically
                            indented leaves, green on the upper, and whitish blue on the under
                            surface—the opening leaves assume a flat position, and the shoot pushes
                            them up two or three inches, spreading all the time in size, stretching
                            out upon a stalk, and opening another pair of leaves at right angles
                            with it.— This process is continued through the whole Season, and the
                            twig of the tree sometimes grows five feet in one summer. The English
                            while Oaks are again covered with acorns; though I fear this tree like
                            the black walnut will always be in <hi rend="italic">danger</hi>
                            <pb n="130" type="ms"/>danger of being killed by our winter’s frosts.—
                            Four of my ten transplanted seedling cherries in the Orchard are alive,
                            and two of them have considerably grown— The large mazzard cherry tree,
                            has scarcely born at all this year, and I found on it this day only one
                            unripe cherry. The red cherry trees in the garden have been thoroughly
                            stripped by the birds and by ourselves— The Strawberries have also been
                            gathered unripe— Currants reddening. <persRef ref="smith-joshua2">M<hi

                            to a Letter from him the Commissioner to me of<space/>February last.— I
                            had not this Letter at hand, and am apprehensive I left the file of

                            promised however to make search for it— He asked if it would be proper

                                    >r</hi> Lunt</persRef>, with a list of Books, which he was
                            desirous of consulting for the composition of his centurial discourse— I
                            had a large portion of them; but not all— Part of those I had he took
                            with him— I shewed him also the old papers which have descended to me
                            from <persRef ref="quincy-norton">uncle Norton Quincy</persRef>,
                            relating to <persRef ref="quincy-john">his father</persRef>, and to the

                            and among the rest I found an account of Guardianship of John Quincy, by
                                <persRef ref="brattle-thomas3">Thomas Brattle</persRef> dated in
                            1712. the year after John Quincy came of age— Thomas Brattle was the
                            husband of <persRef ref="brattle-elizabeth">Elizabeth Ting</persRef>,
                            sister to <persRef ref="shepherd-anna">Anna Ting</persRef> the wife of

                            married at the House of Thomas Brattle, that same night when Thomas
                            Brattle’s wife so suddenly died— This Thomas Brattle the guardian was
                            doubtless the son of the one at whose house Daniel Quincy was married—
                            He was graduated at Cambridge in 1676. the same year with the third

                            her chamber, and most of the day to her bed— At my visitation of the
                            Seminary, I measured several of my seedling fruit trees to mark the
                            process of their growth— Close to the Seminary gate, where I wish to
                            raise one Apple-tree to remain, I have five seedlings, the seeds of
                            which were sown, in the autumn of 1835 and which came up in the Spring
                            of 1836.— One of them has a strait stem 31 inches high; but at the top
                            of which this Spring the Aphis planted his Colony and stopped its
                            growth— Its side leaves have curled up, and it shews no sign of increase
                            for the present year another had made last year a stem about ten inches
                            high— Three or four inches of which died down last winter. A side shoot
                            came out this Season, and it is now two feet high, growing with fair
                            promise; from which I have almost daily pinched off the aphis and the
                            ant— The other three began the season with a promise, but have all been
                            stunted, and will come to nothing. One seedling budded cherry is 37
                            inches high—</p>

                                Benjamin Kent</persRef> in the morning from Matthew 28.9. [“]And as
                            they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All
                            hail. And they came, and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.— and
                            17. And when they saw him they worshipped him: but some doubted.”— The
                            text of his afternoon discourse escaped me—but it was part of a verse
                            merely naming <hi rend="italic">Heaven</hi>— There is some singularity
                            in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kent’s manner of delivery—an effort
                            too visible at the emphatic— His morning discourse, was a dissertation
                            and declamation, upon the fact that <persRef
                                ref="mary;marymagdalen">the two Mary’s</persRef>, and the disciples <hi
                                rend="italic">worshipped</hi> Jesus upon his first appearance to
                            them after his resurrection. The afternoon sermon was an enquiry more
                            curious than profitable as to the locality of <hi rend="italic"
                                >Heaven</hi>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kent’s health is very
                            infirm, and his appearance in the pulpit is pale and emaciated— His mind
                            is ingenious—inquisitive— poetical—but not generally pleasing— There was
                            a tincture of enthusiasm in both of his Sermons of this day, which is
                            infectious among the young clergymen from the Divinity School at
                            Cambridge. The word worshipped in these two verses means that they
                            kissed his feet— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kent dined with us.— He
                            is a graduate of Harvard University of 1820— In December 1827. and

                            1814.— But there was an endorsement upon it dated in 1828. purporting to
                            be from a clerk in the War Department, and stating that Gedeon was not
                            entitled to these 320 Acres of lands— This endorsement, M<hi

                            United States, and that no public lands had been granted to any person

                            in the Senate of the United States, for a repeal of the bounty on the
                            fisheries; and otherwise took a leading part in the House— He spoke of

                                William M. Cornell</persRef> some time Minister of the Orthodox
                            Church called this morning and said that he had been compelled by the
                            state of his health to give up his profession as a Minister of the
                            gospel, and had opened a school to prepare boys for College, and in
                            making references, for character, it might be useful to him, to give my
                            name, as other gentlemen of the town had authorized him to do.— I said
                            that with regard to his peculiar qualifications as a teacher, I had not
                            the pleasure of being sufficiently acquainted with him to speak of my
                            own knowledge; but that to the respectability of his character, and his
                            integrity so far as he was known to me, he might rely upon my
                            disposition to render him any service in my power. And if called upon I
                            would cheerfully bear testimony in his favour. Just four years ago, M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell in the heat of youthful zeal for
                            orthodoxy wrote certain strictures upon the moral and religious
                            character of the Inhabitants of this town which were published and
                            roused their resentment vehemently against him—and Town Meetings were
                            held, and a large Committee was raised, of which I was chairman, to
                            vindicate the character of the town— We had a correspondence with M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell, and reported Resolutions
                            declaring his aspersions false and groundless; which were adopted and
                            published, and there it ended— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell’s
                            burning zeal was cooled, and his conduct has ever since been prudent and
                            exemplary. He suffers now with a disease in the throat called
                            Bronchitis, which is said to have become almost an epidemic among the
                            preachers— This afternoon I made out a second account as Administrator

                            [“]And <persRef ref="samson">Samson</persRef> called unto the Lord, and
                            said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray
                            thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the
                            Philistines for my two eyes. 29. And Samson took hold of the two middle
                            pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the
                            one with his right hand, and of the other with his left. 30. And Sampson
                            said Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his
                            might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that
                            were therein: so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they
                            which he slew in his life.”</p>
                        <p>The second Luke 23.33. [“]And when they were come to the place which is
                            called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors; one on
                            the right hand, and the other on the left. 34 Then said Jesus, Father,
                            forgive them; for they know not what they do.” There was a Volume of
                            Sermons in the single consociation of these two texts— The discourse was
                            a contrasted parallel between the lives and deaths of Sampson and of
                            Jesus—as exemplifications of the Mosaic and of the Christian systems of
                            Religion and Morals.— The vindictive spirit of the antient Law, and the
                            forgiveness of injuries, the blessed Spirit of the new, are all
                            concentrated in the last words of the two sufferers, and the mere
                            reading of the two texts flashed with such vivid light on the minds of
                            the auditory, that the developments of the Sermon, which could of course
                            be nothing more than outlines, hardly sustained the expectations raised
                            by the text.— The afternoon Sermon was from Acts 10.15. “And the voice
                            spake unto him again the second time; What God hath cleansed, that call
                            not thou common.”— This text also was pregnant of much more matter than
                            was delivered in the discourse— That vision of <persRef ref="peter"
                                >Peter</persRef> not only broke down the Wall between the Jew and
                            Gentile—it abolished the whole ritual of the Levitical law; and there is
                            something remarkable in the figurative character of the vision— Peter
                            being very hungry falls into a trance, and sees a vessel laden with all
                            sorts of animals clean and unclean—and hears a voice commanding him to
                            kill and eat— By the Levitical Law he had forbidden to eat of any of the
                            animals which that Law had declared unclean. Peter accordingly, hungry
                            as he is objects to eat of the unclean animals in the visionary sheet
                            and receives the command in the text.— Thereupon the messengers from the
                            centurion <persRef ref="cornelius">Cornelius</persRef> come to him; and
                            he is commanded by the vision to receive them— By a corresponding vision
                            Cornelius had been commanded to send the messengers to Peter requesting
                            him to come and preach at Cesarea— He goes according—preaches Christ
                            crucified to the uncircumcised Gentiles— The holy Ghost falls upon them
                            and they are baptized— The rite of circumcision, the seal of the
                            Covenant with <persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef> is virtually
                            abolished—all the exclusive privileges of the chosen people are
                            superseded—and the doors of the kingdom of Heaven are opened to all
                            mankind— It is exceedingly remarkable, and deserves a much deeper
                            investigation than I am able to give, how Jesus in his life time

                            last to her importunities and to her faith— Saying also that he brought

                            proclaimed peace on earth and good will to men. Commanding his disciples
                            with his last words, when he last appeared before them after his
                            resurrection, to go and teach all Nations—baptizing them in the name of
                            the father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost— That all power is given
                            unto him in Heaven and in Earth—and that he will be with them even to
                            the end of the world— Yet leaving the questions so entirely unsettled,
                            how far his System had abolished the Levitical Law; and how far it was
                            retained, and whether the heathens to be received into his church
                            without adopting the Jewish ritual or not— In the Sermon on the mount he
                            had expressly referred to several principles in the moral part of the
                            Law, and had enjoined upon his disciples principles more pure and
                            benevolent— In his parables of the prodigal Son, of the good Samaritan,
                            and of the defaulting Steward, he had undermined without abrogating the
                            morals of the Mosaic dispensation, while he had emphatically confirmed
                            its precepts of obedience to God and benevolence to man, and containing
                            the whole summary of human duties— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s
                            afternoon text and Sermon opened to a very small auditory the whole of
                            this mystery without diving very deeply into it— I read the 13<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon of the 12<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>,
                            upon the last Judgment—the last of the whole collection— I began to read
                            them on the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July 1832. and have
                            constantly read one Sermon every Sunday, when I have been at Quincy from
                            that day to this— I know not if there is extant a more valuable
                            collection of Sermons; and if I have derived little or no benefit from
                            them it has not been for want of intrinsic merit in them, but from the
                            listlessness inattention and frailty of memory in myself— I deplore my
                            own insufficiency, which I am too sensible increases with revolving
                            years, and for which there is no remedy but in humble and fervent prayer
                            to the father of Spirits that the decay of body and mind inevitable to
                            man in the lapse of time, may be neither aggravated nor accelerated by
                            any wilful failure, or neglect of my own.— I went at the time of the
                            setting Sun to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> House—
                                <persRef ref="campbell-archibald">Campbell</persRef> and <persRef

                            afterwards came to our house, and took leave— They are going to-morrow
                            for Albany— <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">E. Price
                                Greenleaf</persRef> also called at Charles’s, and with him and

                            of the Evening with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"

                        <p>I have answered a very earnest invitation of <persRef
                                ref="leavitt-joshua">Joshua Leavitt</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="stanton-henry">H. B. Stanton</persRef> to attend a great
                            National Anti-Slavery Convention to be held at Albany, on the 31<hi
                                rend="superscript">st.</hi> of this month. I have declined attending
                            on the express ground of my dissent from the Declaration of Sentiment of
                            the American Anti-Slavery Society of 1835. and especially to the belief
                            and affirmation “that every American citizen who retains a human being
                            in involuntary bondage as his property is (according to Scripture)
                            Exodus 21.16 a <hi rend="small-caps">Man Stealer</hi>.[”] I have taken a
                            direct issue upon that affirmation, with the American Anti-Slavery
                            Society and all its affiliated associations— The conflict is fearful but
                            certain as I am that this declaration is neither true nor just, I have
                            no doubt of ultimate success in the encounter—</p>

                        <p>The Diary of yesterday, consumed too much time, and occupies too much
                            space; and in retrieving my arrears of index I found a record of three
                            days 26. 27. and 28 September 1835. which I had forgotten, and thought I
                            had made no record of them at all. I had even made that entry yesterday
                            in my index, and was now obliged to deface the book by erasing it, and
                            making the proper entry.— There came this afternoon a man by the name of
                                <persRef ref="goodhue-samuel2">Samuel Goodhue</persRef>, a Soldier
                            of the Revolution, 74 years of age, now residing in Boston, who said he
                            had heretofore entertained a strong desire to see and talk with <persRef
                                ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>, but had been disappointed—
                            That he had only once seen me in company with <persRef ref="u">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Armstrong</persRef> when I delivered
                            the Eulogy on <persRef ref="madison-james">James Madison</persRef>— But
                            he had long wished to converse with me, and to ask sundry questions, a
                            paper of which he had in his pocket.— He said he had been a member of
                            the Common Council, with my dear departed Son <persRef
                                ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, but was not a member of that
                            body now. I listened to his questions and answered them as well as I
                            could— He kept throughout for at least two hours the style of
                            interrogation, affirming nothing himself, but disclosing clearly enough
                            his own opinions by the character of his enquiries— He is an ardent
                            patriot of our revolution, and now a whig abolitionist head over ears—
                            He abhors <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew Jackson</persRef>, for
                            his Bank war, and his removals from Office— He thinks slaveholding a
                            crime, which ought to be abolished though it should cost the dissolution
                            of the Union; and he thinks as it was wrong in the representatives of
                            the free States to stipulate for the delivery up of fugitive Slaves, a
                            bad promise is better broken than kept, and that we ought to consider
                            that pledge in the Constitution null and void— Here is the Roman
                            Catholic principle that faith is not to be kept with heretics, in all
                            its glory. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goodhue is sincere and honest
                            in these opinions, and to warrant his opinion that a breach of faith
                            with Slaveholders is an obligation of duty he instanced the case of
                                <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>,
                            who upon his conversion at Damascus, broke his promise to the high
                            priest, to bring all the Christians he could find, in bonds to
                            Jerusalem.— I told him the conversion of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
                            Paul was by a miracle—a special command from Heaven—and until we should
                            receive a like command, it would be best for us to keep our faith— He
                            was not satisfied with this reasoning, and insisted still on the enquiry
                            whether a wrongful promise were not better broken than performed. He
                            finally asked me for copies of several of my publications for which he
                            offered to pay. but I gave him copies of my Letter to the inhabitants of
                            the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District of
                            Massachusetts of 13. August 1838. of my three Letters to the Petitioners
                            at the last Session of Congress, of the Eulogy upon <persRef

                            Port, and of the jubilee of the Constitution— And he gave me a printed
                            pamphlet Biography of the family of Goodhue at Ipswich in 1636. and
                            Genealogy to 1833; together with an Address, by <persRef

                        <p>There has been I believe for weeks not a single day without rain; and
                            hitherto very few warm days, scarcely one warm night— My observations of
                            my seedling plants are barren and unfruitful, and yet constitute some of
                            the harmless pleasures of my life— My warfare with insects is like that

                            leading shoot of all my Apple and Pear-trees, though I stain my fingers
                            and thumb with a saffron colour in pinching them off— I found this
                            morning rolled up in two leaves at the top of the leading shoot of a
                            pear seedling in the Seminary a nest of palmer worms just hatched not
                            bigger than emmets, but which in ten days would have been each an inch
                            long, and would have spread their web over the whole tree— The creeping

                        <p>Finished reading with my two Granddaughters the Old Testament which we
                            began on the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of November last; and we
                            read the first chapter of Matthew— This is the third time of reading it
                            with <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> and the second
                            with <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny</persRef>— We read without
                            commenting and without explaining. The Roman Catholics forbid the
                            reading of the Bible not only to children, but to all others unless
                            licensed by a priest— Protestants claim the right of reading it without
                            license— But many Parents are scrupulous about reading or suffering
                            their children to read the whole, but I make mine read it all; for I
                            have observed that children to whom certain parts are interdicted are
                            always the most familiar with them— But often as I have read the Bible
                            through, and anxious as I have been to understand it, there are
                            numberless passages especially of the prophets, which are and ever will
                            remain to me perfectly unintelligible. There is one source of knowledge
                            which I have not sufficiently explored—and that is a strict observance
                            of the Chronology of the prophets, comparing each prophesy, with the
                            narratives in the Books of the kings, and of the Chronicles of the
                            several times when they were written— Of the greater prophets too it is
                            to be observed that there is no unity of subject or of composition in
                            the book that bears only one name— Thus the prophesies of <persRef
                                ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef> embrace a period of 62 years, and were
                            delivered at different times during the reigns of four successive kings
                            of Judah. The recorded prophesies commence with Isaiah, 760 years before
                            Christ and finish with <persRef ref="malachi">Malachi</persRef> 397
                            years before Christ. Some of the smaller prophets seem to have preceded
                            Isaiah, and that of <persRef ref="jonah">Jonah</persRef> against Nineveh
                            is marked as one hundred years earlier— Most of the prophesies relate to
                            the Babylonian captivity and to the rebuilding of the Temple— The
                            Apocryphal books imperfectly fill up the interval, between the close of
                            the prophesies, and the birth of Jesus.</p>

                            certainty the proportion of Gill’s interest in it, to the whole—and also
                            for the vouchers of the award of the Commissioners against the French
                            Government on the whole claim— We considered the question of taking out
                            or causing to be taken out Administration de bonis non of Governor Gill,
                            and administration upon the estate of the last Moses Gill, which M<hi

                            worst men, who ever rose to distinction in this Country— The occasion of
                            my great loss of time this day was the search for my Diary at the close
                            of the year 1835. the years 1836 and 1837— In these there are intervals
                            without record and which can never be filled up. I wish there were more
                            reason to regret the discontinuous character of the notation of my
                            declining years— The search for papers leads from one subject to
                            another, and I am always obliged to close it abruptly. But it took three

                            verse is a part of that mysterious vision of the prophet <persRef

                            to the end— The man with the measuring read and the line of flax in his

                            from the sanctuary.— In Revelation 22.2 it is called the tree of life,
                            and it is said that the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the
                            Nations— This is all allegorical imagery— The tree, whose fruit is meat,
                            and whose leaves are medicine is the Bible and D<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Frothingham gave an admirable exposition of its character as
                            furnishing the nourishment to sustain life, and the medicine to heal
                            disease— He commented upon its unity of purpose from the first verse of
                            Genesis to the last chapter of Revelation—upon th all comprehensive
                            nature of its subject to the condition and welfare of man in this world,
                            and the next—upon the long extent of time over, which it ranges—the
                            number and variety of the writers by whom it was composed: its
                            adaptation to the wants and its tendence to elevate the nature, and to
                            promote the happiness of mankind— All this was discussed with eloquence
                            such as I have seldom heard— The Doctors afternoon text was from
                            Deuteronomy 34.8. [“]So the days of weeping and mourning for <persRef
                                ref="moses">Moses</persRef> were ended”— A field vastly narrower
                            than that of the morning—but it commenced with a magnificent panegyric
                            upon the character of Moses; and discoursed upon the duties of weeping
                            and of mourning—for a time and then of ceasing to mourn— D<hi

                            with a young man from Hartford Connecticut by the name of <persRef

                            introductory Lecture to a course intended to be given next winter by an
                            association of young men in that city formed about one year ago, and who
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morgan said possess already a library
                            of 8000 volumes— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierpont said that in
                            the general movement to mental cultivation which had for several lears
                            past; Connecticut, heretofore distinguished for her intelligence had
                            fallen in arrear of the Spirit of the age, and this was a very
                            commendable effort of the young men of Hartford to redeem their lost
                            ground— Their wish was that on my way to Washington next Winter I should
                            take the occasion to deliver this introductory Lecture at Hartford— I
                            declined with the same grateful sense of the kindness implied by the
                            invitation, and upon the same general principle that as it would be
                            utterly impossible for me to comply with one half the invitations to
                            similar services which I receive, I find myself under the necessity of
                            declining them all— I observed that I had made an exception for the
                            Discourse recently delivered at New-York, because the occasion, was of
                            so peculiar a character, and I was under so great personal obligations
                            to the Society, of which I had been more than 25 years an honorary
                            member, and having already declined two or three invitations to
                            discourse before them, I had thought it a peremptory duty— I returned to
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierpont the volume of <persRef

                            me that the new practice of Lyceum Lecturing had already put down two
                            theatres in Boston, and he hoped would shortly put down, all the rest.
                            The Lectures furnished a substitute for theatrical entertainments— They
                            were constantly and fully attended, and the theatres were deserted—
                                <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef>, also paid
                            me a morning visit, and spoke of the proceedings at the meeting of the
                            board of Overseers last Thursday— I asked him when his History of the
                            University would be published, but he could not give a decisive answer—
                            He said the first volume was printed and stereotyped and part of the
                            second— He had hoped the publication would be ready before commencement;
                            but now believed that would be impossible— I told him I wanted to see

                            his eldest daughter— From this Instrument it appears that William Ting
                            had left by Will, all his property to his four daughters in common, and
                            that they had all administered upon his Estate— On the back of the

                            a will; but it had not been legally authenticated— I was detained so
                            long at the Probate Office, that the Meeting of the Historical Society
                            was over before I reached their apartment— I left a copy of my

                            have been published of the third Series of the Transactions of the

                            was here after breakfast and returned to Boston homeward— I could not
                            prevail upon him to stay and dine with us. He went round my garden,
                            nursery and seminary. and saw my seedling trees— He discovered one large
                            white plum on a tree near the summer house cellar in the garden, which I
                            have been five or six years cherishing as a cherry tree. He says that
                            not one of the English white Oak Acorns which he sowed last autumn has
                            come up— I have only two— I continue myself to vegetate and to do
                            nothing; and in tracing the causes of my imbecility find two which
                            consume more of my time than all the rest put together. 1. The hours
                            wasted in visiting my seedling plants—and 2. The daily mail of
                            Newspapers Letters and pamphlets— Thus at least two hours of this day
                            were absorbed in reading an Address touching the Influence and progress

                            written, from which it appears that his father had then placed him for

                            In 1652 John Hull was appointed Master of the Mint, and coined the

                            Letter mentions the writers having just received information of the
                            death of the common mother Joanna Hoar, who died in December 1661. and
                            that Daniel Quinsey had been dangerously ill but had recovered. He

                            remarkable part of this Letter is that it tells of the difficulties

                            then in London—26 years of age and six years before his marriage— He
                            could not have been long in England, for the year before, in 1675 he had
                            been admitted a member of the antient and honourable Artillery company.
                            It begins however by referring to a preceding Letter of 20. October
                            1675. in which he had announced to Daniel Quinsey the death of two of
                            his Sisters. This Letter does not name them, but announces the death of
                                <persRef ref="reyner-john">John Reyner</persRef>, minister at Dover,

                            Edmund Quinsey his Executor, and gave him land in England at a place
                            called Gildreson, for and in behalf of Judith, and also a considerable
                            part of his Estate here; but Edmund Quinsey declined acting as Executor—
                            It would seem as if Daniel Quinsey had gone to England to purchase arms,
                            and other iron ware; much of the Letter relating to that speculation— He
                            knows not how to advise Daniel, as to the time of his coming home, but

                        <p>Heard <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Lunt</persRef> this morning from Hebrews 4:3. [“]For we which have
                            believed do enter into <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>.” The Discourse was
                            an exposition and Commentary upon the import of the word rest in this
                            text, in which rest he said there was more of Heaven, than in any other
                            word in human language— The conclusion was that rest could be obtained
                            by the practice of religion and of beneficence.— The text was
                            susceptible of large disquisition upon the influence of <hi
                                rend="italic">belief</hi>, in the acquisition of rest— But upon this
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt scarcely touched. It is certain
                            that Christ and his Apostles dwell much upon the irresistible power of
                            belief, which is the foundation of Christian Faith— I would wish to see
                            reconciled with each other many passages in the New Testament, which
                            seem to have different bearings on this principle of belief— In some
                            places Christ performs miracles to reward the belief of those who ask
                            them— In others to convince those who disbelieve— In one place it is
                            said that he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not perform many mighty works,
                            because of their unbelief In another he says that a wicked and
                            adulterous generation ask for a sign, but no sign shall be given them,
                            but that of the prophet <persRef ref="jonah">Jonas</persRef>; meaning
                            thereby his own resurrection. The difficulty to be solved is why the
                            evidence of miracles should be given to those who already believe, and
                            denied to those who need help to their unbelief. When John the precursor
                            baptized Jesus, the Spirit of God descended and lighted upon him in the
                            likeness of a dove and a voice from heaven was heard, saying this is my
                            beloved son in whom I am well pleased— This was seen and heard by
                                <persRef ref="johnthebaptist">John the Baptist</persRef> who even
                            before he performed his function knew that Jesus was the Christ— And yet
                            when he was cast into prison—he sent into prison by <persRef
                                ref="herodantipas">Herod</persRef>, he sent his disciples to Jesus
                            to enquire whether he was the true Messiah, or whether they were to wait
                            for another— Jesus without answering the question directly, tells the
                            disciples of John, to inform him of the miracles he had performed, and
                            adds blessed are they who shall not be offended in me— The miracles were
                            the evidence of the Mission, and yet they did not produce conviction
                            upon great multitudes who witnessed them. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Lunts afternoon text was John 6:38. [“]For I came down from Heaven, not
                            to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.” The deep
                            humility of this declaration; the conformity to it of the whole career
                            of Christ upon Earth, and the lesson of duty taught to all the disciples
                            of Christ both by the precept and the example were set forth in the
                            discourse with great animation and impressive eloquence.— Having read
                            through the Sermons of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, I
                            began this day with a volume of Sermons by <persRef ref="parker-nathan"

                            read; entitled “Man accountable to God alone in matters of Faith.” Very
                            good but very common place— The text James 4:12.— All the Protestant

                            upon it— I did not begin upon the Memoir of the Author— About Sunset I
                            went up to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> porch, and

                            proceeds of the Fair Lady’s cargo in the stock of the French loan, of

                            and said the proper person to take the Letters of Administration was
                                <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cobb</persRef> one
                            of the sons in Law— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis had a draught

                            that he is not indebted to the drawer. This is the second of Cutler’s

                            are to launch the President of 2400 tons.— Imagination cannot conceive
                            the result of this approximation of space upon the globe, combined with
                            the swarming multiplication of the human species— <persRef

                                >Gerrit Smith</persRef>, for I could not finish it— I visited my
                            seedling plants and observed with lingering emptiness of thought, the
                            different processes of Nature in the act of vegetation— My nursery is
                            now so crowded with a confused multitude of fruit and forest trees that
                            they crush the growth of each other— It is just one month since my
                            shagbark walnuts ceased to grow for this Season— Their leading shoots
                            from one to two feet long have hardened into wood, and at the top of
                            each of them is formed a bud, which will not open till next May. I have
                            about 20 of them from two to eight years old, which are growing with
                            favourable promise; but of all the nuts planted last fall, only four
                            trees have come up and with little prospect that any one of them will
                            survive the next Winter— Their growth the first Season is so exceedingly
                            small, that the stem usually dies down to the ground the first winter—
                            It sends up another shoot the next Spring which meets the ensuing
                            Winter, the same fate. Sometimes this yearly stem comes five or six
                            years succession, till a hard winter kills both stem and root.— Perhaps
                            one in ten gets over the first winter, and then throws up a hardy
                            flourishing stem; and the tree is secure— The Oaks fare much like the
                            walnuts, but their growth is so irregular that it is impossible to get a
                            straight stem for them— With the Horse chesnut, the Elm and Ash it is
                            scarcely possible to fail—and the white Maple outgrows them all. The
                            button wood and willow are propagated by slips, and also from self sown
                            seeds.— I have found it all but impossible to raise cherry or plum from
                            the Stone.— I have succeeded with a few berries of the Nettle tree, and
                            have several of them seven years old— The tall white maple in the
                            Seminary—one apple tree in its sixth year near the Summer house cellar,
                            one at the centre of the Nursery in its seventh year—one fronting my
                            chamber window, near the old Horse-chesnut and the flourishing budded
                            cherry in the Seminary, give me hope of coming to maturity though not in
                            my time, and by their constantly perceptibe growth afford me— The black
                            white, red, chesnut and black jack Oaks afford som amusement; but they
                            are so ungovernable that I scarcely notice them.— All the rest are
                            neglected.</p>
