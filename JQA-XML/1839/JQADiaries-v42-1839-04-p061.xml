								>Dauphin’s</persRef> Edition of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef> and the passage for which I was seeking—[“]Sed cum

							nulla carior, quam ea, quae cum republica est unicuique nostrum— Cari
							sunt parentes, cari liberi, propinqui, familiares, sed omnes omnium

							when I was a Senior Sophister at Harvard University, a military mania
							seized upon the undergraduates, and the Senior and Junior Classes formed
							themselves into a company calling themselves the Marti Mercurian band—
							It was the revival of an old company which had borne that name during or
							preceding the revolutionary War, after which it had been discontinued,
							but was now reinstituted in the heat of belligerent fervour against the
							insurgents— The company reorganized itself, chose a Captain, Lieutenant,
							Ensign—Adjutant, Sergeants and Coporals—obtained a loan of fire-arms
							from the Castle—drilled—paraded—bustled; and asked permission to go with
							the party from Boston, which took <persRef ref="shattuck-job">Job
								Shattuck</persRef>; which the College Government however declined to

							mine, no Scholar, but a fine handsome fellow six foot tall, was chosen
							Captain of this company; and my <persRef ref="cranch-william">Cousin
								William Cranch</persRef> was adjutant. I did not join them— When our
							Class was about to leave the University—the Chief Officers retired and
							their places were supplied by others chosen from the next Class The
							company had a ground parade, and Captain Vose on retiring from his
							command delivered to them a very handsome valedictory, as they were
							drawn up in the yard fronting Harvard Hall.— I was present as a
							Spectator, and was very <hi rend="italic">much</hi>

							on this passage from the Offices—Cari sunt parentes—&amp;c—for I had not
							then read the Offices and had never before heard the Sentence— It has
							never gone out of my memory since that day— At the library I read also
							in the Southern literary Messenger a severe review of <persRef

						<p>I bewilder myself more and more every day with my discourse, and am
							getting to be much discouraged. I see the necessity of making the
							address appropriate to the occasion, and feel as if I was all the time
							approaching to my subject without reaching it— The merit of it should
							consist in being exactly suited to that day and to none other.— But here
							forlorn and lost I tread; with fainting steps and slow, where wilds
							immeasurably spread seem lengthening as I go.— Concentration of much
							matter into small compass should mark the composition—rapidity of
							narration—bold dashes of character—contrasted glances at the results of
							the Confederation compared with those of the Constitution, and
							conclusions pointing with clear foresight to futurity—that is what I
							want, and what I cannot obtain— When I reflect how trivial this matter
							is, of reading a short historical disquisition to a private Society, I
							am ashamed of making myself a Self-tormentor about it—but such is my
							nature; and I shall have no quiet of mind till it is over, and perhaps
							then less than ever.— I was occupied this day till past one, with my
							task, and then went and gave a sitting to <persRef ref="charles-sm">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles</persRef> for my Portrait— The
							tension of mind all the morning was so great that when the pressure was
							taken off, an exposition of sleep came over me, and I was dosing all the
							time of the sitting to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles— He told
							me that he had heard <persRef ref="stuart-gilbert">Stuart</persRef> once

							the voyage of the Columbia and Washington, but of a subsequent
							expedition in a vessel called the Hope which sailed from Boston in

							1792. There is towards the close of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Volume a Letter from Robert Gray and Joseph Ingraham to the <persRef

							Letter from him to men, with reference to what had taken place two years
							before between the Spaniards and English at that place of which Gray and
							Ingraham say that they were witnesses, but I find nothing respecting the
							Columbia river— Ingraham’s journal is full of drawings; and of small
							maps of Islands and ledges of rocks, somewhat showy, but very
							indifferently executed, and there seems to be nothing of much value in
							the journal itself— Walks before and after dinner.</p>

						<p>Lingering along in my discourse, with the difficulties with which

							Morning worship at the Unitarian Church, and heard <persRef

							17.1. [“]And after six days Jesus taketh <persRef ref="peter"
								>Peter</persRef>
							<persRef ref="james">James</persRef> and <persRef ref="john"
								>John</persRef> his brother, and bringeth them up into an high
							mountain apart. 2— And was transfigured before them, and his face did
							shine as the Sun, and his raiment was white as the light.”— There is a
							mystery about the scene of the Transfiguration: which it seems to be
							presumption to approach. I had never heard a preacher venture upon it
							before— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cranch treated it with much
							delicacy and proper reverence— The narrative states no particular motive
							for this premeditated manifestation of glory to three of the Apostles
							apart from the rest. It is remarkable that John who was one of the three
							chosen witnesses of this glory says nothing of it either in his gospel
							or in his epistles, or in his apocalypse. But Peter in his 2<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> Epistle testifies to it— After dinner at
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Johns Church <persRef

							read the service for the first Sunday after Easter and <persRef

							6.37—[“]him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.” He said he
							preferred this for a text to the preceding half of the same verse,
							because that was supposed to contain the doctrine of predestined
							election and reprobation—, which had agitated the church for several
							centuries past and was like to do so for time to come. I went at half
							past 3. but the time of meeting was an hour later and I called at
								<persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T

							<pb n="66" type="ms"/>Bills— The debate in the Senate upon <persRef

								<persRef ref="cibber-colley">Cibber’s</persRef> brazen brainless

							as honest as the discussion in this dignified body upon this munificent
							and magnificent bequest— <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun’s</persRef>
							speeches on the subject are the very delirium of malignity— Grundy and
							Poinsett both spoke fair words— So did <persRef ref="woodbury-levi"
								>Woodbury</persRef> when I went to him about it— But I almost
							despair of doing any thing effective with it— I left with the
							Commissioner of Pensions M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Doane’s Letter
							respecting Abigail Lincoln’s Pension claim, and pressed him for a
							favourable decision upon it—he promised me a Report to-morrow. Returning
							home, I met almost at my door <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> M’Lellan</persRef> who requested me to attend a meeting

								ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fowler</persRef> has written him a Letter announcing his intention
							to leave them at the end of the present quarter— There were about 100

							Committee be appointed to wait on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler,
							and request him to withdraw his Letter of resignation— And another that
							the members of the Society will do all in their power to increase his
							compensation— The first of these Resolutions was debated with much
							acrimony, but passed by a vote of 50 to 12 pew holders and communicants—
							The women voting as well as the men—the second resolution passed without
							opposition— A Committee of 9 were appointed. I excused myself from
							voting, though a pew holder, because I was not a member of the Church—
								<persRef ref="parris-albion">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> A. K.
								Parris</persRef> was moderator, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Grundy was there— Another Letter inviting the Society to send a delegate

							special Session of Congress in September 1837. he says that <persRef
								ref="scott-winfield">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Scott</persRef>
							has settled it in his mind that he is to be the next President— <persRef
								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B.
								Johnson</persRef> was also here— Towards Evening there came <persRef
								ref="morgan-charles2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles W.
								Morgan</persRef>, of New Bedford, asking for advice— He said he and
							his partners had for years past made yearly contracts to furnish Oil for
							the Lighthouses along the shores— The contracts stipulate payment by the
							Government on the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of April; and they
							have been so paid several successive years— This year the contract is
							for 94000 dollars—but when he came for payment it was refused by the
								<persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>,
							because the Law prohibits payment upon contracts in advance— The
							contracts are made by the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Auditor
								<persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">Stephen Pleasonton</persRef>; and
							it was his casually using the word “in advance” that startled the
							Secretary of the Treasury who would otherwise have paid the money as he
							had done before— Morgan told him that he would be very glad to abandon
							the contract which was a very unprofitable one; but M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury advised him to consider whether
							if he abandoned the contract he would not be liable to a prosecution.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury had referred the case to the
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> who had said the
							Law must be observed— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morgan said he
							thought it very hard that he should be held responsible for his
							stipulations in the contract, and the Government under no obligation to
							perform theirs; and he said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury had
							offered to take the opinion of the <persRef ref="grundy-felix">Attorney
								General</persRef> in the case— I advised him to take the Secretary
							at his word— To require him to take a written opinion of the Attorney
							General, upon a written statement of the case— That in the Statement the
							facts should be included; that the same contract had been made several
							years in succession, and that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury
							had always made the payments till this year.— And to require specially
							the opinion of the Attorney General; whether, if the Government is not
							bound to payment at the day named in the contract, he can still be bound
							to execute it on his part— I did not think it could be considered as a
							payment in advance, as he must already be under responsibilities of
							payment for the supplies— And I advised him to tell M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury that if while <hi rend="italic"
								>the</hi>
							<pb n="69" type="ms"/>the Government refused payment as stipulated by
							their own Officer, and yet held him on pain of prosecution to the
							fulfilment of his part of the contract, he should petition Congress at
							their next Session, for indemnity and damages.— He said he would follow
							my advice— I had received a note from <persRef ref="stewart-delia">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stewart</persRef> requesting me to
							call, on <persRef ref="tudor-delia">her mother</persRef> this day; and I
							went as Evening twilight came on— It was to ask me, to write another
							Petition for her mother, for a further posthumous allowance from the
							Government, on her Son William’s Accounts— I said that if a new
							application could have any chance of success, it must be first
							introduced into the Senate— <persRef ref="evans-george2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Evans</persRef>, with a power
							of Attorney from <persRef ref="gardiner-robert">Robert
							Gardner</persRef>, an Executor of <persRef ref="tudor-william2">William
								Tudor’s</persRef> Will received the money, upon the Act of Congress
							passed on M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor’s petition— M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stewart shewed me a passage in a Letter
							from Robert Gardner, professing a respect for my opinion, and adding
							that if I would say he was not bound by his Oath and bond as Executor to
							take the money he should think himself mistaken— I said I could give no
							opinion upon what his Oath and bond required of him, because I knew not
							what they were nor what was the Will—but that Congress had made the
							grant on the Petition of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor, and in
							the full persuasion that it would go to her benefit— That the Executors
							took not one step towards it—nor did I believe Congress would have
							passed the bill, on any application of theirs— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Stewart wished me to write this as my opinion— A <persRef

						<p>It seems as if I should never get through the Letter to the Petitioners,
							which I intended should not occupy two pages— I this morning rose able
							to write, which went I went to bed last Night I feared I should not be.—
							And I wrote stedfastly till near 2. P.M. Then called at the Office of
							the National Intelligencer, and told <persRef ref="seaton-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton</persRef> I should to-morrow or
							the <pb n="72" type="ms"/>the next day bring him a Letter to the
							Petitioners who entrusted me with their Petitions to be presented to
							H.R.U.S. to be published with the closing list, and which would cover
							from four to five columns of the paper— He appeared to be somewhat shy,
							and regretting that this subject was to be again agitated— I expected as
							much, and said if after reading my manuscript he should decline to
							publish it, I would simply notify the petitioners of the fact, and
							publish the Letter in another Newspaper.— And if so I should use it as
							an illustration of the suppression of the freedom of the press
							necessarily consequent of the suppression of the right of Petition, and
							freedom of Speech in the House. He thought there was another view of the
							Freedom of the Press which consisted of editorial independence in
							refusing to publish what ought not to be published— I thought there
							might be editorial independence in this but not much freedom of the
							press— He mentioned to me the alteration of the <persRef
								ref="atherton-charles">Atherton</persRef> Resolutions, from the
							first set of them as agreed upon in the Caucus; and which <persRef
								ref="davis-matthew">Matthew L. Davis</persRef> had disclosed in one
							of his Spy Letters— <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> sent a
							copy of them as first agreed upon, to the Charleston Mercury, where they
							were published, differing considerably from those offered by Atherton.
							Seaton said they had published the two sets in parallel columns—but he
							could not find them— <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> dined
							abroad— I took an evening twilight walk, and to spare my eyes a little
							played Loo with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>

						<p>At length I finished my first Letter to the Petitioners whose Petitions I

							<persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef> the Letter which he promised

							from New-York whose <hi rend="italic">text</hi>
							<pb n="76" type="ms"/>text was Genesis 5.24. “And <persRef ref="enoch"

						<p>I wrote a Letter to <persRef ref="webb-samuel2">Samuel Webb</persRef> of
							Philadelphia; to return as he requested a Letter from him containing his
							plan for the emancipation of all the Slaves in this Union. Webb proposed
							to me to bring forward his plan, or to return his Letter, which I now
							do. I intended to write him a Letter of four lines, and wrote four
							pages, which consumed the morning. I wrote a Statement, to serve as an
							account of guardianship of my granddaughters <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Mary Louisa</persRef>, and <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna"
								>Georgiana Frances Adams</persRef> which I took to the City Hall,
							and delivered to the Judge of the Orphan’s Court, <hi rend="italic"
								>by</hi>
							<pb n="78" type="ms"/>by whom it was accepted— I went then to the
							Capitol and applied again at the Clerk’s Office of the House of
							Representatives for copies of the Resolution of thanks of both Houses of
							Congress to <persRef ref="lafayette-george">George W. La
								Fayette</persRef> and the family of the <persRef ref="lafayette"
								>late General</persRef>, for the copy of his Memoirs and Writings
							which I presented to Congress for them last December. They had the 2.
							Copies engrossed on parchment, and <persRef ref="burch-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Burch</persRef> told me he was going
							himself to embark in about ten days for France and offered to take my
							Letter to G. W. La Fayette which offer I accepted— I selected also
							several copies of the two Bills reported to both Houses of Congress— by
							me 16. Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1839. H.R.U.S. 1160 mine and
							1161. <persRef ref="robbins-asher">A. Robbins’s</persRef>—and the sheets
							of the Journal of the House to page 656. sheet 41. They promised to send
							me the remaining sheets and Index as they come out, to Quincy—and also
							the Report upon Indian Reservation Land Sales made to the House 20.
								Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>— <persRef
								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B.
								Johnson</persRef> was here this forenoon— Much of my time was
							consumed in filing Letters; and a fruitless search for those of <persRef
								ref="laurie-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laurie</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="barnard-edward">Barnard</persRef>, with their Notes.—
							In my twilight Evening walk as I was passing by <persRef
								ref="tudor-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor’s</persRef>
							she had me called in, and with <persRef ref="stewart-delia">M<hi

							form of relinquishment to be signed by <persRef
								ref="tudor-frederic;tudor-henry;gardiner-emma">her
								children</persRef> coheirs with her, of her Son <persRef
								ref="tudor-william2">William’s</persRef> personal Estate, of their
							claims to equal portions of the late grant by Congress, and also for a
							Letter expressing my opinion which I promised to send her to-morrow— But
							it seems there also Creditor claims and <persRef ref="gardiner-robert"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gardner</persRef> has written to
								<persRef ref="amory-nathaniel">Nathaniel Amory</persRef> who is one
							of them—to make terms with them— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor
							relies on a decision of the Supreme Court U.S. at their late Session,
							that creditor claims cannot intercept such grants— She is much offended
							at a Letter from <persRef ref="evans-george2">George Evans</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="coxe-ws">W. S. Coxe</persRef>, in which he repeatedly
							advises what M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. should do.— I have a

								Robbins’s</persRef>— He said that the reason why the notice from the
							Court of Chancery did not call for illegitimate children of <persRef
								ref="hungerford-henry">Hungerford</persRef> was because that portion
							of the bequest was by the Law of England null and void— And that the
							pretensions of the two claimants <hi rend="italic">who</hi>
							<pb n="79" type="ms"/>who appeared after he had obtained the money, were
							not only unfounded but absurd— He said he was now here to dispose of
							some house lots which he owns in the city, and for which he had received
							offers— I called at M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor’s house, and
							left my Letter to her, with the form of a relinquishment and assignment—
							Also at <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>The pressure upon my time as that for my departure approaches becomes

							left undone— Among the felicities of <persRef ref="washington-george"
								>Washington’s</persRef> Life is the unity of the two great objects
							which he had to pursue— First the War of Independence, and secondly the
							Establishment of the Constitution of the United States— There is the
							unity of a Grecian Drama in both of them. A Tragedy and a Comedy— No
							reputation of a great man, can be acquired, but by the accomplishment of
							some great object— But perhaps Fortune is the great furnisher of
							occasions.— The Revolutionary age and the Constituent age were the times
							for great men— The administrative age is an age of small men, and small
							things— I wrote this morning to <persRef ref="lafayette-george">George
								W. La Fayette</persRef> and enclosed to him the authenticated copy
							of the Resolution of thanks of the two houses of Congress to him and the
							surviving family of the <persRef ref="lafayette">General</persRef> for

							other heads of Departments, and the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President</persRef> were gone to attend the funeral of <persRef
								ref="smith-samuel2">General Samuel Smith</persRef>.— I then called
							at <persRef ref="u">Bowen</persRef> the Tailor’s shop, and paid an old
							bill for <persRef ref="adams-isaac">I. H. A.</persRef> Then at the
							Library of Congress and returned all the Books with which I was charged
							except the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="peters-richard2">Peters’s</persRef> Reports
							which I could not find— I gave the packet for G. W. Lafayette to
								<persRef ref="burch-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Burch</persRef>, and bespoke the sheets of the Journal not yet
							printed, and the Index to be sent to me at Quincy— I had written a
							dunning Letter to <persRef ref="barnard-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Barnard</persRef>, and he had answered that he would
							call on me at 6. this Evening— He afterwards sent me an apologetic

								Rothwell</persRef>, Treasurer of <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
							<pb n="80" type="ms"/>the Columbian College, and enclosed to him a note

							with the account of his House-rent from 1. Jan<hi rend="superscript"
