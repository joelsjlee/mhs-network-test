						<dateline>Quincy Saturday 1. June 1839.</dateline>
						<p><date>1. IV. </date>Saturday</p>
						<p>Sun rose 4:25—from <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							House; rose behind the house on the hill. </p>
						<p>I begin the month by writing in my Diary the record of yesterday: then in
							the Diary index ten days in November 1834—then by hearing my Grand
							daughters <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-georgeanna">Georgiana-Frances Adams</persRef> read 5
							chapters from 57 to 62 of <persRef ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef>; all
							before breakfast— After breakfast I spent 3 hours in my Garden,
							seminary, Nursery and Orchard—observing my seedlings from eleven years
							old to those breaking the ground— Several of my wild cherries are just
							opening their blossoms— The fruit ripens 15 September— The leading shoot
							of one of my shag-bark walnuts, which opened from the bud since the
							first of May has grown two feet. I measured the largest white maple,
							from the seeds which I brought four years ago from Philadelphia and
							sowed 1 June 1835. it is 7 1/2 inches in circumference and about 12 feet
							high— I have only two remaining of the red flowering maple, from seed
							brought the same year 1835 from Washington; and only one of them that I
							can expect to live— It is in the centre of the Nursery—not a foot high;
							but with a thrifty shoot and large leaves of this Season— I had the
							languishing English Oak at the Northwest corner of the Nursery, and an
							Apricot tree in the centre of the garden thoroughly washed with Soapsuds
							to cleanse them from gathering moss— Ash leaves are putting forth from
							the seed leaves, in the new bed by the kitchen garden gate— A single Oak
							shoot appeared yesterday in Mary-Louisa’s Nursery-bed.— Three or four of
							my surviving black walnuts look as if they may yet live— The Althaea’s
							are but just putting out their leaves— The lilacs are gone having been
							in blossom a fortnight. <persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirk</persRef> hoed up
							one of my seedling cherries which I had transplanted from under the tree
							in the Orchard— I replanted it as a hopeless experiment— The stock from
							my apple-bud of 1832 in the Nursery has blossomed profusely and has
							fruit already formed. After dinner, I took up <persRef ref="adams-john"
								>my father’s</persRef> Diary from 1766 to 1773. and made an extract
							from it— In the evening I wrote a page of my translation of <persRef
								ref="horace">Horace’s</persRef> Ode, on the praises of a Country
							life— Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> had
							spent the Evening here— The day was showery and so cold that I made a
							fire in my chamber— This day is a sample of my occupations for the
							month— I read also some pages of <persRef ref="bowditch-nathaniel2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathaniel Ingersoll
								Bowditch’s</persRef> Memoir of the life of <persRef
								ref="bowditch-nathaniel">his father</persRef>—a model of a self made
							man— My father’s diary is full of self chastisement for waste of time in
							visiting, conversation, and desultory reading—the last of which is my
							own bane.</p>

							<pb n="104" type="ms"/>truth of the Christian Religion, drawn from the
							fact of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ— He pointed out the
							extraordinary contrast in the character and conduct of the Apostles

							day of Pentecost— It was one of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s

							righteous that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit
							of their doings. 11. Wo unto the wicked! It shall be ill with him; for
							the reward of his hands shall be given him”— He read also the 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of <persRef ref="ezekiel"
								>Ezekiel</persRef>, which so emphatically declares that every man
							shall be saved by his own righteousness and punished for his own sin— No
							vicarious atonement— There was an argument against the universalists,
							and another against the calvinists— I read the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> Sermon of the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Volume of
								<persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>—upon the new

						<p>Already this day, I broke in upon the order of my occupations, as I had

							the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District, with the
							list of the Petitions from the towns in alphabetical order, for
							publication in the Quincy Patriot I began with it before breakfast, and
							it absorbed the whole day. I had barely time besides for the diary of
							yesterday, and all the rest was neglected— I spent indeed half the day
							about my grounds. Sawed off in the Nursery, two large peach-trees and
							one Apricot ten years old, but which have never born fruit, except one
							of them one year, in small quantities, and which are now so nearly dead
							that there was no prospect of their ever bearing hereafter— They
							cumbered the ground— All my peach-trees look sickly and ragged— I sawed
							off also the stock of an apple transplanted seedling at the Southwest
							corner of the Orchard—and there is a cherry seedling which I discovered
							close by it— A single Strawberry plant which I set out last Summer, in
								<persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny’s</persRef> Nursery bed has
							blossomed, and is throwing out runners on all sides. Several of my black
							walnuts shew signs of life. The Rohan Potatoes are coming <pb n="105"

						<p>I endeavoured to employ the day in regular order; but with little
							success— <persRef ref="adams-isaac">I. H. Adams</persRef> was here— I
							visited my garden Nursery and seminary, turning my first attention to
							five American white Oaks, all that I have been able to raise, and four
							of which until this year have scarcely grown at-all— They are now
							thrifty and promising. I called at the book binders, with the pamphet
							copies of the acts of Congress of the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							and 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress— But the leaves were
							shaved so close that <persRef ref="gill-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gill</persRef> said he could not bind them in a volume
							corresponding with the rest— I desired him to keep them, and wrote to
								<persRef ref="vail-aaron2">Aaron Vail</persRef>, chief clerk in the
							Department of State, sending back three close cut pamphlets and
							requesting others entire in exchange— I took to the Office of the Quincy
							Patriot, my Letter to the Inhabitants, and Petitioners of the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District, which he
							promised to publish next Saturday— He lent me the National Intelligencer
							of 28 May, which contains my second Letter to the Petitioners entire—
							After dinner, intending to write upon the biography of <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> I missed his manuscript
							Journals, and the Memoir of his own life which he left unfinished, and
							wasted two long hours in searching for them, without success— Then going
							over to Charles’s, I found that he had them; but the day was gone and I
							had written nothing.— I had the rubbish of one of the library chambers
							in the farm house swept away— Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4"
								>his wife</persRef> spent the evening here— I filled a flower pot
							with fresh earth and sowed in it some of the elm seeds that I had picked
							up last week in Boston.</p>

						<p>A thin border of clear sky along the eastern horizon deeply crimsoned by

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Vail</persRef>, and began, but did not

							but found no new vegetation. The growth of the young trees is so
							luxuriant, that almost all the shagbark walnuts are top heavy, and bend,
							as if they would break down. My Diary and Index absorbed all the
							morning, and I only closed my Letter to <persRef ref="colman-henry"
								>Henry Colman</persRef>. <persRef ref="green-john3">John A.
								Green</persRef> the publisher of the Quincy Patriot was here, with a
							proof slip of part of my first Letter to the Petitioners which I
							revised— The Boston Courier of this morning contains about half the
							second Letter, with promise of the remainder to-morrow— After dinner I
							attempted to resume the biography of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef> at the period of his removal from Braintree to
							Boston in April 1768.— I found in his manuscript, notice of his
							attendance on the superior Court at Worcester and Springfield that year,
							and that on his return to Boston, there was an army landed there; and
							that a Convention had been held.— For a full explanation of this I
							resorted to the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Volume of <persRef
								ref="hutchinson-thomas">Hutchinson</persRef> where the facts are
							detailed, and to the Massachusetts State Papers, where are all the
							documents of the snarling controversy between <persRef
								ref="bernard-francis">Sir Francis Bernard</persRef> and the General
							Court in 1768 are collected, but the reading of only a small part of
							them took me from my writing till the Sun was gone, and the twilight
							closed all my books— As the last labour of the day I copied six Stanza’s
							of a translation which some years since I made in Ottava rima of
								<persRef ref="ovid">Ovid’s</persRef> Epistle from <persRef
								ref="phyllis">Phyllis</persRef> to <persRef ref="demophoon"
								>Demophoon</persRef>; which the best of all my compositions in
							verse, but never shewed to any person except my wife— She then made a
							copy of it for me, and it is from her copy that I am now making the copy

						<p>I saw them both from the eastern pillar of the portico of <persRef

							from the first rising to the last sinking beam of the Sun was by my
							observation fifteen hours and seven minutes; and by the American Almanac
							fifteen hours and eleven minutes— By the computations of the American
							Almanac, the morning solstice commences this day— That is the rising of
							the Sun at Boston, is marked from this day to the 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> at 4:22—and on the 19<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> at 4:23 and thence continues later every
							morning till the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of December when it
							is marked at 7:30. and so continues till the 9<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of January— After which it recedes again to 7:29.— But the
							setting Sun marked yesterday and this day at 7:33. continues to set
							later till the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> marked at 7:40. and so
							continues till the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of July—receding on
							the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> to 7:39. and continuing till the
								4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of December marked and thence to
							the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> at 4:28—so that by the American
							Almanac the length of the day from the 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							to the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of June is 15 hours and 17
							minutes— On the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of December the setting
							sun is marked at 4:28 and so continues to the 16<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi>—and on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> sets at 4:29.
							rising at 7:24. and continuing to rise later until the 30<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> at 7:30— By this mode of computation the
							morning solstice is from this day to the 18<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> and the Evening solstice from the 23<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> to the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of July.— While the
							Morning Winter Solstice is from 30. December to 9. January, and the
							Evening Solstice from the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> to the 16<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of December.— This the effect of the
							equation of time. But by the American Almanac the length of the day on
							the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of December is 9 hours 5 minutes on
							the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							<hi rend="strikethrough">and 17</hi><hi rend="superscript strikethrough"
								>th.</hi> 9 hours and 4 minutes—on the 17<hi rend="superscript"

								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and to the 26<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> again 9 hours and 4 minutes. There must be in this some
							error—perhaps of the press.— From the difference of true and apparent
							time the shortest night in Summer is 8 hours and 43 minutes: while the
							shortest day in Winter is 9 hours and 4. minutes— Still a mystery to me.
							In my Nursery visitations I found the leading shoot of the finest of my
							shagbark seedlings broken off—a sad disappointment. <persRef

								Pierpont</persRef> of Boston, this morning from Genesis 1.3. “And
							God said, let there be light:”—a very ingenious and eloquent discourse;
							full of beautiful description and poetical imagery— With frequent
							indirect allusions to the fashionable darkness, and suppression of the
							light at the present time. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierpont cited
							in the course of his Sermon the first line of the third Book of Paradise
							Lost— “Hail! holy light! Offspring of Heaven first born”— He dined with
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>, and I asked him
							if he could tell the exact meaning of <persRef ref="milton-john"
								>Milton</persRef> in the whole of that passage? I said I understood
							it as expressing a doubt whether light itself is not eternal and
							uncreated; and hesitating whether he may avow this
								dou<unclear>bt.</unclear> We examined the passage in <persRef
								ref="todd-henry">Todd’s</persRef> Milton, and found a note upon the
							passage by <persRef ref="newton-isaac">Newton</persRef>, who understands
							it in the same way— But the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> verse of the
								1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> chapter of Genesis seems very
							explicitly to affirm the creation of light by God, and of course the
							pre-existence of God— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierpont said that
							the word <hi rend="italic">created</hi> in the first verse of the
							English Bible, does not in the original hebrew import absolute
							creation—but mere making. So says and argues <persRef
								ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire</persRef>.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Pierpont’s afternoon text was from Matthew 4:4. “But he
							answered and said, it is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but
							by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” I read the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon of the 12<hi rend="superscript"

							upon moral martyrdom; but scarcely had gotten through it, when <persRef

							finishing the copy of my version of the heroid; from <persRef

								>Demophoon</persRef>; and copying my lines upon the Polestar and the

						<p>My long visits to my garden, Nursery, Seminary and Orchard are daily
							made, and constitute almost the only exercise that I take. They make me
							feel no small humiliation, at the numberless observations that I make
							and immediately forget—and at my own barrenness of invention, and utter
							ignorance of the art of training and medicating my trees— I spent three
							hours of this day in going over all my garden grounds; in witnessing the
							slow growth of the seedlings that survive; and the multitudes that
							perish— <persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirk</persRef> sawed off a large stump
							of an Apple tree in the Orchard, and cut away a whole bush of suckers
							around it, leaving one stem for an attempt to reproduce the tree.</p>

						<p>The Sun rose by my Chronometer at 4:25:45 at the corner of <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house— On perceiving his
							first beam I came immediately over to my own window, and at 4:30 found
							the disk of the Sun about 4 digits above the horizon; so that when the
							first beam appears here the whole disk is up from Charles’s house— A
							difference of 3 minutes, and 15 Seconds— The Sunset from Charles’s house
							was not quite clear, a cloud bordering the horizon into which the lower
							part of the Sun’s disk sunk before reaching the surface of the Earth—at
							7:40— This gives 15 hours 15 minutes as the length of the day. By the
							American Almanac the Sun rose this day at 4:22. and set at 7:38 agreeing
							as exactly as possible with my observation, making an allowance of the
							Sun’s disk for the elevation of Charles’s house— I went the rounds of my
							garden Nursery Orchard and seminary; discovering only that the
							experiment of making a second Oak tree from the Black-jack Oak, by
							taking off the stem, and a long root, has failed, the severed stem,
							after putting forth puny leaves being now dead. The same experiment with
							the elm appears as yet to have succeeded.— The spindle chesnut Oak,
							which I topped in the summer house cellar has put out buds, and one of
							the seminary transplanted black walnuts which I thought dead has put
							forth a promising shoot— All the peach-trees are afflicted with crumpled
							leaves; yet many of them are bearing. I manured and watered the seedling
							beds to which I yesterday transplanted the Strawberry plants from over
							the hill.— The morning thus melted away— I finished reading the
							introductory Section of <persRef ref="prescott-william2">W. H.
								Prescott’s</persRef>
							<hi rend="italic">history</hi>
							<pb n="114" type="ms"/>History of <persRef ref="ferdinandofaragon"
								>Ferdinand</persRef> and <persRef ref="isabella-i"
								>Isabella</persRef>, being the summary preliminary history of
							Castile— The Style is very good, and the evidence of research in Spanish
							documents exemplary; but it wants interest; and the perpetual commentary
							of Notes at the bottom of every page exceedingly tiresome— This practice
							is almost exclusively confined to modern English Historians and is in
							direct violation of all rules of unity in composition— Every note is a
							digression, and diverts the attention of the reader, from the subject— A
							very large proportion of these notes should have been woven into the
							text— Notes and Commentaries, except the mere citation of authorities,
							should be thrown into separate dissertations and published at the end of
							each volume—and there should not be many of them. I answered a Letter
							from <persRef ref="kennedy-alfred">Alfred L Kennedy</persRef> who in the
							name of sundry Literary Societies at Philadelphia, has invited me to
							deliver an Oration before them on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of

							have declined— I wrote also to <persRef ref="smith-william-steuben">W.

								Lunt</persRef> this morning from Romans 7 22. “For I delight in the
							Law of God after the inward man: but I see another Law in my members,
							warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to
							the law of sin which is in my members”— and <persRef ref="whitney-peter"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> P. Whitney</persRef> in the
							afternoon from 1. Corinthians 15.53 [“]For this corruptible must put on
							incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney
							is conscious of his own approach to the borders of the future world. His
							last Sermon on the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of last month was
							from this same 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of 1.
							Corinthians and upon a future life— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt
							made this morning a most impressive quotation from <persRef
								ref="paley-william">Paley</persRef>: a remark upon John 5.28.29.
							[“]for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall
							hear his voice—and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the
							resurrection of life; and they that have done evil unto the resurrection
							of damnation.”— That if Jesus Christ had in his whole life done nothing
							more than speak those words he would have been a greater benefactor to
							the human race than all the philosophers that ever lived.— Perhaps this
							is hyperbolical— I believe the doctrine of future rewards and
							punishments indispensable to any system of good morals, but it was
							distinctly taught in the Greek and Roman Mythology— It was believed by
							the Jews before the time of Jesus, excepting by the Sadducees— It was no
							doubt the most essential and vital part of the Religion of Jesus and
							perhaps the only part which required his mission upon earth— The Law of
							benevolence, and the law of future retribution are the two pillars of
							Christianity. Without the former the latter is unnecessary— Without the
							latter, the former is useless. I read the 9<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Sermon of the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of
								<persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, upon the disgust
							with the world and <pb n="115" type="ms"/>and the contempt of life—not
							one of his best. The pictures of the miseries of human life are
							exaggerated— He remarks upon the contrast between the representations of
							life in the book of Ecclesiastes, and those in the proverbs of <persRef
								ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>. I have often thought of them, and
							still more of the mutual opposition between the Ecclesiastes and the
							Song of Solomon— Saurin puts the question without answering it
							satisfactorily which of the two representations is to be considered as
							divinely inspired— There seems to be more of philosophical reflection in
							the Ecclesiastes and more of precept in the Proverbs— <persRef ref="u"
								>The wife</persRef> of my farmer <persRef ref="carr-john2">John J.

						<p>Beclouded morn and Evening— But I made an experiment of manuring the

							pound of <persRef ref="vaughan-william">William Vaughan’s</persRef>
							assetts; and claiming credit for the same sum paid over to the Executors
							of <persRef ref="boylston-ward">Ward Nicholas Boylston</persRef>— I

							Curtis and <persRef ref="boylston-alicia">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs.</hi> Boylston</persRef>; but the judge required also their

							Boylston was and where they both signed their assent to my account,

							and Nursery; took tea, here and spent with me two hours very agreeably—

							advises me to accept.— Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
								wife</persRef> spent the Evening here, as they usually do when the

						<p>Beclouded sky—in the morning, and heavy showers at Night— Yet I
							endeavoured to aid the vegetation of a budded cherry tree, and a black
							walnut in my seminary— Of the ten transplanted cherry seedlings in the
							orchard two only give signs of life, and I have five plum seedlings
							between life and death. <persRef ref="loud-david">David Loud</persRef>
							was here to enquire for the Land warrant and power of attorney which he
							says he sent to me, he thinks in the Winter of 1836–7. and which I have
							not been able to find— He says there is a man by the name of <persRef
								ref="u">Bowditch</persRef> who offers him 320 dollars for the
							warrant of 160. Acres— I made two long searches among my papers last
							Summer without finding those of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loud, and
							I now promised to write to the Commissioner of the general Land-Office,
							for a copy of the warrant and to ascertain how another warrant may be
							obtained, instead of that which has been mislaid— I did accordingly
							write to <persRef ref="whitcomb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitcomb</persRef>— The multitude of papers which accumulate upon my
							hands, particularly during the Sessions of Congress; together with a
							failing memory and the lack of the assistance of a Secretary, which
							during all the former years of my official life I had becomes
							exceedingly perplexing— I now very frequently mislay important papers of
							my own, and am for years together unable to find them— This is the first
							instance in which it has happened to me, with the papers of other
							persons.— My Diary has been extremely useful to me, for recurrence to
							papers after a lapse of years; and so I found it the other day, in
							looking up the papers concerning my Administration de bonis non of
								<persRef ref="boylston-thomas2">Thomas Boylston</persRef>— But in
							the latter weeks of a Session of Congress, I have found it impossible to
							keep my Diary up with the current of time— During the three sessions of
							the last Congress I have received nearly two thousand Petitions to be
							presented to the House of Representatives—with hundreds of Letters full
							of solicitude concerning them— I have accordingly been obliged to keep a
							register of them which at the last Session, I published from time to
							time in the <pb n="117" type="ms"/>National Intelligencer— Then my
							constant attendance in the House, the part which I take in many of the
							debates, and attendance upon committees, with a correspondence
							constantly pressing, and often upon bagatelles, form altogether such a
							pressure upon the brain that it often amounts to distraction— Household
							cares—domestic economy, and the prudent management of my private
							concerns add much to these labours, and social intercourse calls for its
							hours; and relaxation extorts others— Public and private affairs too
							often produce excitements under which I cannot write—and the languor of
							exhaustion, and the drowsiness that follows sleepless nights disable me
							from writing</p>

						<p>Cloudy morning. Missed the observation of the rising of the Sun—but he
							set as observed from <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							porch precisely at 7:40, by my Chronometer, ten minutes later than from
							my house— There was a volunteer parade of a Quincy Military company with
							the Brass Band from Boston, who marched round the Streets, dined at
								<persRef ref="u">French’s</persRef> tavern, and fired a Cannon, at
							Sunrise Noon and Sunset— They marched by my house to the end of the

							for a salute— Charles with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
								wife</persRef>, <persRef ref="adams-louisa3">daughter</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-charles7;adams-john17">two sons</persRef> dined

								Harrod</persRef> late from New-Orleans, and <persRef
								ref="miller-hannah2">Miss Hannah Miller</persRef> spent the Evening
							here— I wasted as usual idle hours in looking at my plants, and another
							portion in reading newspaper— I began a translation of <persRef
								ref="ovid">Ovid’s</persRef> Epistle from <persRef ref="paris"
								>Paris</persRef> to <persRef ref="helen">Helen</persRef>, but on
							reading it over and the answer, I renounced the project altogether— The
							Epistle from <persRef ref="penelope">Penelope</persRef> to <persRef

							to moral principle. That from <persRef ref="phyllis">Phyllis</persRef>
							to <persRef ref="demophoon">Demophoon</persRef> is as good as a moral
							Lecture; but these two are scandalous, and I will have nothing to do
							with them— Charles brought me out from Boston the copy of <persRef
								ref="quincy-daniel">Daniel Quincy’s</persRef> Will; which gives me a
							little more knowledge of that unfortunate ancestor of mine— The eldest
							son of the second <persRef ref="quincy-edmund2">Edmund
							Quincy</persRef>—more than 30 years older than his brother the judge and
							agent of the Province who died at London— The marriage of Daniel Quincy
							was marked by one of the most signal instances of joy turned to mourning
							that real life ever witnessed.— It was solemnized at the House of
								<persRef ref="brattle-thomas">Thomas Brattle</persRef>, whose
								<persRef ref="brattle-elizabeth">wife</persRef>, the aunt of the
								<persRef ref="quincy-ann">bride</persRef>, suddenly died, in the
							midst of the festivity, and her corpse was laid out in the bridal
							chamber— Daniel Quincy himself died of a consumption on Saturday the
								10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August 1690.—under 40 years of
							age; leaving <persRef ref="holman-anna">two infant children</persRef>,
							one of whom <persRef ref="quincy-john">John</persRef> was my
							great-grandfather whose name I bear; and who made the name illustrious—
							This will was written and is witnessed by the Chief Justice <persRef
								ref="sewall-samuel">Samuel Sewall</persRef> and is dated 4. August
							1690.— It is pleasing to me, by the bequest of a small bible with silver
							clasps to his daughter then 5 years of age; and of <persRef
								ref="pole-matthew">Pole’s</persRef> annotations on the Bible, and
							his arms to his son John a child not a year old— And this is nearly all
							that I know of an ancestor <hi rend="italic">whose</hi>
							<pb n="118" type="ms"/>whose memory is yet very dear to me— I devoted
							more of this day than I could well spare to the extracts from Chief
							Justice Sewall’s Diary and began to make out minutes, to connect in a
							narrative the ascertained facts concerning my ancestry— This diverts my
							time from more necessary pursuits; mais c’est plus fort que moi.</p>

								Lamson</persRef> of Dedham, this morning from Matthew 20.22. “Ye
							know not what ye ask.” and in the afternoon from Matthew 25.21 “His lord
							said unto him, Well done thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been
							faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things:
							enter thou into the joy of thy lord.” The morning Sermon was a discourse
							upon the vanity of human wishes—dwelling less on the special character
							of this most remarkable incident in the life of Christ, than upon the
							general unreasonableness of the desires of men—avarice ambition worldly
							pleasures, and the common place disappointments <hi rend="italic"
								>of</hi>
							<pb n="121" type="ms"/>of the hopes and desires of men.— This occurrence
							is related with some slight variation in the gospels of <persRef
								ref="matthew">Matthew</persRef> and of <persRef ref="mark"
								>Mark</persRef>; but is not noticed in those of <persRef ref="luke"
								>Luke</persRef> or <persRef ref="john">John</persRef>— Matthew says
							the request was made for <persRef ref="james">James</persRef> and John
							by their mother— Mark says it was made by themselves— Is it not one of
							the mysteries of human nature that this selfish and unjust demand was
							made by the two disciples, precisely at the moment when he informed them
							that he was about to be abused reviled, and killed—but that he should
							rise again on the third day— Instead of being struck with horror and
							overwhelmed with sorrow at this annunciation, James and John, think of
							nothing but themselves, and ask to be advanced to honour and dignity and
							power in his kingdom, above all the other apostles: and this comes from
							two brothers one of whom was already by Jesus distinguished with partial
							affection— The rejection of the claim is pronounced with admirable
							dignity, and when the other Apostles manifest their resentment, at this
							spirit of encroachment upon their rights, he delivers the true principle
							of his Law, that the distinctions of his kingdom were to consist in
							pre-eminence of service and of suffering— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>Saurin</persRef>— Upon the little success of the ministry of Jesus

						<p><date>27. III:45 </date>Thursday.</p>
						<p>I intended to go to Boston to attend the Meeting of the Historical
							Society; but found myself too unwell, with a flying rhumatism portentous
							of an Easterly storm— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> were also both
							unwell, and <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife’s</persRef>
							health is drooping— I planted three wild garden Strawberries in a flower
							pot with several ripe red cherry stones, and two Kean Seedlings in one
							of the plats— I answered the Letter from <persRef ref="williams-henry3"
								>Henry Williams</persRef>, asking for publication my opinion upon
							the constitutionality and expediency of the fifteen-gallon licence Law:
							and I received a Letter from <persRef ref="leavitt-joshua">Joshua
								Leavitt</persRef> and <persRef ref="stanton-henry">Henry B.
								Stanton</persRef> for the Committee of Arrangements of the American
							Anti-Slavery Society, earnestly inviting my attendance at a National
							Anti-Slavery Convention to be held at Albany on the 31<hi
								rend="superscript">st</hi> of July next— These appeals to me for my
							opinions, upon subjects convulsing the public mind with the conflict of
							interest and passions are at once flattering and perplexing— So
							flattering that they have an evident tendency to engender self-conceit,
							and a fatuitous over-estimate of my own importance— I ought to know, and
							never for a moment forget that my opinion is not of the weight of a
							straw to influence that of the public upon any great question of
							politics or of morals— Common prudence should warn me not to mingle
							unnecessarily with controversies, without a distinct and unequivocal
							call of duty— And this is the more <hi rend="italic">incumbent</hi>
							<pb n="124" type="ms"/>incumbent upon me, because my opinions without
							being useful to others draw down a load of obloquy upon myself and even
							upon my family— Yet when my opinions are formally asked, common civility
							requires an answer—the refusal to give an opinion would manifest either
							churlishness, or a selfish timidity affecting discretion— This
							license-Law, is an ill-advised measure, intended to promote the virtue
							of temperance, but infringing the personal freedom and habits of the
							people— A profligate use of the passions of the people is made to
							overthrow the present State administration, and turn it to the benefit
							of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef>— And it is among
							the strange anomalies of party management that the political agency of
							the Anti-Slavery party produces the same effect— This National
							Anti-Slavery Convention will be followed by the same result.— My answer
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams will not satisfy him nor any
							one else— And while the Abolition champions are importuning me to attend
							their convention all their newspapers with one voice have opened in a
							grand chorus against my Letters to the Petitioners— I spent an hour of
							this Evening at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							<persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">Thomas Greenleaf’s</persRef>— He is
							afflicted with a singular disease in the throat.— Charles was here.</p>

						<p>Rain almost they whole day—first with a Southeast and afterward with a
							Northeast wind but without storm, and scarcely sufficient to saturate
							the earth. <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to
							Boston and returned— I should have done much on such a day as this; but
							did nothing, except answering an invitation from <persRef
								ref="wakeman-thaddeus">T. B. Wakeman</persRef>, corresponding
							Secretary of the American Institute at New-York to deliver an
							anniversary Address before them next November—which I decline— In the
							attempt to redeem the arrears of my Diary-index, I bring back the memory
							of many things, which appear to me in different lights from what they
							did at the time when they occurred— One of the most trying periods of my
							life was that of the close of the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							Congress, when after a most furious succession of debates, buffeted from
							all quarters of the house, I brought them to an unanimous recorded vote;
							and thereby combined to ruin me the whole power of the Senate, and
							especially all the rival aspirants to the Presidency then in that body.—
							The vile expedient of insulting the House of Representatives by a
							message to remind— Of defeating the fortification bill, by a
							hypocritical by-blow at the 3 million appropriation and of charging the
							House with the loss of the bill itself—indicated to me what was to come;
							and I saw the danger in all its magnitude— The storm did burst upon me,
							at the next Session of Congress, by an elaborate and deeply studied
							Speech of <persRef ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef> delivered on
							the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January 1836. in the Senate,
							and published four days after in the National Intelligencer— The whole
							speec was a masked battery opened upon me; which I completely silenced,
							and turned back upon its inventor but by what a whirlwind of invective
							against me it was followed from almost all the eloquence of both Houses—
							I never replied—though with a full reply I was prepared. <pb n="125"
								type="ms"/>But my policy towards France was fully sustained by the
							Event and I was saved from political destruction by my resistance
							against the gag of May 1836— These were casualties or providential
							incidents— I spent this Evening, with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">M<hi

							between the general tome of this book, and that of the proverbs where
							the acquisition of knowledge as promotive of the happiness of man— They
							are certainly different views of human life; and taken from different
							positions— The Song—the Proverbs and the Ecclesiastes are the vivid
							portraitures of the three Stages of the Life of Solomon—Youth—Maturity
							and Old age. <pb n="126" type="ms"/>The afternoon discourse was upon the
							omnipresence of the Deity both good Sermons; but that of the morning the
							most impressive. I read the eleventh Sermon of the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef>, upon Libertines and unbelievers—admirable— He
							says that in all his experience of attendance upon the sick and the

							the character in the Article of death— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Mifflin</persRef> and <persRef

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alger has a Cannon foundry at South
							Boston, and Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Bomford has come from
							Washington to contract for casting great guns of heavier calibre than
							have ever before been used. The effect of the French Steam-battery upon
							the Castle of Saint John d’Ullea has set all our military minds in
							commotion.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alger by some casualty
							mentioned that he came from West Bridgewater, and said that he
							remembered something of the full bottomed wig of his uncle <persRef
								ref="fiske-shepard">Shepard Fisk</persRef>.— I asked him how Shepard
							Fisk came to be his uncle— He said he had married his Grandfather’s
							Sister, and lived and died at West-Bridgewater in the same house with
							his Grandfather— I told him that I had long been in search of
							information relating to Shepard Fisk, who was half-brother to my
								<persRef ref="quincy-john">Great-Grandfather John Quincy</persRef>,
							a son of the same mother <persRef ref="quincy-anne">Anna
								Shepard</persRef>; who after the death in 1690 of her first husband

								<persRef ref="fiske-moses">Moses Fisk</persRef> the Minister of the
							first congregational Church in Braintree, and by him had this Son
							Shepard Fisk— On looking over Farmer’s Register I find it stated that
							Shepard Fisk was a physician, at Killingly Conn<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> and at Bridgewater, Massachusetts, and that he died 14 June
							1779. at the age of 77 whence he must have been born in 1702 I asked
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alger if he had papers which could
							afford information concerning M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fisk’s life
							He said he had many books left by him and among the rest his family
							Bible in which there might be entries respecting his family— He promised
							to look them over, and if he should find in them any thing interesting
							he would communicate it to me— It is strange that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Alger should be under the impression of
							having seen Shepard Fisk in his wig, and that he remembered his funeral
							when he is himself is only 59. years old, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Fisk has been dead 60 years— I wrote Letters to <persRef
