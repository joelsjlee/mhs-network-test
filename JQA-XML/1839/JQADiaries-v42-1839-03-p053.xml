						<p>Called on the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the

							a Letter from <persRef ref="phillips-george2">George L.
								Phillips</persRef> at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Augustine,
							praying for the appointment of his Son <persRef ref="phillips-john6"
								>John Lott Phillips</persRef> to be Surveyor of that Port; an office
							which he supposed to be vacant. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury
							told me that he had received also a Letter from the same person—but he
							was mistaken— The Office of the Surveyor of the Port was not vacant; but
							that of a supervisor, to which the appointment belonged to the
							Collector.— I spoke to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury also of
							the Smithsonian fund— Told him what had been done with relation to it in
							Congress, and what had not been done— How the two Messages of the
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> on the subject
							had been referred to a select Committee of 9 of which I had been
							Chairman— How <persRef ref="robbins-asher">Asher Robbins</persRef> a
							Senator from Rhode Island, being laid politically on the shelf by his
							Constituents had taken a fancy to this fund, for the comfort and support
							of his old age, and projected an University of which he was to be the
							Rector Magnificus— So he made an elegant Literary Speech in the Senate
							and moved for a joint Committee 7. from the Senate— The House concurred
							and the Speaker appointed the same Committee of 9 that he had appointed
							before to join the Committee of the Senate. There were several meetings
							of the joint Committee—scarcely ever a quorum of the Senate’s Committee;
							but they gave carte blanche to their Chairman— He prepared his Bill for
							9 Trustees three chosen by each House, and 3 by the President, to sit
							during the recess and prepare a plan to be submitted to Congress at the
							next Session for a Corporation of which the same Trustees were to form a
							part— I had offered Resolutions against all this which the Committee of
							the House adopted and I prepared a Bill conformably to my own plan. By
							way of compromise it was agreed that both Committees Should report both
							Bills which was done.— I never called either of them up in the House,
							for I knew it would be in vain— Robbins attempted to get up his Bill in
							the Senate, but could not carry it through— I left copies of both Bills
							of my Resolutions and of Robbins’s propositions with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury requesting him to consider them,
							and inviting his views concerning them—telling him that I should if able
							to take my Seat at the next Session of Congress resume the subject, in
							which I felt an interest more intense than in any thing else before that
							body.— I told him that before leaving this place, I intended to see and
							speak again with the President concerning it. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Woodbury promised to give his attention to the subject, and
							to speak of it also to the President. But he told me that in the general
							appropriation Bill 10000 dollars had been taken from this fund to pay
							for the expenses and charges of procuring the money. <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> swindled this into
							the Bill without my knowledge; and it <hi rend="italic">crept</hi>
							<pb n="57" type="ms"/>crept through both Houses unobserved. I shamed him
							out of it last year, and I believe he did it now to spite me— The
								<persRef ref="grundy-felix">Attorney General</persRef> had given an
							opinion against it— I am deeply mortified not to have detected this
							dirty trick. I called at the Pension Office; with a Letter from <persRef
								ref="ellis-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William

								>Seaton</persRef> gave me some papers, and shewed me an Epistle from
								<persRef ref="hassler-ferdinand">F. Hassler</persRef> concerning the
							frontier at Rouse’s point somewhat waspish— After dinner I took a second

								<persRef ref="morsell-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>Continuing the review of the Articles of Confederation, and the contrast
							of their principles with those of the Declaration of Independence; a
							contrast which strikes me more forcibly the more thoroughly I examine
							the facts—but how shall I escape making it tedious and uninteresting,
							especially as I have twice or three times broached and partially exposed
							my views of the subject— Hours and hours of this day were consumed in
							turn over the History of the Confederation and the Journals of the
							Revolutionary and Confederation Congress— Walk before dinner, half way
							to the College hill.— Summer weather— No fire in my chamber— Walk again
							in Evening twilight to the Louisiana Avenue— Letter to <persRef
								ref="webster-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. W.
								Webster</persRef> with a packet of Congressional Documents which he
							had requested— Letter from <persRef ref="cruft-william">W. S
								Cruft</persRef> of New-York requesting Documents, and one from
								<persRef ref="edwards-james">J L. Edwards</persRef>, concerning the
							Pension claim for <persRef ref="rhodes-daniel">Daniel Rhodes</persRef>—
							My Catarrhal cough has partially subsided, and I occupy the whole day—
