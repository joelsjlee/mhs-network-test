						<p>I would commence the year with fervent prayer to almighty God, that the
							year upon which I have now entered may be signalized with more of virtue
							and less of frailty and imperfection in me than any of those which have
							preceded it— For health, for honest purposes, for progress in moral and
							intellectual improvement, for worldly prosperity, and for tranquility
							and peace of mind I supplicate the giver of all good for myself, and all
							my family. Above all for the purification of my own character, and a
							growing preparation for a better world as I am drawing to the close of
							this. We had a great number of morning visitors— Members of Congress—
							Foreign Ministers and others— Men and women and some children— I paid
							myself a visit to <persRef ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Madison</persRef>, and to <persRef
								ref="clarke-mathew;u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi

									>t.</hi> Clair Clark</persRef>; to which he had invited me last
							Evening at <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gales’s</persRef>— They have taken up their residence in a
							magnificent house next door to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							Church, which he has been these two years building and which is yet
							unfinished. It is according to an old adage a house from which to run
							away— With the mail this Evening I received a Memorial and Petition,
							signed by <persRef ref="bacheler-origen">Origen Bacheler</persRef>
							corresponding Secretary of the New-York Peace Society, <persRef
								ref="dewey-orville">Orville Dewey</persRef> and 392 men, <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bacheler</persRef> and 102
							women praying for National Arbitrations, a Congress of Nations, and an
							offer of Mediation from the United States between France and Mexico— The
							Memorial contains some argument in reply to <persRef ref="legare-hugh"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Legare’s</persRef> Report of the
							last Session— I received also an invitation to deliver an address to the
							Adelphic Union Society of Williams College at Williamstown Massachusetts
							at their Commencement next Summer—which invitation and all others of the
							same kind I must decline.</p>

						<p><date>2. V:15. Wednesday </date></p>
						<p>H.R.U.S. On the reading of the Journal this morning, I perceived that no
							notice was taken in it, of the motion I had made on Monday to suspend
							the rules, to take up the three Resolutions of enquiry which I had
							offered on the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last month, calling
							on the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">president</persRef> for
							information whether <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Andrew
								Stevenson</persRef>, our Minister to Great-Britain had accounted or
							been called to account for conspiring against the life of <persRef
								ref="oconnell-daniel">Daniel O’Connell</persRef> a member of the
							British House of Commons, and whether <persRef ref="perry-matthew"
								>Matthew C. Perry</persRef> a Captain in the Navy of the United
							States had been called to account, for his conduct in those
							transactions; nor of the Letter threatening me with assassination, for
							offering those Resolutions, which I sent to the <persRef
								ref="garland-hugh">clerk’s</persRef> table and which was read; nor
							of the refusal of the House to suspend the rules, and even to grant the
							yeas and nays, which I requested on the motion— The <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> said it was not usual to enter
							upon the Journal, motions to suspend the rules, which were not
							sustained, and upon which the yeas and nays were not taken— I said that
							as to the refusal of the house to adopt my motion, and even <hi
								rend="italic">to</hi>
							<pb n="2" type="ms"/>to grant me the yeas and nays, I had cheerfully
							acquiesced in the decisions, accustomed as I was to such treatment from
							the House; but in the total omission from the Journal of a fact so
							important in the proceedings of the House as I deemed this to be I could
							not acquiesce, and must therefore move an amendment of the Journal,
							stating the facts as they were; and must also ask for the yeas and nays
							on this motion— The Speaker said I must reduce my motion to writing— I
							said that this omission having been unexpected to me, I was fearful of
							consuming more of the time of the House than I was willing to take by
							writing down my motion, myself, but if the Clerk would take it down, I
							would tell him what to write— I went up to the Clerk’s table, and the
							motion was written down as I directed—not without manifestations of
							impatience from the slavish side of the House— When the Speaker put the
							question, <persRef ref="lewis-dixon">Dixon H. Lewis</persRef> rose and
							said that he had examined the Letter sent by me to the Clerk’s table,
							and was convinced that it was a quiz, for that he knew no such person as
							the name signed to the Letter and did not believe there was any person
							of that name in the District— I said I was much obliged to the Gentleman
							from Alabama for the sensibility manifested by him on this occasion to
							the idea that such a Letter should have come from his District— I had no
							fear of the execution of this threat; but had sent it to the clerk’s
							table to be read, hoping that it would induce the house to take up and
							consider my Resolutions to which it relates; for the Letter was in the
							same Spirit with the transactions upon which I proposed to call for
							information— They were indeed of a deeper dye and a baser character than
							the Letter to me. This was a threat of Assassination by one ruffian.
							That was a conspiracy to assassinate, by four— And the Gentleman from
							Alabama, must excuse me for not considering the Letter to me as a quiz—
							I was not in the habit of considering a written and signed threat of
							murder, addressed to a member of Congress, for things done in the
							discharge of his duty as a <hi rend="italic">Quiz</hi>— Murder and
							Forgery were hardly called by their right names when termed a Quiz— Here
							the Speaker stopped me, and said the question was upon a motion to amend
							the journal— The House again refused the yeas and nays, and the motion
							to amend the journal was rejected 70 to 87. I asked the Speaker if my
							motion would now appear upon the Journal, and he said it would— Reports
							from Committees were then called for and it took till half past 2, to
							get through with them— The House then went into Committee of the whole
							on the state of the Union upon the President’s annual Message, and
								<persRef ref="cushman-samuel">Cushman</persRef> made a Speech of
							about an hour against the charges of <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise</persRef> and <persRef ref="prentiss-seargent"
								>Prentiss</persRef>, and in defence of the <persRef
								ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="duncan-alexander">Alexander Duncan</persRef> of Ohio then took
							the floor and moved the Committee should rise and the House immediately
							after adjourned— <persRef ref="southgate-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southgate</persRef> informed me of the
							sudden death of my old friend and Classmate <persRef ref="mayo-daniel"

						<p>Thaw with a sprinkling of rain— On the morning of the 31<hi
								rend="superscript">st</hi> of December, the thermometers in the city
							were at 6 degrees below zero of <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel"
								>Fahrenheit</persRef>, the extreme of cold with one exception, in 28
							winters that I have passed in the City of Washington— On the morning of
							the New-year the thermometers were at 0. and the weather has been ever
							since moderating— The Snow is now rapidly disappearing— I called this
							morning at the Bank of Washington and at half past 10. met the members
							of the Committee of Manufactures, whom I had yesterday notified to
							attend this morning. Present Adams, <persRef ref="slade-william"
								>Slade</persRef>, <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph"
								>Tillinghast</persRef>, <persRef ref="vail-henry">Vail</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="hunter-robert">Hunter</persRef> of Virginia, <persRef
								ref="naylor-charles">Naylor</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="kennedy-john">Kennedy</persRef>— Absent <persRef
								ref="biddle-richard">Biddle</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="elmore-franklin">Elmore</persRef>. The subjects referred to the
							Committee were a bill from the Senate N. 77. to refund to the
							Philadelphia, Delaware and Baltimore Railway company the duties upon
							certain imported iron pins and spikes— After a short discussion the
							Chairman was instructed to report the Bill without amendment— The other
							reference was of two Petitions from a man named <persRef ref="u"
								>Logan</persRef>, of Scott County, Ioway Territory, praying for a
							grant of two Sections of land, for the culture of silk. As this subject
							was at the last Session transferred from the Committee of Manufactures
							to the Committee of Agriculture, I proposed to ask to be discharged from
							the further consideration of these Petitions and that they be referred
							to the Committee of Agriculture; which was adopted— The Committee agreed
							to meet every Thursday Morning at ten O’Clock till further order.— In
							the House I met <persRef ref="buller-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Buller</persRef> the Secretary of <persRef
								ref="lambton-john">Lord Durham</persRef> who had been here the first
							of last Month, and who then told me he was to embark the next week after
							at New-York for Liverpool. There was a movement for the receipt of
							Petitions, but the first 30 days of the Session expired yesterday— After
							which by the rules of the House, Petitions are received only on the
							first sitting day of each week.— The rule is that for the first thirty
							days. The first business of every morning shall be to call the States
							over for Petitions. The practice of this Session has been to call the
							States for Petitions only once in the thirty days— The Committees were
							called over for Reports— I reported from the Committee of Manufactures
							the Senate’s Bill 77. without amendment; and moved its reference to the
							Committee of the whole House and made the order of the day for
							to-morrow—and that the Bill, and Memorial from the Directors of the
							Railway Company be printed; which was ordered— I moved also that the
							Committee be discharged from the further consideration of Logan’s two
							Petitions and that they be referred to the Committee of Agriculture,
							which was done. The contested election for the Wisconsin Territory,
							which had been made the special order for this day at One O’Clock was at
							last taken up, and disposed of in less than three hours— The report of
							the Committee of elections concluded with a Resolution that <persRef
								ref="doty-james">James Duane Doty</persRef> is entitled to a Seat in
							the House as Delegate from the Wisconsin Territory, and that <persRef
								ref="jones-george2">George W. Jones</persRef> is not. <hi
								rend="italic">Thomas</hi>
							<pb n="4" type="ms"/><persRef ref="thomas-francis">Thomas</persRef> of
							Maryland began the debate against the report of the Committee, confining
							himself to the first part of the Resolution, and tacitly admitting that
							Jones had no pretension to a Seat.— He was for sending both back to the
							People for another election.— <persRef ref="maury-abram">Maury</persRef>
							of Tennessee a member of the Committee of Elections said the Committee
							had not been unanimous in their report. <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef>, a little, but not much to my surprize, sustained
							Thomas in his opposition to the report—but <persRef ref="crary-isaac"
								>Crary</persRef> of Michigan, and <persRef ref="randolph-joseph"
								>Randolph</persRef>, and above all <persRef ref="fletcher-richard"
								>Richard Fletcher</persRef> of Boston swept away in a Speech of half
							an hour, the sophistry of Thomas so that the house would scarcely hear
							another word— Tillinghast attempted to say something further, but the
							call for the question was so peremptory and impatient that he forbore
							and sat down <persRef ref="degraff-john">De Graff</persRef> of New-York
							moved the previous Question which was carried, and the Resolution
							reported by the Committee was carried 167 to 25. I never saw a more
							decisive and instantaneous effect produced by a speech upon a
							deliberative assembly, and I rejoiced in congratulating Fletcher upon
							it—for no man in the house has been so basely treated by the servile
							party as Fletcher, and at one time he had almost sunk under it— Cushing
							did not vote upon the question— Thomas cowered under the superiority of
							Fletcher’s legal argument. Doty was immediately sworn and took his seat—
							Jones the Ex-delegate had disappeared— He had bought a written opinion
							of two lawyers in this City <persRef ref="jones-walter">Walter
								Jones</persRef> and <persRef ref="key-francis">Francis S.
								Key</persRef> in favour of his right to the seat— The house
							forthwith adjourned— Evening at whist.</p>

						<p>Met at half past ten this morning at the chamber of the Committee of

								<persRef ref="ogle-charles">Charles Ogle</persRef> of Pennsylvania,
								<persRef ref="shepard-charles">Charles Shepard</persRef> of

							Connecticut, <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> of
							South-Carolina and <persRef ref="hunter-william5">William H.
								Hunter</persRef> of Ohio— I had yesterday personally notified all
							the members to attend this meeting, except Hunter who was not in the
							House. Holt told me that he was engaged on the great Land Committee; and
							Thompson promised to come, but forgot it— The references to the
							Committee were the two Messages of the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President</persRef>, with Documents 10 and 11. of the present
							Session— A Memorial from <persRef ref="fleischmann-charles">Charles
								Lewis Fleischmann</persRef>, a Bavarian but now a Citizen of the
							United States, and attached to the Patent Office, who proposes the
							Establishment of an Agricultural Institution and Farm School at the cost
							of about 300000 dollars—a memorial of <persRef ref="johnson-walter"
								>Walter R. Johnson</persRef> praying for the establishment of an
							Institution for prosecuting experiments in certain physical Sciences;
							and a Petition from <persRef ref="martin-samuel">Samuel Martin</persRef>
							of Campbell’s Station Tennessee, who with much other matter prays that
							the Smithsonian fund may be applied to the Instruction of Females. I
							submitted also to the Committee a printed paper signed <persRef ref="u"
								>Franklin</persRef> proposing the establishment of Professorships,
							and various courses of Lectures. <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">read</hi>
							<pb n="5" type="ms"/>I read the two Messages of the President, and the
							circular of 18 July 1838 from <persRef ref="forsyth-john">John
								Forsyth</persRef>, Secretary of State; asking for opinions
							concerning the disposal of the fund, and stated the substance of my two
							Letters in answer to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth— I read also
							the Act of 1. July 1836. accepting the bequest and pledging the Faith of
							the United States to its application conformably to the direction of the
								<persRef ref="smithson-james">Testator</persRef>— There was some
							desultory conversation, and Mr Garland moved an adjournment till next
							Tuesday Morning at ten O’Clock, for a fuller Meeting of the Committee
							which was agreed to. H.R.U.S— Private business day. Reports from
							Committees called. <persRef ref="may-william">May</persRef> of Illinois
							moved to suspend the rules, to take up the Resolution for a Committee of
							Inquiry into the defalcation of <persRef ref="swartwout-samuel">Samuel
								Swartwout</persRef> late Collector of the Customs at New-York— Lost
							by yeas and nays 101 to 88. not two thirds— <persRef
								ref="thomas-francis">Thomas</persRef> of Maryland then called for
							the consideration of an amendment to the rules, proposed by him— That
							every alternate Friday should be assigned for the passage of private
							bills, not disputed— But after an hour’s discussion, this also was
							refused, and the Bill for the relief of <persRef ref="browne-pamela"
								>Pamela Brown</persRef>, widow of General <persRef ref="brown-jacob"
								>Jacob Brown</persRef> was taken up as first on the private
							Calendar, having been postponed last Friday— The Bill is a grant of five
							years half-pay of the General to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brown,
							on the principle of the act of 1802, that he died by reason of the wound
							that he received in the campaign of 1814. This Bill was most vehemently
							contested by the spigot-sparing, bung-outpouring economists of both
							parties, and by the Kinderhoek Ochlocracy, mainly because I favoured it—
								<persRef ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod Williams</persRef> made a
							long and inveterate speech against it, but <persRef ref="bronson-isaac"
								>Bronson</persRef>, <persRef ref="taylor-william7">Taylor</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="foster-henry">Foster</persRef> of New-York, especially
							Foster very strenuously supported it— I followed Foster, in a short,
							confused, and very ill digested Speech in its favour; after which Taylor
							said a few words, scarcely heard for the overwhelming call for the
							question— The previous question was moved and carried. A call of the
							House— Motion after motion for adjournment, repetitions of calls for
							yeas, and nays, and every dilatory expedient, was resorted to by
							Williams, <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef>, who clustered together
							to defeat the Bill, in vain— The last devise was by Duncan who when his
							name was called on the passage of the Bill; but when all the names had
							been called through and he had thus ascertained a large majority for the
							Bill, demanded the call of his name; voted ay, and when the <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> had declared the Bill passed gave
							notice that he should to-morrow move a reconsideration of the vote. But
								<persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef> of Louisiana,
							defeated this movement by moving at once the reconsideration, and then
							the previous question which was carried; and the reconsideration
							refused; and the Bill again declared to be passed—the vote in its favour
							was 109 to 72. and the trickery to defeat the will of this majority was
							so dirty that Frank Thomas the ablest and bitterest man among them
							disclaimed it— <persRef ref="morgan-william4">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Morgan</persRef> of Virginia introduced to me <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mahand</persRef> of
							Monongalia in that State, as he said a political friend of mine, who
							told me that he had never seen me but once before, and that was at a
							drawing room at <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Monroe’s</persRef>
							<hi rend="italic">when</hi>
							<pb n="6" type="ms"/>when he heard a conversation between <persRef
								ref="mercer-charles">C. F. Mercer</persRef> &amp; me in which I
							spoke in strong terms against the law which he was then urging through
							Congress, making the African Slave-trade piracy.— <persRef
								ref="smyth-alexander">Alexander Smyth</persRef> afterwards, as an
							electioneering engine against me, charged me with being in favour of the
							African Slave trade, and applied to Mercer for a certificate of what I
							said in that conversation to support the charge—but Mercer refused him.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mahand this day told me that Smyth
							through his colleague <persRef ref="u">Jackson</persRef> had applied
							also to him for a certificate that he had heard me in that conversation
							speak in favour of the African Slave trade— That he had also refused the
							certificate, and had told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jackson what he
							had heard me to say; and it was in strong disapprobation of the act,
							making it punishable with death, as piracy— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Mahand is now a member of the Legislature of Virginia, and
							said that having always been politically my friend, he had asked M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Morgan to introduce him to me, as it might
							be the last time he should ever have the opportunity to see me— Evening
							at whist. </p>

						<p>H.R.U.S. I rode to the Capitol shortly before the Meeting of the House to

							with which I proceed with a heavy heart, from a presentiment that this

							accomplished in the House this day was the settlement of the question
							that <persRef ref="jones-george2">George W. Jones</persRef> the
							Ex-Delegate of the Wisconsin Territory should receive his pay from
							mileage and attendance, until the decision of the house against him—
								<persRef ref="mason-samson">Samson Mason</persRef> of Ohio after a

							who moved the previous Question, but withdrew it, at the request of
								<persRef ref="biddle-richard">Biddle</persRef>, who not only took
							the same side, but spoke with harsh disapprobation of the decision of
							the House against Jones—intimating that if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had
							been present the house would have been wiser— Jones had taken time by
							the forelock, and got a check for his pay without waiting for the
							decision of the House— Upon hearing of which Giddings wrote him a note
							informing him that he should make a question in the House, upon his
							right to pay— Whereupon Jones returned the check to the <persRef
								ref="dorsey-roderick">Serjeant at arms</persRef>. The house decided
							by yeas and nays<space/>to<space/>against Mason’s negative Resolution,
							which the Speaker declared he should consider as equivalent to a
							decision that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones was so entitled—
							Thomas moved a suspension of the Rules to enable <hi rend="italic"

							<pb n="7" type="ms"/>him to offer a Resolution, instructing the

								>M’Kay</persRef> introduced an amendment for an opinion of the then
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">Attorney General, Wirt</persRef> in
							favour of certain allowances to Cass, in his accounts— The house
							adjourned shortly after 3 without transacting any private business— Just
							after dinner I had a long visit from <persRef ref="chapin-stephen">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Chapin</persRef>, the President of the
							Columbian College, who came to ascertain if the College could obtain any
							assistance from the Smithsonian fund. His wish seemed to be that the
							Government should take the College under its own charge as an appendage
							to the Smithsonian Institution. I said that without knowing what were
							the views of others, mine were that no part of the Smithsonian fund
							should be applied to any School, College, University, or Seminary of
							Education— But that equal care should be taken to avoid doing any injury
							whatever to any such institution— He said the condition of the College
							at present was such that unless it could receive assistance from some
							quarter, it must go down, and its concerns must be closed— They had been
							several years struggling to raise a subscription from the Baptists,
							throughout the United States, to pay the debts of the College; but in
							accomplishing this they had failed— There had been a project for
							transferring the whole concern to Richmond Virginia where there was
							already a flourishing Baptist School—but the principal difficulty in the
							way of that was that it might forfeit the subscriptions which they had
							obtained to pay the debts here— I said that if the faculty thought there
							was any prospect of their obtaining any thing from the Smithsonian fund,
							they might apply to the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President of the
								United States</persRef>, or to any other member of the Committee;
							and if there should be any disposition in Congress to aid the College
							from the fund, I would immediately withdraw from the Committee and leave
							the whole arrangement to be made by others— As I deprecated above all
							things the application of the funds to purposes for the benefit of
							individuals I had determined at least to be disinterested myself, and
							would in no shape or form receive one dollar of the fund to myself; and
							as the principal debt of the Columbian College was to me, I could be
							instrumental to no arrangement which would result in the payment of the
							College debt, from the Smithsonian fund— He said he had conversed with
								<persRef ref="ruggles-william">Professor Ruggles</persRef> on the
							subject— They were aware that there was some delicacy in my position
							with regard to the College debt; but they had ample means for the
							payment of their debt as preliminary to their receiving any assistance
							from the Government— I said, that at all Events it was a subject in
							which I could have no agency, though if they should <hi rend="italic"
								>obtain</hi>
							<pb n="8" type="ms"/>obtain encouragement to their wishes from the
							President, or in Congress, I would cheerfully withdraw from the
							Committee. The Doctor asked if I should be willing to receive any
							further communication from him upon the subject— I said certainly; with
							pleasure, and with the best disposition to do any thing, useful to the
							College, in my power. I gave him printed copies of the two Messages of
							the President to the Congress on this subject at the present Session—
							Evening at whist.</p>

						<p>Morning service at the Presbyterian Church— Heard <persRef
								ref="dwight-harrison">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dwight</persRef> a Missionary, recently arrived from
							Constantinople—and who visited me with <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Noble</persRef> one of the
							Presbyterian Clergymen of this City, on the New Years day— His text was
							from Matthew 13.38. “The field is the world” and the Discourse, urgently
							mendicant, was a narrative of his experiences as a Missionary. He went
							from this Country in 1830. and has been 8 years labouring faithfully in
							his vocation; and as he thinks with encouraging success— But his account
							of the several classes of population of the Turkish Empire was a
							melancholy picture— They consist of Turks, Greeks, Armenians and Jews—of
							whom the Armenians are the best, and the Jews the worst— The success of
							the Missionaries was confined entirely to the Armenians, and amounted
							only to the conversion of some of them from the Greek Church to
							evangelical christianity or Presbyterianism— He spoke of the Turks as a
							fair open hearted hospitable, but desperately cruel People—the cruelty
							being a part of their religion, taught in the Koran— Among the
							achievements of the missionaries, there was one seemingly strange— It
							was a translation of the Koran into modern greek to circulate among the
							people, and shew them the absurd abominations that it contains— Upon the
							whole what I gathered from this Sermon was that the sum total of
							accomplishment by the American Missionaries in the Ottoman Empire, is
							the conversion of a small number of Armenian Christians of the Greek
							Church, into Christians of the Presbyterian Church. For as to the Turks,
							apostasy from the Faith of the Koran is Death, and this Law is
							inexorably executed to this day. And as to the Jews, their hatred of all
							Christians is rancorous beyond conception; and the account of the Greeks
							was nearly as unfavourable— Now as to contributions of money to convert
							Armenian Christians to the presbyterian creed to enlighten their
							ignorance; there is in the last Emancipator a Letter from <persRef ref="smith-gerrit">Gerrit Smith</persRef>,
							about two Slaves escaped from a Plantation in Virginia, who were at his
							house on their way to Canada one 49 years old and the other about 35.
							the latter of whom had never been in a house of public worship and never
							had heard of Jesus Christ— This is the fate of millions of natives of
							our own Country; and we are spunged for contributions to teach Armenian
							Christians evangelical presbyterianism— In the afternoon <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read the service for the Epiphany, and read the 49<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Chapter of <persRef ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef> His
							Sermon was from Isaiah 60.1. “Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and
							the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.”— This Chapter he said
							contained the direct prophesy of the manifestation <pb n="9" type="ms"
							/>manifestation of Christ to the Gentiles, and this Chapter was the
							first lesson of the morning service of the day— But as the Epiphany was
							not kept as a festival in this Country, the chapter was read only when
							the day happened on a Sunday, that is once in six or seven years, he had
							therefore chosen this text from that chapter for his afternoon
							discourse— What an occasion it offered, for a commentary upon the whole
							book of Isaiah, and especially upon this Chapter— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley was brief. I had only time to read
							part of a chapter in <persRef ref="gleig-george">Gleig’s</persRef>
							history of the Bible, on the Tower of Babel </p>

						<p>H.R.U.S. <persRef ref="slade-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Slade</persRef> moved to take up his pending resolution for the
							recognition of Hayti—but the House refused. The <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> called over the Territories and
							States for Petitions, beginning with Iowa. There were very few
							petitions, excepting those relating to the abolition of Slavery and the
							Slave-trade; and although there were great numbers of these, the members
							who presented them, manifested not the slightest interest in them— With
							the exception of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Slade who had very
							few—and of <persRef ref="curtis-edward">Edward Curtis</persRef> of
							New-York, who in presenting a petition from that city, said that the
							first signer to it was <persRef ref="bryant-william">William Cullen
								Bryant</persRef>— Of the other members charged with these Petitions,
							some sent all they had to the <persRef ref="garland-hugh"
								>Clerk’s</persRef> table at once—others mumbled over the names of
							the first petitioners, and their numbers in a low indistinct voice; so
							as not to be heard, and all shewed the most perfect indifference to
							their fate— I presented myself one hundred petitions; ninety-five of
							which were directly or indirectly upon the Slavery topics— I named in
							every case the first signer; the place and State from which the Petition
							came, and the number of signers to it.— The Petitions varied much in
							their language; many of them avoiding direct allusion to Slavery; but
							praying for rights, and liberties and grievances, and the Declaration of
							Independence; but the Speaker decided they must all go on to the table,
							by the general order of the Atherton-gag— The Petitions for the
							rescinding of those Resolutions were all laid on the table by separate
							motions, all made by <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef>
							of Virginia— The Peace, and Congress of Nations Petitions were referred
							to the Committee of foreign Affairs; and in each case I moved
							instructions that they should consider and report thereon— Dromgoole
							always moved a division of the question—the reference to the Committee
							was carried; and the instructions refused— The Petitions for the
							recognition of the Republic of Hayti were treated in the same manner.
							There was one Petition of <persRef ref="stevenson-john2">John
								Stevenson</persRef> and 46 others, ironical and bitterly sarcastic
							the whole of which I read— Dromgoole objected to its being received as
							disrespectful to the House— And the House refused to receive it by yeas
							and nays<space/>to<space/>I moved that to shew what it was that the
							House refused to receive, it should be entered on the Journal— The
							Speaker said it was not in possession of the House, and therefore could
							not be entered on the Journal— I then moved that it should be printed.
							The Speaker said it would not be in order: There was a Petition
							from<space/>in the State of Maine, with seven distinct prayers, five of
							which were the Slavery interdicts— Then for the recognition of Hayti—and
							then to rescind the Gag. As this <hi rend="italic">was</hi>
							<pb n="10" type="ms"/>was the whole of the Petition, I read it—before I
							had finished it <persRef ref="parris-virgil">Virgil D. Parris</persRef>,
							enquired of the Speaker if it was order to read the Petition— The
							Speaker said it was not; and had been so repeatedly decided. I insisted
							that I was only making a brief statement of its contents, and read it
							through— I moved the refence to Committee, of the prayers to recognize
							Hayti, and to rescind the gag; but the house refused both, and laid the
							whole on the table I was about an hour and a half, in delivering all my
							Petitions— There was one from William Lloyd Garrison
							and<space/>inhabitants of Boston, praying for the removal of the Seat of
							Government to some place North of the Potomac where the Declaration of
							Independence is not considered as a mere rhetorical flourish— I alluded
							to a Petition from the inhabitants of Georgetown, presented at the last
							Session, praying to be receded to the State of Maryland, and moved that
								<persRef ref="garrison-william">Garrison’s</persRef> petition should
							be referred to a select Committee with Instructions to enquire and
							report to the House their opinion of the Constitutional power of
							Congress to remove the seat of Government, and to recede to the States
							of Virginia and Maryland their respective portions of the territory of
							the District— I said it was a grave and serious question; and if
							Congress had the power, this Petition was an offer of compromise, as a
							substitute for the abolition of Slavery in the District, which deserved
							to be considered— But they laid the petition on the table— After I
							finished the States of New-Hampshire and Maine were called, and then a
							few straggling petitions from members who had been absent from their
							Seats when their States were called— Adjourned near five. Evening at
							whist.</p>

							the money. <hi rend="italic">But</hi>
							<pb n="11" type="ms"/>But the decree of the Master of the Rolls was

						<p>H.R.U.S. The Call for reports from Committees not having been completed

								<persRef ref="fleischmann-charles">Charles Lewis

						<p><date>11. VI. </date>Friday.</p>
						<p>Weather almost at Summer heat— H.R.U.S. Reports from Committees—numerous
							from the Committees on Claims, and the land Committees— <persRef
								ref="craig-robert">Craig</persRef> asked leave to offer a
							Resolution, assigning the first Tuesday in Feb<hi rend="superscript"
								>y</hi> next for the special consideration of Bill 546 granting an
							additional quantity of Land, for the location of Revolutionary bounty
							Land-warrants—but the leave was refused— <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise’s</persRef> resolution for printing 20,000 copies of certain
							defalcation documents was at last disposed of—<persRef
								ref="whittlesey-thomas">T. T. Whittlesey</persRef> moved 5000
							instead of 20000— <persRef ref="mitchell-charles">Mitchell</persRef>
							moved the previous question. Seconded 71 to 65— Petrikin moved to lay
							the whole subject on the table— Wise called the yeas and nays— <persRef
								ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> withdrew his motion, and
							moved to lay the first Resolution (for printing the documents) on the
							table—rejected by yeas and nays 110 to 82— The second Resolution calling
							for a further report from the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of
								the Treasury</persRef>, and correspondence upon defalcations was
							carried by a vote of 185 to 7. The House then went into Committee of the
							whole on the State of the Union, <persRef ref="banks-linn">Linn
								Banks</persRef> in the Chair, upon the Bills from the Committee of
							Naval Affairs, for the consideration of which yesterday and this day had
							been assigned— <persRef ref="evans-george2">Evans</persRef> of Maine,
							routed the Southern phalanx horse, foot and dragoons upon their charges
							of partiality against the South, in the public expenditures on which
							they are eternally ringing the changes, and put them all into a
							ludicrous combustion. <persRef ref="legare-hugh">Legare</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="shepard-charles">Charles Shepard</persRef> struggled in vain to
							escape the castigation— After much snarling debate, and not a little
							confusion the Pensacola and Philadelphia Dry Docks were rejected—
							Petrikin moved to strike out the enacting clause of the Bill and
							failed—the Bill was laid aside— A bill to regulate the pay of pursers in
							the Navy was taken up and carried through with amendments, one of <hi
								rend="italic">which</hi>
							<pb n="14" type="ms"/>which was offered by <persRef ref="moore-ely">Eli
								Moore</persRef>, and without opposition— Then a Bill respecting Navy
							Rations in which an amendment offered by <persRef ref="reed-john">John
								Reed</persRef> was introduced, for giving the option of 6 cents a
							day instead of a gill of Spirits, and reducing the biscuit ration from
							14 to 12 ounces— <persRef ref="potts-david">Potts</persRef> proposed an
							amendment to strike out the Spirits ration, but failed— Then a bill
							reducing several navy appropriations into one passed without debate— A
							Bill for the payment of certain Pensioners heretofore paid out of the
							privateer pension fund</p>
