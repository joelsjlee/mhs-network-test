						<p>Cold rain and storm the whole day. I attended public worship this morning
							at the Presbyterian Church where <persRef ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler</persRef> was settled; and I
							learnt from <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hand</persRef> that this Gentleman’s name is <persRef
								ref="wood-george2">Wood</persRef>— His text was Romans 1.16. [“]For
							I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God
							unto Salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also
							to the Greek.” The sufficiency of Faith to every one for Salvation is a
							primary Article of the Calvinistic creed, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Wood managed his first subject in the usual Style, without
							much warmth or energy— His auditory consisted of about 30 persons— It
							was the first of his preaching here, for in announcing that there would
							be an afternoon service, he said he did not know the usual hour, and
							upon being told it was a quarter before 3. mistook and announced it for
							3. He read also a notice that there would be to-morrow evening a prayer
							meeting at the house of <persRef ref="brown-elizabeth2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> O. B. Brown</persRef>, (the notorious
							Baptist Minister) of the Union female religious association, to
							supplicate God, for a revival of religion in this place— He said this
							meeting was in consequence of the suggestion of some person at
							Boston—and that there were encouraging signs that a revival had already
							commenced, and was now in progress— Of this, the empty walls to which he
							had been preaching gave no luminous evidence.— Nor was it apparent in
							the fact that on going after dinner to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							John’s Church, I found the doors closed— No Service— I then went again
							to the Presbyterian Church, and heard M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wood again from Romans 1.17 “For therein is the righteousness of God
							revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, The just shall live by
							faith.”— The discourse like the text was a sequel to that of the
							morning— The auditory not quite so numerous— About 20 persons— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood announced that there would be
							preaching at the Church next Sunday. It is apparent that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler has <hi rend="strikethrough"
								>apparently</hi> finally left them— <persRef ref="hellen-walter2"
								>Walter Hellen</persRef> came this afternoon and visited his
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Sister</persRef>.— <persRef
								ref="pope-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pope</persRef> also
							came to see us— And <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> in
							the evening— I found on my table the bible I had given to the dear child
								<persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny</persRef> on her birth day 10.
							September 1836— I sent it to her mother, and to sooth if possible her
							feelings on receiving it, with the following lines.</p>
						<lg>
							<l>A blessed Spirit, from the realms on high</l>
							<l>Descended, for a brief sojourn on earth</l>
							<l>From mortal parents she derived her birth,</l>
							<l>And born of <persRef ref="adam">Adam</persRef>, she was doom’d to
								die.</l>
							<l>But still her native region was the sky</l>
							<l>And she was joyous—pure ethereal mirth</l>
							<l>This world contain’d no standard of her worth</l>
							<l>Heaven claim’d its own—and who could dare deny?</l>
							<l>Bereaved Mother! In this volume see</l>
							<l>The solace that from God alone can flow.</l>
							<l>With meek submission to thy Saviour flee</l>
							<l>For balm to heal unutterable woe.</l>
							<l>Look upward—there no sorrow dwells—nor pain</l>
							<l>There shalt thou meet thy darling child again.</l>

						<p>Twenty-sixth Congress— First Session—</p>
						<p><persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef> called upon us this morning. About 11 O’Clock I
							walked to the Capitol, and found the Hall of the House of
							Representatives swarming with members old and new— After half an hour of
							mutual greetings, precisely at Noon the <persRef ref="garland-hugh"
								>Clerk</persRef> of the last House of Representatives, called the
							meeting to order, and said that according to the established rule of
							usage, he should call over the roll of members of whom he had formed a
							list, by States; he then began with Maine—called over the six
							New-England States, and New-York—and <persRef ref="randolph-joseph"
								>Joseph M. Randolph</persRef> of New-Jersey.— He then said that
							there were five other Seats from the State of New-Jersey, which were
							contested; and not feeling himself authorized to decide the question
							between the contending parties he would if it were the pleasure of the
							house pass over the names of those members, and proceed with the call,
							till a house shall be formed, who will then decide the question— This
							gave rise to a debate which continued until past 4 O’Clock when a motion
							was made to adjourn.— The Clerk said he could put no question, not even
							for an adjournment until the House itself should be formed— There could
							nothing be done, but by general consent— There was then a general called
							to adjourn, and although one voice cried no; and others called out to
							adjourn to 11. O’Clock; the Clerk declared the House adjourned to 12.
							This movement has been evidently prepared, to exclude the five Members
							from New-Jersey from voting for Speaker— And the Clerk had his lesson
							prepared for him— Under colour of a modest disclaimer of the right to
							decide between the conflicting claimants, he sets aside the five members
							from their seats and excludes them from voting at the organization of
							the House. It seems to have been supposed that this course would be
							acquiesced in by the whole House, for the Clerk was unprepared to meet
							the objection to it— His two decisions form together an insurmountable
							objection to the transaction of any business, and an impossibility of
							organizing the House.— He stops the call before a Quorum of the House is
							formed, and then refuses to put any Question until there shall be a
							Quorum formed— The most curious part of the case is that his own
							election as Clerk depends upon the exclusion of the New-Jersey Members—
							The debate itself was conducted with decency and moderation—but in its
							progress will doubtless elicit heat enough— Returning home, I stop’d at
								<persRef ref="taylor-frank">Taylors</persRef> Book-store, and
							bespoke the American Almanac for 1840. And the Religious Souvenir as a
							present to my Granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Mary-Louisa</persRef>— She was born this day eleven years ago, and
							then as this day it was a day of Meeting to Congress— I have been here
							only two days, and find myself already afflicted with a catarrhal cough
							and hoarseness of voice— I think this has never once failed me in the
							eight successive years that I have come on to this City to attend
							Congress as a member of the House of Representatives— I met in the lobby
							of the House this day several of my old acquaintance and among the rest
								<persRef ref="serruys-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Serruys</persRef>, the Chargé d’Affaires from Belgium to whom I
							promised last Winter, autographs of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef> and myself— I received a few weeks since a Letter
							from him reminding me of this promise, and have now only to revise and
							copy the lines I composed in the Narragansett, to be ready for him.</p>

						<p>Rain storm the whole day— My hoarseness and catarrhal cough increase,
							with no inconsiderable pain— Attributing this to the use of Anthracite
							coal in my bed and writing chambers, I had this day, the grate taken out
							of the fire-place in my writing chamber; and a wood-fire made instead of
							the coal— Before I went to the capitol this morning, I called at the
							Bank of Washington, and drew a check for 50 dollars— I saw notices
							posted up in the banking room that demands upon the bank would be paid
							only in bills, unless by special agreement otherwise.— Next I went to
								<persRef ref="u">Morgan’s</persRef> store and ordered a box of one
							dozen of claret wine which he said was a fair Article at 5. dollars—
							Then at the Franklin Insurance company, where I received a dividend of 5
							per Cent, on my Stock;—only half the dividend of last May.— Then at
								<persRef ref="cranch-william">judge Cranch’s</persRef>, where I saw
							only <persRef ref="cranch-anna">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Cranch</persRef>, and left a Letter for <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-william">William C. Greenleaf</persRef> from his
							family at Quincy. The judge was at Court— When the House met at Noon,
								<persRef ref="duncan-alexander">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Duncan</persRef> was ready charged and primed for a Speech; when
								<persRef ref="garland-hugh">Garland</persRef> the Clerk addressed
							the House, saying that he had been aware of the extreme difficulty and
							delicacy of his situation, and asked permission to read a statement
							which he had prepared assigning the reasons for the course that he had
							taken— <persRef ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef> asked him if he
							had reconsidered his determination not to call the members from
							New-Jersey, whose seats are contested— The Clerk said he must persist in
							what he considered to be his duty— Then arose a long day’s debate on the
							question whether the Clerk’s statement should or should not be heard—
							The administration party without exception, and the noodles among the
							whigs being for hearing him; and all the rest against it— <persRef
								ref="stanly-edward">Stanly</persRef> of North-Carolina directly
							objected to his making any statement at all— <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise</persRef> made a long speech to persuade the House to hear the
							Statement—intimating that he wanted to hear what he had to say in
							justification of so extraordinary a procedure.— <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> were both willing to hear what
							the Clerk had to say; but <persRef ref="white-john6">White</persRef> of
							Kentucky protested vehemently against it and supported his objection by
							a powerful speech; delivered with so much rapidity that I lost much of
							his argument in the indistinctness of his articulation— <persRef
								ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef>, <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
								Johnson</persRef> and <persRef ref="bynum-jesse">Bynum</persRef>
							made party Speeches frothy with the rights of the people, technicalities
							and frauds, till after four O’Clock when a motion was made to adjourn—
							The Clerk still persisting in his refusal to put any question, till the
							House should be organized, and Cushing telling him that he should not
							consider the house adjourned unless by a vote— The Clerk said he would
							judge upon inspection around him whether a majority of the members were
							in favour of adjourning; and then he declared the House adjourned;
							Cushing and others calling out a count! a count! and Wise as the members
							were rushing out of the Hall, loudly saying Now we are a mob!— I walked
							home, the storm still raging— <persRef ref="sergeant-john">J.
								Sergeant</persRef> introduced to me in the lobby a <persRef
								ref="tancred-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tancred</persRef>
							a member of the British Parliament who has been travelling in Canada— He
							told me that <persRef ref="peel-robert">Peele’s</persRef> ministry was
							overthrown by the choice of an Opposition Speaker 316 to 310. and that
							within two months afterwards 6 of the opposition members were disseated
							upon contested elections.</p>

						<p>My Catarrhal cough is yet very troublesome, and painful, and disturbs my
							sleep— I was up this morning at 3 O’Clock—and again at 5— I had some
							difficulty in kindling my wood fire, and then in writing to retrieve my
							arrears in this diary. <persRef ref="browne-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> William Browne</persRef> called this
							morning—and said he would call again to-morrow— <persRef
								ref="thomas-james3">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Thomas</persRef> came for gossipping He said it was reported in the
							Madisonian of this morning that there had been a Caucus of the
							Administration party, to agree upon the choice of a Speaker, and that
								<persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lewis-dixon">Dixon H Lewis</persRef> had been nominated—but
							that <persRef ref="benton-thomas">Thomas H. Benton</persRef> had
							attended the Caucus, and protested against the appointment of either of
							them, because they had been nullifiers; and read some of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson’s</persRef> blasting denunciation of
							the nullifiers— That <persRef ref="jones-john9">Joseph Jones</persRef>
							of Virginia had then been put in nomination and was carried by a
							majority of one vote— Benton’s objection to Pickens and the nullifiers
							is their connection with <persRef ref="calhoun-john">John C.
								Calhoun</persRef>, whom Benton regards as a very adder in his way—
							The house met again at noon, and the Clerk announced that <persRef
								ref="duncan-alexander">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Duncan</persRef>, who had taken the floor at the time of adjournment
							was now by Parliamentary usage entitled to it— <persRef ref="wise-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wise</persRef> said he had in
							his hand a Resolution drawn up by one of his Colleagues now absent,
								<persRef ref="botts-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Botts</persRef>, who would himself have offered it if he had been
							present— He hoped it might reconcile all opinions, and asked D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Duncan to yield him the floor for a moment
							to present it, which he did. The Resolution was in substance that the
							Clerk should proceed in the call of the members whose election was
							uncontested, and that being gone through and a Quorum of the House found
							they should immediately proceed before organizing the House to examine
							and decide upon the claims to the contested Seats. This of course
							changed the subject of debate. Yesterday it was whether the Clerk should
							be permitted to make a statement of his reasons for stopping in the
							midst of his call of the roll; referring to the house the question
							whether he should pass by the members whose Seats were contested, and
							then refusing to put to the house any question whatever, because the
							roll had not been called far enough to constitute a Quorum— This day it
							was this Resolution of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wise, which
							conceded the point made by the Clerk to pass over the members from New
							Jersey— <persRef ref="hunt-hiram">Hunt</persRef> of New-York offered as
							a substitute a Resolution, that the call should proceed allowing the
							New-Jersey members to vote; that the House when formed should choose a
							temporary Speaker without power to appoint Committees— That a Committee
							of Elections should be chosen by ballot, who should immediately examine
							and the claims to the Seats, and the House after settling the question
							should proceed to elect a Speaker— <persRef ref="graves-william2"
								>Graves</persRef> offered a substitute for both Resolutions, one
							directing the <persRef ref="garland-hugh">Clerk</persRef> to proceed in
							the call of the New Jersey members who have the regular certificate of
							election from the Governor of the State— He replied <pb n="286"
								type="ms"/>by a very violent speech, to one equally violent made
							yesterday, by <persRef ref="weller-john">Weller</persRef> a new member
							form Ohio— The debate was continued in a desultory manner, by <persRef
								ref="hoffman-josiah">Hoffman</persRef>, Pickens, <persRef
								ref="craig-robert">Craig</persRef>, <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">D.
								D. Barnard</persRef>
							<persRef ref="cooper-mark">Cooper</persRef> of Georgia, Stanly Wise and
								<persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>. The speech of
							Barnard was admirable— It came to be past four O’Clock— Underwood a very
							worthy amiable man troubled with the conceit that he is the very wisest
							of mankind made a Speech to show the absolute necessity of passing over
							the New-Jersey Members and intimating that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had
							prepared a Resolution which would settle all difficulties; but as there
							was not now time for discussing it he must move an adjournment. The
							Clerk then said that he must correct a decision which he had made
							yesterday—that until a Quorum of the house should be formed he could not
							put to the house any question whatever—but he had found last Night in
							the Constitution of the United States that although a Quorum of the
							House was necessary to do business, a smaller number was competent to
							adjourn from day to day— So he read the clause in the Constitution, and
							put the question of adjournment which was carried—</p>
						<p>I had evening visits from <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">Abbott
								Lawrence</persRef>, <persRef ref="johnson-william2">William Cost
								Johnson</persRef> and <persRef ref="connell-john">John
								Connell</persRef> Lawrence and Johnson were very urgent that I
							should address the House in this debate— Several other members had
							already requested the same thing— I now said that if I should speak at
							all, I should address the house, and not the clerk— I should call upon
							the house, and upon the majority of the House to organize themselves as
							the first of their duties. Lawrence and Johnson both said they thought
							that would be the proper course.</p>

							without employment— That he was obliged to take the benefit of the
							insolvent act— That he now has a place and hopes to be able in time his
							debt to me, which he does not consider at all cancelled by his
							insolvency; and that he is willing to give a new engagement for its
							payment. I said I would look up the papers, and asked him to call again
							next Tuesday morning which he promised to do— This day was beautiful,

						<p>debate, by a speech of an hour in support of a long resolution with a

								>Wise’s</persRef> Resolution—that is that the New-Jersey members
							should not be called till the roll of the uncontested members should be
							gone through: and that then their title to their Seats shall be tried—
							When he sat down, <persRef ref="dickerson-philemon">Philemon
								Dickerson</persRef>, one of the contesting members rose to speak—he
							had already attempted to speak yesterday, and had only been prevented by
								<persRef ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard’s</persRef> refusing to

								ref="randolph-joseph">Randolph</persRef> got the floor, though
								<persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef> remonstrated
							against it; and he spoke at least an hour and a half in vindication of
							the conduct of the Governor and Council of New Jersey.— Immediately on
							his taking his seat, I rose and said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clerk and obtained the floor.— I then turned to the House and said
							Fellow Citizens, Members elect of the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Congress of the United States— I shewed them the necessity that I was
							under, of addressing them directly, the two decisions of the Clerk,
							having rendered it impossible for the House to proceed at all unless by
							an appeal from the Clerk to them— I then called upon them in the name of
							the People, of their Country and of mankind, to organize themselves— I
							offered finally, the Resolution yesterday presented by Graves ordering
							the Clerk to call the members from New-Jersey, possessing credentials
							from the Governor of the State, and I declared my determination to put
							the question to the meeting myself— I said any member might offer an
							amendment to my Resolution, which would bring the question before the
							meeting to an immediate issue— Vanderpoel held out a paper and said he
							had an amendment to offer.— <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef>
							then offere a Resolution that <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis

							Williams and put the question which was answered by an almost universal
							shout in the affirmative— Two members of the House conducted me to the
							chair— Whereupon Wise immediately offered the same Resolution that I had
							offered to the Meeting— <persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave
								Johnson</persRef> moved an adjournment— <persRef
								ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef> had moved that the Rules of

							but <persRef ref="briggs-charles">Briggs</persRef> objected that the

							upon which tellers were called, and the adjournment was carried by a

								Sergeant</persRef> called on me this morning, and said that both
							parties had held Caucuses last Evening— That the Administration party
							were greatly exasperated; and many wild propositions had been presented;
							but none adopted— They had separated without coming to any conclusion—
							The opposition meeting had also been attended with much diversity of
							opinion but they had finally come to the conclusion that there was but
							one course to pursue— And that was to adhere to the Constitution the
							Law, and the established usage— As to the voting of the New Jersey
							members for Speaker— They had themselves scruples, but Sergeant thought
							they ought to vote— I thought they should not—that the Administration
							would carry their Speaker even with the New-Jersey vote against them,
							and I thought it would be most expedient to let them have their Speaker
							When I reached the House, I was advised to take the Chair at the precise
							moment of 12 for there was some apprehension that the <persRef
								ref="garland-hugh">Clerk</persRef> would not withstanding the
							proceedings of yesterday attempt to preside again— But I had been in his
							chamber, and examined the Journal of the proceedings of the Meeting
							hitherto, and had told him that they must be read this Morning; to which
							he had assented— One of the boys of the House brought me a Letter from
								<persRef ref="rhett-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rhett</persRef>— It was sealed and addressed to R. B. Rhett. I told
							the boy to take it back, but he insisted that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rhett had told him to bring it to me. I opened it, and
							immediately found that it could not be for me. I was taking it back to
							him, when he came up to me, and said the boy had taken the wrong
							Letter—he took it back and gave me the Letter which he had written to
							me. It apprized me that there was great excitement, at my appointment as
							chairman of the Meeting— That many persons thought I should not act with
							my impartiality, though he did not entertain that opinion himself, and
							hoped such apprehensions would not be realized. Precisely at Noon I took
							the Chair—called the meeting to order and directed the Journal of the
							four preceding days to be read— Several amendments were proposed,
							discussed and adopted. <persRef ref="wise-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Wise’s</persRef> resolution was then taken up, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rhett moved to lay it on the table, with a
							view to offer a resolution of his own— Rhett premised his resolution
							with a Speech upon which <persRef ref="biddle-richard">Biddle</persRef>
							called him to order upon the rule that motions to order shall be decided
							without debate.— I said that the objection was correct in principle, but
							the practice of the House was otherwise— That always allowed the mover
							of a Resolution to lay on the table to precede it with a speech— Rhett
							however was sh<unclear>arru</unclear>ed out of the remnant of his
							speech; and said he would without further observation submit his motion—
							Tellers were called for. I named <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole</persRef> of Virginia and <persRef ref="davis-john11"
								>Davis</persRef> of Pennsylvania— Dromgoole said he was willing to
							serve but asked who he should count as members from New-Jersey, there
							were ten persons from that State claiming Seats, he knew not which were
							entitled to them and was willing to count them all— I said he must count
							those who had produced the regular credential from the <persRef
								ref="pennington-william">Governor</persRef> of the State the same as
							that upon which one member <hi rend="italic">from</hi>
							<pb n="289" type="ms"/>from the State had been called, according to the
							Constitution and Laws of the United States, and the Laws of New-Jersey;
							whereupon Vanderpoel started up; took an appeal from the decision, and
							charged the decision as a monstrous usurpation—this occasioned a debate
							for the remainder of the day; till after 4. O’Clock when <persRef
								ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> of Ohio took the floor, and
							moved an adjournment which was carried— In this debate there was much
							vituperation, and much equally unacceptable compliment, lavished
							personally upon me. We had evening visits from <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="hall-frederick">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frederick Hall</persRef>.</p>

						<p><date>7. IV:15— </date>Saturday.</p>
						<p>I am still harrassed with my Catarrhal cough; and with the task of
							keeping up the current of my Diary with the lapse of time— At noon I
							took the chair of the Meeting and the Journal was read—many amendments
							to it were proposed and discussed and adopted. There was one proposed by
								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> to add some
							of the words, in which I gave the decision yesterday— The Journal had
							merely stated the decision of the Chairman, that the members who had
							produced the Credential from the <persRef ref="pennington-william"
								>Governor</persRef> of the State should alone be counted.— I was
							satisfied with that—but I had said conformably to the Constitution of
							the United States and the Laws of New-Jersey and Governor Lincoln
							thought it important that these words should be added to the Journal— A
							long debate ensued, and the question was finally taken by tellers— I
							named <persRef ref="davies-edward">Davies</persRef> of Pennsylvania and
								<persRef ref="smith-albert2">Albert Smith</persRef> of Maine.— Smith
							asked Dromgoole’s question over again, for whom of the claimants to the
							New Jersey Seats, he should count? but he did not add as <persRef
								ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> had done that he would
							count every one who should present himself, unless otherwise directed by
							the house I therefore said that if any person whose seat was contested
							should pass between the tellers, they should report the fact to the
							Meeting. Smith then alledged that he did not know the members from New
							Jersey, but <persRef ref="randolph-joseph">Randolph</persRef> told him
							he would stand by and point out to him any one of them who should pass
							through— He then did act as teller and they reported 106 for the
							amendment and 107 against it.— None of the New-Jersey members passed
							through and it is apparent from this vote, that the choice of the
							Speaker will depend entirely upon the New Jersey vote— I took the
							occasion to address the house, assigning my reasons for the decision of
							yesterday, and for giving a different decision to the tellers to-day.
							And I said that believing there was on this occasion there was more heat
							than diversity of opinion it was my most earnest wish to allay that heat
							and to bring the meeting to a cool and deliberate decision on the
							questions before them. I said I considered my authority and duties in
							the chair confined to the single purpose of organizing the house, and as
							soon as the roll shall be called through I shall call upon the House to
							elect a Speaker, and my functions as chairman will be at an end— And as
							the choice of Speaker must by the rule of the house <pb n="290"
								type="ms"/>be made by nominal call, and answer viva voce, when the
							members from New-Jersey shall be called, whose Seats are contested, if
							they answer it will be yet in Season, for any member to object to their
							votes being received or counted— I referred to the case of the contested
							vote of Michigan at the last Presidential election, for a precedent of
							the manner in which this contest might be adjusted, and to the Journals
							of the Confederation Congress for a question upon the right to vote of
							two members from Rhode-Island varied eight or nine times to exclude them
							from voting; but upon every one of which they did vote— After I finished
							my address, <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> moved, he said
							in conformity to my remarks an amendment to the Journal of Thursday
							specifying that the appointment of Chairman was for the single purpose
							of organizing the house, which was adopted— <persRef
								ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> of Ohio had the floor but
							yielded it successively to several members, and at last made several
							attempts to yield it to <persRef ref="dickerson-philemon">Philemon
								Dickerson</persRef>, one of the claimants to the Seats against the
							credentials of the Governor; but so much opposition was made to this
							that they gave it up— <persRef ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef>
							had moved a Resolution that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickerson a
							claimant to a Seat form New-Jersey having expressed a desire to address
							the house, that permission should be granted him by courtesy— But this
							did not suit them, and they gave it up, for the present.— Duncan
							commenced his Speech, and ranted and raved for two hours, till many of
							the Seats both in the house and in the galleries, for the first time
							since the Session commenced were vacated. He called up, from the Clerk’s
							Table and caused to be read numerous returns and certificates of the
							elections, all ex parte, brought by the contesting claimants of the
							New-Jersey Seats— No objection was made to the reading of these Papers
							at first, but after it had consumed about an hour <persRef
								ref="graves-william2">Graves</persRef> enquired if the reading of
							them was in order— I said, it was always allowed unless objection was
							made; but in that case it could only be with permission of the meeting—
								<persRef ref="halstead-william">Halsted</persRef> and Randolph
							stated that all these Documents were taken without notice; and that they
							had certificates to the same effective points, of opposite import
							regularly taken and with notice. <persRef ref="white-edward"
								>White</persRef> objected to the further reading of the papers— It
							was near four O’Clock, and <persRef ref="craig-robert">Craig</persRef>
							moved an adjournment which was carried— I went into the library and took
							out the first and tenth volumes of the Transactions of the English
							Astronomical Society— <persRef ref="pearson-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pearson’s</persRef> work has not yet

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seaton</persRef> that the
							Reporters Notes of my Address to the Meeting this morning, should be

							notes, and went through with the work. I received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="bigelow-john">John P. Bigelow</persRef>, Secretary of the

						<p>As I was going out this morning, I met at the door, a boy from the
							National Intelligencer Office who came for the revised report of my
							address to the Meeting yesterday morning, which I gave him— I attended
							public worship at the Capitol, and heard <persRef ref="nott-eliphalet"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Nott</persRef>, President of
							Schenectady College, from Job 30.23. [“]For I know that thou wilt bring
							me to death and to the house appointed for all living.” It can hardly be
							imagined that at this day a Discourse upon Death should present any
							thing of novelty—nor did it— The thoughts were of the most hacknied
							common place concerning the universality of death, considered in a
							religious point of view. The Sermon was delivered memoriter—regularly
							composed and divided according to <persRef ref="claude-jean"
								>Claude’s</persRef> Treatise upon the composition of a Sermon— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Nott’s voice is neither strong nor
							clear—but his manner is solemn, impressive and highly interesting. The
							Hall was well filled; many members of Congress, were there, and the
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President of the United
								States</persRef>, who led in his daughter in Law, <persRef
								ref="vanburen-angelica">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Abraham Van
								Buren</persRef> and they took seats at the foot of the Speaker’s
							Chair— The preacher commanded the unremitted attention of the whole
							auditory, for about an hour— He read two hymn’s one of which was that of
								<persRef ref="watts-isaac">Watts</persRef> “Hark! From the Tombs, a
							doleful cry” but no one there undertook to sing it— <persRef
								ref="curtis-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward
								Curtis</persRef> introduced D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nott to
							me, one day last week in the Hall, and I had a short conversation with
							him—in which he expressed to me the opinion that there had been within
							the last half century much human improvement in the physical Sciences,
							but that the moral Sciences had gone backwards— I concurred in the first
							part of his opinion but doubted the accuracy of the last— The use of the
							Hall was obtained by a written application signed by many members, drawn
							up by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis, and of which I was the
							first signer. <persRef ref="taliaferro-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Taliaferro</persRef> this day thanked me for it— Before
							leaving the Hall I heard it said that the Convention at Harrisburg had
							nominated by a large majority <persRef ref="harrison-william">William H.
								Harrison</persRef> of Ohio, as the Candidate of the Opposition to
							the re-election of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van-Buren— Returning
							from the Capitol, <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence</persRef> and he were
							desirous of having some conversation with me on the present condition of
							our affairs, and I told him I would meet them at any time and place
							agreeable to them— I called at the Office of the National Intelligencer
							and spoke to <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gales</persRef> of the references to the Journals of both Houses of
							Congress, and of the Confederation Congress in my Address to the Meeting
							yesterday.— They had not at the Office the Journals of the Old Congress,
							and I sent the Volume to him by the boy. I asked M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gales to insert in the Intelligencer the notice of the death
							of my dear <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Grandchild</persRef> which he
							promised— He told me that the nomination of Harrison at Harrisburg was
							the triumph of Anti-Masonry, and was entirely the work of <persRef

							New-York— <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> dined with

								Botts</persRef>, two of the members of the House from Virginia
							called upon me this morning; to consult with me, upon what is best to be
							done in the present crisis of affairs— I said that as <persRef
								ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef>
							<hi rend="strikethrough">is</hi> was producing the testimony on the part
							of the contesting claimants, perhaps it would be best to let him go
							through with it—receive the testimony on the other side, and settle the
							question now— Wise had two Letters, one from <persRef
								ref="french-benjamin">French</persRef> the Under clerk, and the
							other anonymous: he supposed from <persRef ref="u">Sutherland</persRef>,
							proposing expedients— French’s Letter was rather an exhortation to
							compromise— The anonymous Letter recommended that I should assume all
							the powers of a Speaker of the House, in which I should certainly not be
							sustained— I said it was apparent from the vote taken on Saturday that
							there was an Administration majority of one vote, without the New-Jersey
							members; and most probably an opposition majority of one or two with
							them They did not vote—and therefore <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2"
								>Governor Lincoln’s</persRef> proposed amendment of the journal was
							lost.— Wise said they would then reverse my decision upon the appeal I
							said I supposed they would—but then they must decide who should vote for
							the people of New-Jersey, or they must exclude five-sixths of that
							representation from voting at-all.— Wise said he had thoughts of
							withdrawing his resolution, in which I told him I should readily
							acquiesce. He said it was the most knotty point he had ever met with in
							his life— At the Hall I enquired of several members why the testimony
							should not now be received on both sides, and the parties heard, and the
							right to the seats determined at once.— but I was told that the members
							with the <persRef ref="pennington-william">Governor’s</persRef>
							credentials had not all their testimony ready, and must have time to
							take it; and when the debate upon White’s objection to the further
							reading of Duncan’s papers came on <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron"
								>Vanderpoel</persRef> avowed that he should oppose the reading of
							testimony on the other side of the question— The debate upon <persRef
								ref="white-john6">White’s</persRef> objection to the further reading
							of the papers continued about two hours; and then was decided by tellers
							106. to 101. in favour of the reading.— Nearly two hours more were
							consumed in the reading— The last paper was a copy of the Record of the
							proceedings of the Governor and Council of New-Jersey, on the return of
							the members—the protest of the minority and the reply of the majority of
							the Council— This paper certified by the <persRef ref="westcott-james"
								>Secretary of State</persRef> of New Jersey, was delivered to the
								<persRef ref="garland-hugh">Clerk</persRef> of the House only last
							Saturday<space/>of Indiana, objected to its being read on that account—
							I said I considered, the vote of the meeting on White’s objection, as
							equivalent to a permission to read what he pleased, and it was read.
								<persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> now offered his
							old proposition new vamped, giving up the point of the New-Jersey
							Representation, which Duncan said he was willing to accept, and after 4.
							P.M. the meeting adjourned.</p>

								Leonard</persRef>, a Spanish woman speaking intelligible English,
							and representing herself as the widow of <persRef ref="leonard-john">a
								man</persRef> who was 33 years Consul of the United States at
							Barcelona came as she said by the advice of the <persRef

							enquire what was the prospect of the claims of indemnity for French
							Spoliations prior to the year 1800, she as the representative of her
							husband, having one of those claims— She said she had been last winter
							to <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> with the same enquiry, and he had told her that the
							Session was so short, the claims could probably not be provided for
							then; but they might be at this Session— I told her they might be; but
							it was impossible for me to say that they would be— She said that during
							her husband’s life he had given <persRef ref="key-francis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Key</persRef> a power to prosecute
							this claim for him— That since his death M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Key had required of her and <persRef ref="leonard-francis">her

							which that from her husband had not been, and which therefore, by the
							advice of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Matthews, she and her son had
							refused to sign— The woman appear very intelligent, and has been very
							handsome, but she must be mistaken in the belief that he was 33 years
							Consul of the United States at Barcelona.— I applied this morning at the
							Patriotic Bank, with a check for the dividend of the Franklin-insurance
							company, which they paid me in Bills of the Bank of Washington, which
							has suspended Specie payments.— I deposited the Bills in the Bank
							itself, and took an order upon the Merchants Bank at Boston for 100
							dollars, for which I gave a check for 108 dollars.— I endorsed the order
							to the order of <persRef ref="heath-john4">John F. Heath</persRef> and
							gave it to <persRef ref="rives-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rives</persRef>, the member of the House— Precisely at Noon I took
							the Chair of the Meeting— The journal of yesterday was read, I stated
							the question under consideration at the adjournment of the Meeting, and
							that the member from Ohio, (<persRef ref="duncan-alexander"
								>Duncan</persRef>) had the floor.— He was not present, and <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> moved the Previous Question <persRef
								ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> moved a Call of the
							House, which I decided could not be made, the Roll of the House not
							being completed— Other dilatory motions were made to consume the time
							until Duncan should come in—but finally the Previous Question was taken
							and carried, and upon the main question my decision was reversed, and it
							was decided that the members from New-Jersey who have produced the
							credential from the <persRef ref="pennington-william">Governor of New
								Jersey</persRef> should not vote— I then referred to the Meeting to
							determine who should vote for the People of New Jersey which gave rise
							to another stormy debate. Duncan having in the mean time come in and
							claiming the floor for the conclusion of his Speech— A Babel of
							confusion followed, and multitudes of propositions, till I proposed to
							take the vote on <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett’s</persRef> motion to
							lay Wise’s Resolution on the table, the tellers to count all who should
							pass through and if any member from New Jersey whose seat was contested
							should pass his name should be reported to the meeting to decide whether
							it should <hi rend="italic">be</hi>
							<pb n="294" type="ms"/>be counted or not— After much confusion this was
							at last assented to and the vote was 115 to lay on the table and 114
							against it.— I voted against it and that making a tie on the motion to
							lay on the table— I announced that it was not carried— A question then
							was made on the right of <persRef ref="naylor-charles">Naylor</persRef>
							to vote—a new question, which had not before been made— Naylor rose and
							protested against the right of the meeting to deprive him of his
							vote—and I said I was of that opinion, upon which <persRef
								ref="turney-hopkins">Turney</persRef> took an appeal and another
							scene of confusion ensued.— A motion to adjourn was made and the
							question taken by Tellers. 116 for and 113 against adjournment, and I
							declared the house adjourned— There were three of the disputed votes on
							each side of this question and when I left the chair, <persRef
								ref="yorke-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Yorke</persRef>
							one of the members with Credentials seemed to be under the impression
							that by deducting the votes on both sides, their rights were affected by
							being placed on a level with those of their adversaries, but I assured
							him that I had no such intention— I said that had I deducted the three
							votes of their adversaries and counted theirs; there still would have
							been a tie and I should have voted for adjournment— I wrote this Evening

							last Evening a meeting of the whig members to consult upon what was now
							to be done— A Resolution had been adopted, offered by <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> that in taking the vote on
								<persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett’s</persRef> motion to lay Wise’s
							Resolution on the table, or on Wise’s Resolution itself— The tellers
							should report the <hi rend="italic">names</hi> of any whose vote should
							be disputed for the decision of the House— I said the Resolution was
							general in its terms, but I had not considered it as including <persRef
								ref="naylor-charles">Naylor</persRef>, because he had constantly
							voted, and his vote had never before been disputed I had therefore
							decided that his vote should be counted, and there was an appeal from
							that decision, which was first question for this morning— Wise said if
							my decision should be reversed, the question would be still upon
							Naylor’s right to vote; and the decision might depend on the manner in
							which it should be stated— It should be, shall the vote of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Naylor be excluded— That would require a
							majority to exclude.— But should it be put shall the vote be counted
							that would require a majority and a tie would exclude him. I said if
							they had a majority to reverse my decision, they would certainly insist
							that the question should be put shall the vote be counted, and if I
							should put it otherwise, the charge of usurpation would be renewed with
							double violence. Wise said he thought he would move that Naylor’s vote
							should be excluded, and vote against it himself to have the question put
							in that form— I said I had been reflecting, what my duty would be, if
							they should proceed to elect a Speaker, excluding the 5 votes from
							New-Jersey—and the question had occurred to me <hi rend="italic"
								>whether</hi>
							<pb n="295" type="ms"/>whether it would not be my duty, to refuse to
							announce the choice as unconstitutional and void not being made by a
							majority of the members present; and to resign the chair leaving it to
							the clerk to announce the choice— Then on taking my Seat immediately to
							offer Resolutions, declaring the right of the People of New-Jersey to
							six members representing them in the house. that by authentic evidence
							exhibited to the house it appears that they have elected members to
							represent them who are in attendance claiming their Seats—. That by the
							arbitrary decision of the house, five of them have been excluded from
							their right to vote— That no Speaker has been elected by a majority of
							the members present, and that the choice made is unconstitutional null
							and void— And perhaps then to refuse to be sworn by the Speaker—
							Sergeant said it would be perfectly proper to resign the chair; but not
							to refuse to be sworn— It would be impossible to bring the whig members
							to untie and persevere in that— Wise said it would certainly not come to
							that— They could not bring their majority to vote for a Speaker,
							excluding the votes of the New Jersey members— We shall see— At the
							Capitol, when at Noon the Meeting was called to order, and the journals
							of the proceedings of yesterday was read Wise moved an amendment stating
							that when <persRef ref="smith-albert2">Albert Smith</persRef> of Maine
							challenged Naylor’s right to vote, Naylor challenged his in return—
							Smith said it was the fact and he had no injection to its being entered
							on the Journal which it was.— Then the first question was on my decision
							that Rhett’s motion to lay Wise’s Resolution on the table was not
							carried, because there 115 votes in the affirmative, and 115 in the
							negative counting Naylor’s vote and my own; and <persRef
								ref="turney-hopkins">Turney’s</persRef> appeal from it— On this
							appeal the tellers reported 112 including the 5 commissioned members
							from New-Jersey to sustain the decision of the Chair and 118 including 4
							of contesting New-Jersey-men against it— Here were 9 votes from
							New-Jersey, besides that of <persRef ref="randolph-joseph"
								>Randolphs</persRef>. As there had been yesterday two votes from the
								3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> district of Pennsylvania.— But even
							allowing all the lawful votes to be counted, and rejecting all the
							unlawful votes, the still-remained a majority of two against my decision
							and I declared it reversed— And now upon Briggs’s resolution of
							yesterday I called for the decision of the house whether each separate
							contested name should or should not be counted— This was demanded by
								<persRef ref="johnson-william2">Cost Johnson</persRef>, and Wise— It
							was objected that the decision upon all the names, would not change the
							result; but Briggs’s resolution was peremptory and I determined not to
							be diverted from it— The furies all broke loose— Turney poured forth a
							volley of the foulest mouthed invective— <persRef ref="u"
								>Thomas</persRef> writhed in agony— <persRef ref="mckay-james"
								>M’Kay</persRef> of North-Carolina, the <persRef ref="jerrysneak"
								>Jerry Sneak</persRef> of candid prevarication raised a base
							pretension that Briggs’s Resolution referred only to two questions of
							which this was not one— But the call for the previous Question had been
							seconded— I told M’Kay that he was too late with his objection, I would
							not suffer my hold upon the Previous Question to be loosened—it was
							taken and carried, and the main question, shall the vote of Naylor be
							counted was carried in the affirmative 119 to 112 and I announced that
							the house had reversed the decision of the Chair that the vote of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Naylor should be counted; and had
							themselves come to the <pb n="296" type="ms"/>same decision—that the
							vote of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Naylor should be counted— Next
							came the question upon the vote of <persRef ref="aycrigg-john"
								>Aycrigg</persRef>. Ayes 117. including 4 commissioned members— Naes
							122 including 3. of the certificated claimants there were of course 8
							votes from New Jersey— I said the Chair considers this vote
							Unconstitutional— Upon which there was a new outburst of indignation— I
							repeated the Chair considers this decision as unconstitutional; was
							much, as more votes were received from the State of New Jersey than she
							was entitled to— But the majority of this meeting thus informally
							constituted having so decided the Chairman finds himself compelled to
							announce that the vote of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Aycrigg cannot
							be counted— The question was then successively taken upon <persRef
								ref="maxwell-john">Maxwell</persRef>, and then upon <persRef
								ref="halstead-william">Halsted</persRef>
							<persRef ref="stratton-charles">Stratton</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="yorke-thomas">Yorke</persRef>, and they were in like manner
							excluded from voting— Then the question came upon the vote of <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef>— He attempted
							five or six times to address the chair without success; at last he came
							directly in front of the Clerks table and said he wished to withdraw his
							claim to the right of voting at present— I said if the Gentleman
							withdrew his claim to vote, he was not a member of the House and had no
							right to address the Chair—upon which he slunk away— The question was
							then taken whether his vote should be counted, and not one member passed
							between the tellers and 158 passed through in the negative— The question
							was then taken upon, the votes of <persRef ref="cooper-william4"
								>Cooper</persRef>, <persRef ref="kille-joseph">Kille</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="ryall-daniel">Ryall</persRef>—not one passed between
							the Tellers in the affirmative 133 in the negative. I then announced
							that the decision by the Chair that Rhett’s motion to lay Wise’s
							Resolution on the table was not carried, there being a tie 115 and 115
							including Naylor’s vote had been reversed, and in the process of
							reversal, the Meeting had decided that the vote of Naylor should be
							counted, which was precisely the decision the chairman had made— I
							therefore declared that the decision of the Chairman was reversed, and
							the vote of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Naylor was received— Upon
							which there was a general shout of laughter— Wise’s Resolution being
							thus not laid on the table, he called the previous Question upon it; and
							persisted in demanding it, though <persRef ref="pickens-francis"
								>Pickens</persRef> said he had another Resolution to offer— The vote
							upon the second to the previous question was 113. to 113. a tie, and I
							decided for it— The previous question was carried 118 to 97. and on the
							main question the yeas and nays were called; and I said that the
							difficulty with regard to the question who should vote having been
							removed the yeas and nays might now by universal consent be taken—
							Turney objected, but afterwards withdrew his objection.— The yeas and
							nays were called and were 115 to 118. the Resolution was thus rejected;
							though it would have been carried with the New-Jersey votes— It was thus
							ascertained that an Administration Speaker cannot be chosen without
							excluding the commissioned members from New-Jersey. and as they are
							excluded now, so they will be excluded to the end— Rhett now offered his
							Resolution, which was divided, and carried in both parts— Then <persRef
								ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> of South-Carolina, moved a
							reconsideration— The reconsideration was refused on the first part of
							the Resolution, and before taking the question on the second part the
							Meeting adjourned.— Just before the adjournment, I received an
							invitation <hi rend="italic">from</hi>
							<pb n="297" type="ms"/>I received a note of invitation from <persRef

							nominated for President, and <persRef ref="tyler-john">John

							members of the Committee to state that feeling much exhausted and
							somewhat indisposed I must ask their excuse for not attending— I added
							that I had another reason which I did not wish to have assigned.— Which
							was that since I had held myself the Office of the President of the
							United States, I had felt it my duty to abstain from all personal
							interference in the Presidential election— He asked if I could not send

						<p>At the meeting of the House this Morning, after the Journal was read,
								<persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> moved an amendment to it
							reciting the Protest of the five New-Jersey members, which the House had
							yesterday refused to have inserted on the Journal— The Journal of

							of an hour and a half. I decided that the motion was in order: Dromgoole
							appealed from the decision, and by yeas and nays, my decision was
							reversed 105 to 114.— By this reversal Dromgoole’s objection to Wise’s
							motion came to be considered. <persRef ref="petrikin-david"
								>Petrikin</persRef> insisted that he had moved the Previous Question
							upon it an hour before; and said the Country should know it— <persRef
								ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> moved to the lay the
							whole subject, and the house had involved itself in such inextricable
							absurdity by reversing my decision, that the motion to lay the whole
							subject on the table was carried by a large majority—115 to 51. <pb
								n="299" type="ms"/>This is the second direct instance in which the
							House immediately after reversing my decision, reversed its own— There
							were two motions for reconsideration—one upon the second part of
								<persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett’s</persRef> Resolution; and the
							other upon that for the appointment of a Committee the first after some
							sparring was passed over; and the second was taken up for consideration—
							Wise soon said that if both parties would understand that the Resolution
							for appointing a Committee was reconsidered, he would offer a direct
							Resolution affirming the right of the New-Jerseymen to their Seats.—
							After considerable altercation— This was agreed upon— I put the question
							of reconsideration which passed unanimously.— Wise then offered his
							resolution, and after the call of the House 234 members present the
							result was a tie 117 to 117.— The 5 members from New Jersey being
							excluded—one vacant seat from Massachusetts by the death of <persRef
								ref="alvord-james">James C. Alvord</persRef>, one absentee from
								New-York<space/><persRef ref="kempshall-thomas">Kempshall</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="hawes-richard">Richard Hawes</persRef> of Kentucky
							sick in this city and unable to attend in the House— There was therefore
							a vote of 8 majority of the whole house affirming the right of the
							New-Jersey Members to their Seats which they lost by this tie—
							Immediately after the result was announced <persRef ref="smith-albert2"
								>Albert Smith</persRef> of Maine rose and moved that the House do
							now proceed to elect a Speaker—and then moved the previous question. A
							point of order was made whether he could submit the two motions at once
							and I decided that he could not— Another point of order was made whether
							the motion now to elect a Speaker was in order while Rhetts resolution
							to try the New-Jersey case before the election, of Speaker was in force—
							I decided that the motion to elect a Speaker was in order although the
							existence of the prior resolution might be a reason for voting against
							it— A succession of motions was then made to adjourn and for a call of
							the house, till midnight—the Previous question upon Smith’s motion was
							carried and the motion itself—that the house will now proceed to the
							election of a Speaker— <persRef ref="proffit-george">Proffit</persRef>
							of Indiana and <persRef ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef> made long
							vehement speeches and <persRef ref="saltonstall-leverett"
								>Saltonstall</persRef> a very ardent one against the decision—
							Between 8 and 9 in the Evening, <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
								Lincoln</persRef> came, and urged me to leave the Chair and take
							some refreshment. I asked him to take the chair for a few minutes which
							he did— I went into the <persRef ref="garland-hugh">Clerk’s</persRef>
							chamber, and sent for a cup of Coffee and two slices of buttered toast
							which I took, and returned in about ten minutes to the chair.— The
							majority voted down by yeas and nays, every motion to adjourn and for a
							call of the house until close upon midnight when a motion for
							adjournment was carried by 117 ayes to 109 naes 8 members had already
							left the House— It is remarkable that if the 117 members who voted for
							the admission of the New-Jersey Members had all voted against Smith’s
							motion to proceed to the election of Speaker it could not have been
							carried—but the vote on it was 118 to 113.— The Judas was Rhett, and six
							others slunk away without voting.— As I came out from the Hall, I found
							our Coachman <persRef ref="dumphy-thomas">Thomas Dumphy</persRef> at the

							not one word of objection was made to it was made from any quarter of
							the House— So much for the reversal of my decision yesterday— After the
							reading of the journal, there was a call of the House which consumed
							about an hour of the proceedings upon which were finally suspended
							before all the members in the City had appeared and answered to the
							call— <persRef ref="white-john6">White</persRef> of Kentucky, <persRef

								ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef> successively offered
							Resolutions for trying over again the question whether the commissioned
							members from New-Jersey should be permitted to vote on the election of
							Speaker— Upon every one of them questions of order, previous questions
							and appeals were taken; until without deciding it, I referred one of
							them to the House itself— There was then a vehement struggle to force me
							to make a decision, evidently for the sole purpose of appealing from and
							reversing it— After long altercation upon points of order—heaped upon me
							one another Barnard withdrew his motion at the earnest request of
								<persRef ref="alford-julius">Alford</persRef> and <persRef

								>Halsted</persRef>, <persRef ref="maxwell-john">Maxwell</persRef>

						<p>I attended the morning service of public worship at the Presbyterian
							Church; and heard <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Wood</persRef> from Ephesians 6.13—[“]Wherefore take
							unto you, the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand, in
							the evil day, and having done all to stand”— The discourse was not
							completed, but I had no special inducement, for the sake of hearing the
							remainder, to deviate from my usual practice in this city of attending
							the evening service at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church— I
							attended there accordingly, and heard the evening service for the third
							Sunday in advent, performed, by a young man from Portland, Maine named
								<persRef ref="boyd-fw">Boyd</persRef>, whose Sermon was from Job,
							21.15. the latter part of the verse—“What profit should we have, if we
							pray unto him?” The subject was the profitable character of prayer.— The
							duty and efficacy of prayer— A juvenile composition, not destitute
							either of argument, or of eloquence— The duty of prayer was urged upon
							the principle of obedience to the will of God; because it is commanded.
							Its efficacy was variously illustrated, and specially by a description
							of the death-bed scene of a father of an infant family, having already
							lost their mother, and an elder brother at the bed-side addressing the
							God of Mercy in prayer— The auditory were deeply affected at this
							passage, and my own eyes streamed with tears, at the thought of the
							Scene so nearly resembling this, through which I have so recently
							passed, and which still rends my heart— On coming out of the Church, as
							I was walking home I was accosted by a Gentleman who said his name was
								<persRef ref="u">Leavitt</persRef>, with two Ladies, arm in arm with
							him, all of respectable appearance, and who entered into conversation
							with me.— He told me they were from New-York, going to New-Orleans to
							spend the winter— That they arrived here last Evening, and should
							proceed on their journey to-morrow morning. One of the Ladies was very
							conversible—said that she took a great interest in public affairs and
							especially in the proceedings of Congress, and that she was well
							acquainted with the history of both of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef> and of his distinguished Son— As we walked along
							she enquired what were the public buildings by which we passed, the
							Departments of State and of the Treasury, and gave her opinions of them
							until coming to the opening of F. Street opposite the Treasury I parted
							from them— <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef> paid an
							afternoon visit to the <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary"
								>Ladies</persRef>; but declined staying to tea— And we had
							successive Evening visits from <persRef ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel D. Barnard</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbot
								Lawrence</persRef>— We all agreed that to-morrow that huge hill of
							flesh <persRef ref="lewis-dixon">Dixon H. Lewis</persRef> will be
							elected Speaker of the House— His avoirdupois weight can scarcely be
							less than twenty-score.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard said he
							had thoughts of offering some resolution making one more effort to
							arrest the House in their career of iniquity; but I told him I thought
							we could not stand upon better ground to go before the people with the
							question, than that which we now occupy. And in this he finally
							acquiesced.</p>

						<p><date>16. IV:30. </date>Monday</p>
						<p>When I went to the House this morning, it was with a firm conviction that
								<persRef ref="lewis-dixon">Dixon H. Lewis</persRef>, the Silenus of
							the House, a <persRef ref="falstaff-john">Falstaff</persRef> without his
							wit or good humour, would be chosen Speaker—probably at the first trial—
							At the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> trial on Saturday Night, Dixon
							H. Lewis had 79 votes, and <persRef ref="jones-john9">John W.
								Jones</persRef> 39. These were the two divisions of the
							administration party—united they made 118 votes, the precise number
							required for the choice of the Speaker.— The opposition had rallied only
							63 upon <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Hunter</persRef> and 43 scattered
							all over the house.— But the division in the administration ranks was
							deeper than I had expected— Jones was the man of the <persRef
								ref="benton-thomas">Benton</persRef> faction, and Dixon H. Lewis of
							the Calhounites, much to the discontent of <persRef
								ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef>, the mouth piece of <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> in the house— At the 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> trial this morning of 229 votes Lewis
							received 110. wanting only 5 to be chosen— The whigs had agreed to run
							Bell again and he had 44 votes— Hunter’s number having fallen to 22. At
							the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> trial, the whole number had
							increased to 232— Lewis’s to 113—lacking only 4 to be chosen. Bell had
							80. and Hunter only 16.— At the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Lewis
							being in his seat, did not answer when his name was called— He did not
							want his own vote to tell against himself.— <persRef
								ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> buckled him down to
							it; by enquiring of the Chair if there was not a rule that every member
							of the House present should vote on every question— I said there were
							three rules respecting the right and obligation of members to vote.
							First that every member <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the House shall vote
							on every question, unless excused for reasons specially assigned.
							Secondly that no member without the bar at the call of his name shall be
							allowed to vote—and I said that to reconcile these two rides together it
							followed that it was the duty of every member in the House to be within
							the bar at the call of his name— Thirdly that no member shall vote upon
							any question in the event of which he is immediately and particularly
							interested— On the reading of this rule there was a general titter
							through the house— <persRef ref="warren-lott">Lott Warren</persRef> a
							member from Georgia started forward and voted for<space/>I said I had
							read the written rules of the House, but the practice of the House was
							not always the same as the written rules— The practice of the House was
							rigidly to exclude the vote of every member not within the bar at the
							call of his name, while the rule requiring every member in the house to
							vote was seldom or never enforced.— Thompson said that he had not known
							that the member from Georgia, had not voted; and that he was not the
							person to whom his enquiry had referred— Lewis said he had no objection
							to voting, and voted for Pickens— But at this trial he had only 110
							votes, the desertion of him having already begun— Bell’s vote too was
							reduced to 33 and Hunter’s increased to 59. At the tenth trial Lewis
							left his seat, went outside of the bar, and did not vote— But the
							administration phalanx was broken— He received only 73 votes, and the
							rest were scattered— Hunter had 85.— Lewis then <pb n="303" type="ms"
							/>requested that his name might be considered as withdrawn from the
							canvass; but the Administration forces could not be rallied, and at the
								11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> trial of 232 votes, Robert M. T.
							Hunter of Virginia had 119. and was chosen— He finally united all the
							whig votes, and all the malcontents of the Administration— I then upon
							receiving the report of the Tellers read it and announced that Robert M.
							T. Hunter having received a majority of all the votes given was elected
							Speaker of the House— I requested <persRef ref="banks-linn">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Banks</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lawrence</persRef> to conduct the Speaker to the Chair, and <persRef
								ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> the oldest member of
							the House to administer to him the Oath— My functions were at an end— I
							resigned to him the Speaker’s chair, and retired to my Seat, with an
							ejaculation of Gratitude to God for my deliverance— At the motion of
								<persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> the house immediately
							adjourned and I walked home with a lightened heart.</p>

						<p>At the Meeting of the House this day, after the reading of the Journal,
							the Speaker, <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Robert M T. Hunter</persRef>
							made a short, modest, pertinent address to the House, in which he spoke
							of his independent position—declared that he would be the Speaker of the
							House and not the Speaker of a party, and alluded to the duty of the
							House to inquire into, investigate and reform abuses— The first business
							now was to swear the members, but <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole</persRef> offered a Resolution that the Rules of the last
							House of Representatives should be adopted— The object of this was by
							the operation of the rule for the appointment of a Committee of
							Elections, the five members from New-Jersey; should be excluded from
							taking the Oath— The Oath expressly says that after the Speaker has been
							sworn the members shall all be sworn, <hi rend="italic">before</hi>
							proceeding to any other business. <persRef ref="johnson-william2">Cost
								Johnson</persRef> objected to Dromgoole’s Resolution as not in
							order<space/>moved to lay it on the table— The Speaker declined to
							decide the point of order; observing that the motion to lay on the table
							would have the same result— The vote was 116 to 116. and the motion to
							lay on the table was carried by the casting vote of the Speaker.— This
							vote of 116. to fly directly in the face of the Law is a signal example
							of the temper of the Administration party in the House— The motion
							failed however, and the members were called up by States and sworn.—
							When New Jersey was called <persRef ref="randolph-joseph"
								>Randolph</persRef> alone was sworn— The five other commissioned
							members presented themselves and demanded that the Oath should be
							administered to them— The Speaker proceeded first to swear all the other
							members and the Delegates from the three Territories, and then stated to
							the House that in the administration of the Oath a difficulty had
							occurred— That five members from the State of New-Jersey had presented
							themselves, with regular Commissions from the Governor of the State.—
							That if this had been a new incident, and there had been no previous
							action of the House concerning it, he should have sworn them without <pb
								n="304" type="ms"/>hesitation—but the House having in the course of
							its proceedings decided by a tie vote that they were not entitled to
							their Seats, he had thought it his duty to refer the question of their
							being sworn to the judgment of the House, and to put the Question shall
							these Gentlemen from New-Jersey be sworn— <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise</persRef> then moved a Resolution that they were <hi
								rend="italic">not</hi> entitled to their Seats, and he said that he
							put the question in that form, that by the negative pregnant they might
							have the benefit of the tie, which they had most unjustly lost by the
							form of the question as stated before— Dromgoole insisted that the
							Speaker himself had but the question in the form, shall the commissioned
							Claimants from New-Jersey be sworn? but the Speaker said it had not been
							his intention to prescribe the form of the question— <persRef
								ref="craig-robert">Craig</persRef> of Virginia then offered the same
							Resolution which I had offered at the last Session of Congress, but it
							was declared not to be in order— The debate then turned upon Wise’s
							Resolution, and continued till past 4 O’Clock, when the house adjourned.
								<persRef ref="sergeant-john">J. Sergeant</persRef> made an admirable
							argumentative and eloquent Speech, and Dromgoole a very elaborate and
							disjointed one. <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef>, unstable as
							water involved himself in confusion worse confounded, and <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> convicted him of one of his
							gross inconsistencies upon the spot— I had intended to avoid all further
							participation in the debate, but <persRef ref="bond-william2"
								>Bond</persRef> and <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph"
								>Tillinghast</persRef> came successively to my Seat and in behalf of
							several members urged me to address the House— I told them it would be
							of no avail— They said it might influence two or three votes, and if it
							should influence one, it would carry the point— It perplexes me in the
							extreme— <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thomson</persRef> of South
							Carolina came and stated his willingness to offer a Resolution of thanks
							to me, for my service as Chairman; but I intreated him not to— In the
							rancorous and bitter temper of the Administration party exasperated by
							their disappointment in losing their Speaker, the Resolution of thanks
							would have been lost if it had been offered— I had evening visits from
								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef>, and <persRef ref="boyd-fw">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Boyd</persRef>—the young man who preached at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church last Sunday afternoon. I
							sent to <persRef ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah Adams jun<hi

						<p><persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas B. J. Frye</persRef> dined with us
							yesterday— This morning a woman from Rhode-Island named <persRef
								ref="pearce-elizabeth">Pearce</persRef> came and exhibited to me
							several Letters concerning a claim of herself and a Sister of hers, a
							widow <persRef ref="telfair-mary">Telfair</persRef> as daughters of
								<persRef ref="pearce-israel">Israel</persRef> to a certain amount of

								Taliaferro</persRef> then a member of the Committee of Revolutionary
							claims, and Taliaferro’s answer, both highly characteristic— <persRef
								ref="cranston-robert">Cranston</persRef> presented the Petition at
							the last Session of Congress and is to call it up at the present. Miss
							Pearce asked my influence, which is just nothing at all in its favour,
							and as she finds it very <pb n="305" type="ms"/>expensive living at
							Washington, offered her services to doing sewing that may be wanted in
							the family— The shaking of my hand has so greatly increased that I am
							disabled from shaving myself—last Monday I cut my face in three places—
							A black barber by the name of <persRef ref="u">Lee</persRef> was sent
							for this morning and shaved me— I engaged him to come three times a Week
							for a dollar and a half a month.— At the House, the debate of the day
							upon the Resolution that the five commissioned members from New-Jersey
							are not entitled to seats in the House commenced with a long Speech from
								<persRef ref="barnard-daniel">Barnard</persRef> against the
							Resolution, less forcible than that which he had before delivered— He
							was followed on the same side by <persRef ref="rayner-kenneth"
								>Rayner</persRef> a new Member from North-Carolina, who declared
							himself a State-rights man, and a nullifier— He alluded to <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">J. C. Calhoun</persRef> as the head of that party
							whom he said he had idolized, and over whom he mourned with lamentation
							as of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef> over <persRef ref="kingsaul"
								>Saul</persRef> and <persRef ref="jonathan">Jonathan</persRef>. His
							argument was sound—his impressions fervid his delivery vehement— There
							is an obliquity of the reasoning faculty—a broken link in the chain of
							logical deduction in every mind which can bring itself or be brought to
							the sincere belief of the nullification doctrines— But an ill regulated
							mind may reason justly upon questions of right and wrong, when its first
							principle happens to be right.— When Rayner finished <persRef
								ref="shepard-charles">Charles Sheperd</persRef> the North-Carolina
							turncoat rose to speak— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> rose at
							the same time—but <persRef ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef>
							first caught the <persRef ref="hunter-robert">Speaker’s</persRef> eye;
							and moved to lay the Resolution upon the table— A jarring question then
							arose who was entitled to the floor— I enquired of the Speaker whether
							in the present condition of the House—with no rules yet adopted the
							motion to lay on the table was not debatable— He said that in the
							opinion of the Speaker it was not— A decision evidently wrong against
							which Bell immediately remonstrated and other members manifested
							dissatisfaction— The Speaker said that as experienced members of the
							House thought differently from him on the question, he would be glad if
							one of them would appeal from his decision, that it might be submitted
							to the House. But another question was made, whether if the motion to
							lay on the table, the Resolution that the New-Jersey members are <hi
								rend="italic">not</hi> entitled to seats in the house, it would not
							be equivalent to a Resolution that they were— The Speaker decided (wrong
							again) that it would and that he should swear them—whereupon Vanderpoel
							withdrew his motion to lay on the table— Charles Shepherd made his
							prevaricating and equivocating Speech: was answered by <persRef
								ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thomson</persRef> with sharp castigation
							and bitter personalities, which Shepherd retorted, and Thomson rejoined
							till past four when the House adjourned— Thomson repeated in the House
							what I had told him that <persRef ref="tancred-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tancred</persRef> had related to me in
							the House about the choice of an opposition Speaker, and the dissolution
							of the <persRef ref="peel-robert">Peel</persRef> Ministry. I made a

						<p>Before the meeting of the House I examined at the library at the 2<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> Volume of the Parliamentary debates of
							the year 1835 and found that the <persRef ref="peel-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Peel</persRef> and his ministry did
							not immediately resign upon the election of <persRef
								ref="abercromby-james">Abercromby</persRef> the opposition Speaker,
							which was by a vote—of 316 to 306. the name <persRef ref="tancred-henry"
								>Tancred</persRef> being among those who voted for him— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Peel the next day announced to the house,
							that notwithstanding the failure of the Ministry to elect their Speaker,
							they thought it their duty still to continue in Office.— And they
							persevered about two Months till the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							of April when after having been outvoted on several favourite measures
							they resigned— I examined also other books, and was again strongly urged
							to take part in the debate, and with extreme reluctance came to the
							determination that I would— The case is desperate—every vote in the
							house is known; and there is a majority of 8 or 10. for expelling the
							New-Jersey members from their Seats.— The poor result of any thing that
							I can say will only be to add one more voice of remonstrance against the
							perpetration of wrong— I fear too not to do justice to the subject—to
							fail of presenting it in all its strength—to falter from inability in
							the cause of righteousness— My reliance must be upon the goodness of my
							God, and upon the trust that he will not forsake me— That he will in his
							own way turn to good the evil about to be done is now my only hope.— At
							the house this day, <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> had the
							floor upon his Resolution; with a pledge that he would renew <persRef
								ref="turney-hopkins">Turney’s</persRef> motion for the previous
							question— He spoke for about two hours, and when he sat down <persRef
								ref="johnson-william2">William Cost Johnson</persRef> objected to
							the reference by the Speaker to the House of the question whether the
							New Jersey members should be sworn as out of order because it was
							unconstitutional and illegal.— The <persRef ref="hunter-robert"
								>Speaker</persRef> decided Johnson’s motion to be out of order; from
							which he appealed— There was long and bitter altercation to deprive
							Johnson of the floor—and to smother his right to speak—till he told them
							that if they meant to quit their character as a deliberative body for a
							game of rough and tumble, he would take a hand at that. A motion was
							then made and carried that he be permitted to proceed; and he made a
							brief and in my judgment unanswerable argument to shew that the duty of
							the Speaker to swear the New-Jersey members was positive and peremptory
							and that no vote of the House could release him from its performance.—
							As he sat down I rose from <persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence’s</persRef> seat, which I had
							again borrowed, and obtained the floor— It was past four O’Clock— There
							was a call to adjourn from all quarters— I therefore moved to adjourn;
							upon which the yeas and nays were taken and it was carried
							by<space/>to<space/>All the red hot administration votes being against
							the adjournment; and all the whigs, neutrals and nullifiers against it—
							I went into the Library, and transiently looked into <persRef
								ref="comyns-john">Comyns’s</persRef> digest, Article Parliament.— On
							returning home I found <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef>
							here, but she had dined and returned home.— I spent the Evening in
							rumination and in vain endeavours to marshall the topics of my
							to-morrow’s address to the House—</p>

						<p>I went to the Capitol this morning at half past ten, and in the library
							of the Supreme Court, examined the British Statutes at large for the
							mode of deciding contested elections— I looked over six Acts of
							Parliament. 10. Geo: 3. ch. 16. 11. Geo 3. ch: 42 25. Geo: 3. ch. 84 28.
							Geo. 3. ch. 52 42. Geo: 3. ch 84. and 47. Geo. 3. Sess. 1. ch 1. from
							1770 to 1817. It is a complicated system combining a designation of
								<unclear>. . .</unclear>ts by lot, by choice and by exclusion, the
							ultimate result of which after all is chance; and chance is a more
							impartial arbiter than will— When the House met the journal was read— I
							had the floor; but a full half hour was wasted in chicanery whether I
							should have it or not. <persRef ref="hunter-robert">The Speak</persRef>
							lacks the spirit of decision, and suffers questions of order to be piled
							one upon another till debate becomes interminable.— I was compelled to
							maintain my right to the floor by pertinacity— After, I had proceeded in
							my argument about half an hour <persRef ref="thomas-francis">Frank
								Thomas</persRef> interrupted me, and with a profusion of professions
							of respect, called me to order, and snaked up a new question upon appeal
							from the Speaker, and moved that I should have permission to proceed <hi
								rend="italic">in</hi> order—that is, interdicting me from speaking
							upon the only question which was in debate before the house— A new
							cut-throat member from Missouri named <persRef ref="jameson-john2"
								>Jameson</persRef> was not so candid— He was for refusing me
							permission to proceed at all— Here was another wrangling snarl of half
							an hour when I was allowed to proceed and finish; after which there was
							a sparring debate of an hour between <persRef ref="rhett-robert"
								>Rhett</persRef> and <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>,
							somewhat to the disadvantage of the latter. Rhett having the address to
							shield his own gross prevarications by retorting upon Wise, and charging
							upon him the loss of the battle by bad management— <persRef
								ref="evans-george2">Evans</persRef> of Maine then took the floor,
							and another wrangle of an hour succeeded, in which <persRef
								ref="chapman-reuben">Chapman</persRef> of Alabama with his gang at
							his heals, struggled to filch the floor from Evans; but did not succeed—
							He made his speech and finally moved that the members of the House of
							Representatives present advised and requested the Speaker to administer
							the Oath to the five commissioned gentlemen from New-Jersey— <persRef
								ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> sputtered against this form
							of the question because it did not recognize the members present as a
							House. But his gang deserted him; and the question was put upon Evans’s
							Motion— There was a call of the House— Three couple paired off. Evans’s
							motion was lost by yeas and nays 112 to 116.— The majority being
							constituted by <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef>, Rhett,
								<persRef ref="griffin-john">Griffin</persRef>, <persRef

							These same men effected the election of Hunter as Speaker; a flying

								Nourse</persRef> for information in support of it, and I advised her
							to go, supposing that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nourse may have

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles W. James</persRef> of
							Cincinnati Ohio, a collector and general agent for eastern and western
							publishers and merchants came and claimed old acquaintance and
							correspondence of which I had no recollection.— But his object was to

							complaining that the whigs of Cincinnati never received any from the
							representative of that place <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">D<hi

							exception of the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> which prescribes that
							the officers of the House shall be chosen viva voce— <persRef
								ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> had withdrawn his motion to except
							also the rules relating to the previous question— Bell made a warm and
							eloquent Speech to defend himself against the attack of <persRef
								ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> upon him last Evening and he
							declaimed forcibly against the executive influence upon the house; a
							theme upon which Pickens used to rave like a maniac; and upon which he
							now roars like a sucking dove. The question of voting by ballot or viva
							voce was discussed by sundry stump Orators, to the corps of which
								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb Cushing</persRef> now acceded—
							Hoffman’s exception was struck out, and the rules were adopted in a

								<persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Matthew S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Clair Clark</persRef> 105. and <persRef ref="mason-richard">R. C.
								Mason</persRef> nominated by <persRef ref="hopkins-george"
								>Hopkins</persRef> of Virginia 8—if the five New Jerseymen had voted
							there would have been a tie, and Garland would not have been chosen— He
							stands self-elected, by the baseness of his treachery to his trust.— He
							carried his election by the South-Carolinians.— The next Officer to be
							chosen was the Serjeant at arms— The whigs had determined in Caucus to
							vote for <persRef ref="jones-william4">William Jones</persRef> late
							Postmaster in this City, whose only claim was that he had been turned
							out of the Post Office last Spring— They had got <persRef

							Jones— I knew of no misconduct of <persRef ref="dorsey-roderick"
								>Dorsey</persRef>, who was the Serjeant at Arms of the last House,
							and I told Mitchell I would vote for no man nominated by Griffin— I
							voted for Dorsey—so did Cushing; but came to me shortly after, and said
							he had voted so because I did; but <persRef ref="wise-henry"

						<p>Snow in the Night, and through the greatest part of this day, at least a
							foot and a half deep—occasionally turning to sleet and rain, with a
							moderate gale, and very little drifting of the Snow.— I went at 11 A.M.
							to the Presbyterian Church, and found there <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lellan</persRef>, <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hand</persRef>; three other men,
							and five boys— All together not enough, including myself to make a petit
							jury. After waiting a reasonable time for the preacher, who did not
							appear, I came home and read <persRef ref="gleig-george"
								>Gleig’s</persRef> introduction to the history of the Bible. There
							was no afternoon Church Bell, and I had a day of bodily repose— Of
							mental repose I can enjoy none, while witnessing the wrong that I cannot
							prevent, and suffering at once from the injustice of man, and the
							chastising hand of Heaven— Disease, bereavement, afflictions not to be
							named, and the temptations of the adversary to conclude with <persRef
								ref="brutus">Brutus</persRef> that virtue is but a name— Yet there
							is in Providence a vis medicatrix—a healing, repairing, redeeming hand—
							Let me never despair of its power—never be weary of well doing— Perhaps
							the severest trial of righteousness is the patient Fortitude which
							endures without yielding to the perverseness of mankind— In adversity,
							consider— I employed part of this day in preparing for the presentation
							of Petitions, and in assorting papers. Upon that most vexatious and
							portentous subject of Slavery and the Slave-trade, I am yet to fix upon
							the course which it will be my duty to pursue— I see clearly that it is
							not for me to volunteer in bringing it forward; and as clearly that it
							will be impossible for me to steer clear of it altogether.— It will be
							forced upon me— It will not be for me in walking to direct my steps—may
							they be directed from above! I have received two very extraordinary
							Letters from <persRef ref="trist-nicholas">N. P. Trist</persRef>, Consul
							of the United States at the Havana who is charged with direct and
							official participation in the African Slave-trade, in which Letters he
							not only urges me to take up and bring forward this subject in Congress,
							but insists that I am the man of all others who ought to do it— And
							these Letters he makes private and confidential, though he never had any
							private or personal intercourse with me— His object is to gull me with
							flattery—and to secure impunity to himself, by the exhibition to the
							South of me as his accuser.— His wishes are at once the evidence of his
							guilt, and the counterpart of my duty— I made a partial assortment of my
							papers, and have two Letters from <persRef ref="lewis-charles"
								>Lewis</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">Pierce</persRef> of Brooklyn,
							long island, both dated from 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi

							additional documents in support of the claim of widow <persRef
								ref="benson-dinah">Dinah Benson</persRef> to a pension under the act

							James L. Edwards and three documents in support of the Pension claim of
							widow <persRef ref="lennington-sarah">Sarah Lennington</persRef>, under
							the same act.— <persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef> was

						<p>The <persRef ref="boyd-fw">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> F. W.

							wish to receive the appointment of chaplain to the House of

							with scarcely any of whom he had any personal acquaintance, and besides
							which it was an expedient to which he should not willingly resort— I
							told him I had received a printed circular from an episcopal clergyman
							named <persRef ref="u">Wilmer</persRef>, and a recommendation of a
							presbyterian named <persRef ref="danforth-joshua">Danforth</persRef>—
							That I supposed <persRef ref="slicer-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"

							again be a candidate, and that I had heard a <persRef
								ref="cookman-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cookman</persRef> a Methodist Minister would also be upon the list.—
							All this he knew before but said he understood M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cookman was a candidate only for the chaplaincy of the
							Senate— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boyd, I should cheerfully
							vote for him; <persRef ref="smith-albert2">Albert Smith</persRef> of
							Maine came, to me in the House and told me he should nominate him, as he
							belonged to a very respectable family at Portland, his near neighbours—
							The business of the day was to chuse a door keeper; under door keeper,
							Post-master and printer— <persRef ref="everett-horace">H
								Everett</persRef> from the joint Committee to wait on the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> reported that he had
							informed them, he would send to both Houses of Congress a Message in

							received from the Senate, and another— For Door keeper of the house;
							there was a party strike <persRef ref="follansbee-joseph">Joseph
								Follansbee</persRef>, the Door keeper of the last House happens to
							be a New-England man, and no partizan— A shark by the name of <persRef

							carry it— The Carolinians voted for Follansbee and he had 130 votes, Dow
							73. and a man named <persRef ref="houston-john">Houston</persRef> 15.
							The under door keeper <persRef ref="hunter-john">John W.

								>Post-master M’Cormick</persRef> were chosen by Resolution, without
							nominal call— But the lug was for the printer— <persRef

							last Saturday for the election of a printer; and raise a Committee to

							Then followed a snarling debate of five hours; questions, of order
							innumerable, motions to lay on the table, previous questions, decisions
							of the Chair and an appeal from one of them by <persRef
								ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef>— Crimination and
							recrimination in abundance on the score of economy.— A call for the

								>M’Kay</persRef> at the last Session—made to the House but never

						<p>The Snow makes the roads and Streets almost impracticable, and the

							was delivered by <persRef ref="vanburen-abraham">his
							Son</persRef><space/>It took the <persRef ref="garland-hugh"
								>Clerk</persRef> upwards of an hour and a half to deliver it— The
							picture of the condition of the nation is of mingled light and shade—
							Its foreign affairs in general are highly prosperous.— The rest is a
							dissertation upon political-economy, Banks, Currency, Exchange, Gold and
							Silver, and an Independent Treasury with the Specie clause.— It is
							understood that this measure will now be carried— The mismanagement of
							the Banks, and above all the suspension of specie payment by the
							Pennsylvania Bank of the United States, and most of the Banks of
							Philadelphia, and South and West of that City, have excited the hatred
							and indignation of the people, against those institutions to such an
							extent that the faction opposed to them have them at their mercy— The
							annual report of the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> on the finances, and several other Treasury
							reports, were also presented to the House— There was some discussion as
							to the number of copies of the Message to be printed with and without
							the documents.— They were finally ordered to be printed under the
							direction of the Clerk, and the remainder of the day was consumed in
							wrangling about the election of a Printer— <persRef ref="dawson-william"
								>Dawson</persRef> moved to postpone till the 1<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> of February the election of the Printer, and in the
							meantime to appoint a Committee to enquire and report whether the
							expence of the public printing cannot be reduced— Hence a debate of
							altercation and mutual reproach in which the principal Speakers were
							Dawson, <persRef ref="mason-samson">Sampson Mason</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="bond-william">Bond</persRef>, and <persRef ref="garland-rice"
								>Rice Garland</persRef> on one side, and <persRef
								ref="vanderpoel-aaron">Vanderpoel</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bynum-jesse">Bynum</persRef> on the other— Charges of
							insincerity of hypocrisy and of duplicity were bandied to and fro
							without stint or restraint— The journals of the House at the three
							Sessions of the last Congress were ransacked for lists of yeas and nays,
							and the names of the voters were read over by Vanderpoel and Bynum— In
							the midst of his most furious vociferation Vanderpoel brought down a
							shout of laughter upon himself by reading a list of his own party as
							voting for a resolution, which Rice Garland, rectified by shewing that
							their vote was for striking it out. And thus time wasted away till
								<persRef ref="giddings-joshua">Giddings</persRef> of Ohio took the
							floor— Various attempts to adjourn had been made with out success till
								<persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> of South-Carolina

							Carried by yeas and nays 8 to 8 After which about 7. O’Clock the motion

						<p><date>25. V:15. </date>Christmas— Wednesday</p>
						<p>Of the merriment of Christmas, we had none. All around us is mourning and

								<persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lawrence</persRef>; but he went off this morning to New-York— I saw
								<persRef ref="granger-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							also there on a visit— Called on my return home at <persRef
								ref="barnard-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barnard’s</persRef> lodgings but he was gone out.— I received this
							day a fresh Letter from <persRef ref="lewis-charles">Lewis</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="u">Pierce</persRef> of Brooklyn of the 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> with

							revolutionary pension of <persRef ref="concklin-francis">Francis
								Concklin</persRef> under the act of 7. June 1832— And I had before
							received from them a Letter of the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
								inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> with an enclosure to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards and Documents in support of the
							Pension-claim of <persRef ref="reeve-phebe">Phebe Reeve</persRef>, widow
							of <persRef ref="clark-william">William Clark</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Smith</persRef> went and dined with <persRef
								ref="smith-william-steuben">her husband</persRef> at the prison—
							After dinner I received from <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef> the report of my
							Speech in the House, last Friday, taken in two parts, the first by
								<persRef ref="stansbury-arthur">Stansbury</persRef> and the second
							by <persRef ref="wheeler-henry">H. G. Wheeler</persRef>, the two best
							Reporters who attend upon the House— The report of Stansbury is until I
							was interrupted by <persRef ref="thomas-francis">Frank
								Thomas’s</persRef> notable question of order; and Wheeler’s is from
							the time when I resumed till I closed— I revised all Stansbury’s report
							and part of Wheeler’s—both are good; but both omit the desperate
							struggle to take the floor from me before I began, and the infamous
							attempt of Thomas to put me down in the midst of my discourse— These
							were really the most interesting incidents of the day; and a true report
							of them would be much more valuable than that of my Speech. This was not
							what it ought to have been; nor was it satisfactory to myself— In the
							New-Jersey case, the popular interest is all on our side of the
							question; and the popular favour is on the other— I received this
							afternoon from <persRef ref="otis-james2">James F. Otis</persRef> a
							Newspaper published at New-York called Brother Jonathan, in which is
							printed, announced as from the original manuscript, a poem by me called
							the Vision, written in 1789. or 1790 while I was a student at the Law in
							the Office of <persRef ref="parsons-theophilus">Theophilus
								Parsons</persRef> at Newbury-Port. It is nearly fifty years since I
							had seen this effusion of my early love; and on reading it now the first
							impression upon my mind is that I have never since written anything
							equal to it— But I had no copy of it myself, and knew not that a copy of
							it existed in the world.— My next feeling was curiosity to know whence
							the publication now came, and through whose hands the manuscript has
							passed. This I suppose I can ascertain. I received this afternoon a note
							from <persRef ref="dickinson-julia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Benjamin Ogle-Tayloe</persRef>, inviting me to a small tea party
							this Evening to which I went— I met there <persRef ref="vandenhoff-john"

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="wood-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wood</persRef>, morning and afternoon—a Christmas Sermon, from a
							Presbyterian preacher. His morning text was Luke 2.10. [“]And the angel
							said unto them, Fear not; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great
							joy, which shall be to all people. 11. For unto you is born this day; in
							the city of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef>, a Saviour, which is
							Christ the Lord.”— The afternoon text was from 1. Timothy 3.16—“God was
							manifest in the flesh—” The auditory consisted of less than fifty
							persons and the Discourse was not equal to the theme. The occurrences at
							the birth of Jesus are partly facts of common occurrence and partly
							miraculous to the severest trial of faith— A <persRef ref="joseph5"
								>carpenter</persRef> and his <persRef ref="mary">wife</persRef>
							going to be taxed as tributary slaves to <persRef ref="augustuscaesar"
								>Augustus Caesar</persRef>, the woman falls in labour in the stable
							of an Inn—the child is born, and laid in a manger— They lived at
							Nazareth a mean and dispised town of Judea—they were going on foot to
							Jerusalem, and the child was born at Bethlehem a small village a few
							miles distant from that place. In the compass of human existence can any
							thing more lowly, without dishonour be imagined as high and low are
							estimated in the world? Yet this event is announced by an Angel from
							Heaven to a few shepherds watching their flocks by night in that
							neighbourhood— The heavenly host with shouts of exultation proclaim to
							these Shepherds, the infant laid in the manger to be the long promised
							Messiah—the anointed—the Saviour—and this connects him with all the
							predictions and all the promises of the antient Covenant; at least from
							the time of <persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef>. Nothing can be
							more natural or credible than the historical part of the story; but why
							this preternatural angelic communication to a few solitary shepherds
							which when related by themselves was evidently not believed? Here is a
							subject for eloquence of the highest order—for pathos—for
							imagination—for logical argument—for all the intellect of <persRef
								ref="paul">Paul</persRef>, and all the extatic fervour of the
							beloved Apostle— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood was cold, and tame,
							and presbyterian— I went after dinner to S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
							John’s Church but it was half an hour too soon, and there was nobody
							there I read part of the first chapter of <persRef ref="gleig-george"
								>Gleig’s</persRef> History of the Bible and was not very well
							satisfied with that— It is not a History of the Book, but the History of
							the Events recorded in the Book; and has the failing of every attempt to
							bring those events within the bounds of historical credibility—to
							explain the miraculous by the operation of the ordinary Laws of Nature
							to which it is a perpetual exception— In the Richmond Whig, I find my
							Letter of<space/>February 1839 to <persRef ref="hackett-james">J.
								Hackett</persRef> on the character of <persRef ref="hamlet"
								>Hamlet</persRef>, which was first published in the New-York Mirror
							and then in the National Intelligencer— And in the last Night’s Globe
							there are garbled extracts from two of my Letters to <persRef
								ref="loring-ellis">Ellis Gray Loring</persRef> on the case of the
							Africans of the Amistad. Part of the same and other extracts are
							published by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring himself, in the
							Boston Courier of the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> I have also a
							Letter from <persRef ref="patton-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								John M. Patton</persRef>; requesting a copy of my Eulogy on <persRef

						<p>In the reading of the journal of this morning the standing Committees of

								Jones</persRef>, Chairman of the Ways and Means— <persRef
								ref="pickens-francis">Francis W. Pickens</persRef> of the foreign
							Affairs; and the whole organization as subservient to the executive
							administration, as if the appointments had been made in the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President’s</persRef> Cabinet. So much for
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							<persRef ref="hunter-robert">Robert M. T. Hunter’s</persRef> independent
							position.— He has followed the footsteps of his illustrious
							predecessors, in appointing me chairman of the Committee of
							Manufactures; a station merely ostensible, and therefore suiting my
							convenience— I deserve no other, and particularly not to be chairman, or
							a member of any of the laborious Committees. It was expected that the
							States would be called this morning for petitions, but <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> moved a suspension of the rules to
							offer a Resolution—that every abolition petition resolution or paper
							that should be presented to the house, there should be considered an
							objection to its reception, and the motion for its reception and the
							motion should be laid upon the table without debate— The vote for
							suspending the rules was 109 to 77. not two thirds; whereupon <persRef
								ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef> of Louisiana, moved to
							suspend the rules to offer three long argumentatives resolutions
							terminating in the same result the rejection of all abolition petitions—
							I asked if he meant that these Resolutions should be debated; for if the
							house would allow that I would vote for a suspension of the rules—
							Garland said he had offered them without consultation with any one— I
							said I could not trust the House with the previous question, and voted
							against the suspension of the rules—the vote was 107 to 82— <persRef
								ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> then claimed the floor
							upon his motion to reconsider the vote for printing 20000 copies of the
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President’s</persRef> message.
								<persRef ref="jameson-john2">Jameson</persRef> of Missouri made a
							point of order to take the floor from Thompson; which the <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> decided against him— He
							appealed, and the house almost unanimously sustained the decision of the
							Speaker.— Thompson made his Speech of about an hour a philippic upon the
							message and the administration, and then withdrew his motion for
							reconsideration. <persRef ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> of
							Ohio then offered a Resolution that the five claimants to seats from New
							Jersey, with the certificate from the <persRef ref="forsyth-john"
								>Secretary of State</persRef> should be sworn as Members— Sundry
							propositions were made to get the case before the Committee of
							elections, and the Speaker presented a packet of depositions which he
							had received on the subject— I said the proper course would be to
							instruct the Committee of elections to enquire and report to the house
							who were elected members from New-Jersey—and that they have leave to
							send for persons and papers.— This did not suit the tie majority, who
							intend to let in the spurious members as they ejected the true ones,
							without a trial— I introduced my bill concerning the Smithsonian
							bequest, which was read twice, and referred to a select Committee of
							nine— The Speaker told me he meant to put <persRef ref="lewis-dixon"
								>Dixon H. Lewis</persRef> upon the Committee— Adjourned after 3.

						<p>Snow and frost. A cold and gloomy day. An hour and a half of the time of
							the house was consumed in motions to amend the journal, first of
							yesterday, by striking out the specification of <persRef
								ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan’s</persRef> motion that the <persRef
								ref="hunter-robert">Speaker</persRef> should swear the certificate
							claimants of the New Jersey seats, which the Speaker pronounced out of
							order—from which decision Duncan appealed and the Speaker’s decision was
							sustained— The motion to strike out was rejected by yeas and
							nays<space/>to<space/>Next by inserting in the journal of last Friday
							the specification of a motion made by <persRef ref="jameson-john2"
								>Jameson</persRef> of Missouri, which the Speaker declared out of
							order; from which decision Jameson appealed and the Speaker was
							sustained by the house.— The Speaker said it was too late to move an
							amendment to the Journal of last Friday, and so has always been the
							practice; but Jameson appealed to the words of the rule which are not
							limited, and worried him into the admission of his motion to amend and
							it was carried by yeas and nays 87 to 85. <persRef ref="coles-walter"
								>Coles</persRef> of Virginia then moved a suspension of the rules to
							offer the second part of <persRef ref="atherton-charles"
								>Atherton’s</persRef> gag-resolution of the 12<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of December 1838. for the exclusion of abolition

							failed<space/>to<space/>whereupon <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise</persRef> moved a suspension of the rules to offer the same
							resolution which he had proposed to offer yesterday, and said he would
							make the same motion every day throughout the Session— I objected to it
							as not in order, but the Speaker decided that it was— <persRef
								ref="bynum-jesse">Bynum</persRef> appeared to be very indignant with
							Wise and advised me to appeal from the Speaker’s decision; but I knew he
							would be sustained— Wise’s Resolution was lost<space/>to<space/>And then
								<persRef ref="chinn-thomas">Chinn</persRef> of Louisiana moved to
							suspend the rules to offer a Resolution, that all the abolition
							petitions that may be presented shall be referred to a select Committee
							the vote upon this was<space/>to<space/>shewing a decided majority of
							the house for referring the petitions, but not a sufficient number to
							suspend the rules— <persRef ref="smith-albert2">Smith</persRef> of Maine
							and others called sturdily for the Orders of the day; which the Speaker
							declared to be the calling by States for the presentation of
							Petitions—but <persRef ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef> moved a
							suspension of the rules to offer a Resolution that the daily call for
							petitions, limited by a rule of the house to the first thirty days of
							the Session should be in force twenty days from this day— Some of the
							Slaveholders vehemently resisted this, and Bynum, sounded the trumpet
							for the rights of the South.— <persRef ref="stanly-edward"
								>Stanly</persRef>, <persRef ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef> gave him a
							severe castigation to which he was exceedingly desirous of replying— But
								<persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice Garland</persRef> moved the
							previous question and inflexibly refused to withdraw it— The Rules were
							suspended and Sergeant’s Resolution was adopted— It was by this time
							between 3. and 4. O’Clock, and after a struggle to adjourn over till
							Friday without taking the yeas and nays it was carried.</p>
