						<p>Sun rose 5:24. Set 6:36. Day 13 hours 12 minutes.</p>
						<p>Clear morn and Eve and I saw them both from <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> porch</p>
						<p>Heard <persRef ref="cranch-christopher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Joseph Pearce Cranch</persRef>, a younger Son, of my Cousin judge
								<persRef ref="cranch-william">William Cranch</persRef> of
							Washington. His morning text was from John 6.63. [“]It is the Spirit
							that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak
							unto you, they are Spirit and they are life.” The chapter containing
							this text is one of the most mysterious and solemn of the whole bible;
							especially from verse 48 to 71. the end of the chapter— This very 63<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> verse is the solution of most if not of
							all the numberless difficulties, and monstrous absurdities which have
							been perverted some by one sect and some by another into creeds and
							articles of faith— The words that he speaks are Spirit and life— Their
							doctrine is immortality, their language is spiritual, figurative,
							metaphorical— Almost all the inconceivable blunders of Christians in
							reading the new Testament have sprung from giving a literal
							interpretation to figurative speech— In this Chapter Jesus says Except
							ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life
							in you— And this declaration did so shock his disciples, that from that
							time, many of them went back and walked no more with him— Yet on taking
							the passover, just before his crucifixion, he broke the bread, and gave
							it to his disciples, saying this is my body—and in giving the cup said
							This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you. A
							repetition of the same figure which he had used at Capernaum— But
								<persRef ref="john">John’s</persRef> gospel is the only that gives
							the discourse at Capernaum, and the only one that omits the institution
							of the paschal supper. It must be admitted that the positive command to
							the disciples to eat his flesh, and to drink his blood, was, without
							explanation exceedingly revolting, but the explanation at Capernaum, and
							especially that of the last supper ought to have satisfied them all— And
							how with the two explanations the doctrine of transubstantiation could
							ever arise is utterly inconceivable— A collection for the parish library
							was taken up after the morning service. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cranch and <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> dined with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>us</persRef>— The afternoon text was Job. 7.17. [“]What is man that
							thou shouldst magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon
							him? 18 And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him
							every moment?” The doctrine derived from this text was that the superior
							excellence of the nature of man was proved by the trials to which he has
							been subject by the Providence of God—an ingenious deduction, disclosing
							a meditative mind— I read the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon of
								<persRef ref="parker-nathan">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Parker’s</persRef> volume. Scriptural definitions of the Christian
							character— The text, if any man be in Christ, he is a new Creature—and
							then the doctrine of regeneration.— Scarcely a skimming upon the surface
							of a deep abyss. Regeneration is another of the unfathomable depths of
							Christianity, sprung from the senseless practice of receiving in a
							literal sense that which was figuratively spoken— <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Greenleaf</persRef> was here towards Evening, and left with me, his
							report from the Committee on the Accounts of the Treasurer of the Temple
							and School fund Corporation, shewing a balance of 945 dollars and 52
							cents now in his hands. <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> E. Price Greenleaf</persRef>is so far
							recovered that he was at Meeting this day, Morning and afternoon.

						<p>Hingham. Steamboat— Boston. Gilletts Stage— Quincy.</p>
						<p>At five O’Clock this morning I took passage at <persRef ref="u"
								>French’s</persRef> tavern, for Hingham, in the Plymouth Stage.
							There was one other passenger in it, from Boston, and a double barrell’d
							fowling piece. He took his seat on the outside, with the driver when I
							got in— On the way another passenger got in at Weymouth who was going to
							the centennial celebration to be held to-morrow at Barnstable— The Stage
							started from French’s about half past 5 and at a quarter past 6. I
							alighted at the Post Office in Hingham, immediately opposite <persRef
								ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Loring’s</persRef> house— I called on him, and found he was going to
							Boston in the Steamer General Lincoln, which was precisely my own
							purpose— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring took me in his chaise to
							the boat about half a mile from his house— She left the wharf precisely
							at 7. and at half past 8 landed at the wharf, at the end of Pearl street
							Boston— The harbour at Hingham is perfectly land locked, and the passage
							to Boston is through a succession of Islands all the way through— The
							Quincy stone-meeting House, and <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> house are in sight perhaps through half the
							passage, and the town of Hull lying between two hills is full in view—
							There were I think not less than one hundred passengers in the boat—
							Among them <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker</persRef> who was upon our last fishing party, <persRef
								ref="lincoln-jairus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jairus
								Lincoln</persRef>, <persRef ref="greenleaf-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> William C Greenleaf</persRef>, who had
							passed the Sunday at Hingham, where his bien aimée <persRef
								ref="whitney-mary">Mary Whitney</persRef> is upon a visit to her
							friends— The boat went round Georges Island, in complaisance to me, and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring said the Captain, would
							receive no pay for my passage, which I suppose meant that he paid for it
							himself. He walked with me to Charles’s Office, and urged me much to
							return in the boat at 1. O’Clock, promising to take me home from
							Hingham. But I preferred returning directly to Quincy.— I soon called at
							106 State Street to inquire for <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathaniel Curtis</persRef>, but he was
							not there. I waited for him at Charles’s Office where he afterwards
							came, and I read to him and gave him the draught of a petition which I
							had prepared for <persRef ref="gill-moses3;u;u">the children</persRef>
							of the late <persRef ref="gill-moses">Moses Gill</persRef>, to the judge
							of Probate for the County of Worcester, praying him to grant Letters of
							Administration to <persRef ref="fuller-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Fuller</persRef>, on the Estates of <persRef
								ref="gill-moses2">Governor Gill</persRef>, and of the late Moses
							Gill— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller is to proceed tomorrow to
							Worcester— I called twice at the House of <persRef ref="blagden-george2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Blagden</persRef>, the Minister
							of the Old South Church, but neither time was he at home— I visited
								<persRef ref="dexter-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Dexter</persRef>, who urged me to stay and dine with her, but I
							declined— Visited also <persRef ref="phelps-abner">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Abner Phelps</persRef> at 23. Oliver
							Street; where though it was just after one, I found <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Phelps</persRef> and two other
							Ladies at dinner— The doctor was not with them, but came down from his
							chamber, and sent for his next door neighbour who came in; and we had
							half an hour of pleasant conversation. After a visit to the Silversmith
							shop—opposite the old State-house I went to Charles’s Office and read in
							the North American Review for last April, an Article upon <persRef
								ref="southey-robert">Southey’s</persRef> works, and several others,
							all dull, at 4. O’Clock I went to Elm-street and took passage in
								<persRef ref="gillet-simon">Gillett’s</persRef> omnibus for Quincy—
							Met there <persRef ref="dewindt-john;dewindt-caroline">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								DeWint</persRef> with their <persRef ref="dewindt-mary">infant
								child</persRef> and a Nurse <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet

								ref="bracket-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lemuel
								Bracket</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Marsh</persRef> and half a dozen women—Miss Welsh came to Charles’s

							spent the eve here.</p>

						<p>Sun rose 5:27. Set 6:33. Day 13 hours 6 minutes—</p>
						<p>The Sun was risen before I was dressed. I saw him set from the porch of
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house— Morning
							visit from <persRef ref="angier-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Joseph Angier</persRef> of Milton, with his Cousin <persRef
								ref="angier-luther2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Luther
								Angier</persRef> a young Clergyman of New-York. In the conversation
							with them M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Luther Angier mentioned
								<persRef ref="lanman-james">judge James Lanman</persRef> who was
							several years a member of the Senate of the United States, as having
							expressed to him a friendly feeling to me, a feeling which I told him
							was on my part altogether reciprocal. I said that just fifty years ago
							in the first week of September 1789. being a student at Law in the
							Office of <persRef ref="parsons-theophilus">Theophilus Parsons</persRef>
							at Newbury-Port, and going on a visit to <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef> then Vice-President of the United States at
							New-York I met at Providence and went down to Newport, in one of the
							small packets which then plied between those places, a young man, whose
							name I found to be <persRef ref="lanman-peter">Peter Lanman</persRef>—
							Thursday was beautiful but calm so that we could only drift down the
							river with the tide, and twice at the turn of the tide were obliged to
							cast anchor and lay six hours without moving forward an inch. We were
							all Night on the river and reached Newport about Sunrise. There I was
							detained two or three days by head winds before I could embark in the
							Packet for New-York— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lanman after a
							shorter detention, perhaps only of one day, crossed the river and
							proceed to Norwich, which was his home. But upon this very short and
							casual acquaintance I found him so very pleasant, intelligent and
							amiable a companion that we were something like the two German young
							Ladies in the Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin who meet at a tavern and swear
							to each other eternal friendship— But from that day for more than thirty
							years I neither saw nor heard any thing of Peter Lanman— When James
							Lanman came to Washington, as a Senator from Connecticut, I enquired of
							him whether Peter Lanman was related to him and he told me he was his
							brother— He afterwards came repeatedly to Washington and was I think
							appointed by <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef> in February 1824. Consul at Kingston in the Island
							of Jamaica. But the British Government at that time refused to admit
							Consuls from the United States at their Colonial Ports—and I had heard
							with much regret that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter Lanman had
							not been so successful in life as his brother— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Angier said it was so and that his brother had been to a
							considerable extent involved in his misfortunes— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Joseph Angier then said that his cousin was shortly to be
							married to <persRef ref="u">a daughter</persRef> of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> James Lanman. <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E. Price
								Greenleaf</persRef> was here this afternoon and examined the Apple
							and Pear buds, which he had inserted on the 3<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> and 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August; all of
							which he thinks have taken. But the inoculation of the pignut hickories
							have all failed. The stoutest of my Philadelphia seedling white maples
							which on the first of June last was 7. inches in circumference at the
							ground is now nine inches; and the budded cherry then 37 inches high is
							now 54. and has stopped growing for the Season— The tallest of the five
							Apple seedlings at the seminary gate is 3 feet 4 inches high. the
							second—31 inches 3 stunted— A Seminary wild pear seedling<space/>inches—

						<p>Supervisors of Temple and School fund Meeting. Pic-Nic.</p>
						<p>At Noon the Meeting of the Supervisors of the Temple, and School fund was
							held at my house. All the members present. The report of the Committee,
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Greenleaf</persRef> and myself upon the Treasurer’s account was read
							and accepted and a vote passed at my motion that the treasurer be
							directed to invest the funds in his hands, as soon as may be convenient
							in the manner prescribed, by the Deeds of grant; that is, in funds of
							the United States or of this Commonwealth— They are now in Notes from
							the town of Quincy— The lease of a house lot on the Hancock lot was
							received recorded. And another lease of a small strip of land, to
								<persRef ref="hayden-solomon">Solomon Hayden</persRef> by the last
							years Selectmen, but not executed by him, was presented for execution by
							the Surveyors— After much discussion, it appeared that by the terms of
							the Deeds the Select men of the Town alone can execute leases of the
							Lands, and that the Supervisors have only an advisory power— The lease
							was for 20 years and there was a proviso that if at the end of that time
							the parties could not agree upon a renewal, the buildings erected upon
							it by the lessee should be taken at an appraisement— <persRef
								ref="miller-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Miller</persRef>
							objected to this and proposed that the right reserved by the lessee
							should only be to take off his buildings— Much debate— I offered a
							Resolution to that effect which was adopted and a Committee of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Miller and myself were appointed to notify
							the selectmen, and confer with them thereon— I agreed with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Miller to meet him at the Selectmen’s
							weekly meeting next Saturday afternoon— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jewett</persRef> was reappointed as
							the Agent of the Corporation, for taking care of the Lands; and a
							Committee was appointed to lay out a street from the Neponset Bridge
							road to the private road opened by me, over the hill— About half past
							two the Meeting was dissolved; and the members, with <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="dewindt-caroline">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> De
								Wint</persRef>, and her daughter <persRef ref="dewindt-julia"
								>Julia</persRef> dined with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>us</persRef>— <persRef ref="dewindt-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> De Wint</persRef> was so much indisposed that he could
							not come— <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet Welsh</persRef> had
							returned this morning to Boston— The Pic Nic party of the Ladies of
							Quincy assembled at 3. P.M.— I had sent an excuse from Meeting them at
							that hour, owing to my previous engagement; but had promised to go in
							the Evening— <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Quincy</persRef> left us about 6. to return to
							Cambridge— I then walked with the other Gentlemen to the Green where the
							company were assembled— At our approach the Committee of 16 young
							maidens in uniform white muslin dresses, with Straw Sheperdess hats, and
							a green wreath around them came in pairs to meet me; opened their files
							and after I had passed between them escorted me to the tent, where I was
							received by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John
								Savile</persRef>, and was obliged to address the Ladies in a Speech—
							A corvée from which I had hoped to escape— I spoke only about half a
							dozen Sentences to apologise for the absence of <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>; and to contrast the
							happiness of these times with the distressing period of 1775 and 1776.
							There was a dance on the green by the young Ladies of the Committee and
							about Sunset we repaired in procession from the green to the long Hall
							at <persRef ref="u">French’s</persRef> tavern. I then walked home and
							returned in the Carriage with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef>,
							Charles and his wife to the Hall— There was dancing and singing of
							Glees, till after the Curfew-Bell, when the Ladies first and then the
							men supped on cakes, fruit and limonade. I addressed the men and toasted
							the Ladies at the supper table— We came home about 10. P.M. </p>

						<p>The evening before last there was one of the most brilliant nocturnal
							Aurora’s that I ever be held— Not a Northern light, but a circle of
							luminous coruscations, gathering from the circumference of the horizon
							to the Zenith, with a various colouring of dark crimson, of black clouds
							and of dazzling light—altogether producing a degree of light surpassing
							that of the Moon at the full— Last evening there was also a brilliant
							northern light. This day was warm, damp, and cloudy, threatening rain,
							and with one short sprinkling about Noon; but cleared off cool at Sunset
							which I saw from <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							porch— The setting was however not cloudless.— <persRef
								ref="billings-oliver">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Billings</persRef> called on me this morning, with his daughter
								<persRef ref="carey-adeline">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adeline
								Elizabeth Cary</persRef>, as he had told me last Evening that he
							should— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Cary is a widow and about
							fourteen months since had two sons enlisted as boys in the Navy. The
								<persRef ref="u">eldest</persRef> about 16 years old is now at Sea
							in the ship Ohio, the <persRef ref="cary-thomas4">youngest</persRef>
							about 14 is in the receiving ship at New-York, and as well as his mother
							extremely anxious to obtain his discharge— For this she applies to me;
							for my influence with the <persRef ref="paulding-james">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef>, which I told her was just nothing at all— I promised
							however to write to the Secretary of the Navy, stating her wishes and
							those of her Son, and recommended to her to do the same; but she had no
							reason for claiming his discharge, but his own and her most earnest
							wish— She said she had been last week to New-York to see him, and found
							him very uneasy— One of his grievances was that he was obliged to eat
							his meals without any other table than the deck of the ship— I asked if
							he was out of health. She said he had been afflicted with worms; but she
							did not wish to have his health assigned as a reason for asking the
							discharge— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Billings is much opposed to
							asking the discharge, and last Evening hinted that he wished me to
							dissuade the Secretary of the Navy from granting it. He said this day
							that it would be better to urge him to send the boy immediately to sea,
							but the mother with tears in her eyes vehemently protested against this,
							and I shall do no such thing— I advised her to consider whether it would
							not be kinder to the boy himself to leave him to the fulfilment of his
							engagement; but I was not more successful with her, than I expect to be
							with the Secretary of the Navy— I spent this Evening at <persRef

						<p>Another sudden and great change in the temperature of the weather— After

						<p>A gloomy day. Thick fog in the morning— Then distant thunder, and a
							succession of copious showers— All day, and Evening— Heard <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lunt</persRef>—
							His morning text was from James 5.11. [“]Ye have heard of the patience
							of <persRef ref="job">Job</persRef>”—this sermon was composed in
							consequence of a conversation at our table, upon an observation of
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">wife</persRef>, that she did not think the
							book of Job sustained his reputation for Patience— The discourse was a
							critical review of the Book and of the character of Job.
							Ingenious—eloquent— pathetic— The anecdote of the banishment of <persRef
								ref="aristides">Aristides</persRef>, and the booby for whom he wrote
							his name on the shell, was introduced as a happy illustration— And the
							dying exclamation of Jesus “My God! My God! why hast thou forsaken
							me?[”] as an apposite vindication of Job, for some manifestation by him
							of indignant complaint by him at his sufferings— The afternoon text was
							from Genesis 49:4. “Unstable as Water, thou shalt not excel.”— This
							version of the common English Bible contains as M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Lunt remarked, an admirable maxim of wisdom, applicable to
							every age of the world, and to every region of the globe— Whether it is
							in the Hebrew original, I know not, but in the Greek Septuagint it is
							not— In the French Genevan Bible it is rendered thou hast overflowed
							like water, and shalt not have the supremacy— But the thought is
							expressed in the English Bible with the most energy, and precision— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt laid down the principle that
							instability is fatal to all excellence, and sustained it by great
							variety of illustration—concluding with an exhortation to the most
							important of all stabilities that of Religious Faith— I read the 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of <persRef ref="parker-nathan">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Parker’s</persRef> Sermons—Joy in
							Heaven over the Penitent Sinner very good, but inferior to others of
							those that I had heard.— Charles was here this Evening, and we spent it
							by the bedside of <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">his

								Quincy</persRef> had dined with us. I wasted much time; reading in

						<p style="text-align: center;"><persRef ref="boylston-edward2">Edward

						<p>N. 6. Boston Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 13. 1721— Condoles with him
							on the decease of his Sister <persRef ref="graves-sybil">Madam
								Greaves</persRef>.— Speaks of Wigglesworth’s appointment as Hollis
							professor of divinity, which had been made in that year—of <persRef
								ref="hollis-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hollis’s</persRef> satisfaction with the appointment; and of the
							hope that he may be induced to increase the Salary of the professor from
							£40 to £80 a year— He says that [“]in Boston they can talk of nothing
							but inoculation—the success of which is increasing and he hopes will
							continue to increase.”— And yet, so infatuated are the people as to
							continue obstinate against the plainest experience (the only sure
							foundation in Physick[)]—but time will produce what nothing else can—
							The Letter refers also to the abominable Oath of the French Doctor
								<persRef ref="u">Dalhonde</persRef>, about the Battle of Almanza.
							The Letter is signed Edward Boylston—or as the heralds say—Boyldston. </p>
						<p>This was the year in which <persRef ref="boylston-zabdiel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Zabdiel Boylston</persRef> introduced
							the practice of inoculation into Boston— It appears by his pamphlet that
							on the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of November, eleven days after
							the date of this Letter, he inoculated M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Edward Wigglesworth (M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hollis’s professor
							(aged) 32.[)] and <persRef ref="quincy-edmund6">Edmund</persRef>, son of
								<persRef ref="quincy-edmund3">judge Edmund Quincy</persRef>, then a
							student at Harvard College, and that they had the disorder very
							favourably— Edward Boylston had probably had the disease before— D<hi

						<p>Weather variable— Cloud— Sunshine— Summer heat. Clear sky— Thick haze fog
							and star-light Evening— I had eight new rings, dug out about 3 feet deep
							in the seminary, for the purpose of raising upon them seedling fruit
							trees—from each hole, about five bushels of Stones were taken out, to be
							carried away, to be replaced with fertile soil, for I have invariably
							found that the seedlings thrive in proportion as the soil is refreshed
							and fattened. In the eight rings opened last year there are seedling
							peach apple and pear trees. 1 wild plum, 1 Althaea, 2 English Oaks. 3.
							Walnuts—2 strawberry vines planted last year—and one wild vine planted
							last June— A Cucumber vine from 2 seeds which I carelessly cast in last
							May, which has produced about a dozed Cucumbers used at table, and four
							already plucked for seed— A Squash vine casually cast in also last May,
							which has produced an abundance of barren, and two or three fruit
							bearing flowers, the fruit of which having no time to ripen will perish
							with the first frost— I have a multitude of seedlings of growth from 1to
							9 years, but of which the peaches only bear fruit. Of 11 budded Baldwin
							apples imported from Medford in 1830. three girdled by field-mice have
							thrown up new shoots two of them below the bud; which I have again
							budded this year—the third is making a new stock of the Baldwin but
							Several of them bore this year but the late storm blew off almost all
							the fruit— My seminary is now wholly laid out in 8 rows of 8 rings each
							which I propose to cover if possible with 64 bearing fruit trees,
							besides the northern border. Charles and his wife were here this

						<p>N. 10. Barbados March 18 1722/3 Politics— Much surprized at the <persRef

								ref="sanderson-anthony">Anthony Sanderson</persRef> a merchant of

								ref="dummer-jeremiah">Dummer</persRef>, will so offend him that

						<p>This Letter corroborates the narrative of <persRef

						<p>A cold autumnal day—and we had fire in the dining room. My seminary is

							seedling fruit tree; besides the northern border. I began this plan in
							the autumn of 1834 when the border and the first two rows of rings were
							laid out— There was one row, next to the fence at the road already and I
							have added one row of rings each year since 1834— Setting out in each
							ring a peach, cherry or black walnut seedling tree from the garden or
							Nursery; and strewing Apple and Pear seeds—Peach and Plum stones—Acorns
							and walnuts in the rings round the trees— The ground beneath the surface
							is perfectly paved with loose stones of every size, from gravel to 50
							pounds weight. <persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirk</persRef> has now dug out,
							filled up with manure and dressed the last row of rings Each ring is a
							circular hole of about four feet diameter, dug three feet deep, and
							filled up with manure, and fresh earth mixed up with the old soil sifted
							from five bushels of stones carted away— I spend an hour of morning
							twilight for exercise, in labour upon these rings. In ring 8 of row 6.
							there is a wild strawberry vine, the root of which on the<space/>of June
							last I brought over from the hill, and set out, and which has been
							slowly creeping along till this day; and there are 3 poor apple
							seedlings, sown last autumn upon it. I dressed it this morning; sowed
							round it a circle of 13 english Oak acorns and 4 peach stones—and in an
							extra ring near the road, Southeast corner of the seminary 10 English
							Oak Acorns, and 4 peach stones— <persRef ref="adams-charles2"

								Lunt</persRef>— Morning Sermon, from Matthew 28.8 “And they departed
							from the Sepulchre with <hi rend="italic">fear</hi>, and great joy”— The
							first part of the discourse was a commentary upon the event narrated in
							the chapter of which the text forms a part, remarking upon the
							simplicity of the narrative as furnishing luminous evidence of its
							credibility, and pointing to the nature of this fact, as exactly suited
							to produce the mingled sensations of fear and joy in the two women, at
							the sight of the Angel, and the hearing of his words. And thence he
							passed to a general deduction that this mingled emotion of fear and joy,
							is the temper with which the Christian should be impressed by all the
							important truths of religion—as the existence of God, his attributes of
							power—and of Justice—as the immortality of the Soul, and a future state
							of retribution— In the afternoon <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef> preached from Luke
							16.27. “Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest
							send him to my father’s house; 28 For I have five brethren; that he may
							testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.” The
							parable of the rich man and Lazarus. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney’s improvement of this story was. 1. That it was not because
							Dives was rich, that he went to Hell—nor because <persRef ref="lazarus"
								>Lazarus</persRef> was poor that he went at once into <persRef
								ref="abraham">Abraham’s</persRef> bosom. This must be true—but it is
							remarkable that the contrast presented in the parable is exclusively of
							riches and poverty— Not one word is said of the merits of Lazarus or of
							the demerits of Dives.— The pampered enjoyments of the rich man and the
							beggary, and sufferings of the poor man, are exclusively the theme of
							the tale— In the world of real life, riches are often the reward of
							superior virtue—the fruits of industry, economy, prudence, temperance,
							justice, fortitude—and in the infinite variety of chances in human life,
							the practice of virtue is the most successful avenue to wealth, as
							beggary, and abject poverty are prima facie indications of vice— 2 That
							in this parable the doctrine of future punishments and rewards is most
							explicitly declared by Christ, is to my mind undeniable— The denial of
							it is to me but a form of Atheism. Yet I will not deny that a
							universalist may be a Christian á sa maniere, as the Spanish Bishop at
							Astorga, said to the Priest, of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>— 3. That the rich man of the parable, had one very
							amiable virtue, manifested by his affectionate concern for his five
							brothers.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney believes in the final
							salvation of all men; and although I cannot find it in the gospel, I
							hope it may be true— I once heard M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney
							put in a plea for <persRef ref="judas-iscariot">Judas
							Iscariot</persRef>— Just before the close of the Evening service, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt gave notice that on this day
							fortnight, the second centurial anniversary of the gathering of the
							Church at Mount Wollaston he proposed to notice the fact in the services
							of the day; and that both the Pastors of the Church thought it would be

						<p>I noticed the brilliant Northern light of Saturday Evening. It continued
							through the Night, and when I rose yesterday morning, was brighter than
							when I had left it on retiring to bed. It was yesterday truly a Boreal
							Aurora; but as the dawn advanced suddenly vanished leaving a Crystal
							clear sky— There was again a Northern light last Evening and there has
							indeed been one almost every evening the last ten days— This morning by
							way of varying my exercise, I walked at the dawn to the 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Milestone towards Boston 46 minutes— My
							quick pace is still 17 minutes to a mile and 1070 paces on level ground
							and hard earth and cool temperature and calm weather, and light shoes.—
							But hilly ground, dusty or muddy road, sultry weather, or a brisk gale,
							or heavy shoes increase the number of paces sometimes to 1120.— The dust
							this morning and gravel in my shoes gave me 1090 paces from the 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> to the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							milestone and 1110 returning.— <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi

							Queen Street Boston—very short—merely to announce, that he came down the

						<p>N. 19. Livorno May 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> N.S. 1726.— This is the
							longest and most interesting Letter of the collection— He arrived at
							Leghorn, in the latter end of December (where he was from June 1725 when
							he was at Deal does not appear) about the middle of February he went to
							Civita Vecchia, and thence to Rome, where he spent near two months;
							visiting the curiosities antient and modern of the place; and in
							constant intercourse with a round number of very ingenious English
							Gentleman Travellers, among whom he was pretty much of a rarity and was
							chiefly known by the name of the American— But his Coffee man, in making
							out his bill dubbed him Mons<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> lé Chevalier
							Africane. At Rome he witnessed the extravagant and costly absurdities of
							the Carnival— After which he diligently applied himself to the virtue of
							travellers, and visited with his antiquary the temples, churches,
							palaces, Villa’s— The Pantheon, the Temple of Vesta, the Amphitheatre of
							Vespasion, Triumphal Arches, Columns, Aqueducts, Baths, and all the
							marvels of the eternal City.— He had frequent opportunities of seeing
							the <persRef ref="benedict-xiii">Pope</persRef>; and his favourite
								<persRef ref="coscia-niccolo">Cardinal Cocci</persRef>— Also the
							Pretender of whose condition at that time he gives some account— Says

						<p>N 23. London March 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> 1726/7 almost
							entirely upon politics; the reigning topic, he says of conversation in

							from Ostend to the East Indies rather than risque the Austrian
							Netherlands falling into the hands of France; as they probably might in
							the case of a rupture. He fears that England will be compelled to

						<p>N 25. and last. Barbados July 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> 1728— He
							says he has not received a line from his correspondent since he left

							of Ferdinand and Isabella, but of <persRef ref="cordova-gonzalo"
								>Gonzalvo of Cordova</persRef> the great Captain, the <persRef

							Prescott strips of all his spurious honours, as the Pere du Peuple, of
							the noble <persRef ref="debobadilla-beatriz">Marchioness of
								Moya</persRef>, Isabella’s ever devoted friend, are all brought into
							fresh and vivid recollection— The wonder almost inconceivable, is how a
							person of such a spirit, could have been produced parents; and in the
							midst of such a course have been bred to such a glorious reign, adorned
							with such a train of virtues, and with so little of the dross of the age
							in which she lived. <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clark</persRef> when <persRef ref="u">his wife</persRef> died

							be maps of Spain and Italy at least to illustrate the narrative. The
							Conquest of Grenada of Naples and of Navarro give a splendid colouring
							to the Story— The least laboured part is the discovery and adventures of
							Columbus. </p>

								Lawrence</persRef> came to obtain my assistance if possible for
							procuring a renewal of her pension; for the service of <persRef

							But I could give her no encouragement to expect that her application

									>r</hi> Lunt</persRef> called this afternoon, and left with me a
							small volume of the Cambridge Church Records; a document more confused
							and chaotic than those of Braintree or of Milton— It goes back to about
							1656. and contains minutes of births—marriages, admissions to the
							Church, ownings of the Covenant—and then loads of wood given to the
							ministers, receipts for Salary, dates of planting and sowing them in the
							spring, and minutes of stirring events as they occurred— A Church record
							of this kind systematically kept would be a jewel— M<hi

								ref="newell-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Newell</persRef>, the Minister of the Church at Cambridge, with whom
							he proposes to exchange to-morrow, and he left it with me, supposing I

								ref="hilliard-timothy">Timothy Hilliard</persRef>, copied in the

								Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1636—the account of the formation
							of the Church at Newtown (Cambridge) and the election of <persRef
								ref="shepherd-thomas3">Thomas Shepard</persRef> as Pastor— The
							Letter of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stiles was written before the
							publication of Winthrop’s Journal, but of which he had seen the

							admissions to the church and marriages of persons by the name of Adams
							from <persRef ref="adams-anne">Anne</persRef> wife of <persRef

							said he would call for the book to-morrow morning on his way to
							Cambridge, as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newell wished to have it
							returned to him— After dinner I took a ride with <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> in his four wheeled Chaise
							round over Milton Hill— Stopped on the way at <persRef
								ref="billings-oliver">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="cary-adeline">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Cary</persRef>
							was there— He said she was in Boston— I read to him the answer received
							this morning from <persRef ref="chauncey-isaac">Commodore

								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Cary, for the discharge of <persRef
								ref="cary-thomas4">her Son</persRef>, from the Navy-Yard at New-York
							where he is engaged as an Apprentice. The answer is that <persRef
								ref="ridgeley-charles">Commodore Ridgely</persRef> has been directed
							to discharge Thomas Webb Cary, provided there be no particular reason
							for retaining him— Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his

							spent the Evening here. On Thursday night there was a Ball and Supper at
								<persRef ref="u">French’s</persRef> tavern exclusively confined to
							the Stone cutters, and from which all the Irish were excluded— They met
							about nine in the Evening upon which a salute of 26 guns was fired: and
							the salute was repeated yesterday morning, just before Sunrise; as they
							were breaking up.— I suppose it was a set-off to the Pic-Nic.</p>

							did not call this morning for the volume of Cambridge Church Records,
							but I was engaged almost all the morning in examining it and in
							extracting all its entries of the name of Adams, though I believe none
							of them were of the lineage of our old <persRef ref="adams-henry">Henry
								Adams</persRef> of Mount Wollaston. There were undoubtedly of the
							primitive patriarchal age of the New England Colony, many others of the
							name of Adams— <persRef ref="newell-william2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Newell</persRef> preached here this morning from 1.
							Corinthians 13.9. “For we know in part, and we prophesy in part 10. But
							when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be
							done away. 11. When I was a child I spoke as a child, I understood as a
							child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away
							childish things. 12. For now we see through a glass darkly; but then,
							face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know, even as also I
							am known.” Nothing remarkable in this Sermon— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Newell dined with us— I invited also <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney</persRef>, but he declined saying that he always dined at home
							on Sundays— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newell’s afternoon text was
							Genesis 2.15. [“]And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the
							Garden of Eden, to dress it and to keep it.” Same character as the
							discourse of the morning. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newell took
							home with him the manuscript volume of Cambridge Church records.
								<persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Degrand</persRef> came out from Boston, and dined and spent the day
							with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>— Tea and Evening
							at <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E. Price
								Greenleaf</persRef> came in. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand
							as usual brought out a large budget of Newspapers— The Steamship British
							Queen, arrived Friday afternoon at New-York, bringing 209 passengers in
							17 days. This is now the average passage of the Steamers from England—
							The average passage out is 14 days. The Steam navigation has thus
							abridged the distance across the atlantic more than one half; for in the
							most improved state of previous Navigation the outward average passage
							of the packet ships was 30 and the return passage 37. days. The
							multiplication of travellers is proportioned to the increased expedition
							of travel. The <persRef ref="victoria">queen Victoria’s</persRef> Speech
							at the close of the Session of Parliament is brought out by this vessel,
							and portends the continuance of Peace— The controversies between the
							kingdoms of Belgium and of Holland have been adjusted—and the five
							powers, Britain, France, Prussia, Austria and Russia, have combined to
							maintain the Independence of the Mahometan Turkish Empire against the
							rebellious <persRef ref="muhammadali">Bashaw</persRef> of Egypt— A
							Christian league for the preservation of a Mahometan Empire— The queen
							declares also her determination to persevere in her efforts to persuade
							all the Christian powers to abolish the Slave-trade. It is hardly
							conceivable that if the British Government were sincere in their zeal
							for the abolition of the Slave trade, they should after so many years of
							negotiation have accomplished nothing but Treaties. The British Nation
							drive their Government along in this Career; but the Government never
							have been and never will be hearty in the cause— I read this evening the
								9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of <persRef ref="parker-nathan"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parker’s</persRef> Sermons; to
							prove that righteousness is the test of the Christian Character— The

							they appear.</p>

								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>

							had a succession of visitors from dinner time till dark. <persRef
								ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef>
							came with a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Anderson</persRef> from Texas; who appeared to be labouring with
							some communication to me, which he did however but very partially
							reveal.— He said that the People of Texas had very inconsiderately made
							Slavery a part of their Constitution; and thereby closed their doors
							against migration from the free States of this Union— They were
							therefore wholly devoted to the Institution of Slavery. But many of the
							most intelligent among them think this impolitic and wrong— The natural
							conclusion from this seemed to be that they wished to make of Texas a
							free State and to abolish Slavery; but this he did not distinctly avow.
							He seemed to be desirous of obtaining my opinions, without venturing his
							own— I said I thought this might be effected by the British Government,
							and that it appeared to have entered into the views of <persRef
								ref="oconnell-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								O’Connell</persRef>, according to a notice of an intended motion
							lately given by him in Parliament; but I expected that nothing would

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E. Price</persRef> Greenleaf was
							here; returned some German Books, and borrowed others; and loosened the
							bands of most of the Apple and Pear-stocks which he had inserted on the

								<persRef ref="jackson-francis2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Francis Jackson</persRef> brought me a Letter from <persRef
								ref="loring-ellis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellis Gray
								Loring</persRef>, requesting my opinion upon the knotty questions
							involved in the case of the Spanish ship Amistad recently taken by a
							vessel of the U.S. engaged on the survey of the Coast, and brought into
							New-London, having on board about 40 African Slaves, and two Spaniards
							of the Island of Cuba their owners— The Slaves having been charged with
							murder and piracy, for taking the ship and putting to death the <persRef
								ref="ferrer-ramon">Captain</persRef> and one or two other white men—
								<persRef ref="thompson-smith">Judge Smith Thomson</persRef> of the
							U.S Circuit Court has decided that his Court has no jurisdiction to try
							the offence of piracy committed on the high Seas in a Spanish vessel;
							but his opinion is not yet published; and the newspaper account of his
							decision I think is correct— I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jackson to say that I felt some delicacy about answering his Letter
							until judge Thomsons opinion shall be published and until the final
							decision of the Government upon the whole case in the mean
							time—requested him to ask M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring to look
							up and examine the records of the Circuit Court upon the trial of the
							Pirates convicted and executed there in<space/>and I mentioned to him
							the refusal of President to deliver up a man charged at Charleston S.C.
							with Piracy committed on board of a British Vessel— Charles and his wife
							and Miss Hall spent the Evening here, after the return of the Ladies
							from Boston— <persRef ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah Adams jun<hi

							Lunt had requested me to furnish him with a hymn to be sung at the
							centennial anniversary, and I gave him one that I wrote some years
							since, upon the rapid flight of Time; observing that the reflections in
							it, were perhaps of too general a nature, for a special occasion, and
							leaving at his option to use it or not— He said he thought it would do,
							and that perhaps it would be best to generalize in that part of the
							Service— <persRef ref="newcomb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								James Newcomb</persRef> was here, and returned the copy of the
							Resolution of the Supervisors of the Temple and School fund,
							disapproving the projected lease to <persRef ref="hayden-solomon"
								>Solomon Hayden</persRef>, which I had left with the Selectmen— And
							he said that <persRef ref="whittier-john2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Whittier</persRef> to whom a similar lease had been
							promised, for 100 years upon payment of 35 dollars, had manifested some
							uneasiness at its being denied to him; he having made it already part of
							his garden; and having thoughts of removing his house itself upon it, to
							give him the benefit of being upon a more convenient School District—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newcomb asked my advice what to do. I
							thought the best thing would be to give a lease for 20 years at a rent
							of 2 dollars and ten cents a year— This proposed example of giving
							leases for 100 years, without reservation of rent upon the payment of a
							trifling sum, endangers the whole property; and I propose now to call a
							meeting of the Supervisors on the third Wednesday of August next, and
							then to propose as by-laws 1. That there shall be a regular meeting of
							the board on that day annually. 2. That a minute of all the existing
							leases shall then be laid before the board by the Secretary, 3 That a
							Committee of 2 members shall be chosen at every annual meeting to
							inspect the Library with the Secretary, and to report in writing the
							condition of the books, and if any of them are missing or have been
							damaged. 4. That a report of the State of the fund shall be made to the
							board at every annual meeting by the Treasurer— Other regulations may
							perhaps be also necessary for the preservation and good management of
							the property. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newcomb appeared under some
							solicitude for the elections to the State Government, which are
							approaching and will be vehemently contested; and particularly for the
							effect of the license law of April 1838. this and an alteration of the
							Militia Law by the Legislature of the present year will according to all
							appearance overthrow the present administration of the State, and throw
							it into the arms of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef>—
							By the 125<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section of the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of the revised Statutes, a
							bounty of 5 dollars a year was allowed to the members of volunteer
							companies— This bounty was repealed by an act of the 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April last— There was this day a
							militia muster on the Hancock lot in this town which all the volunteer
							companies in the County refused to attend, excepting two— The muster was
							therefore nothing, but it brought together an assemblage of gambling,
							drunken democrats, as they styled themselves who disgraced the day in
							fighting and rioting, and forced themselves into the front yard of my
							house, from which I had no small difficulty in dislodging them— They
							cleared of however by the dusk of Evening— Charles and his <persRef

							>Charles</persRef>—a youth of the brightest promise, barely one year

						<p>Sun rose 5:50. Set 5:52. Day 12 hours 2 minutes.</p>
						<p>I went to Boston this morning in the Carriage, with <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> C. F.
								Adams’s</persRef> Nursery Maid <persRef ref="goods-catherine"
								>Catherine</persRef>— There had been a very heavy thunder shower in
							the Night, and the morning was still lowering— I left Louisa at her
								<persRef ref="foster-elizabeth">Sister Foster’s</persRef>, and was
							overtaken by a smart clearing up shower, which drove me for shelter,
							first to the Boylston market Hall, and then to Charles’s Office where I
							found his tenant <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Spooner</persRef>. I called next at <persRef ref="loring-ellis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellis Gray Loring’s</persRef> Office,
							and had some conversation with him concerning his Letter to me on the
							case of the Amistad and her Cargo of Africans— He has not yet obtained
							the minutes from the records of the U.S. Circuit court of the Piracy
							trial there when <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Monroe</persRef> was President; but will procure them.
								<persRef ref="jackson-francis2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Francis Jackson</persRef> came in while I was there— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring was extremely anxious to obtain my
							opinion as to the right of the President to deliver up the negroes, upon
							the demand of the Spanish Minister— Yet the time has not yet come when
							it would be proper for me to give an opinion for publication— Prudence
							would forbid my giving an opinion upon it at any time; and if I ever do,
							it must be with great consideration and self controul— May I walk humbly
							and uprightly, on this and all other occasion—flinching from no
							duty—obtruding no officious interposition of opinions, and prepared to
							meet with firmness whatever obloquy may follow the free expression of my
							thoughts— At Noon I attended the meeting of the Historical Society:
							several new members were proposed; among whom <persRef
								ref="berrien-john">J. M. Berrien</persRef> the President, and
								<persRef ref="tefft-israel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tefft</persRef> the Secretary of the newly instituted historical
							Society of Georgia— The Secretary of the Historical Society of Kentuckey
							was admitted as a corresponding member— I returned the volume of funeral
							Sermons which I had borrowed, containing that of <persRef
								ref="hancock-john2">John Hancock</persRef> upon <persRef
								ref="quincy-edmund3">Judge Edmund Quincy</persRef>; and took out the
							three Manuscripts, which I had promised to procure for <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="pierce-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Pierce</persRef> of Brookline, promised to send me extracts from his
							Church records of all the baptisms of the names of Boylston, and of
							White connected with them. <persRef ref="shattuck-lemuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lemuel Shattuck</persRef> requested a
							copy of the Will of the first <persRef ref="adams-henry">Henry
								Adams</persRef>, and a sight of the genealogical table of the Adams
							family made in 1799. by <persRef ref="adams-elijah">Elijah
								Adams</persRef> of Medfield— He also told me, that <persRef
								ref="adams-john13">John Adams</persRef> the son of the first Henry
							removed to Concord—and finally to Cambridge so that the names, which I
							found on the Cambridge Church Records, are all descendants from Henry of
							Mount Wollaston— <persRef ref="winthrop-thomas">President
								Winthrop’s</persRef> son <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Robert
								C.</persRef> was proposed as a member of the Society— The old
							Gentleman invited me to dine with him, but I declined— <persRef ref="davis-isaac">Isaac P. Davis</persRef>
							took me over to the Exhibition of the Horticultural Society, where there
							was a fine display of flowers—fruits and culinary esculents. I then
							returned to <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								James H. Fosters</persRef>, where I saw M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Foster and her <persRef
									ref="foster-mary;foster-elizabeth2;foster-louisa">three daughters</persRef>. Took
							up <persRef ref="foster-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> and Catherine,
							and came home to Quincy to dine— I now learn that all Cars Cows and Oxen
							were turned last Night into my Orchard ground—broke down and devoured my
							China Corn, and uprooted all the hills of my Rohan Potatoes— Called at
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunts; but he and <persRef
								ref="lunt-ellen">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lunt</persRef> were
							gone to Boston— I left the Manuscripts with his <persRef
								ref="lunt-mary;lunt-anne;lunt-lucretia">daughters</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail2">Abby</persRef> here.</p>

						<p>I observed last Evening’s setting and this morning’s rising Sun, both
							perfectly clear from <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							porch— By the American Almanac the setting was at 5:50—the rising at
							5:53—by my watch the setting and rising were both at 5:51:30. forming a
							perfect equinox of 12 hours.— Charles and I had received a printed
							circular invitation from <persRef ref="greenough-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> B. F. Greenough</persRef>, proprietor
							of a new invented chemical oil, for use in the Light-house lamps, and
							which he wishes to have substituted in the stead of sperm oil, to join a
							select party of scientific and nautical Gentlemen to embark in the
							Steamer General Lincoln from the end of Liverpool wharf at four O’Clock
							this afternoon, to view the light from the Bay and compare its
							brilliancy with those Lights using Sperm Oil. Charles went to Boston
							this morning— I after an early dinner went in the Carriage with <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="u">daughter</persRef> and <persRef ref="kirk-elizabeth"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Kirke</persRef>— Called at
								<persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frothingham’s</persRef> where Charles had dined but was just gone—
							Then at his Office where I found him with <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Spooner</persRef>— We both repaired
							immediately to the Steamer Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Lincoln at
							Liverpool wharf— It blew a heavy gale from the Southwest; and there was
							much discussion whether the party should not be postponed till next
							Monday— The boat however was to take passengers for Hingham and was
							concluded to go there, and if the Storm should subside at Sunset, then
							to go out into the Bay— We landed accordingly at Hingham at 6. O’Clock,
							and marched in procession under the escort of <persRef
								ref="sturgis-josiah">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Josiah
								Sturgis</persRef>, Commander of the Revenue Cutter with his band of
							music, and the Crew of his vessel to the Old Colony House— The
							procession consisted of <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H.
								Everett</persRef> and myself—<persRef ref="jarvis-leonard">Leonard
								Jarvis</persRef> and my Son—<persRef ref="treadwell-daniel">M<hi

								ref="lewis-winslow">Win<unclear>slow</unclear>
								Lewis</persRef>—<persRef ref="peabody-oliver">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>Peabody</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="willard-joseph3">Joseph Willard</persRef>, and half a dozen
							others unknown to me, and lastly M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Greenough himself— The Gale instead of subsiding increased in violence
							as the Sun went down and no one thought of going this Night into the
							Bay— I sat on the upper deck of the Steamer on the passage to Hingham,
							noticing Governors and Castle Island—Spectacle Thomson, George’s
							Pettucks, Long Island—Sheeps and Hangman’s rocks with Nantasket beach
							and the town of Hull—Quincy—Hough’s Neck, Germantown, and on approaching
							Hingham the World’s end and sundry other Islands the names of which
							escaped me— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker</persRef> and <persRef ref="lincoln-jairus">Jairus
								Lincoln</persRef> of Hingham were on board, and many women— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenough’s party had a comfortable tea
							and supper and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenough made his
							comparative experiments of brilliancy, between the light of Sperm Oil
							and his chemical composition, in the long Hall of the Hotel—first with
							large conical reflectors or reverberes—and then with the bare lighted
							lamps— The chemical compound gave the most brilliant light, but the
							result of the comparison of the shadows from the naked lights was
							doubtful, and severely tested by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Treadwell— About 9 in the Evening in the party of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenough with Lieutenant Sturgis, his
							band and his crew left the Hotel to return in the Steamer to Boston—
							Charles engaged a four wheeled Chaise with one horse and a man, who took
							us home to Quincy by land: we had however two or three sprinklings and
							one very heavy shower of rain, in the midst of which we reached home
							about half past ten— My wife with her party had returned in the Carriage
							from Boston, by tea-time— I found a note from <persRef
								ref="loring-ellis">Ellis Gray Loring</persRef>, and a packet of
							books, with the trial of the Pirates at Boston, in December 1818 and
							other judicial decisions. </p>

								>Charles</persRef> went in to Boston for his horse and Chaise, and
							returned home to dine— We have not been able to keep off the making of
							fires in the dining room— My Thermometer was this morning at 42. and was
							yesterday morning at 40. I still resist the making of fire in my

							the days are so shortened that I lose the long evening hours in

							requesting as a favour some thought or sentiment of mine, written with

							having just passed from the fairy dreams of childhood to the sober
							realities of life, residing beneath the paternal roof, in the
							South-eastern part of Chester County, Pennsylvania— The hand-writing,
							the spelling, and composition of the Letter, all indicate a cultivated
							mind and liberal education; the only deduction from the estimate of
							which is the fulsome flattery with which her request is urged— But this
							I suppose emanates from the enthusiasm of Anti-Slavery; not yet
							refrigerated, as with the great mass of the Abolitionists it has been by
							the dampers which I have put upon their senseless and overbearing
							clamour for the immediate, total, uncompensated abolition of Slavery in
							the District of Columbia— I have sent to Miss Peirce copies of my
							Oration upon the life and character of <persRef ref="lafayette">La
								Fayette</persRef>, of the fragment Speech of June and July 1838 and
							of the Jubilee of the Constitution, with the following thought or

						<p>This is the centennial day. The third century commences with this day
							since the formation of the Congregational Church at Mount Wollaston—
								<persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> preached two historical Sermons on the occasion— In
							the morning from Deuteronomy 8.11. “Beware that thou forget not the Lord
							thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments and his
							Statutes, which I command thee this day: 12 Lest when thou hast eaten
							and art full, and hast built goodly houses and dwelt therein;— 14 then
							thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God, which
							brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage:—
							17. And thou say in thine heart, My power, and the might of mine hand
							hath gotten me this wealth: 18. But thou shalt remember the Lord thy
							God; for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may
							establish his covenant, which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this
							day.[”] His Doctrine was that the undertaking of the puritans to
							establish a Christian Commonwealth in the North American wilderness, was
							a design so vastly beyond their visible means to accomplish, that
							nothing short of the overpowering energy of religion could have effected
							it— He illustrated this position by the comparative merit of the
							sacrifices of <persRef ref="cain">Cain</persRef> and <persRef ref="abel"
								>Abel</persRef>—from the vocation of <persRef ref="abraham"
								>Abraham</persRef>— From the Exodus out of Egypt, and finally from
							the mission of Christ and his apostles— He then gave a historical
							account of the formation of the Church at Mount Wollaston as connected
							with the settlement of the town of Braintree—from <persRef
								ref="morton-thomas2">Morton’s</persRef> Merry Mount Maypole to the
							ordination of the Ministers <persRef ref="thompson-william2"
								>Tompson</persRef> and <persRef ref="flynt-henry">Flint</persRef>.
							He gave a lucid account of the Sermon of <persRef ref="wheelwright-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wheelwright</persRef> which
							occasioned the Antinomian controversy, and which he supposed to have
							been preached here, and paid a handsome tribute to the character of
							Wheelwright himself— The afternoon text was from John 4:20. “Our fathers
							worshipped in this Mountain”—and with short biographical notices of the
							Pastors of the Church Tompson and Flint—<persRef ref="fiske-moses"
								>Fiske</persRef>, <persRef ref="marsh-joseph">Marsh</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="hancock-john2">Hancock</persRef>, <persRef

							eloquence— <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Peter Whitney</persRef> made the morning and <persRef
								ref="whitney-george2">George Whitney</persRef> the afternoon prayer—
							The Communion was administered jointly by the two Pastors after the
							morning service and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter Whitney began
							the afternoon service, with baptizing a child by the name of <persRef
								ref="gorham-george">George Gorham</persRef>— There was an Anthem

						<p>I had intended to postpone the making of a fire in my chamber at least
							till the first of October, but this morning I was so chilled in reading
							before Sunrise that to work myself into a perspiration, I walked to the
								6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> mile stone. 17 minutes to a mile
							1084 paces, and 1088 between the two milestones and 46 minutes from my
							gate to it again— After breakfast I had the fire made in my room. There
							were sprinklings of rain and a raw chilly day, which confined me almost
							entirely to the house— I answered the application from two literary
							Societies at the Wesleyan Methodist Universit at Middletown Connecticut
							to deliver an Oration before them at their Commencement next
							August—declined—and I received from <persRef ref="sturgis-josiah"
									>Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Josiah Sturgis</persRef> a
							sheet of beach-grass paper. My time was much absorbed in examining
								<persRef ref="bacon-matthew">Bacon’s</persRef> Abridgement, <persRef

								ref="emerigon-balthazard">Emerigon</persRef>, upon the principle

							of my father, or for any other profitable writing— Accordingly the
							Summer is gone, and I am where I was when I arrived here on the 2<hi

							the American Historical Society at Washington have elected me their
							President, and called upon me for a discourse to be delivered in the
