                            returned to dine. Before he went I told him I understood the meeting of
                            the whig Committee at Boston finally to fix upon their list of
                            Representatives for the general Court was held last Evening, and that
                            they had then probably settled their list. But if they had not, I
                            concurred entirely with <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks</persRef> in the wish that he

                            acquiesced— After two days of dissipation, I found it impossible this
                            day to return to that assiduity of application indispensable to go
                            through my present daily task, of writing three pages for my Lecture;
                            the diary of the day and to retrieve the arrears of two successive days
                            at Boston— A man by the name of <persRef ref="stearns-levi">Levi
                                Stearns</persRef> who said he came from the town of Sweden, I
                            suppose in the State of Maine, where he had lost his house and property
                            by fire—he asked for a gift of cast off garments and had a bundle of
                            them under his arm— He said also that he belonged to the Methodist
                            Church— I had no reason to mistrust his statement, which had every
                            appearance of sincerity— <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef>

                            brought her home— I was at Charles’s about half an hour at the twilight
                            after Sunset— I finished this day a Lecture on the Smithsonian bequest,
                            but finding that I have not said half of what it was my intention to
                            include in one discourse I began upon a second, which if ever finished I
                            have no doubt will be as long as the first.— I had no space in the diary
                            of the 31<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of last month to give my usual
                            summary of daily occupations during the month, and may as well give it
                            now— My rising hour as usual between 4 and 5— I make my fire wash and
                            dress which takes me a full hour— Often more— Then read or write till 8.
                            Breakfast—read Letters and Newspapers or pamphlets brought by the mail
                            till 2 P.M with intervals of writing; about 2 hours— After dinner half
                            an hour or an hour of idleness for digestion—then an equal time till
                            Sunset, now before 5 again writing. From that time till 10. P.M. with an
                            interval of half an hour for tea, and a cup of hot cocoa-shells for me I
                            spend with my family— Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
                                wife</persRef> come in for an hour between 7 and 8. Ten is our bed
                            time— On the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October I began writing
                            the Lectures which I had promised to deliver this Season— On the 24<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> I delivered the one at Braintree which
                            became an address to the Inhabitants of the Town— I have now prepared
                            one for the Quincy Lyceum, and for the Boston Mechanic Apprentice’s
                            Library Association, and this day begin upon a second, which will
                            consume all the remainder of my time, till my necessary if practicable
                            departure for Washington. This is but a form of wasting time; but I
                            passed it with as much comfort as a man in the 73<hi rend="superscript"

                            and her <persRef ref="hellen-mary">mother</persRef> is in deep anguish.

                                Holbrook</persRef> was here this Morning and spoke to me in doubtful
                            and ambiguous terms of her condition. I can but bow with resignation to
                            the Will of Heaven, and pray that if possible this cup may pass from me—
                            It was a chilly—dull—gloomy day. <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef> preached this morning,
                            from 2. Corinthians 7.1. perfecting holiness in the fear of God. The
                            argument of the discourse was that all virtue is founded upon religion;
                            that there can be no perfect holiness, or righteousness but by the fear
                            of God— This I believe to be true— For independent of the conviction of
                            responsibility hereafter to a just and merciful God, all moral principle
                            resolves itself into selfishness and expediency— For then comes the
                            utilitarian doctrine which is all selfishness, every man’s passions and
                            prejudices persuading him that his own good is always the greatest good
                            of the greatest number— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt dwells so
                            much and so often upon this principle that all righteousness is founded
                            on religion, that it gives a monotonous character to his Sermons— It was
                            yet more evinced by his discourse this afternoon from Luke 17.21. “for
                            behold the kingdom of God is within you.[”] On the 9<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September 1838. he preached both
                            parts of the day on this text, and my approbation of the first part of
                            the discourse was then recorded, with a pause for the sermon of the
                            afternoon. That was what he now repeated, and it did not gain in my
                            estimate by repetition— The spiritual kingdom of Christ is undoubtedly a
                            fundamental tenet of Christianity, but when it has been clearly and
                            explicitly laid down, though it may be often illustrated and commented
                            upon, it should be more frequently be seasoned with variety of discourse
                            upon practical morals—upon scriptural narratives and characters—upon the
                            poetical effusions of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef>— Upon the
                            Loves, the worldly wisdom and the melancholy disappointments of <persRef

                            the prophets—the biographical Memoirs of the Evangelists, and upon the
                            Acts and Epistles of the Apostles— All these furnish abundant materials
                            for variety without losing sight of the essentially spiritual nature of
                            the Christian Religion. I read the 50<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of

                                <persRef ref="spear-william">Deacon Spear</persRef> was here, and
                            brought a plan of the woodlot, at the foot of Penn’s hill, upon which I
                            have concluded to sell the standing wood.— It is laid out
                            into<space/>lots for sale. The Deacon takes no responsibility in
                            recommending the choice of an auctioneer; but he says that <persRef

                            disable him from the vigorous performance of so laborious a duty— That
                            his credit is running low, and he is deeply involved in debt, and
                            greatly embarrassed with a multitude of doubtful speculations. That his
                            reputation for integrity is not altogether unsullied, and for
                            punctuality wholly gone—and he warmly recommended <persRef

                            and of undoubted integrity— He might therefore employ Major Adams.

                            as I had asked the question he must tell me it was a case not without
                            danger.— He could not speak with certainty, and perhaps not yet for
                            eight or ten days—but there was danger— I have long been afflicted with
                            an apprehension that this poor child was destined to short life. There
                            is so much of the angel in her already that she seems all fitted for a

                            trembling heart and with sinking hope, and am sure that the Doctor has
                            none— His postponement of a decisive opinion is only to prepare us for
                            it when it will come.— The trial to myself is excruciating— To the

                            deputed from a literary Society at Waltham, calling themselves the Adams
                            and Rumford association, to request me to deliver a Lecture or Address
                            before them— I could not answer positively— I objected both the state of
                            my health, and the condition of my family; but his solicitations were so
                            earnest and importunate, that I told him, that if he should not hear
                            from me before next Saturday week he might call for me here in a chaise
                            at four O’Clock in the afternoon, and I would go and deliver a Lecture
                            at Waltham, and should wish to be home here the next morning by ten
                            O’Clock in time for the morning service at Meeting; all, which he very
                            readily promised, and I told him that if any thing in the meantime
                            should occur to prevent my coming I will give him notice of it by the
                            mail— I shall try my first Lecture on the Smithsonian bequest here next
                            Wednesday and at Boston the next day— The second will I trust then be
                            finished— If I fail here or at Boston, I will retrench my visit to
                            Waltham. If I succeed but tolerably, I will compress the two Lectures
                            into one, and deliver it at Waltham, and perhaps at Brooklyn— If I can
                            possibly rouse the public mind to take some interest in this foundation,
                            it may save the fund from being utterly wasted and lost; and the more
                            frequently I go before the public upon it, the more chances will there
                            be for connecting public sympathies with it— The experiment is
                            desperate; but with a blessing it may succeed— <persRef

                            were successively taken up— The first whether the contemplated
                            centennial celebration would be a benefit to the rising generation? This
                            question had been raised by <persRef ref="newcomb-george2">George

                            measure which had unexpectedly appeared in Town meeting— But he alone
                            spoke in favour of the celebration. No one spoke against it and the
                            question when taken, had not a single negative voice. The vote against

                            always found my taste for planting nearly extinguished this year it has
                            turned to distaste and aversion.— I can live to see no results from any
                            planting of mine after this date, and there is not a single member of my
                            family who takes any interest in my plantations— At this moment I have
                            no leisure to devote to them if I would, for the Smithsonian Lectures
                            and the Diary absolutely grind me down. I walked this afternoon to

                            sick with a very severe cough and sore throat— She was engaged to be
                            present at the wedding of <persRef ref="miller-hannah2">Miss Hannah, who

                            mother was concealed from her and she was sent off to Medford on the day
                            of the operation, that she might not be disappointed of the pleasure of
                            being at the wedding— This took place on Tuesday evening and Elizabeth
                            was there still ignorant of her mother’s situation— This was made known
                            to her only this day and she hastened home from the house of feasting to
                            a sick chamber and a sick bed— She has been saved however from much
                            distress of mind, and finds her mother much better than she could have
                            anticipated. </p>

                            pressed for time I attended the examination of the central town School
                            kept by <persRef ref="french-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            O’Clock, but I was not there before half past ten— There are now there
                            about 90 scholars male and female in about equal proportions— Their
                            reading writing, (I did not witness the examination in cyphering)
                            parsing, composition, drawing and Geography are all improved since the
                            last year. Many of the Scholars appear to take a warm taste for drawing,
                            especially in water colours.—but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> French
                            says all the drawing is done out of School hours. I have some doubts of
                            the usefulness of their mapping; and think some part of the time they
                            bestow upon that might be more profitably employed in forming a fair
                            handwriting— They have no copper plate copies and the teachers own hand
                            is not exemplary— The examination however taken altogether was
                            creditable, the children orderly and well dressed.— <persRef

                            but when the Bell for Noon rang and the school was to be dismissed they
                            asked me to address the children— There was a short composition of one
                            of the girls under the head of School, urging the duty of diligent
                            attendance to it in all weathers, and remarking that composition was
                            useful though lazy Scholars thought it hard— I read the whole of this
                            composition, commented upon it briefly and commended it, believing that
                            it would afford gratification to the child herself and prove a stimulant
                            to emulation to the whole School. I had barely reached home, when

                            postpone it to another Season— If they should postpone, I could then

                            account, added to it an allowance of 600 dollars for the charges of the
                            administration and a reservation of 984:78 cents for the note from the

                                    rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston</persRef>, and then took my
                            Oath to the account, and also that I had given notice in the Boston
                            Courier three weeks successively of the presenting the account as he had
                            ordered— The day mentioned in the notice was of next Monday the 11<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> but the judge told me there would be no
                            need for me to come again then as his order would be dated as of that
                            day— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller as Administrator of the
                            late Moses Gill, could agree to nothing. He shewed me a Letter from a
                            person named <persRef ref="u">Prentiss</persRef> enquiring if he
                            intended to represent the Estate as insolvent, and averring that he and
                            several other persons had been called upon to pay 11000, which with the
                            interest would amount to 22,000 as sureties on the Bonds of M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Gill.— But there was no pretence that they
                            had paid a single dollar, and I had with me a deed of Covenants between
                                <persRef ref="boylston-ward">Ward N. Boylston</persRef> and Moses

                            108000 dollars in the Supreme Court of the State, Boylston covenants in
                            consideration of Gill’s giving up the Estates of <persRef

                            not to levy execution upon the sureties to his bonds—and accordingly it
                            never was levied on the sureties— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller
                            asked the loan of this paper, promising to return it after having a copy
                            of it made. I left it with him— The annuity Bond of W. N. Boylston to
                            Moses Gill, which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller had written to

                            possession, and he promised to shew it to him— As M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller could come to no compromise about
                            the note to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston, I said I should
                            reserve the Bank shares and await the issue of a suit from M<hi

                            was white and glistening. 30 And behold there talked with him two men,

                            represents Jesus, Moses and Elias as suspended in the air above the
                            hill, for which there is no authority in the text, and which always
                            disgusts me in the picture itself.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Young
                            considers Moses as the representative of the old covenant, and Elias as
                            the representative of all the prophets of that dispensation; and he
                            dwelt largely upon the cloud from which issued the voice— This is my
                            beloved Son— Hear him— It seems to have been a preternatural scene, the
                            object of which was to communicate to the Apostles by indirect
                            intimation not then understood by themselves the superseding from that
                            time of the Law from Sinai, before the light of the gospel. M<hi

                                ref="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>, and his afternoon text
                            was from Romans 12.2. “And be not conformed to this world; but be ye
                            transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove, what is
                            that good and acceptable and perfect will of God”— This was something of
                            a political discourse; and in the exhortations not to be conformed to
                            this world, the preacher inveighed against the extravagant manners of
                            the times, which are indeed very great— He referred to the disordered
                            state of the currency and the delinquency of the banks, but told the
                            people that their own profusion and wastefulness was the cause of their
                            disasters—and so no doubt it is— Prosperity has relaxed the morals of
                            the People— There is no lack of Industry— But there are no poor,—except
                            the infirm and the maimed— Wages are enormously high, and there are no
                            menial servants but foreigners— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Young has
                            attended much to the early history of the Plymouth and Massachusetts

                            divine Providence to visit me upon earth— My hoarseness and sore throat
                            roused me from sleep about 2 this morning— After lying restless and
                            disturbed till four I rose and applied myself to the labours of the

                            Sonnet to the Morning Star, which I saw this morning, according to the
                            American Almanac in her greatest brilliancy— <persRef ref="rice-william"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William Rice</persRef> of
                            Weymouth, and <persRef ref="hardwick-john2">Captain John
                                Hardwick</persRef> were here about a contract for the erection of a

                            Hardwick was interested— It proved that the work was much heavier and
                            more costly than had been anticipated at the making of the contract; but
                            Rice completed it, under encouragement from the <persRef

                            to Congress, by Petition. The case seems to be precisely that of

                            Representatives at the very commencement of the Session— I told him how

                            presented very early in the Session, and he promised to follow my

                            recovery— She has been to me an angel upon earth, and the only
                            consolation that the Mercy of Heaven can bestow for the loss of her will
                            be, that she may be taken away from the evil to come— I cannot survive
                            her long, and may humbly hope to rejoin her in the world of Spirits
                            where there is neither sorrow nor mourning, and where every tear shall
                            be wiped from every eye— This was the day of the annual election of

                            Senators for the County of Plymouth were elected which I do not believe.
                            The cause of this political revolution in the politics of the State, is
                            the 15 gallon license law of April 1838 a temperance blue law, enacted
                            with the best intentions for the preservation and reformation of the

                            press upon me— I finished this day, my second Lecture upon the
                            Smithsonian bequest— But they have been written under the harrow of such
                            distress of mind, that they are unfit to go before the public, and I
                            fear will be found insupportably tedious and dull— I have done scarcely

                            with power in the argument to be maintained before Congress, the

                            that of these Lectures. The arguments against application of the funds
                            to education are the multitudes of such institutions already existing,
                            and the impossibility of equalising its benefits to all the people of
                            the Union—State and Sectional jealousies, and no prospect of any evident

                            Observatory, the history of that of Greenwich, and superadded

                            have had several meetings preparatory to the late election, and have at
                            last formed themselves into whig reading society to meet weekly during
                            the winter for the purpose of political information. That they appointed
                            him a committee to procure a whig paper from Washington during the

                            something more than the two dollars would be required— Halifax is one of
                            the Towns disaffected to the Administration of the State and this throws
                            them at once into the arms of the federal administration— The fifteen

                            5 dollars a day to the volunteer company militia men, touches the
                            purse—and these two ill-judged measures have revolutionized the State—

                            remonstrance, and almost without notice, and they are now suffering the

                            recovery— Prepare us oh God for our trials, and for resignation to thy
                            will— At 7. O’Clock this Evening I walked to the Town Hall, and though
                            labouring under great hoarseness, and a hacking cough delivered the
                            first of my two lectures on the Smithsonian bequest, which took me one
                            hour and twenty minutes— The hall was crowded to its utmost
                            capacity—with two or three women to one man— The attention of the
                            auditory was well sustained, though parts of the discourse were
                            evidently tiresome— A resolution of thanks was adopted with a request to
                            me to deliver the second Lecture this day week, and the Lyceum was
                            adjourned to next Wednesday Evening, at half past six O’Clock— I rode
                            home, shortly before the Evening bell, and retired to bed with a cup of

                            Quincy with a copy of certain proceedings of delegates from the towns of
                            Scituate, Marshfield, Hanover Hanson and Pembroke, last February,
                            petitioning Congress for a new survey of the North river with a view to
                            removing obstructions and opening a canal for the improvement of the
                            Navigation— They sent their petition to <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
                                >Daniel Webster</persRef> to be presented to the Senate, and sent
                            none to the House—perhaps because it was in substance a Counter petition
                            to the one that I had presented from Scituate, which was before the
                            Committee of Commerce of the House. Nothing was done at the last Session
                            with either and it is apparent that if the two petitions are brought
                            into conflict with each other at the approaching Session; nothing will
                            then be done— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Luther Rogers jun<hi

                            Scituate of the same impression with that given me by <persRef

                            Scituate and the adjoining towns, which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Rogers said was more accurate— He said they had heard of my visit to
                            Scituate, and viewing that harbour, and the adjoining beach and course
                            of the North river, and they would be glad if I could again go, and view
                            the position of Marshfield. I expressed my regret that this would be
                            impossible before the approaching Session for which it would be
                            necessary for me to take my departure the week after next and he said
                            they had forborne to send me an invitation, under the expectation that I
                            should not be able to come— I said if they proposed to petition again
                            they would do well to forward two copies of it, one to the Senate and
                            the other to the House of Representatives— <persRef ref="holbrook-amos"

                                Moore</persRef> at Waltham, to notify him that I cannot come there
                            to-morrow evening to deliver a Lecture, as I had conditionally promised—
                            The speaking of the last two Evenings has aggravated my Catarrhal
                            fluxion which is returning upon me: but my decisive motive was that the
                            condition of my family to morrow evening will be such as probably to
                            forbid my leaving home for the Night— After breakfast I read cursorily
                                <persRef ref="smith-adam">Adam Smith’s</persRef> fragment of a
                            summary history of Astronomy, with that feeling so strong in reading a
                            good book, and so seldom realized, that I must return to it again— I had
                            read this before— It is a rapid sketch of astronomical theories, from
                                <persRef ref="pythagoras">Pythagoras</persRef> and <persRef

                            admiration; which he defines and discriminates.— There is another source
                            of astronomical and all other theories more powerful than
                            these—Curiosity—the thirst for knowledge— The thread of the labyrinth
                            from effect to cause— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith says that the
                            great majority of mankind, never throughout their whole lives take any
                            notice of the movements of the stars at all— Then they can scarcely move
                            either wonder, surprize or admiration—but as the eye cannot look to
                            Heaven without seeing them, the moment the human being exercises the
                            faculty of thought upon what he sees—the what and the wherefore, the why
                            and the when rush to his mind and he theorises. I cannot now pursue this

                            have known that I lectured last Evening—but I gave her a ticket for the

                            they were not altogether satisfactory— The grants of lands to
                            individuals are very numerous—and as early as 3. December 1636. there
                            was a Committee of the Governor and 7 others to see to the ripening of
                            the business of a Town and Church at the Mount— On my return to

                                <persRef ref="adams-charles2">My Son</persRef> came out from Boston,

                            dinner. She had passed the night watching with Fanny. I wrote a note to
                            the lecture Committee of the Hamilton literary Society at Brooklyn, Long
                            Island, declining their invitation to deliver a Lecture before them— And
                            I answered a Letter from Brigadier <persRef ref="kingsbury-fisher"

                            fore-river— I presented these petitions to the House on the 18<hi

                            the Committee of Commerce, and there slept— Kingsbury is a demagogue
                            lawyer, and the mud of Weymouth fore river is part of his political
                            stock in trade; together with Anti-Masonry, Abolition, the Militia, and
                            the Post-Office and last and most of all Democracy— In all this his
                            first care is for himself, I never to my knowledge saw the man, but he
                            has been very officious in correspondence with me about the Post-Office
                            and abolition.— But last winter he sent some abolition Petitions to
                                <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Caleb Cushing</persRef>, telling him
                            that my abolition constituents had lost their confidence in me— This
                            bustling busy body’s democracy has made him already a Brigadier General,
                            and with all his abolitionism <persRef ref="kendall-amos">Amos
                                Kendall</persRef> has just given him the Post Office at Weymouth— It
                            is a curious symptomatic fact, how many of these raving abolitionists,
                            abuse and vilify me in public and consult me, and court my opinions in
                            private correspondence. Darling virtues like favourite children breed
                            injustice to the rest of the family. <persRef ref="capen-robert">M<hi

                            them.— I told him that I owned neither of those books myself; but I lent
                            him <persRef ref="farmer-hugh">Farmer’s</persRef> works in four Volumes

                            in the books. <persRef ref="turner-peter">Peter Turner</persRef> came to

                            cheering my Soul, too much oppressed with sorrow and fear to take

                            not in himself; it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.” The
                            object of the Discourse was to shew the error of a common adage that man
                            is the creature of circumstances, and it proved that it ought not to be
                            so—that it is not always so. That principle should always, and sometimes

                            must place himself, before he could obtain admittance to it— But Oh!
                            blessed God! we must resign this child— We must suffer her to go unto
                            Jesus—and not forbid— Receive her to thy kingdom in Heaven; and be thou
                            the God of her widowed mother to sustain her in this sore trial and

                            other than that life might yet linger with her a few days— I told D<hi

                            from bed, I had staggered as if but half awake— That I had felt
                            top-heavy without pain or sickness the whole day— That I had taken a
                            Seidlitz powder this morning, but had yet some swimming in the brain— He
                            said the Seidlitz powder was not drastic enough, and advised a warm
                            foot-bath, and calomel or Castor Oil— I did not tell the Doctor of my

                            or alarm to my wife postponed his remedies. M<hi rend="superscript"

                            had never charged my memory with the date but I remembered that it was
                            the earliest entry on <persRef ref="adams-john">my fathers</persRef>
                            diary minutes— He began with them at Worcester 1. Jan<hi

                            folded into 16. pages. The year begins on the right hand page of the
                                2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> leaf but at the top of the left hand
                            page is an entry apparently made at Worcester of the Earthquake which on
                            the 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of November 1755—had awaked him
                            from sleep, and for the space of 4 minutes made the house shake and
                            crack as if it was coming to pieces— He says—I was then at <persRef
                                ref="adams-john4">my fathers</persRef> house—and adds that it shook
                            down seven chimnies in the town of Braintree— It probably suggested to
                            him the idea of minuting events in the form of a Journal; which floated
                            in his mind till the beginning of the next year.— I looked up this

                            neighbourhood, and said he should write to me concerning one of them—
                                <persRef ref="turner-peter">Peter Turner</persRef>, paid me the 55

                            which had struck him, which upon attempting to repeat to <persRef

                            always a little more than a man has got— That’s it, said he—why did not
                            I remember it— But I did remember the saying of <persRef

                            appropriate, and soothing to my own feelings— From 9 to 10 O’Clock this
                            evening I forced myself to pass an hour by the bedside of this suffering
                            Seraph as she seemed to me to be— Her sufferings were not acute, but in
                            her beseeching and moaning helplessness they wrung my soul— Nether my

                            hour of her birth I addressed a prayer to God for her worldly and
                            eternal welfare— That she might be blessed with a long life of
                            prosperity usefulness and virtue. That prayer has not been all denied—
                            She has been upwards of nine years one of the chief delight of the lives
                            of both her Grandparents—of her father while he lived, and of her
                            widowed and now disconsolate mother— I had engaged to deliver the second
                            Lecture on the Smithsonian bequest this Evening at the Quincy Lyceum.
                            Last evening, I gave the Lecture to <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi

                            promised— This morning, the child seemed likely to continue several days
                            longer. I called on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt and as the
                            Lyceum was adjourned to half past 6. I desired him to take the lecture
                            with him, and wait till 7— If the child should be so that I could
                            attend, I would come and deliver the Lecture myself. But if I should not
                            be there at 7. I wished him to read it. <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi

                            of death. They were terrible, but I can speak of them only in general
                            terms— For two long hours and more I witnessed this struggle of pure and
                            spotless infancy with the king of terrors— Doctor Bigelow who had
                            foreseen what was coming had given me repeated and most emphatic
                            assurances that whatever convulsive appearances there might be there
                            would be no suffering of pain; that all consciousness was departed, and
                            all sensibility extinct— But when I saw and heard, I could not believe
                            him such tortur’d spasms, such shrieking groans Oh! was it possible they
                            should be without feeling. Oh! my God! I could only fall upon my knees,
                            and uniting my voice with that of my wife implore thy mercy upon the
                            expiring angel and upon us.— At a quarter past five the heaviest agony
                            was over—the breathing was short and quick the moaning low and
                            indistinct— I went into the other to endeavour to sooth and compose the
                            mother scarcely less agonized than the child— At ten minutes before six
                            Miss Cutts came in. The mother exclaimed she’s gone! Miss Cutts hung her
                            head in silence, and the Mother burst into a flood of tears.—</p>

                            be premature— Charles took with him to Boston the four volumes lent me

                            sanctified to them— I asked him for a copy of his prayer yesterday at
                            the funeral of the dear child, which deeply affected her <persRef ref="hellen-mary">mother</persRef>. She
                            expressed to me the wish for a copy of it, and M<hi rend="superscript"

                            copy of it— My dear wife was confined the whole day to her bed. <persRef
                                ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came out from Boston—attended
                            the morning and afternoon service, and then returned to Boston, taking

                            Meeting and preached from Ezekiel 2.9. [“]And when I looked, behold an
                            hand was sent unto me: and lo, a roll of a book was therein— 3.1.
                            Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest, eat this
                            roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel. 2. So I opened my Mouth,
                            and he caused me to eat that roll”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt
                            remarked upon the modes of figurative language customary in diffent ages
                            of the world; and explained the purport of the injunction upon the
                            prophet to imbibe the principles of the roll, so as to make them a part
                            of his own substance— He read my note, and prayed fervently as it
                            requested— <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            appropriate to the occasion; without direct allusion to our heavy
                            calamity— The closing hymn of the service was the 215<hi

                        <p>As we were returning from Meeting yesterday morning there was a light
                            sprinkling of rain with the wind at Southeast and a warm atmosphere— It
                            continued and increased all the remainder of the day, came to a heavy
                            gale of wind before Night— Tempestuous the whole Night and all this day
                            till about half an hour before Sunset when the dark curtain rose from
                            the Western Horizon— The rainbow formed its brilliant Arch over the
                            Eastern waters, and the Sun went down serene and calm, as if to cheer us
                            even in his departure— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
                            did not come out from Boston. My <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"
                                >wife</persRef> was barely able to leave her bed; and under a
                            depression which divine mercy alone can relieve I began making
                            preparations for my departure for Washington— As the sky was clearing
                            off, <persRef ref="spear-william">Deacon Spear</persRef> came in with an
                            account of the sale last Thursday of the wood standing in the grove at
                            the foot of Penn’s hill; amounting to 1232 dollars and 50 cents yet to
                            be collected, and greatly needed— The Banks of New-York and Boston
                            persevere in the ostensible payment of specie relying only upon the
                            forbearance of their creditors to demand it, and forbearing to press
                            upon their debtors— But as they decline almost all discounts, debtors to
                            others plead for time, till the banks shall discount, and the suspension
                            of payments, and of the collection of debts is almost universal— Shortly
                            after Sunset I walked over the hill to <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunts</persRef> and returned to him
                            the Christian Register which he had lent me. He gave me a copy of the
                            prayer which he made at the funeral on Saturday, and I gave it to
                                <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> who had requested it— He
                            gave me also a Letter from his father <persRef ref="lunt-henry">Henry
                                Lunt</persRef> to him concerning a claim to prize money in behalf of

                            she took the Serapis—with the Letter there is a declaration of Henry

                                >Moses Davenport</persRef> of Newbury Port declaratory of the fact
                            that Henry Lunt the elder was a Lieutenant in the Bonhomme Richard.
                            These papers I am to remember at Washington— After I returned home

                            He had borrowed, my first Lecture on the Smithsonian bequest expressing
                            a wish to take a copy of my report of January 1836.— He now returned me
                            the manuscript, and shewed me a copy of the whole Lecture, made as he
                            assured me, by his daughter <persRef ref="adams-sarah2">Sarah

                            our journey to Washington and then went immediately into Boston— Just
                            before reaching the free-bridge I met Charles and <persRef

                        <p>The vacant space can only be filled in Heaven— Departure from home for
                            long distances of time and space is always a bitter draught for me— This
                            time it was the wormwood and the gall— The memory of the past weeks, and
                            the prospect of the coming months were clouded with sorrow and gloom.
                            There were many anxieties in the journey itself before me, and
                            forebodings of nothing good to follow— The conscious Sentiment of my own
                            utter helplessness, oppresses me by day and haunts me by Night, for
                            which my only resource is to frequent and fervent and importunate prayer
                            to the being who has hither to preserved my life, and crowned it with
                            unnumbered blessings; forever blessed be his name!— My Son left his
                            horse and chaise in charge of <persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirk</persRef>,
                            and accompanied us into Boston— We came to the Rail-way depot a quarter
                            before 3. a full hour too soon. At 3. a train of Cars started for
                            Providence with Passengers who were to take the Steamer Narragansett
                            there and go round Point Judith.— There was yet an hour of waiting
                            during which, I walked to <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi

                            their father saw us off.— At 4 we started, and as we whirled along by
                            the blue hills a beautiful Sunset in the opposite direction, after a
                            cloudy day, and followed by a deepening crimson twilight, cheered me as
                            with an auspicious omen, which I hailed with grateful joy.— We reached
                            Stonington about 9. P.M and embarked in the Steamer Narragansett— But
                                <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> was quite

                        <p>After we embarked last Evening in the Steamer Narragansett at Stonington,
                            she was detained about an hour at the wharf, taking in freight, and
                            waiting for a tide— Going out of the harbour, the boat grounded which
                            detained us some time longer— The night was blustering, and the wind
                            directly ahead. The Cabin was over-heated and I slept not a wink— After
                            lying in wait three or four hours for a doze, I abridged the remnant of
                            time till half past 4. by ruminating an autograph for <persRef

                            daylight, but the boat had got into smooth water.— Between 9 and 10 in
                            the morning, we landed at New-York, and went to the City Hotel— <persRef

                            severe sick head ache— At 7 O’Clock this morning the boat for Amboy had
                            gone, and that line for Philadelphia runs only once a day. At 9 the
                            morning Cars on the Trenton railroad had departed, and our alternative
                            was to go in the afternoon train or remain in New-York till to-morrow
                            Morning— My business required that I should be at Philadelphia in the
                            early part of the day to-morrow. I advised my wife to remain with part
                            of the family till the morning and let me proceed with the remainder
                            this afternoon— After some hesitation she concluded to go on, all
                            together— Before dinner I walked round some of the Streets, first alone
                            and then with <persRef ref="cutts-mary">Miss Cutts</persRef>— We viewed
                            the new Marble Custom-house, and the new Quincy granite Exchange in

                            feet long pillars, which we had seen drawn by 70 oxen and 10 horses past
                            our house at Quincy.— They are not yet raised to their position in the
                            building. We passed round the whole quarter, where the conflagration of
                            1835. 17. December had swept away twenty millions of dollars worth of

                            before; but the shops and Stores were all closed, it being Thanksgiving
                            day here as well as in Massachusetts.— We passed through the battery
                            where were gangs of boys taking their pastime at Cricket—returning to

                            unremitted attendance— At a quarter before 5 we crossed the ferry to

                            without leaving my seat, except to change Cars at the Trenton Bridge was
                            tedious enough— About half past 11. we came to the depot in Market

                            and Frenchtown have ceased, and the only travel from Philadelphia to
                            Baltimore now, is by the Railway— At 8 O’Clock this morning we departed
                            from the depot N. 368. Market Street in the Cars, with horses for about
                            4 miles—then exchanged for the locomotive— <persRef

                            very tedious, and a miserable exchange for the alternate steam boats and
                            cars down the Delaware river and Chesapeake Bay. The country on the road
                            is very uninteresting; particularly, at this Season of the year— Our
                            progress was this day unusually slow, and it was 3 in the afternoon when
                            we reached the depot at Baltimore— There is a Hotel there opened on the
                            opposite side of the Street, where we found a dinner on the table,
                            spread to receive us.— After dinner, a <persRef ref="u">M<hi

                            had been about two months in this Country, and proposed to go shortly to
                            Washington to hear the debates in Congress— And he gave me his card— The

                            and two other gentlemen came in to give me a greeting— I understood they
                            were a deputation from the City Council, or some other body of whigs to
                            pay this compliment to <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            they volunteered the same to me, which I suppose they thought they could
                            hardly help; but in which I take no delight. I found M<hi

                            was in another Car of the same train— There was a crowd of idle gazers
                            round the Car, to look at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and they
                            delayed the departure of the train nearly half an hour after their
                            appointed time which was 4. O’Clock— The passage to Washington was thus
                            nearly all benighted; but we reached the depot at the foot of the
                            Capitol hill about half past six in the Evening.— <persRef
