								>Gulliver’s</persRef> Brook Square— Examined Oaks, black, white and

								ref="olivet-pierre">D’Olivet</persRef>— This work is addressed like

								>Marcus Brutus</persRef>—and like all the philosophical Treatises
							begins with an apology for writing upon the subject at all. Then follows

								ref="cotta-gaius">Caius Cotta</persRef>; to which he invites
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> during the Fariae
							Latini— There he meets <persRef ref="velleius-gaius">Velleius</persRef>
							an Epicurean, and <persRef ref="balbus-quintus">Cornelius
								Balbus</persRef> a Stoic; both Senators— In this first book Velleius
							adopts the opinions of <persRef ref="epicurus">Epicurus</persRef>
							concerning the Nature of the Gods, and gives historically an account of
							the Speculations of all the Greek philosophers upon this question— From
								<persRef ref="thales">Thales of Miletus</persRef>; the first of the
							Greeks who reasoned high on this topic, down to <persRef ref="carneades"
								>Carneades</persRef>, the last of the originating Greek
							Philosophers. Velleius states successively all the Greek theories
							concerning the Gods; shews the absurdity of them all, and then extols
							Epicurus as the great discoverer of truth, and liberator from the errors
							of superstition. He is answered by Cotta the Academician, who without
							very forcibly sustaining the other philosophers, abundantly shews the
							absurdity of the Epicurean Creed. The moon rose this evening totally
							eclipsed— About 2 hours passing off.</p>

							afterwards did, came to enquire if I would sell about 50 acres of my
							land at Weston for 9 dollars an acre— I told him I had only a Life
							interest in the Estate; but the owners of the remainder would perhaps
							join in the conveyance if a suitable price should be offered for the
							land— That I should however not consider an offer of one thousand
							dollars for the 50 Acres as acceptable— This morning I worked two full
							hours in my Nursery, the sole bodily exercise of the day, chiefly
							employed in digging trenches for planting my seeds— At the centre of my
							enclosure there seems to be a rock under the surface— In two or <pb
								n="536" type="ms"/>three places it appears even above the surface;
							and in digging the Spade turns up nothing but gravel, and loose Stones
							of various sizes— On this ground all the trees that came up from seeds
							or stones which I planted, have perished the second or third winter
							after planting; but some of the thriftiest trees are in the immediate
							neighbourhood. The finest of our forest trees grow on rocky and stony
							ground, and where their roots have room to creep between the Stones,
							they are supported and perhaps protected from vermine by them. I am
							digging a trench from this Centre over the Stony-barren up to the
							Nursery gate— It is divided by young horse chesnuts at intervals, and I
							renew the experiment of raising trees from the seed on this ground— I
							dig the trench nearly a foot deep— Fill it about half up with rich mould
							from the garden— Then plant a row of peach and plum stones— Of Apple and
							Pear seeds; with Basswood seeds, year steeped huckleberries, Willow and
							Water Oak acorns and Ash pods—cover them all with another Spade full of
							rich Garden mould and cover the whole with the gravelly earth first dug
							from the trench— I began this work this morning; and it will take me ten
							days to get up to the fence— Of the Stones that I dig up some split in
							layers like Slates— Made a temporary deposit of the small Stone marked
							Alteri Seculo, by the young growing red Oak in the Nursery; the only Oak
							of my planting which survives in that enclosure: and which if it lives,
							I intend shall stand where it now is— This is the first anniversary of

							“Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you, of the
								<unclear>common</unclear> salvation, it was needful for me to write
							unto you, and exhort you, that ye should earnestly contend for the faith
							which was once delivered unto the Saints,” and in the afternoon from
							Isaiah 1.17. [“]Learn to do well[”]—both discourses were ingenious, well
							written and closely reason—defensive of Unitarianism and argumentative
							against the Calvinistic doctrines of election and the five points— In
							replying to the objection that the Unitarians profess none of the
							important doctrines of Christianity he enumerated, the belief of one
							omnipotent God the creator and Governor of the Universe—the immortality
							of the Soul, and a future state of retribution— The divine mission of
							Jesus Christ, the acknowledgment of his authority, and of his
							mediatorial character as the redeemer of the world, and the admitted
							obligation of conforming to the moral precepts promulgated by him <pb
								n="537" type="ms"/>all of which he considered as highly important.—
							From his short text of the afternoon “Learn to do well,” he deduced an
							inference against the doctrine of total depravity of man—for to do well
							he observed comprized the whole sum of human duties; and the injunction
							of the prophet to learn to do well, necessarily implied the capacity of
							man to acquire the practice of doing well. It necessarily implied that
							man might learn to do well if he would, and that virtue or transgression
							are voluntary— It were an absurd command, to learn that which the
							scholar has not the capacity to learn, and worse than idle waste of
							words in the prophet to give the instruction, knowing that he who
							received it had no power to carry it into effect. D<hi

								Degrand</persRef> went into Boston this morning with <persRef

								<persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> one of my

							Cattle, to drive into Rhode-Island for Sale— He told me he had sold
							between one and two hundred head in the last fortnight— He borrows from
							the Bank to make his capital— I continued my planting in the Nursery,
							pursuing my experiments on the Stony-barren— There was room for
							remarking upon the formation of the Stones and rocks under the Surface—
							I overfatigued myself— Youth may acquire hardihood by hard labour; but
							it suits not the infirmity of old Age— I resumed the assortment of
								<persRef key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> papers, and found
							that this will prove another laborious task— I shall divide his
							correspondence Alphabetically, and Chronologically, but cannot get
							through with it before the winter— My attention was arrested by a number
							of Letters received by my father in the years 1780 and 1781 from a
								<persRef ref="digges-thomas">correspondent</persRef> in England, who
							dates every Letter from a different place, subscribes several fictitious
							names, Church, Ross and Russell, and addresses the Letters to a
							fictitious Spanish name at Amsterdam— I found Letters from <persRef
								ref="adams-samuel">Samuel Adams</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="cooper-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cooper</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="dalton-tristram">T. Dalton</persRef>, <persRef

							these Letters repays the trouble of reading it— Scarcely one deserved to
							be kept— They are neither lively, nor ingenious, nor indicative of mind
							in the writer— There is some pompous inanity in the Letters of M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Warren— Much mortified pride— Jealousy
							and Envy of <persRef ref="hancock-john">Hancock</persRef>—rankling
							discontent at her own situation, and with constant professions of ardent
							friendship a querulous tone of remark, and perpetual ebullitions of
							Spleen, at the contrast between the Cottage and the Court, Milton Hill,
							and the Palaces of Versailles and S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							James’s. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Warren was a woman of uncommon

							to Medford. Charles went to Boston, and came back to dine. My Nursery
							labours were interrupted, and the rain forced me to take refuge in the
							house. I planted on one division of the Stony-barren, alternate peach
							and Plum stones; with Apple and Bass wood seeds—first partly filling the
							trench with mould from the Garden— Annual meeting of the proprietors of
							Neponset Bridge— I dined with them at Squantum— The road for a quarter
							of a mile was overflowed by the tide— <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas"
								>Thomas Greenleaf</persRef>
							<persRef ref="beale-george">G. W. Beale</persRef>, and Edward Miller,
							were the only proprietors there—<persRef key="adams-thomas">my

							brother in Law <persRef ref="spooner-william3">Spooner</persRef> were
							also there. The place was dreary with a stubborn North easter, and we
							adjourned soon after five. I finished reading the second Book de Natura
							Deorum— The whole book is occupied by <persRef ref="balbus-quintus"
								>Lucilius Balbus</persRef>, with an exposition of the Stoic
							doctrines concerning the Gods— His disquisition is in four parts— 1. to
							prove their existence. 2. what they are. 3. That the world is governed
							by them. 4. That they take interest in human affairs— The proof of the
							existence of the Gods is in the first sixteen Sections—and is by no
							means logical— The only rational argument for the existence of an
							intelligent creative power, is the creation itself— We everywhere see
							means adapted to ends.— Intelligence invisible in act—visible in effect,
							is stamped upon all creation— We find a watch—we infer the watchmaker,
							because we know the watch could not make itself, and must have had a
							beginning—but here our evidence stops— By whom or how or when the watch
							was made, we have nothing to shew— The agent is impenetrably concealed.
							There may be one; there may be myriads— The Stoics inferred that there
							were Gods; but as in all the works of creation there is unity of action,
							it would have been more philosophical to infer unity of the agent— But
							the Stoics with this natural evidence mingled up the absurdest
							traditions, and Balbus immediately passes to the fables about <persRef
								ref="castor-deity">Castor</persRef> and <persRef ref="pollux"
								>Pollux</persRef>, augury, the flight of birds and the feeding of
							Chickens— When he takes up his second point, he makes Gods of the Sun,
							moon and planets—the courses of which he describes— Next he deifies
							certain moral properties—such as Faith—the Mind—Virtue—Help, Safety,
							Concord, Victory—Love, Pleasure and all the Passions— Then distinguished
							men after death: atmospherical phenomena, Earth, Air and Water— These
							airy nothings extend to the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section—
							The rest of the Book argues the Government of the Gods, from the
							description of the Constellations, and the natural history of Beasts and
							Birds— That in all this there is a constant adaptation of cause to
							effect, Balbus considers as proof that it is all under the Government of
							the Gods—the whole substance of the argument is embraced in a quotation,
							Section 37. from <persRef ref="aristotle">Aristotle</persRef>— There are
							five Sections from 40 to 44. of extracts from <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> translation of the
							Astronomical Poem of <persRef ref="aratus-poet">Aratus</persRef>—and
							from Section 56 to the end, the Providence of the Gods is manifested in
							human concerns, by the corporial and mental organization of man— All
								<persRef ref="paley-william">Paley’s</persRef> Natural Theology is
							here included.</p>

						<p>Third day in succession, of rain; which continued all the morning, and
							held up about Noon. <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> left us after
							dinner to visit <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Brooks</persRef> at Medford. There they propose to stay
							about a fortnight, and then to return to their own house at Boston for
							the winter. I made a short visit to my Nursery: the ground was too wet
							for working. <persRef key="adams-thomas">My brother</persRef> was here
							at noon, and his Sons <persRef ref="adams-john3">John Quincy</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph Harrod</persRef> in the Evening.
							John is to return to his school at Exeter to-morrow. <persRef
								ref="turner-peter">Peter Turner</persRef> was also here this
							Evening— I rode towards Evening with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="gulliver-anthony">Gullliver’s</persRef> Brook, and across to
							the Neponset Bridge Road. My Son <persRef key="adams-john2"
								>John’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="hellen-mary">wife</persRef> was unwell and dined in her
							chamber, but came down to tea— She was soon after taken seriously ill,
							and <persRef ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Holbrook</persRef> was sent for before Midnight— I finished reading
							the third and last Book of Cicero de Natura Deorum; with <persRef
								ref="olivet-pierre">D’Olivet’s</persRef> Translation— A great part
							of it is lost, and a mere fragment remains— In this Book <persRef
								ref="cotta-gaius">Cotta</persRef> the Academician, contests the
							opinions set forth in the preceding Book by <persRef
								ref="balbus-quintus">Balbus</persRef> the Stoic, concerning the
							Nature of the Gods—their superintending Providence, and their Government
							of the World, and interference in human Affairs— Cotta was a member of
							the College of Augurs; and Balbus at the close of his discourse reminds
							him of his official obligation to defend the honour, and maintain the
							Power of the Gods— Cotta begins by acknowledging all this, and by
							declaring that in the discharge of his official duties, he always had
							and always should inflexibly adhere to the established Religion of his
							Country— That he shall therefore neither deny the existence of the Gods,
							nor their Providence, nor the share which they take in human affairs—
							But that now, in a philosophical disquisition, he considers only the
							positions assumed and the arguments urged by Balbus, to none of which he
							can yield his assent— He then attacks the whole theology of the Stoics—
							Without denying the existence of the Gods, he shews that the Mythology
							of Balbus is utterly absurd. That human Passions and human Virtues and
							Vices, cannot belong to divine Natures— That of all the principle
							deities there were several bearing the same name— That to deify, human
							properties and passions was absurd, and that the Gods evidently take no
							concern in the affairs <unclear>of</unclear> Mankind— The whole
							objection to the existence of evil is pressed with great energy, but
							almost all this part of the dialogue has perished— There is reason to
							believe that the Christians who preserved the works of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>, were willing that his argument
							against divine Providence should not be preserved in all its energy. He
							concludes the book by observing that after the dialogue was finished,
								<persRef ref="velleius-gaius">Velleius</persRef> the Epicurean
							thought that Cotta had the best of the argument; but that he himself
							inclined to award the palm of victory to Balbus— In this decision there
							is apparently more of discretion than of sincerity. </p>

						<p>My health has improved, and my labour in the garden and nursery gives me
							sufficient exercise: perhaps they may teach me the lesson of moderation.
							I planted this morning an alternate row of Peach and Plum-stones, at the
							central division of the Nursery on the West side: with Apple and
							Bass-wood seeds, black Currants, and one fox grape. This was the spot
							where in 1827 a row of English Oak Acorns was planted; which came up
							well, but perished the first winter— There is little but stones and
							gravel for soil— I now planted my seeds and Stones, between two layers
							of Garden Mould which I transferred from the Garden to the Trench—
							Gathered the last Horse Plums; three only upon a tree which had been
							neglected— They ripen from the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							August to the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of September.— <persRef
								ref="hardwick-george">George Hardwick</persRef> was here and I
							promised to call and look at the house in which he lives next Monday—
								<persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Spear</persRef> brought a third load of
							Oak-wood; and asked me to go to Mount Wollaston, and select a spot for
							an Orchard this afternoon, which I did. Rode down with my Son <persRef
								key="adams-john2">John</persRef>, and inspected the three Acres of
							Salt marsh which Spear purchased for me last Winter. Ascertained its
							boundaries; and viewed a fine grove of Oaks, Black White and Grey, and
							of spurious Shag-bark Walnuts— Few Acorns; no true Shagbarks, and
							numberless Multitudes of Musquitoes. I determined on taking up for the
							Orchard a Pasture at the South side of Mount Wollaston itself, which
							Spear is to stake out and prepare for ploughing up— I had a Letter from
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, who says that
								<persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brooks</persRef> recommends that the Trees to be planted for an
							Orchard, should be taken up in the Autumn, kept over winter and planted
							in the Spring— This is the new system of <persRef ref="phinney-elias"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Phinney</persRef>, who has
							promulgated it by a paper in the New-England Farmer. Spear shewed me a
							place, where he thinks the tide will make a breach into the adjoining
							land, and spoil his Spring of water if not diked out— Also his Spring
							which he has surrounded with willows; which he wishes also to do with
							the <pb n="541" type="ms"/>Spring behind his house— I viewed also the
							place where Henry Hardwick wishes to purchase about a quarter of an Acre
							adjoining a lot of one Acre which he now owns— But this one Acre
							belonged originally to my farm, and was cabbaged out of it many years
							ago; no one now knows how or when— Evening unoccupied.</p>

						<p>Visited the Nursery— The vegetation is beginning to decay— The Horse

									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holbrook</persRef> was here this

							Waltham; from Philippians 4:4 “Rejoice in The Lord alway”—and from John
							14.2. “In my father’s House, are many mansions: if it were not so, I
							would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 3. And if I go and
							prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself;
							that where I am, there ye may be also.” The argument upon the morning
							text reminded me of much that I have been recently reading in <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>—particularly in the Treatise de
							Finibus and the Tusculans. The doctrine of the Stoics was Rejoice
							always— In pain, in poverty, in affliction in Death, we are still to
							rejoice— So say the Stoics— So says, more doubtingly Cicero—and so says
								<persRef ref="paul">Saint Paul</persRef>. But for this Conquest over
							the weakness of the flesh, the Greek Philosophers gave no preceptive
							means— They said it was the reward of wisdom— The attribute of the wise
							man— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitman says that the means of
							fulfilling the precept, given by the Apostle are furnished by the
							Religion which he preached— That the Christian religion alone, teaches
							and enables us to rejoice always; and that is true—but <persRef
								ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef> as truly says there
							was never yet Philosopher, who could endure the toothache patiently; and
							sincere and ardent Christians may be more successful in learning

						<p>I planted the last row of Peach and Plum stones, Apple-seeds, whole Pears

							taken out many large stones to the depth of a foot or more under ground
							from this border— One this day required the aid of a Crow bar to bring
							it up; and I have supplied their places in the trenches with manure of
							mould from the garden— I place some of these large Stones round the
							roots of the young peach trees as an experiment to protect them from the
							worms— Steeped a quantity of fox grapes in a bottle of New-England Rum—
							Had a morning visit from <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph

								key="adams-john2">John</persRef> rode with him to the Railway. I
							went with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> and <persRef ref="smith-louisa"
								>Louisa</persRef> to Weymouth— In the evening I finished the first
							and began the second book of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef> de Divinatione— One of the most amusing, though
							not the most philosophical of his writings. The primary position of the
							book is, that divination is a reality and not a mere creature of
							imagination or an imposture— Cicero was not willing to maintain this
							position himself and has therefore assigned the task to his brother
								<persRef ref="cicero-quintus">Quintus</persRef>; who professes
							sincerely to believe in divination. Of this he contends there are two
							kinds—one natural; the other artificial. The natural a prophetic
							delirium or frenzy, like that of <persRef ref="cassandra"
								>Cassandra</persRef>— The other taught scientifically— An Art
							practiced by Augur’s and Aruspices—and of which the indications were in
							the flight of birds, the feeding of chickens and the entrails of
							sacrificed victims— The first of his arguments is that the question of
							divination is in fact the question of the existence of Gods, or of their
							taking an interest in human Affairs— To deny the one, he insists is to
							deny the other— For if there be Gods, and they take any concern in the
							affairs of men, they necessarily must give occasional <pb n="542"
								type="ms"/>preintimations of their will to those who enjoy their
							favour. His second argument is derived from the testimony of all
							nations, universally concurring in the assertion of predictions
							verified; and finally he repeats with a gravity consummately ludicrous,
							all the absurd and silly tales, which the Greeks and Romans had heaped
							up in the course of seven or eight centuries, all of which he declares
							himself fully to believe— He admits that vaticination is very often at
							fault, and that the event almost always gives the lie to the prophecy;
							but this he thinks furnishes no decisive objection to the art, any more
							than the fatal termination of diseases disproves the art or skill of the
							physician. If the prediction is sometimes fulfilled that sufficiently
							demonstrates the art of divination— He quotes verses from his brothers
							translation of <persRef ref="aratus-poet">Aratus</persRef>, and from the
							Latin Poets, <persRef ref="ennius-quintus">Ennius</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="accius-lucius">Accius</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="pacuvius-marcus">Pacuvius</persRef>— The subject becomes too
							ridiculous when he attempts to establish a natural connection between
							the course of Events, and the chickens, the birds, the male crow at the
							right hand, and the female at the left, and the entrails of slaughtered
							oxen— Returning from Weymouth I stopped at the foot of Penn’s Hill and
							discussed with <persRef ref="hardwick-joseph">Joseph Hardwick</persRef>
							the repairs necessary upon the old family mansion. Another neighbour
							called on me to repair the partition fence of the Quincy Meadow, and I
							met <persRef ref="spear-daniel">Deacon Spear</persRef>, whom I requested
							to call upon me to make arrangements for the repair of the old House,
							and for the Sale of wood in standing lots—</p>

						<p>After a very heavy rain in the Night, this day was fair and warm—
								<persRef key="adams-thomas">My brother</persRef> was here; and spoke
							of leasing the Penny-ferry Saltmarsh— It was his birth day, and he
							completed his fifty eighth year. I planted a row of peaches, cherries,
							plum-stones, Apple seeds and Pear Cores at different depths at the
							entrance of the Nursery, Westward from the Alley to the Apple tree near
							the Wall. That the young trees, may have the shade of the tree for
							protection, from the Sun— I found worms at the roots of several of my
							peach trees. The best preserved is that which I surrounded last Summer
							with Stones. <persRef ref="farrar-salmon">Farrar</persRef> killed the

							are not given by <persRef ref="michaux-francois">Michaux</persRef>— One
							is the spurious Shell-bark; a nut half way between that and the pignut—
							There is a wood of Buttons, Walnuts and Junipers growing spontaneously

							promising to be more so. I found some of the Walnuts fallen from the
							Trees; but all the Pignuts which I brought home, floated in water, and
							the nuts were withered or unsound. I propose to plant numbers of the
							Shellbark, and of the pignuts separately; to observe whether they will
							each produce its kind— I gathered two Pears of the wild stock, which
							remained on the tree. There I propose also to plant— And I gathered
							berries of a tree unknown to me— The wild cherries on the large tree are
							not yet ripe— I had received an invitation from the Committee of
							Arrangements for the second Centennial celebration of the settlement of

							from the Boston road to the bathing wharf; which for this Season I had

							to which I consented— I received this day a Notice from the Committee of

							had also a Letter from <persRef ref="persico-luigi">Luigi

						<p>Second centennial celebration of the Settlement of Boston— I went to the
							City, taking my brother’s Son <persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph
								Harrod</persRef> with me— Called first at <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> Office, but he passed the
							day at Medford. I stopped at my old friend <persRef ref="hall-joseph"
								>Joseph Hall’s</persRef>— <persRef ref="hall-sarah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hall</persRef> is dangerously ill,
							with a pulmonary disease. At nine I went to the Senate Chamber in the
							State-House, where the City Government and others were assembled for the
							procession— <persRef ref="sullivan-william2">General William
								Sullivan</persRef> was the Chief Marshal of the day— He and the
							Mayor <persRef ref="otis-harrison">H. G. Otis</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="perkins-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> T. H.
								Perkins</persRef> came and offered me their hands, and their
							salutation was accepted— Numbers of others of my old acquaintance were
							more cordial. A place had been assigned to me by name in the processions
							and two of the Marshals were assigned to me, for an escort. The
							procession moved about ten; passed through the Common, down Tremont
							Court, and State Streets to the head of long wharf, then returned
							through State Street, and the old Cornhill, to the Old South Meeting
							House where after a Prayer by the Minister of the Church <persRef
								ref="wisner-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wisner</persRef>, and the 100<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm
							partly sung by a large choir to the tune of Old Hundred, an Oration was
							delivered by <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">Josiah Quincy</persRef>,
							President of Harvard University, worthy of the subject and received with
							universal approbation. There was then performed to the tune of God save
							the King an Hymn by <persRef ref="pierpont-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pierpont</persRef>— And precisely at the moment when
							they were singing as part of a Stanza [“]Ye temples, that to God, Rise
							where our fathers trod, Guard well your trust,” a bench broke down, a
							Panic seized many of the persons in the western upper gallery, that it
							was giving way, and there was a momentary alarm and great rush to the
							door, but it subsided without injury to any one— The Choir resumed their
							hymn— It was followed by a Poem, delivered by <persRef
								ref="sprague-charles">Charles Sprague</persRef>— Very short, and not
							very good. In irregular verse, poorly spoken, and containing more about
							Indian Savages, and the recent Revolution in France and <persRef
								ref="lafayette">General La Fayette</persRef>, than about the
							Settlement of Boston, or the Pilgrim Fathers— After <persRef
								ref="handel-george">Handel’s</persRef> Hallelujah Chorus, the
							Benediction was pronounced by <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham</persRef>; Minister of the

							dispersed— I went with <persRef ref="silsbee-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Silsbee</persRef> to the Tremont
							House: and dined with him at the Lady’s common Table. <persRef ref="u">His daughter</persRef> was

							dinner <persRef ref="derby-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Richard Derby</persRef> came, sat down at the Table— Refused to
							drink wine and then took a glass alone; asked Crowninshield for a pinch
							of snuff, and then sent to the barroom for a little snuff in a paper,
							and told how <persRef ref="humphreys-anne">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Humphreys</persRef> had at the age of 55 thrown herself
							and a fortune of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars away upon a
							Polish Waterloo Colonel, and spurious <persRef ref="walewski-etienne"
								>Count Walawsky</persRef>. I soon withdrew, and called at <persRef
								ref="dexter-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Dexter’s</persRef> house, but she was gone to Pittsfield. I thence
							went and passed an hour at <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> James H. Foster’s</persRef>. Viewed
							the fireworks in the Common, and made a short appearance at <persRef
								ref="winthrop-thomas">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Governor Thomas L Winthrop’s</persRef>
							Evening party, where I met again some of the persons I had seen in the

							from South Carolina in Congress; <persRef ref="krehmer-george">M<hi

							Legation, Everetts, Bulfinch’s, Coolidge’s, Crowninshield’s, Silsbee’s,
							and <pb n="545" type="ms"/>some whom I did not know. There was
							lamentation upon the issue of the recent elections in the State of
							Maine, and exultation at that in the City of Charleston S. Carolina a
							damper to the nullification doctrine— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Winthrop’s <persRef ref="u">Son</persRef> asked me to select a Lady to lead in to supper, but I
							excused myself from the necessity of returning to Quincy this Evening. I
							took up <persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph</persRef> at his Uncle
								<persRef ref="foster-phineas">Phineas Foster’s</persRef>— The Town
							Clock struck ten, as we were driving through the Streets, and at a
							quarter past eleven we got home— Joseph remains here for the Night—
								<persRef ref="richardson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Joseph Richardson</persRef>, the Representative in Congress from
							Plymouth District, of which Quincy forms a part, and <persRef
								ref="davis-john3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John B.

							relating to the Negotiation of the Treaty with the Porte: I thought best

							Congress; I told him I had nothing to say about it— Ten or twelve days
							since appeared in the Boston Courier a paragraph, proposing that the
							People of the Plymouth District should elect me as their Representative
							to the next Congress— As the <persRef ref="buckingham-joseph"
								>Editor</persRef> of the Paper has been uniformly hostile to me, I
							supposed this nomination was made with the same Spirit, and did not
							imagine it was seriously thought of by any one— It was to this

						<p>There was a frost last Night, and the Thermometer in my Library was this
							morning at 50. The Sun raised it in the course of the day to 60, but
							towards Evening it fell again— I prepared for making a fire, but make a
							point of postponing it till the day of the Equinox— After breakfast I
							took two hours of labour in my Nursery, and planted my Stony barren row
							under the western Wall— The spot is the best sheltered from the frigid
							Northwest winds of any part of the enclosure; but is exposed to the Sun
							and to the East winds— I planted whole Pears; 4. Woodhouse Apples,
							Fox-grapes, cherries, Mazzard and wild—one Peach-Plum stones and Ash
							pods; at different depths, one between two layers of mould from the
							garden, the other on the top of the second— I was called in to the house
							to <persRef ref="davis-john3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John B.
								Davis</persRef>, who came to make inquiries concerning the character
							of <persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Connell</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis has an
							interest in a claim upon the French Government, of those which Connell
							is endeavouring to obtain from the Claimants an authority to the
							Government of the United States to settle by compromise. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis that with regard to the expediency
							of giving the authority for the Settlement, I had nothing to say; but I
							could give unqualified testimony to the character of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell, both for capacity and integrity—
							While Davis was here, <persRef ref="richardson-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Richardson</persRef> came; and Davis
							said he had seen in the newspaper that he declined a re-election to the
							next Congress. He said it was a determination long since taken by him—
							That he thought it due to the people of his Congregation at Hingham; who
							had been exceedingly reluctant at his going even to the present
							Congress; and he said he came purposely to inquire of me, if I would
							serve, if elected as a member for the District. I said I had observed in
							a paper, the <persRef ref="buckingham-joseph">Editor</persRef> of which
							without any cause known to me, had invariably been hostile to me, a
							nomination to that effect, about ten days since— From whom the
							nomination came I knew not; but had believed it made, in no friendly
							Spirit towards me.— I had not supposed it serious; or that any person
							had a thought of holding me up for that election— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Richardson said that if I would serve he
							believed the election could be carried; by a large majority—as the Old
							Colony Memorial and the Hingham Gazette the only Newspapers printed in
							the District, and another paper published in the adjoining District, and
							taken by some of his <pb n="546" type="ms"/>constituents, would support
							the nomination—but if I should decline, it was not probable that the
							District would unite upon any other person, and there would be no
							election. He then said he thought that the service in the House of
							Representatives of an Ex-President of the United States instead of
							degrading the individual, would elevate the Representative Character— I
							said I had in that respect no scruple whatever— No person could be
							degraded by serving the People as a Representative in Congress— Nor in
							my opinion would an Ex-President of the United States be degraded by
							serving as a Selectman of his town if elected thereto by the People— But
							age and infirmity had their privileges and their disqualifications. I
							had not the slightest desire to be elected to Congress—and could not
							consent to be a candidate for Election— I knew not how the Election
							would turn; and if chosen it might depend upon Circumstances whether I
							should deem it my duty to serve or to decline— The state of my
							health—the degree of opposition to the choice, the character of the
							candidate in opposition might each or all contribute to my
							determination— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richardson said this was
							sufficient and he would go to work. He desired M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Davis to consider as secret and confidential what had passed
							here, which he promised— After dinner I rode with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> to the Milliner’s at
							Weymouth— Saw there <persRef ref="pratt-matthew">Matthew
							Pratt</persRef>, an old man who formerly lived several years on <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> place at the foot of Penn’s
							Hill— Gathered a few Acorns from a White Oak Tree on the summit of
							Penn’s Hill—which I propose to plant, and call Cap white Oak— Evening so
							cold that I could not write.</p>

						</list>
						<p>Short visit to my Garden and Nursery. Heard <persRef ref="flint-jacob"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Flint</persRef> of Cohasset,
							morning, from Psalm 66.13— I will pay thee my vows, 14. Which my lips
							have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble— Afternoon
							from Proverbs 22.6. “Train up a Child in the way he should go; and when
							he is old, he will not depart from it.” Two most impressive texts—the
							latter so often handled as to have become a common place— The former
							seldom noticed, but containing a moral lesson, not less important— The
							obligation of Christians to perform the promises and fulfil the
							Resolutions made when in trouble is a copious subject for introduction
							and reproof. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Flint treated it with plain
							good sense, but his elocution is so languid and drawling that it does
							great injustice to his composition. His afternoon discourse, upon the
							education of children might have been improved by the perusal of
								<persRef ref="tillotson-john">Tillotson’s</persRef> Sermons on the
							same Subject. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Flint dined with us. After
							the second Service, I rode with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> over Milton Hill into Dorchester, returning by the
							upper bridge over the Neponset— I could not write in my chamber; and
							read in the dining room below, where we had a fire. I finished reading
							the second Book de Divinatione— It is occupied entirely by <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Marcus Cicero</persRef> himself, who declares
							his total disbelief in Divination: and refutes the Arguments and
							ridicules the authorities, and examples cited by <persRef
								ref="cicero-quintus">Quintus</persRef> in favour of it— He
							cautiously disclaimed any intention to interfere with the Religion of
							the Country— He therefore agrees and urges that the Auguries and
							Aruspications should be continued; for the preservation and prosperity
							of the Republic— But he says as they are alone, and as the principles of
							the Academic philosophy which he approved were rather to raise than
							absolve doubts; he assures him that he believes nothing in Divination—
							He takes the whole discourse of Quintus to pieces, rejects with scorn
							the idea, that the entrails of beasts the flight of birds or the feeding
							of chickens should have any connection whatever with the Fortunes of
							individuals, <pb n="547" type="ms"/>and argues with great acuteness and
							irresistible cogency against the possibility of any positive foresight
							of Events— He leaves nothing for human reason to reply— In the 30<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section he gives an extract of about 30
							lines from <persRef ref="homer">Homers</persRef> Iliad, in Latin
							Hexameter verse of his own composition— They are from the second Book of
							the Iliad V. 299–333. and in <persRef ref="pope-alexander"
								>Pope’s</persRef> Translation V. 364–397.— In the 56<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section he cites the double meaning
							Oracles, delivered to <persRef ref="croesus">Croesus</persRef>, and to
								<persRef ref="pyrrhus">Pyrrhus</persRef>: and in the 58<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> he remarks that there is no absurdity so
							great but it has been affirmed by some philosopher— I read also three
							Sections of the Book de Fato—</p>

						<p><persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> at 51 this morning. Frosts at Night— The Sun raised the
							Thermometer in the course of the day to 60; but in the Evening it fell
							again to 55— We have fire in the dining room but I make none yet in my
							Library— I warmed myself after breakfast by spading in the Nursery— My
							ground is too narrow for my projects of plantation— I plucked up the
							stalks of my twenty hills of Missouri Corn, eaten up by the ground
							Squirrels, and commenced a trench from the lower part of the Nursery to
							the old Apple-tree near the centre— I was called in to <persRef
								ref="spear-daniel">Deacon Spear</persRef>, and therefore planted
							nothing this day. I consulted with the Deacon, about leasing for the
							next year, my Penn’s valley houses and Lands— We looked over the plans,
							and he advised me to lease the houses with small parcels of land
							separately and the lots by themselves— I determined to have the valley
							farm resurveyed to ascertain whether a mistake was made by <persRef
								ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Humphreys</persRef> in his Survey of last year: and to divide it
							into small lots for leasing— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spear said
							he should see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphreys in two or three
							days, and would ask him to call upon me— <persRef ref="hardwick-henry"
								>Henry Hardwick</persRef> came to ask again about the quarter of an
							Acre of Saltmarsh, at the Mount Wollaston farm which he wished to
							purchase of me— I told him I had seen it, but could not conveniently
							dispose of it— I rode this afternoon with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> to Weymouth— As we
							were returning, stopp’d at the White Oak tree in Goose pasture at the
							summit of Penn’s Hill— Gathered about fifty of the Acorns, which are
							ripe— I went into the lot, to see if it might be broken up for a
							plantation of Oaks—but it is almost all Rock. It will scarcely bear
							trees— Yet I found in it a Rock Chesnut Oak, from which I picked three
							fine Acorns, not ripe. While we were out <persRef ref="hall-david">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> D. A. Hall</persRef> of Washington,
							and <persRef ref="bulfinch-george">George S. Bulfinch</persRef> called

							as Cook, and <persRef ref="spear-lucretia">Lucretia Spear</persRef>, as
							Nursery Maid for <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Louisa</persRef>. Unable to
							write, for the cold, I passed the Evening in the dining-room—finished
							reading the Book de Fato, and read five Sections of the first de
							Legibus— The book de Fato is a fragment; the subject is a sequel to the
							Treatise upon divination, but is separated altogether from it— In the
							Book de Fato, <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> himself is
							the expounder, at the request of <persRef ref="hirtius-aulus"
								>Hirtius</persRef>, then designated Consul; who had come to the
							Puteolan Villa, to consult with Cicero upon public affairs after the
							Death of <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Julius Caesar</persRef>: and who
							desired to enliven the gloomy topic of political contention, by the
							discussion of philosophical enquiries— The inextricable tangle of Fate
							and Free-will, perplexes Cicero as it must every thinking mind to the
							end of Time— The Stoics were Fatalists. the Academics and Cicero with
							them insisted upon the Freedom of the Will; and he urges with energy
							that fatalism takes away all discrimination between virtue and
							vice—right and wrong.</p>

							me with importunity to let him have so much of my land as would supply
							his lot with an inexhaustible spring of water, of which he has none— He

							Monday. The Deacon spoke of the Election for the House of
							Representatives to come on the first Monday in November, and asked me if
							I considered myself an Inhabitant of Quincy. I said certainly— If not an
							inhabitant of Quincy, I was an inhabitant of no where— He said that was
							all he wished to know: but he nevertheless did give some further hints,
							that there were persons very desirous of electing me to Congress, and
							others equally anxious to prevent it. He said the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> men would do every thing to
							defeat the choice, and that they included all the most violent men of
							both the parties; federal and democratic— He said there would be a
							District Convention soon to fix upon the person to be chosen— That he
							had formerly attended those Meetings; but it was rather hard for Quincy
							to have to send so far— I asked how it happened that Quincy had been
							cast into the Plymouth District for Elections to Congress— He said he
							attributed it to <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Thomas Greenleaf</persRef> who was in the Council when
							the thing was done; and the object of it was to make Plymouth a

						<p>The weather has moderated almost to the temperature of Summer. I wake in
							the morning at three and rise before four—to little purpose. Spaded over
							the Corn patch, where the 20 hills were devoured by the ground
							Squirrels. <persRef ref="farrar-salmon">S. Farrar</persRef> has shot
							three of them, fat as feasted Capons, and there are others now devouring
							the Cabbages— I dug one trench from West to East, and planted a row from
							the Stony-barren centre to the pumice young Apple trees—with Cap white
							Oak Acorns, Apple-seeds, Ashpods: wild cherries, Horse Chesnuts, Peaches
							and Stones, Pear-seeds and Cores, and the unknown berries. <persRef
								key="adams-thomas">My brother</persRef> and his daughter <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail2">Abby</persRef> were here— He mentioned that
								<persRef ref="gay-peyton">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peyton
								Gay</persRef> had changed his plan of settling in the West; and now
							proposed going to France and requested a Letter of Introduction from me
							to <persRef ref="lafayette">General La Fayette</persRef>. My brother had
							also a Letter from his Son <persRef ref="adams-thomas2"
							>Thomas</persRef>, and I had one with an Order on the Cashier of U.S.
							Branch Bank Boston, for 3000 dollars which he wishes me to invest for
							him in funds yielding interest— The Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							is ordered with his company to a station on the Cherokee Lands in the
							State of Georgia. Abby dined with us— I received visits from <persRef

								Hutchinson</persRef> Consul of the United States at Lisbon,
							accompanied by a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Morse</persRef>— <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus
								Spear</persRef> came to request me to go to the Mount Wollaston
							farm, this afternoon which I did— I fixed for an Orchard upon a spot
							adjoining the garden, Westward of the House—on the Southern side of the
							Mount. There are 23. Rods or 379 1/2 feet in a line between the garden
							fence and a rail-fence now there at the road, in which there is however
							an Angle— We measured 540 feet from South to North, from the Road along
							the line of the Garden fence as it stands, then the same distance from
							East to West to the standing rail-fence— Then the same measure along the
							rail fence from North to South to the road—but there is what Spear calls
							a heater piece on the western line as well as upon the road— I then made
							my Estimates with Spear and <persRef ref="spear-lemuel">his
								brother</persRef> who is a more acute accountant— Three sides of
							rail fence to make 32 3/4 Rods each 146 Posts 580 Rails— They earnestly
							recommended Chesnut Posts instead of Cedar, as lasting much longer, and
							they had a lot of <unclear>Chesnut</unclear> Posts stuck in the Salt
							marsh water, for seasoning; which they thought they could let me
							have—price from 20 to 25 Cents a Post— The rails cost 6 dollars a
							hundred— The Spears advise that the trees should be planted 2 rods or 33
							feet apart—16 trees in the long line, 224 trees in the whole— I
							inspected also the ridge of Mount Wollaston with a wish to cover it with
							fine Oaks; and a fear that it will prove impracticable— Passed the
							Evening in my chamber, writing and reading.</p>

						<p>Summer heat— The Sun expelled me from the Nursery, an hour before my

							Shell bark Walnut. 1. Rock Chesnut Oak Acorn—Apple-seeds, Pear Cores;
							Peaches and Stones. Ashpods, and 1 grape— The maturity of my seeds
							outstrips my preparation of ground— On the Evening when I gathered my
							Cap White Oak Acorns, I dropped them into a tumbler of Water, and they
							all sank like lead— The next Morning I took them out of the Water, and
							without <pb n="550" type="ms"/>wiping them, put them into a broken
							footed Rhenish wine glass. This morning I found four or five of them had
							sprouted— I planted two of them in one of my Summer-house cellar blue
							boxes; and one in the other— In the course of the day a number more of

							a Note by him to <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>. Walked
							across the Hills observing the maturation of Shellbarks, pignuts and the
							unknown berry; of all which I gathered a few.— The Shellbarks are so

								<persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter

							as it certainly would be— I said I could not answer it myself— To say

							People of the District in Season to enable them to agree upon another

						<p>Heavy Rain in the Night and all this morning till noon, after which it
							subsided. I rode to Meeting this Morning. Heard <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney</persRef>; from Isaiah 57.20. [“]But the wicked are like the
							troubled Sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt—
							21. There is no Peace, saith my God, to the wicked.” The necessary and
							inevitable connection between wickedness and punishment, is the doctrine
							of this text—a Sound and salutary doctrine— Sermon very short— The
							afternoon text was from Ephesians 6.13. “Wherefore take unto you the
							whole armour of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day,
							and having done all, to stand.”— Before the afternoon service, my Son
								<persRef key="adams-john2">John’s</persRef> infant daughter was
							baptised by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney by the name of
								<persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Georgiana Frances</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Nowland</persRef> held the Child as
							Nurse, and the father being absent, I presented it for baptism— The
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">Grandmother</persRef> was also
							present, but the <persRef ref="hellen-mary">mother</persRef> not
							sufficiently recovered to leave her chamber— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Nowland and my dear wife left the house and returned home
							immediately after the Christening. <persRef ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Quincy</persRef> was here this
							Evening— <persRef ref="adams-mary4">John’s eldest child</persRef> has a
							sore throat, and ulcerated mouth, and is apparently breeding two double
							teeth—distressingly ill this Evening— I read 15 Sections of the first
							Book de Officiis— The books de Legibus are incomplete, and were probably
							left unfinished by their author— In the philosophical Treatises he has
							taken <persRef ref="plato">Plato</persRef> for his model, and after
							composing a work de Republica followed it up by a proposed philosophical
							dissertation upon Laws. It is in the form of a Dialogue between <persRef
								ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>, <persRef ref="cicero-quintus"
								>Quintus Cicero</persRef> and <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Marcus</persRef> himself. There is no preamble, as there is to all
							the other philosophical works, but the Dialogue commences abruptly by a
							remark of Atticus, supposed to be walking with the two Cicero’s in a
							grove at Arpinum— Atticus points to an Oak, which he thinks the same
							which had been noticed by Cicero in a Poem upon <persRef
								ref="marius-marcus">Marius</persRef>— Whether this form of
							introducing the subject was intentional, or whether the Proem was to
							have been prefixed, when the work should be completed is uncertain, but
							the introductions to the other philosophical works are all so much
							alike, that this <unclear>entrament</unclear> once upon the main theme
							of the discourse, forms a pleasing variety more acceptable to present
							readers, than would have been another lamentation upon the ruin of the
							Republic, and another narrative of the authors passion for philosophical
							disquisitions— In the conversation preceding the subject of the
							dialogue, Quintus urges his brother to write a History, upon which
							Marcus observes that it would require more preparation and leisure time
							than he has worked to bestow, and he adds some judicious remarks upon
							the principles applicable to the composition of History. Atticus then
							intimates a wish to hear his friend discourse upon <hi rend="italic"
								>Law</hi>; to which he assents, and declares it a subject worthy of
							the highest powers of human contemplation—for be assured, says he, that
							there is no topic of discourse among men, better suited to display the
							natural attributes of man, the extent and excellence of his mental
							powers, the ends and purposes of pursuit and action for which we were
							born, the causes and objects of human association, from which the
							fountain of Laws, and of their Administration is to be discovered. <pb
								n="552" type="ms"/>This is the foundation of the subsequent
							Discourse; the first Book of which consists of general Considerations
							upon the nature of Law, as the result of the utmost energies of wisdom:
							and ultimately terminating in the operation of divine wisdom—the
							authority which commands or forbids human Action— The second book treats
							of the Laws and Ministers of religion, and the third of those relating
							to the Magistracy, and to the Administration of the Government— At the
							close of this he promises to take up in the next Book the Law of
							Natures, and the proper Roman Law— The Assassin Ruffians of <persRef

								Humphreys</persRef> the Surveyor from Weymouth came at 8 this
							morning, and we resurveyed the Penn’s Valley Farm; the survey of the

							contained in <persRef key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> deed to me
							of August 1803. and of the previous conveyances to him— We now undertook
							to mark separately 1. The lot of 9 1/2 or 10 Acres, conveyed to <persRef
								ref="adams-john4">my Grandfather</persRef> by <persRef
								ref="billings-john;billings-richard">Billings</persRef> in 1744. and
							given in my Grandfather’s will to my father. 2. The Homestead of 35
							Acres, given by my Grandfather’s Will to my Uncle <persRef
								ref="adams-peter">Peter B. Adams</persRef>, and by him conveyed to
							my father in 1774. 3. The lot of 46. Acres, conveyed by <persRef
								ref="veasey-william;veasey-sarah">W and S. Vesey</persRef> to my
							father in February 1788. And 4. The lot of 7. Acres conveyed by <persRef
								ref="babcock-moses;babcock-hulda">Moses and Huldah Babcock</persRef>
							to my father 2. May 1783. These four parcels constitute the Estate,
							included in one survey last year.— I supposed until this day that there
							was included in it also 16 1/2 Acres. conveyed in April 1762 by <persRef
								ref="belcher-nathaniel">Nathaniel Belcher</persRef> to my father, my
							uncle Peter and <persRef ref="field-joseph2">Joseph Field</persRef>; but

							South of Joseph Field’s land adjoining mine— <persRef ref="field-joseph"
								>Joseph Field</persRef>, now 81 years of age, and son of the man to
							whom the joint conveyance was made, now shewed me other papers,
							connected with this transaction; among which a Quit-claim deed, dated
							11. April 1764—from my father, and my uncle Peter, of 5 1/2 Acres of the
							16 1/2 to Joseph Field his father— This explanation reduces the possible
							error of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphreys’s last year’s survey
							to about 7. Acres; precisely the quantity of the grant from the
							Babcock’s— In this day’s Survey, <persRef ref="spear-william">William

								<persRef ref="spear-daniel">Deacon Daniel Spear</persRef> joined us

							fresh meadows adjoining upon <persRef ref="adams-ebenezer;adams-josiah"
								>Ebenezer and Josiah Adams</persRef>: the water being so high after
							the heavy rain of yesterday that the passages were nearly impracticable—
							I gathered about a pint of Acorns of Black, White, and Chesnut Oaks, in
							what I call the Druid Plains behind the Old Brook— The White Oak Acorns
							are ripe—many fallen, and some sprouting on the Tree— The Chesnut Oak
							Acorns are ripening and the black still unripe— The finest white are
							from an old tree which was already a large one when I was a boy, and
							which is one of the first objects of my remembrance. I shall call them
							therefore Druid, and mark the Acorns which I shall plant from them, for
							experiment. There are upon the Babcock lot many scrub grown Oaks, kept
							down by the cropping of the cattle. And there are some dying and dead
							Oaks which it will be proper for me to have cut down, and brought home
							for fuel— We dined, sitting down upon Stones in a Corner of <persRef
								ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field’s</persRef> yard, and finished about
							five in the afternoon— I agreed with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Humphreys to commence the Survey of Mount Wollaston this day fortnight,
							if the weather should be fair— I picked up also four or five wild pears
							for seed on the Druid plain, and Farrar gathered me some fox grapes. I
							walked home over the Stony-field Hill— Found the Shellbark Walnuts near
							the Old Trask house, already mostly <pb n="553" type="ms"/>carried off—
							I gathered some ashpods from the tree. I have taken them at different

							before coming up, and because our winter frosts strike deeper than in
							England— I threw in at a ventures several buttons from the button wood
							tree— Marked the cap white Oaks with stake and Stone, and planted in
							like manner a sinking pig nut between the Book boxes 1. and 2. in the
							garden. The two black Oak worms, which I took from the tree on the 16<hi

							fed with black oak leaves, since yesterday cast off their Caterpillar
							skins, and have turned to grubs. This afternoon <persRef
								ref="hitchcock-edward">Professor Hitchcock</persRef> employed by the
							Legislature to examine the Geology of the territory of the State, to aid
							in the composition of a map of the Commonwealth, called here with a
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes</persRef>
							from Boston, and made some enquiries respecting the extent of the Slate
							Quarries in the Town of Quincy which I was not altogether able to
							answer— Such information as I possessed I gave him; and he walked with
							me over upon Stony field hill, and examined the Rocks and Stones which
							abound upon it— <persRef ref="krehmer-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Krehmer</persRef> came out with my Son Charles, this

								ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Greenleaf</persRef> spent an hour of the Evening with me— He knew as
							little about the Slate quarries as I did; and we agreed to go together
							in a short time and see them— We spoke of the Plan of the 8. Acre lot,
							made by <persRef ref="fuller-stephen2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fuller</persRef> and which has been adopted by the Town— And also of
							the expediency of having a classical school established in the Town as
							soon as possible— The town has received within the last year a severe
							check in the removal to Sandy-bay of a considerable number of the
							Stone-Cutters— A number of houses has been evacuated, and the population
							of the Town has decreased— The prospect is that this will prove a
							permanent loss to the Town, and will have an inauspicious influence upon
							all improvement within it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf
							mentioned also the subject of the approaching Congressional election,
							and expressed the opinion that I have no justifiable cause for
							declining— I took 3 Shellbarks from the garden tree— Their ripeness
							appears from the easy opening of the drupe—</p>

									>r</hi> Holbrook</persRef> early— The Disease of the Child is
							Canker in the Mouth and throat: She suffers less in the day time than in
							the Night. This was a day of military training and review at the Bridge
							point; and of excessive bustle round the whole neighbourhood— A
							continual stream of Gigs, Carryall, Stages, and waggons, rattled over
							the roads to and fro, from 5 this morning till ten at Night. Planted in
							the Nursery a row of Druid Chesnut Oak Acorns, with stake and Stone,
							alternating with Horse Chesnuts and Shellbarks— In the line above them,
							Beech Stones from Medford, brought yesterday by <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>. Pear Cores and Apple seeds.
							Began a new Trench, from the middle old Appletree towards the Gate.
							After dinner I walked over the Hill— Gathered a few of the Stranger
							Berries, which are not yet ripe, and a few Ashpods which are dry— I
							found the Trask Shellbark trees which were half stripp’d of their Nuts
							on Monday wholly disburthened of them now— A few at the tops of the
							trees, too high to be reached are all that remain. The day was
							uninterrupted, excepting by anxieties for the child, and I wrote
							accordingly—</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> Like that of July and August,

							of <persRef ref="buchanan-robert">Robert C. Buchanan</persRef>—that of
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">Charles’s wife</persRef>, with him;
							and the Confinement of <persRef ref="hellen-mary">John’s wife</persRef>,
							have reduced the social Circle of the family to its two heads— Sea
							bathing has ceased, and I am to be thankful that my Catarrhal cough has
							almost left me— I continue to take sudorific exercise, of which my
							garden Nursery, and my seed planting hobby furnish me the means— It has
							had a good effect upon my health, and scarcely a day passes; but I
							labour from two to three hours with the spade and the hoe, and deposit
							some seed nut or stone in the ground, with the hope that it may
							re-appear as a plant, next Spring. My series of experiments is neither
							scientific; nor perhaps judicious, but the thought that the result of
							them may be useful hereafter to others sustains me in pursuing them— The
							reflection which most weighs with me is that if it had commenced in my
							youth, and steadily persevered into this time, I should now be reaping a
							harvest of abundant fruits, and enjoying perhaps the shade of a lofty
							forest— That which might now have been mine, may with the blessing of
							Heaven be the comfort of <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna;adams-mary4">my
								Grandchildren</persRef> the next Century; and if there be to the
							all-seeing eye, and the all controuling Will, presumption in the wish,
							there yet may be other future human beings, whose enjoyments will be
							increased by my plantations— In the mean time, graver things are
							neglected, and I lead a life of idleness— I read the Bible— Illustrative
							fragments appended to the English Translation of <persRef
								ref="calmet-augustin">Calmet’s</persRef> Dictionary; and the works
							of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>. With these last I am
							drawing to a close, and yet ask myself what benefit I have derived from
							a persevering study of ten Months, and which will extend to a full year—
							This diary is the last of my persevering pursuits; and it absorbs large
							portions of my time— I am now closing a volume with the intention of
							beginning upon another to-morrow— There are large interruptions during
							the period while I was in the Administration of the Government— Some of
							them are supplied in other volumes— Some never can be supplied— A Diary
							of detail can not be kept by a public man, whose time slips away from
							the discharge even of many important duties— Since my retirement mine
							has been regularly kept, but it has been a record of crude thoughts, and
							of Events calamitous or trifling— With a Soul full of gratitude to the
							giver of all good gifts, for blessings yet enjoyed, and in humble
							supplication for those yet suited to my wants, I pray for Prudence,
							Temperance, Fortitude, Justice, and Christian Charity, for a still
							merciful Creator, for purification of heart for energy of purpose, for
							resignation to his will, and I shut the book.</p>
