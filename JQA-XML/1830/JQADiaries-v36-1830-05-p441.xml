						<p>Shortened my Morning walk, to return in time to see the Sun rise from the

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett</persRef> called and visited
							me— <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Johnson</persRef> and <persRef key="frye-carolina">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frye</persRef> were here. After
							dinner, <persRef ref="tudor-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Tudor</persRef> who is my next door neighbour sent, a request to me
							to come to her, which I did, and found her and her daughter <persRef
								ref="stewart-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Stewart</persRef> in great distress— She gave me to read, a Letter
							from <persRef ref="wright-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wright</persRef> Consul of the United States at Rio de Janeiro to
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren</persRef>, Secretary of State, dated 13. March, announcing the
							decease on the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of that Month of <persRef
								ref="tudor-william2">William Tudor</persRef>, Charge d’Affaires at
							the Court of Brazil: M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor’s oldest Son.
							The old Lady was composed, and conversed with full self possession. M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stewart was bewailing bitterly their
							misfortune, and could not be comforted— <persRef ref="stewart-delia2"
								>Her daughter</persRef>, a girl of about fourteen, was shewing her
							every possible filial attention— I sat with them about half an hour, and
							said what I could to sooth them— Their loss is irreparable; and the
							Country has lost an upright, able, and faithful public servant— M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stewart asked me to write a biographical
							notice of him for publication, of which I promised to consider— He was
							the Son of <persRef ref="tudor-william">William Tudor</persRef>, one of
								<persRef key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> pupils and
							throughout life, a kind and affectionate friend— He was born at Boston
							in 1777—graduated at Cambridge in 1796. Sometime a member of the
							Legislature of Massachusetts—appointed by <persRef key="monroe-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef> 9. Dec<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1823. Consul for Lima, and the Ports of
							Peru—and by me in 1827. Charge d’Affaires at Rio de Janeiro— He was one
							of the very few persons, whom upon my own favourable opinion, I brought
							into the public Service, in distinguished Office, and who by his
							Services more than answered my expectations— He negotiated an excellent
							Treaty of Commerce with Brazil; and obtained indemnity for numerous
							injuries committed by Brazilian Officers during their War with Buenos
							Ayres, which had been much aggravated by the rashness and intemperance
							of <persRef ref="raguet-condy">Condy Raguet</persRef>, another of my own
							appointments; but one whose folly, ruined himself and disgraced as far
							as he could disgrace me; and who of course returns my unmerited kindness
							by base ingratitude. He brought this Country and Brazil to the very
							verge of War—raved and stormed with the Brazilian Government, till he
							had left himself nothing else to do; and then without authority demanded
							his Passports and came home. Tudor was a perfect contrast with him in
							character. His temper was conciliatory, his manners pleasing—his
							deportment respectful; he healed the breaches between the two
							governments, and succeeded completely in his Mission— The <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">present Administration</persRef> did not remove
							him, and I had hoped he would yet have rendered more important Services
							to his Country— It has been otherwise disposed—my duty is acquiescence,
							and perhaps to perform a last act of friendship to this worthy man; and
							of kindness to his aged and afflicted mother— I took and Evening ride
							with <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef>— The <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">child</persRef> quite unwell—and disqualifying
							Summer here.</p>

						<p>Heard a Stranger at <persRef ref="campbell-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Campbell’s</persRef> Church from Hebrews. 7.1. “For this
								<persRef ref="melchizedek">Melchisedec</persRef>, king of Salem,
							priest of the most High God, who met <persRef ref="abraham"
								>Abraham</persRef>, returning from the slaughter of the kings, and
							blessed him; 2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first
							being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King
							of Salem, which is, King of Peace; 3. Without father, without mother,
							without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but
							made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually”— The
							preacher gave some account of the diversities of opinion which have
							prevailed—first concerning the author of this Epistle. <persRef
								ref="barnabas">Barnabas</persRef>
							<persRef ref="luke">Luke</persRef>, or <persRef ref="paul"
								>Paul</persRef>—but said a Dissertation recently published by a
							Countryman of our own <pb n="442" type="ms"/>had proved nearly beyond
							dispute that Paul was the author; and so I had supposed it had been
							always considered by all, excepting for purposes of controversy—secondly
							to whom the Epistle was written— This I had not heard questioned before.
							It is extraordinary that there is nothing on the face of the Letter
							expressly declaring either who was the writer, or to whom it was
							written—and in this respect it differs from all the other Epistles of
							the New Testament— Some reasons were suggested why the apostle should
							have chosen to conceal himself, because the design of the Letter was to
							make converts from the Hebrew faith, and the knowledge of the author
							might have predisposed the Jews against him. The principal subject of
							the Discourse however was the character of Melchisedec—first mentioned
							in the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of Genesis— Then in the
								110<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Psalm and lastly in the 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Chapter of this Epistle to the Hebrews— Melchizedek, was king of
							Salem—he was the priest of the most high God—he blessed Abraham who gave
							him Tythes— The Levitical Law, declared the children of Israel to be
							Gods chosen people: and the priesthood was confined to the family of
								<persRef ref="levi">Levi</persRef>— The 110<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Psalm is prophetical, and declares the Messiah, a Priest
							for ever after the order of Melchizedek— Paul combines the passage in
							Genesis with that in the Psalms, and argues with great acuteness, that
							the Priesthood of <persRef ref="aaron">Aaron</persRef> must give way,
							and fell before that of Melchizedek—but there is more in the argument of
							Paul— He states that Melchizedek was king of Righteousness and king of
							Peace— That he was made like unto the Son of God—immortal—and a
							high-priest for ever— The whole argument of Paul, represents him as of a
							nature higher in the scale of creation than mortal man—yet he calls him
							a man— Our preacher told us that he had been supposed absurdly by some
							to be the holy Ghost, and by one sect of the Melchizedekians, to be
							superior to Christ himself— He concluded with the doctrine of the
							atonement <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>Morning walk with rain— The approach of Summer affects exceedingly my
							power of writing— I called again upon <persRef ref="tudor-delia">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="stewart-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Stewart</persRef>, with a Memorandum of questions concerning the
							principal events in the life of <persRef ref="tudor-william2">William
								Tudor</persRef>; but found neither of them could tell even his age
							at the time of his death— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stewart said
							he entered the University at the age of 13. and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Tudor afterwards sent me, my minutes; with Boston in 1778
							in answer to the question of the Time and place of his birth, but with
							scarcely any other information respecting the objects of my enquiries—
							In the evening I wrote part of a page for an obituary notice, but found
							myself obliged to generalize every thing; and soon to stop in utter
							dissatisfaction with what I had written— To get through the Evening I
							finished reading <persRef ref="shakespeare-william"
								>Shakespear’s</persRef> Play of <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Julius
								Caesar</persRef>; which now struck me according to the criticism of
								<persRef ref="johnson-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Johnson</persRef> as cold and deficient in interest. The beauties
								<pb n="443" type="ms"/>of the Play consist in particular passages;
							and in the pictures of the Passions— One of the Commentators justly
							observes that the Title should have been not Julius Caesar—but <persRef
								ref="brutus-marcus">Marcus Brutus</persRef>— The Moral is to be
							traced from two passages—first the description by Brutus—Act 2. Scene 1.
							of the State of his own mind— Since <persRef ref="cassius"
								>Cassius</persRef> first did whet him against Caesar.— The second is
							the character of Brutus given by <persRef ref="antony-mark"
								>Antony</persRef> in the last Scene: beginning This was the noblest
							Roman of them all— Brutus, instigated by another headed a conspiracy
							which murdered Caesar— The purpose of the Poet is to shew how such a man
							could be prompted to such an act—and how it operated afterwards upon his
							mind and fortunes. <persRef ref="orestes">Orestes</persRef> for the
							murder of his mother was tortured by the Furies— Brutus was haunted by a
							Phantom; his Evil Genius— Shakespear has drawn him, consistent in
							character throughout— A fearful picture it is— I remark further that
							although the comment upon the State of mind, which accompanies deep
							conspiracies is general yet the observation of it is suitable only to
							Brutus— He reflects upon what is passing in his own bosom; and he tells
							that which is applicable though not equally to all— Suppose this speech
							to be made by Cassius and it would be entirely out of character— Suppose
							it made even by Brutus to Cassius, as an objection to the conspiracy,
							and it would be out of place— Brutus communes with his own heart, and
							describes its convulsions as matter of philosophical speculation— There
							is in this Edition, a Letter from <persRef ref="warburton-william"
								>Warburton</persRef> to <persRef ref="concanen-matthew"
								>Concanen</persRef>, upon this passage of Shakespear, compared with
							one, in <persRef ref="addison-joseph">Addison’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="catoyounger">Cato</persRef>—like all Warburton’s
							criticisms acute, ingenious and fanciful— There is a singular objection
							of Brutus to making the conspiracy known to <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef>—that he would never follow any thing that other
							men begin— <persRef ref="plutarch">Plutarch’s</persRef> conjecture is
							that they distrusted his courage or his age.</p>

								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sheffield</persRef>
							of Springfield Massachusetts. <persRef ref="sparks-jared">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparks</persRef> afterwards called and
							enquired again concerning <persRef ref="grahame-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham</persRef> of Frederick— Sparks
							said he had been spending a week at <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison’s</persRef>, who spoke to him
							much of the proceedings and published Journal of the Convention of 1787.
							He said he knew not what to make of the plan of Constitution in that
							volume purporting to have been presented by <persRef
								ref="pinckney-charles2">Charles Pinckney</persRef> of
							South-Carolina. He said there was a paper presented by that person to
							the Convention, but it was nothing like the paper now in the book— It
							was referred to the Committee who drafted the plan of the Constitution,
							and was never afterwards in any manner referred to, or noticed— In the
							book, it has the appearance as if it was the original draught of the
							Constitution itself, and as if that which was finally adopted was
							Pinckney’s plan with a very few slight alterations— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparks that <persRef ref="king-rufus"
								>Rufus King</persRef> had spoken to me of C. Pinckney’s paper,
							precisely in the same manner, as he says M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Madison now does— That it was a paper to which no sort of attention was
							paid by the Convention, except that of referring it to the Committee,
							but when I compiled the Journal of the Convention Charles Pinckney
							himself sent me the plan now in the Book, as the paper which he had
							presented to the Convention, and with it he wrote me a Letter, which
							obviously held the pretension, that the whole plan of Constitution was
							his, and that the Convention had done nothing more than to deteriorate
							his work, by altering some of his favourite provisions. <pb n="444"
								type="ms"/>Sparks said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison added
							that the plan now in the book contained several things, which could not
							possibly have been in Pinckney’s paper, but which rose out of the
							debates upon the plan of Constitution reported by the Committee. He
							conjectured that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pinckney’s Memory had
							failed him, and that instead of a copy of the paper which he did
							present, he had found a copy of the plan reported by the Committee, with
							interlined amendments perhaps proposed by him; and at a distance of more
							than thirty years had imagined it was his own plan— Charles Pinckney was
							of loose morals and as R. King said to me of crapulous life. And I never
							knew a man of that character who had any scrupulous regard to truth—
							Virtue may recover from the sensualities of youthful frailty, but an old
							lecher is a universal profligate, who will lie and steal, and cheat, for
							any sordid and selfish purpose— We rode this Evening round by the
							race-ground, and by <persRef ref="greenleaf-james">Greenleaf’s</persRef>

						<p>I found myself again this morning with a severe cold in my head a
							complaint constantly returning upon me; and the cause of which I can
							neither avoid nor trace— The weather was sultry and I shortened my

							and <persRef ref="stewart-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Stewart</persRef>, the latter of whom was impatient for the

								brother</persRef> that I had promised. I therefore finished it and
							took it in, desiring M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stewart to mark any
							thing which they might prefer to have altered or omitted— I met <persRef
								ref="sparks-jared">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparks</persRef>
							at their door, and asked him to dine with us, which he did. Conversation
							upon modern Metaphysics which I took for disguised Atheism; and
							political Economy, which I pronounced political swindling— The present
							objects of the British Political Economists is National Bankruptcy— Rode
							with my Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef>. This is the week
							of the Spring Races, and the roads about there were thronged with
							People— I had an Evening visit from <persRef ref="hillhouse-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> James Hillhouse</persRef> formerly a
							Senator from Connecticut, and one of my associates in that body, during
							the whole time that I was one of its members. He has been here the
							greater part of this Session of Congress, soliciting a subscription for
							completing the Farmington Canal— He has also republished the Speech that
							he made to the Senate on the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of April
							1808. with the Amendments to the Constitution which he then proposed;
							and has now added a new preface, with a new set of Amendments partly
							differing from those of the former period— He gave me one of the
							pamphlets containing his present publication. We were quite social— M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stewart sent back my sketch of an
							obituary notice of her brother, approving it generally, but requesting
							several alterations and some additions.— After a very sultry day, there
							was a distant thundercloud in the Northwest, which followed down the
							course of the River; a corner of it only passing over us with a moderate
							Shower— I am reading every morning part of the Orations against <persRef
								ref="verres-gaius">Verres</persRef>—They are divided into two
							Actions— The first consisting of one Oration, and the second of five—
							The first only was delivered, and contained a charge that Verres had
							taken and carried away a certain large sum of money from the Sicilians—
							This charge, <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> offers to
							prove by witnesses and the great argument of his side is to prove that
							the only reliance of Verres for his defence is to get the <pb n="445"
								type="ms"/>trial to be postponed till the next year, when <persRef
								ref="hortalus-quintus">Hortensius</persRef> would be Consul; and the
							Praetors friendly to Verres; who would appoint judges accessible to his
							corrupt practices— But after this first Oration and the hearing of the
							witnesses, Verres attempted no defence; but gave up his Cause and went
							into exile— The five Orations of the second Action were never delivered—
							But they are among the most valuable monuments of antiquity; not only as
							models of eloquence, but as containing an authentic History of the Roman
							Government over their tributary Provinces.</p>

						<p>The cold in my head has fallen upon my lungs, and aggravated the internal
							inflammation, with which I am afflicted so that I can scarcely hold a
							pen— This writing is the best of witnesses— <persRef ref="tudor-delia"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor</persRef> sent this
							morning a request to see me— She wanted me to make alterations and
							additions to the biographical notice of <persRef ref="tudor-william2"
								>her Son</persRef>, some of which I could not make— She was
							unwilling that his appointment of Consul should be stated, unless with
							the Addition of General—which he was not— She disliked the title of
							Political Agent, an informal Office in which he served two or three
							years, and had one or two other objections of similar character. Tudor
							had accepted the appointment of Consul with great reluctance, and after
							having once refused it— He thought it beneath him, as it was; and there
							is much of this personal and family pride among us, though it is one of
							those feelings which we seldom acknowledge, though influenced by them—
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor said a Brazilian Gentleman had
							told her that when her Son arrived at Rio de Janeiro the Affairs of the
							United States there, were in very bad condition; and that he had
							entirely changed the aspect of them— I told her I knew this very well,
							and had alluded to it in the obituary notice, as distinctly as I could
							without leading to a controversy which would be unpleasant to her—
								<persRef ref="raguet-condy">Condy Raguet</persRef> Tudor’s
							predecessor was a man, who by my special kindness had been raised from
							wretchedness and bankruptcy to the honours and emoluments of a Charge
							d’Affaires— He was a mere fire-brand, and brought the two Countries to
							the brink of War—dismissed himself from Office by demanding his
							Passports and coming home without Orders or authority, and now because I
							left him to enjoy the privacy into which he had thrown himself,
							ingratiates himself with the Rulers of the hour by lampooning his
							benefactor. Tudor’s character was a perfect contrast to that of Raguet
							and he did by his discreet and conciliatory conduct restore the harmony
							which Raguet had ruined. It is proper that this should be duly recorded,
							but not in an obituary notice for a Newspaper. M<hi rend="superscript"

							a communication to me, for which express purpose he had come all the way
							from Philadelphia— It was to ask me to lend him money to pursue his

							disposes of about 450 bushels of corn-meal a week, at the market or to
							customers in Washington and Georgetown— He began this business last
							Spring by Sales of about 150 bushels a week; and these effected with
							difficulty. He began with sending into the Market and Grocer’s shops
							daily one horse and cart—then occasionally and afterwards constantly
							twice a day— Then found a second horse necessary, and has for the last
							six weeks had a second cart with one horse constantly employed— His

							is sold at an average of 48 cents— It is at present by far the most
							profitable business to which the Mills can be turned; and much the
							safest.</p>

							of the second action of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>
							against <persRef ref="verres-gaius">Verres</persRef>, somewhat resemble
							five Articles of Impeachment. But each of them embraces a multitude of
							criminal Acts— The first is styled de Praetum Urbana. That is—of his
							misconduct while exercising the Office of Praetor at Rome— But it
							includes charges of oppressive and tyrannical acts, for a period of
							fourteen years; first as Quaester at Rome, then as Proquaestor, in the
							Provinces of Cilicia, Achaia, and Asia—and finally as Praetor, at Rome—
							He accuses him of treachery to his superior Officers <persRef
								ref="carbo-gnaeus">Cneius Carbo</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="dolabella-publius">Cneius Dolabella</persRef>—of many shameless
							Robberies of Statues and other works of Art; and of a complicated

								>Philodamus</persRef> and his Son at Lampsacus, to raise and head a
							popular insurrection, in defence of the chastity of the daughter of
							Philodamus; and then by a public prosecution the conviction and

							his infamous passions, named <persRef ref="rubrius">Rubrius</persRef>,
							and a mistress named <persRef ref="chelidon">Chelidon</persRef>, through
							whom his Edicts as Praetor were purchased. The closing part of this
							Oration is lost— The next is upon his exercise of the civil Jurisdiction
							as Praetor in Sicily— The third upon his malversations in plundering the
							farmers and the Cities of Sicily, of their grain—and is entitled de
							frumento. The fourth, is upon his robberies of Statues and works of
							Art—and the fifth upon his cruel executions— These are styled de Signis
							and de Suppliciis.— They compose together a large Volume, and he seems
							to have published them as a sort of compendium of all the Official
							crimes that could be committed by a Roman Magistrate.</p>

							occasioned by a strain in a violent effort about six weeks to save
							himself from breaking through a decayed plank in passing a bridge— He
							was too ill for holding a connected conversation, but expressed himself
							in terms of severest <pb n="447" type="ms"/>reprobation concerning the
							present course of affairs— He censured especially a late order of the
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> dismissing from
							the Navy, two Lieutenants and two Midshipmen, for having been concerned
							recently in a duel, in which one of them, <persRef ref="hunter-charles"
								>Midshipman Charles G. Hunter</persRef>, killed <persRef
								ref="miller-william3">William Miller jun<hi rend="superscript">r.

							notorious fact that the same hand which issued this order, killed in a
							duel, a rival <persRef ref="dickinson-charles">Jockey</persRef> at a
							horse-race, for a supposed insinuation of foul play in the race— The

						<p>Finished reading the old Testament, begun this time last year— 3 chapters
							every morning. The prophets are hard to be understood; and if you judge
							from the voluminous commentaries upon them, their difficulties are
							rather increased than diminished by study. At the Unitarian Church I
							heard <persRef ref="hedge-frederic">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hedge</persRef>—this Morning from John 8.32. “And ye shall know the
							truth, and the truth shall make you free.”— I was not much pleased with
							this Sermon. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hedge and <persRef
								ref="upham-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Upham</persRef>
							joined in the administration of the communion. I called to see <persRef
								ref="hay-george">judge Hay</persRef>; whom I found suffering severe
							pain, though somewhat less violent than last Evening— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hedge’s Evening discourse was from Jonah
							4.6. [“]And the Lord prepared a gourd and made it to come up over
								<persRef ref="jonah">Jonah</persRef>, that it might be a shadow over
							his head to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of
							the gourd. 7. But God prepared a worm when the morning arose the next
							day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.”— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hedge began with a series of ingenious observations, upon
							the extensive and even universal application of many incidents
							apparently trivial and insignificant in themselves with which the
							Scriptures abound—of which he gave the incident related in his text as a
							memorable example— An alternate succession of good and evil, by the
							direction of Providence, and operating upon human life, was then drawn
							as the moral inference from the text— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hedge did not enter into any particular consideration of the Book of
							Jonah, which differs materially from all the other prophetical books— It
							is in truth the History of a prophecy <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
							fulfilled— Jonah lived 840 years before Christ— In the 14<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of the second book of Kings v.
							25. A prophesy of Jonah concerning the kingdom of Israel, is said to
							have been fulfilled by <persRef ref="jeroboam">Jeroboam the
								second</persRef>; but that prophecy is not in the book of Jonah— The
							Book has no apparent reference to either of the kingdoms of Israel or of
							Judah— Jonah was commanded by the word of the Lord to prophecy the
							destruction of Nineveh— He attempted to evade this command, in
							consequence of which the tempest arose; he was cast into the Sea;
							swallowed by the great fish; cast ashore by him; ordered a second time
							to prophecy against Nineveh, which he did— But Nineveh repented— Nineveh
								<pb n="448" type="ms"/>Nineveh was spared, and Jonah’s prophecy was
							not fulfilled— Upon this Jonah was exceedingly distressed for his own
							character and expostulated with the Lord; insisting that he did well to
							be angry, and to pray for his own death— He then retires to his booth on
							the East side of the City—where the Lord prepares the gourd to shade
							him, and the worm to smite the gourd—finally the heat of the Sun which
							overpowers the prophet; and he again prays for death— The whole closes
							with a pointed sentence of reproof upon the prophet for pitying the
							Gourd, and yet being angry because the Lord had not destroyed the great
							City of Nineveh— The whole Book appears to be an Allegory or a Parable,
							and in its moral strongly resembles the book of Job—</p>

						<p>My disease abated some portion of its severity upon my lungs and

								>Mary</persRef> passed the Evening with <persRef
								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">T. B. Johnson</persRef>— After reading
							again through the Old Testament, there ought to remain more of its
							contents upon my Memory than there does. I have endeavoured to fix more
							of my attention upon the prophets at this reading than heretofore— But a
							very small part of them is intelligible. I have endeavoured to ascertain
							the precise character and condition of the Hebrew Prophets— In Genesis
							20.7. <persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef> is said to be a prophet,
							but afterwards they were for sometime called Seers— They sometimes Saw
							Visions— Sometimes heard Voices and sometimes dreamt dreams— They were
							persons who received direct supernatural communications from God which
							they were commanded to make known to the kings and People— Most of the
							Patriarchs were Prophets— So was <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>.
							So were most of the Judges— <persRef ref="david">David</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef> among the kings; and there
							was a constant succession of them during the Monarchies of Israel and of
							Judah— Many Psalms of David are considered as prophetic, but in the
							present Canon of the Scriptures, there are only sixteen Books of
							Prophets; four Great and twelve Minor Prophets— The Great Prophets are
								<persRef ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef>, <persRef ref="jeremiah"
								>Jeremiah</persRef>, <persRef ref="ezekiel">Ezekiel</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="daniel">Daniel</persRef>, the last of whom so styled
							not for the length but for the importance of his work. The time during
							which the prophecies were written was about 500 years from <persRef
								ref="jonah">Jonah</persRef> 840 years before Christ to <persRef
								ref="malachi">Malachi</persRef> 397. They were written as
							predictions of destruction to the two kingdoms, and to all their
							neighbours and conquerors. Most of them also predicted the Messiah, and
							the kingdom of Christ upon Earth— They were admitted as Books of divine
							Inspiration by Christ and his Apostles, and there is scarcely one of
							them, from whom there are not quotations, in the Gospels and Epistles of
							the New Testament— The manner in which they were commissioned to deliver
							their Messages from Heaven was astonishing—usually by typical
							representations, and acts sometimes very questionable in themselves— A
							collection of these types would be interesting. It is also remarkable
							that excepting the case of Jonah it does not appear that the
							denuntiations of Gods wrath in all these prophets ever produced any
							effect to draw the people to Repentance, or to obtain for them a
							mitigation of the sentence to which they were doomed— The purpose of the
							predictions of the prophets seems to have been to prepare mankind for
							the reception of Christianity.</p>

						<p>My indisposition continues, and becomes more painful; but has not
							hitherto interfered with my occupations— I called this forenoon and
							visited <persRef ref="hay-george">judge Hay</persRef>, and found him
							suffering less than when I had seen him last before. <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> was
							with him. And a young man named <persRef ref="u">Payne</persRef> came in
							while I was there— I rode with <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef>
							this afternoon to the Mill, and in the Evening wrote to <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H. Everett</persRef>, and part of
							a Letter to my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>— I am
							reading the fourth Oration of the second Action against <persRef
								ref="verres-gaius">Verres</persRef>— A continued series of
							vituperation against one person through a large volume, must degenerate
							into dulness—invective should be short—when a man has once been devoted
							in your mind to utter execration, you cannot do more than turn him over
							to the infernal Gods. After the first Oration Verres gave up his Cause
							and went into banishment— Five long Orations of perpetual invective upon
							a man already self-condemned, would seem to be too much— The
							imcomparable address of the Orator is felt in the interest, which he
							never suffers to flag, and of which no reader can even now be conscious—
							The multitude of frauds, of cruelties, and of robberies detailed in
							these Orations is scarcely credible, but the names of all the parties
							are given, and every narration is prepared as for dramatic effect— To
							collect the Evidence <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> had
							himself gone and spent several Weeks in the Island of Sicily, and
							frequently alludes to the persons with whom he conversed and to the
							discoveries he made there— In one instance the public accounts of a
							City, which contained proofs of unlawful payments to Verres, had by
							collusion with him been destroyed— But Cicero obtained a copy of part of
							them, which had been taken by one of the magistrates for his own use;
							and Cicero exults much of the production of it. In another case the
							accounts had been falsified by erasures, and alterations which Cicero
							describes with minuteness and much humour— There were charges to a very
							large amount against Verres, which had been altered to the fictitious
							name of Verrutius, there being no such person in existence— Cicero
							frequently puns upon the name of the accused Praetor, by compounding
							several verbs from his name, which signifies a boar. He gives an
							occasional description of his person and looks, and graphic portraits of
							some of his agents and creatures.</p>

						<p>The occasional pains which indicate an inflammation of the kidneys were
							this day extremely severe, yet I took my usual early walk— Met <persRef
								ref="hillhouse-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
								Hillhouse</persRef> of Connecticut who turned and walked with me—
							Three or four days ago, he stopped me and asked me, if I had any
							objection to giving him my views upon project of Amendments to the
							Constitution. I did not give him a positive answer. When M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hillhouse on the 12<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> of April 1808 offered his proposal of Amendments, and read
							his dissertation, I did believe that he had another motive than that
							which appeared on the surface—namely the desire of drawing <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father</persRef>, or me into controversy with
							him— I saw clearly the advantages that he might expect to derive from
							that; but absurd as his proposed amendments were, there was not the
							slightest danger in them— And I had no inclination to fight Shadows or
							Windmills— When my father read Hillhouse’s book, he spoke of it to me,
							and intimated to me a design to expose some of its absurdities— I told
							him I believed that to be precisely Hillhouse’s object; and my father
							gave up all idea of answering him. Twenty-two <pb n="450" type="ms"
							/>years have since passed away, and after some feeble efforts of the
							cabal with which Hillhouse was connected to puff his project into notice
							it sunk into oblivion— He never called up his Amendments in the Senate—
							He continued as a Senator among the most violent of the federalists, but
							retired from Congress in 1810. and in 1814 and 15 was a member of the
							Hartford Convention— The change of Politics in Connecticut took place in
							1816. and Hillhouse has since that time been retired from political
							life—but always maintaining a respectable character— He comes here now
							as Agent for a Canal Company to obtain a subscription by Congress— He
							understands his interest too well to indispose the majorities in both
							houses of Congress, and the members of the present Administration by
							dabbling in Politics disagreeable to them— About a year since M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hillhouse was one of <persRef
								ref="gould-james">judge Gould’s</persRef> certificate men, to
							discredit a Statement made by me which he Hillhouse well knew was true—
							He came here nearly three Months since; passed by me at least ten times
							in the Streets without the slightest notice of me, and last week first
							called to see me. I received him with good humour and cordiality—upon
							which he took from his pocket and gave me a copy of his new pamphlet,
							addressed to me in manuscript with his name— Since then we have met
							several times in my morning walk, and at last he asked me to give him my
							views upon his work, which he says he considers extremely important—
							Crafty people are apt to overreach themselves— A serious discussion of
							his amendments would be ridiculous; but as my antagonist, he would know
							how and to whom to pay his court, and might get a vote of subscription
							for the Farmington Canal— I had a visit this Morning from <persRef
								ref="sprague-peleg">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Sprague</persRef>—Senator from Maine— He came to ask from me for
								<persRef ref="shaw-moses">Moses Shaw</persRef> a document relating
							to the Life of <persRef ref="tucker-samuel">Samuel Tucker</persRef>,
							which he is writing— I told him I had received last Fall a Letter from
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaw, making the same request. It was
							but a few days before I left Quincy, and not having the time to examine
							my father’s papers I postponed answering the Letter— But I expected very
							shortly to return to Quincy; and would then immediately examine the
							papers, and answer M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaw’s Letter— I took
							with difficulty this Evening a warm bath.</p>

						<p>The occasional severe pains of the last two days subsided, leaving some
							soreness, and incapacity of bodily labour— I renewed, but abridged my
							Morning walk, and rode with my Son <persRef key="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> to the Mills after dinner. I found them at work,
							grinding wheat at the large Mill and Indian Corn at the small one. The
							demand for Corn meal, and for what they call Rye-chop continues, and the
							prospect of profitable business for the year remains fair— The
							experience of the last years, forbids sanguine hope; but my anxieties
							for the future condition of my family have no other reliance upon Earth—
								<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef> died at 84. amidst the most abject supplications
							for eleemosinary contributions for bread to his children— <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s</persRef>
							groans of famishing distress are incessant, and ring throughout this
							continent— <persRef key="adams-john">My father</persRef> screened the
							poverty of his last years; by a severity of domestic frugality, which
							neither Jefferson, nor Monroe, nor I had energy of mind to practice— My
							experience of the last 15 Months leaves me nothing to expect but a rapid
							consumption of what property I have, to defray the cost of my own
							sustenance, and that of <persRef key="adams-charles2">my
								children</persRef>— If the industrious and prudent employment of
							these Wills, will give me no relief, the close of my animal life, will
							to all appearance be as needy, and as comfortless as that of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson—yet will I not despair— <persRef
								ref="fendall-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fendall</persRef> called and asked me again for that manuscript
							dissertation upon parties which I had written and which yet remains
							unfinished. I told him I would look for it. There is doubt in my mind
							whether Fendall will ever write the History of the late Administration
							which was advertised— I am yet upon the Orations of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> against <persRef
								ref="verres-gaius">Verres</persRef>; and the more thoroughly I know
							this admirable Orator, the higher my estimate of him rises— The practice
							which I have now adopted of allowing one hour every day to classical
							reading has been to me a source of so much enjoyment that I hope to
							persevere in it as long as life and health will permit— One year will
							just carry me comfortably through Cicero— The collection of the Regent’s
							Classics will occupy about four, if Providence has destined to me so
							long a date—and if my own heart and mind can derive little or no
							improvement from this tardy study, perhaps it may enable me to give
							useful hints to my Sons— I have read three or four Letters of <persRef
								ref="plinytheyounger">Pliny</persRef>, to compare his epistolary
							Style with that of Cicero— A Contrast— Every Letter of Pliny is a
							dissertation; intended for publication; and prepared with a Court-dress—
							Even the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of the first book—only five
							lines, to express a thought repeatedly given by Cicero, is elaborate. He
							tells his friend, if he has nothing to write, to write <hi rend="italic"
								>that</hi>—and then comments upon this simple thought— In this
							Letter he says also that the practice of beginning Letters, with, Si
							vales, bene est, ego valeo, was no longer in use.</p>

							<persRef ref="herodotus">Herodotus</persRef> which I have taken up, and

							Monarchies— Herodotus is one of the historical fountains— The father of
							profane History— Born 486. years before Christ— Cotemporary with

							from Philippians 4:13. “I can do all things through Christ which the
							strengtheneth me.” The Sermon was ingenious, but the course of argument,
							savoured if not of arrogance, and rashness; at least of a sanguine
							temperament and youthful confidence— The text itself was taken in a more
							comprehensive sense than I believe the Apostle intended— The single
							verse indeed is without limitation—but the thought is apparently limited
							by the context— The passage refers to the personal support of <persRef
								ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>, which he
							thanks the Philippians for having taken care to provide for him— But he
							adds that he knows how to be abased, and how to abound—to be full and to
							be hungry—to abound and to suffer need— After which he offers the words
							of the text, saying that he can do all things— That is all things for
							his own personal comforts and support— But M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hedge understands it as a general and unqualified sense; and
							he vindicated the right of the apostle to say so. Urging that every
							individual was equally able to do all things, <pb n="453" type="ms"/>he
							may undertake, if he have only firmness of purpose and a determined
							Will. A few years of experience must teach a sounder doctrine than this—
							I called to see <persRef ref="hay-george">judge Hay</persRef> at his

							[“]Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the

							and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have
							been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. 31. Wherefore ye
							be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them, which

						<p><date>17 V. </date>Monday.</p>
						<p>There was a Heavy Thunder Shower in the night, and several others in the
							course of this day. My Catarrhal cough yet continues, and I had resort
							this day to the medicinal remedy to which I have been accustomed in the
							Spring. I finished a Letter I had yesterday begun, to <persRef
								ref="vaughan-benjamin">Benjamin Vaughan</persRef> and answered one
							from my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>— Read the
							Oration of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> for <persRef
								ref="fonteius-marcus">Fonteius</persRef>, and an Article in the
							Edinburgh Review, on Providential and Prophetical Histories—For the
							first time I have gone through the whole of the Orations against
								<persRef ref="verres-gaius">Verres</persRef> in succession. It is
							rather a History of Roman Tyranny in the Government of the Provinces,
							than an impeachment of an individual Offender— Sicily was governed by
							Praetors, and was required to furnish by way of tax or tribute, one
							tenth part of the wheat raised in the Island— Another tenth was to be
							furnished at fixed prices, below those of the market, and the Praetor
							had a discretionary power to exact a further indefinite quantity, as it
							might be wanted for his own establishment, and at a reasonable price—
							The Cities were required to furnish each an armed vessel, with a crew,
							and all necessary equipments, for defence against the Pirates— The
							people were usually priviledged to be governed by the Laws of <persRef
								ref="hieron-ii">Hiero</persRef>, one of their antient kings; to
							which they were warmly attached, but which Verres totally disregarded—
							The picture of tyranny, rapacity, cruelty, debauchery, and venality,
							practised by Verres is stupendous— His robberies of consecrated images,
							relics, and exquisite works of Statuary and Sculpture, prodigious— His
							oppressions upon the Aratores, or wheat growing farmers, went far in
							three years to depopulate the Province— Cicero specifies the numbers in
							many of the districts, forced to abandon their farms by his exactions,
							and they amount to near two thirds of the whole number— By his gross
							mismanagement, and embezzlements, the fleet raised by the Cities for the
							defence against the Pirates, was run ashore and burnt by the Pirates
							themselves, who penetrated into the very harbour of Syracuse— Verres who
							in the mean time was living in drunkenness and debauchery on shore, with
							the <persRef ref="nice">wife</persRef> of <persRef ref="cleomenes"
								>Cleomenes</persRef> to whom he had given the command of the fleet;
							passes sentence of capital condemnation and puts to death the Captains
							of the Vessels which had been burnt— And from these wretched men, his
							executioner takes bribes for promises to strike off their heads at one
							blow; so that their torture may not be prolonged— The Orator closes the
							accusation with the crucifixion of <persRef ref="gavius-publius"
								>Gavius</persRef> the Roman Citizen, as the most aggravated of the
							crimes charged upon Verres; and finishes by a solemn, and magnificent
							prayer to each of the Gods and Goddesses, outraged by the violation of
							their Temples and their Images— The decorations added to the narrative
							of facts throughout these Orations, the descriptions of Sicilian
							Scenery, the mythological allusions to <persRef ref="ceres"
								>Ceres</persRef> and <persRef ref="proserpine">Proserpine</persRef>,
							the appeal to <persRef ref="scipio-metellus">Publius Scipio</persRef>,
							one of the defenders of Verres, in the name of his Ancestor <pb n="454"
								type="ms"/><persRef ref="scipioafricanus">Scipio
							Africanus</persRef>; the references of the Orator to his own situation,
							his exposition of the duties which he felt himself bound as a Roman
							Magistrate to discharge— The purity of Life which he admits he had
							imposed upon himself by undertaking this accusation, the enmities which
							he acknowledges he must encounter by its prosecution, all give occasion
							to luminous passages in these Orations— The style is always lofty and
							dignified; even when he has occasion to notice <persRef ref="chelidon"
								>Chelidon</persRef>, and <persRef ref="pippa">Pippa</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="tertia">Tertia</persRef>— There is a continual effort
							at antithetic expressions, which sometimes appears affected; and there
							are rather too many puns upon the name of Verres— Throughout the whole
							of the six Orations the interest never flags for a moment.</p>

							dined with us. After dinner I rode with <persRef key="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> to the Mills, which they have been unable to work
							these two days, for superabundance of Water— It was worse yesterday— In
							the space of 15 minutes the flood in the Creek rose 6 feet—overflowed
							the lower floors of the Mills, and damaged 100 bushels of Meal— The
							water subsided as rapidly as it rose, but still runs in so heavy a sheet
							over the dam, that it cannot turn the wheels. It has also injured the
							road leading to the Mills— Those accidents engross the time and labour
							of the workman at the Mills, and reduce the supplies which they can
							furnish for the daily consumption of the City— These accidents of which
							there are many have a double effect upon the business, by doing damage
							to the works, the Stock, and the Road; and by intercepting the supply to
							the city markets— These Summer thunder-showers are as dangerous to Mill
							Establishments as to Harvests— It is not two years since one of them
							carried away a whole side of our dam—the repairing of which cost me
							nearly a year’s Rent— And the sudden flood of this time was caused by
							the breaking down of the dam of one of the Mills above ours upon the
							Creek—the timbers of which were brought down and precipitated over our
							dam. After finishing the Orations against <persRef ref="verres-gaius"
								>Verres</persRef>, I read yesterday that for <persRef
								ref="fonteius-marcus">Fonteius</persRef> which is a short fragment,
							all the first part of it being lost— Fonteius had been three years
							Praetor in Gaul, and was prosecuted de repetundis by the Gauls as Verres
							had been by the Sicilians. The Gallic witnesses as against Fonteius,
							were so strongly pointed, that <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef> declined examining them at all, but puts the
							defence of his Client, upon his fair character, and witnesses favourable
							to him, and upon totally discrediting the Gauls— The cause was tried
							before <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar’s</persRef> Wars in Gaul, for
							one of Cicero’s topics of persuasion is that Fonteius being an
							experienced Military Commander should be acquitted, to be preserved for
							the service of the Republic, where warlike fame was much on the decline—
							He introduces also the widowed Mother of Fonteius, and especially his
							Sister who was a Vestal Virgin— And he intimates that if the judges
							should be inexorable to her prayers for her brother, they must expect
							the Gods will be equally so to her prayers for the Roman People— This is
							a strange idea, and indeed there is so much of address to fancy and
							passion in this defence as leaves room for conjecture that it was in
							substance very weak.</p>

							formed a very high opinion of his talents— I said he had the talent of a

							because the rarest of talents— He is the only Spanish diplomatic man,
							whom I have had to treat with, and who formed an exception to the
							character of them given by <persRef ref="pitt-william">Lord Chatham</persRef>— Shaler spoke of <persRef

							thought there would be any impropriety in his selling to the British

							and three of the Gospels, which he had procured to be made in the Berber

								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Secretary of State</persRef>— I rode with

							he had been elected Praetor. He takes his Exordium from that
							circumstance; attributes to his modesty that he had never addressed them
							before; and assures them that he had been resolved never to present
							himself before them with crude, inexperienced or unlaboured discourse—
							This Oration is accordingly wrought with great skill, and polished to
							the highest perfection of Language— It is one continued panegyric upon
								<persRef ref="pompey">Pompey</persRef>—the object of it being to
							prevail upon the People to give the sole command of the War against
								<persRef ref="mithridates-vi">Mithridates</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="tigranes-ii">Tigranes</persRef> to Pompey— A Law to that effect
							having been proposed by the Tribune of the People <persRef
								ref="manilius-gaius">Manilius</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="catulus-quintus2">Catulus</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hortalus-quintus">Hortensius</persRef> opposed the passage of
							the Law; and Cicero replies to their objections.— He divides the Oration
							into three points—the Nature of the War—its magnitude, and the choice of
							a Commander—and he closes by earnestly exhorting Manilius to persevere
							in the proposal of his Law, and by promising all the assistance in his
							power to carry it through; protesting with solemn adjuration of the Gods
							that he has no private or personal motive for giving this advice, and
							particularly that it is not with the view to court the favour of Pompey—
							The Style of eloquence is temperate, dignified, and uniform: with an
							occasional introduction of appropriate sentiments and reflections.</p>

							marks of an Infidel in disguise— The next Article couples a Speech of

							with a History of political Economy in Italy by <persRef

								>Benton</persRef> and <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>
							to proclaim anti-tariff and nullification doctrine under the shelter of

							birth-day; by an assemblage of Members of Congress, dining together upon
							Republican principles— The real object was to trick the Pennsylvania
							Members into the drinking of anti-tariff and nullification toasts. Eight
							members of the Pennsylvania delegation; Jefferson Republican dyed in the
							Wool, agreed to go— The company were assembled— The <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> was there by invitation—
								<persRef ref="leiper-george">George R. Leiper</persRef> one of the
							Pennsylvania members, told <persRef ref="miller-daniel"
							>Miller</persRef>, his colleague one of the toast-making Committee, that
							he should like to see the toasts before drinking them. Miller brought
							him the list of toasts, and read them till he came to the 13<hi

							need not read any more— He then collected the whole eight <pb n="458"
								type="ms"/>together and told them he should not sit down at the
							table where these toasts were to be drank; and they all agreed to
							withdraw together, which they accordingly did.— The obnoxious toasts
							were drank— But President Jackson being called upon for his toast, gave
							“The Union—it must be preserved.”— Aio te, AEacida, Romanos vincere
							posse— And from that day the two sides of the faction have been each
							claiming the Presidential toast to itself. The Union must be preserved
							says South-Carolina, by repealing the Tariff— The Union must be
							preserved says Pennsylvania, by sustaining the Tariff to the muzzle of
							the gun— Since the dinner Leiper has published a Letter from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson to <persRef ref="leiper-thomas"
								>his father</persRef>, charging opposition to domestic manufactures
							upon the anglo-federalists. In conversing with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rush upon the prospects of the Country, we agreed that the
							Indians are already sacrificed— That the Public Lands will be given
							away— That domestic Industry and internal Improvement will be
							strangled—and when the public debt will be paid off and the Bank Charter
							expired, there will be no great interest left upon which the action of
							the general Government will operate— The future must be consigned to the
							sweet little Cherub that sits up aloft.</p>

						<p>A cold, rainy, cheerless day needing a fire little less than January; but
							I had none. Morning Service at the Presbyterian Church— Heard <persRef
								ref="campbell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Campbell</persRef> from 1. Corinthians 2.4. “And my speech, and my
							preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in
							demonstration of the Spirit and of power.”— The argument of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell was that the success of the
							gospel was not at all promoted by the arts of human eloquence but
							entirely by the special operation of the holy Spirit— Such is the course
							of reasoning in the Chapter from which this text is borrowed; but
								<persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>
							did not always disdain the aids of human eloquence. He availed himself
							of them with great power in preaching at Athens— Nor does it follow
							because the Apostles did possess and exercise supernatural power in the
							performance of their duties, that the same assistance can be expected by
							the preachers of the Gospel at this Time— They must use to the utmost of
							the power the enticing words of man’s wisdom, and the more thoroughly
							they are qualified by learning and study, and the more fervently they
							apply themselves to the acquisition and to the use of human eloquence
							the more effectually will they serve the Cause of their Lord and Master,
							and the more cause will they have to hope for that aid of the holy
							Spirit, which may shed a blessing upon their labours— Yesterday Morning
							I finished the reading of the Apocryphal Books and this Morning began
							upon the New-Testament— The Historical Books of the Apocrypha, are very
							unworthy to be bound in a Volume with the Scriptures of the Old and New
							Testament— There is a link of connection wanting between the Books of
								<persRef ref="ezra">Ezra</persRef>, and <persRef ref="nehemiah"
								>Nehemiah</persRef> and the Maccabees on one side; and between the
							Maccabees and the Gospel Histories on the other— The Maccabees, appear
							suddenly as Military Commanders and High Priests, waging Wars with the
							kings of Syria, and Egypt, it scarcely appears <pb n="459" type="ms"
							/>how or why— There is a peculiar Chronology used in the Books of the
							Maccabees, the AEra of which I have not ascertained. The two Books are
							accounts by different authors in part of the same transactions— The
							second Book ending with the Death of <persRef ref="nicanor"
								>Nicanor</persRef>, which is told Chapter 7. verse 43 of the first—
							The second Book is avowedly a mere abridgment of a work in five Books by
								<persRef ref="jasonofcyrene">Jason of Cyrene</persRef> and the
							Abridger considers his work, as more difficult and laborious than that
							of the original author— At the close of the 12<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Chapter there is a story of a contribution for offering up
							prayers for the dead, which is expressly approved, and is considered by
							Roman Catholic as establishing the doctrine of purgatory. And there is a
							horrible story of seven brothers and their Mother suffering death for
							refusing to eat Swine’s flesh— The Style is remarkable for its inanity.

							one charge for fifty Months of a contribution which was undertaken to
							pay the Note to me, and to which I did aid, until after all the others
							had ceased— And as the Note was not paid; I did not think the charge

							biographical notice of William Tudor for the North-American Review and
							that he had accepted the Offer. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor

								<persRef ref="cluentiushabitus-aulus">Cluentius</persRef> which

							>Oppianicus</persRef>— He was dead, and one of the charges against
							Cluentius was that he had caused him to be murdered by poison— But
							Cicero charges him with six or eight atrocious murders; and among them

								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef>, with my Son
								<persRef key="adams-john2">John’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="hellen-mary">wife</persRef>; <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>his infant daughter</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Nowland</persRef>, left Washington at
							8 O’Clock in our own Carriage and a pair of horses driven by <persRef
								ref="kirk-john">John Kirke</persRef>— Half an hour later I started
							in the Stage, of <persRef ref="fuller-azariah">Fuller’s</persRef> line,
							with a black Servant named <persRef ref="william3"
							>William</persRef><space/>In the Stage with me was <persRef
								ref="butman-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Butman</persRef>,
							a member of the House of Representatives from Maine— <persRef
								ref="henderson-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Henderson</persRef>, once the husband of <persRef ref="laurens-john"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> John Laurens’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="henderson-frances">daughter</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="webb-henry">Ex-Lieutenant Webb</persRef>, a personage of
							transient notoriety, and a family from Philadelphia— At the door of a
							house where we took in a passenger, <persRef ref="chilton-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Chilton</persRef>, a member of
							the house from Kentucky, of versatile fame and opinions was introduced
							to me— We passed our Carriage standing at the door at Rossburg Tavern,
							and at 3. in the afternoon we landed at <persRef ref="barnum-david"
								>Barnum’s</persRef> Hotel—Baltimore— While we were dining we
							received an invitation, from the Committee of the Railway Company to
							take a ride, out to <persRef ref="u">Ellicott’s</persRef> Mills— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Butman declined; feeling himself under a
							necessity to proceed in the Night line of Stage and steam-boat, which
							left Baltimore at 5 P.M. and still goes by the way of Frenchtown and
							Newcastle— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henderson and myself accepted
							the invitation, and went accompanied by <persRef
								ref="patterson-william3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								Patterson</persRef>, and <persRef ref="wever-casper">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wever</persRef> the Superintendent of
							the Road— At four P.M. we set out— Six Cars of different forms, each
							drawn by a single horse. The Car in which I rode had the form of a
							double Stage Coach; with a door at one side, and a bench round the
							inside upon which fourteen persons were seated— Eight others were on the
							out side—six on the top; and one each side of the driver— The horse was
							changed twice on the road, and we travelled the 13. Miles to the Mills
							in an hour and a half— After resting about 10 minutes, we returned, in
							the same time it had taken us to go out. I rode out by the side of the
							driver, and returned within the Car, with ten Lady Passengers— The
							embankments, the deep Cuts, the Carroll and Patterson Viaducts or
							Bridges, constitute altogether a work of great enterprize, labour and
							expense. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson speaks with great
							confidence of the continuance of the work; but it cannot pay its cost,
							and unless the Government comes to their assistance by a large
							subscription, the Capital in the City of Baltimore must sink under the
							pressure of the undertaking before it will be half completed. They are
							severely disappointed by the failure of their application to Congress
							for a subscription at the present Session. On returning to Barnum’s
							Hotel; about Sunset I found my family had been about half an hour
							arrived— <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								John Sergeant</persRef> of Philadelphia, was there, and spent the
							Evening with us— He is going to Fayetteville in North-Carolina. We had a
							succession of Visitors the whole Evening; among whom was <persRef
								ref="barney-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W.
								Barney</persRef> the late Naval Officer, and <persRef
								ref="barney-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Barney</persRef>;
							lately much celebrated for a spirited Letter to the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President of the United States</persRef>, on
							the dismission of her husband from Office.</p>

						<p><date>28. IV:30. </date>Friday— From Baltimore to Philadelphia.</p>
						<p>There are two lines of Steam-boats and Stages between Baltimore and
							Philadelphia, which now run in competition with each other— The Old
							Union Line, who have two new Steam-Boats; the George Washington from
							Baltimore to the Canal at Black Creek, and the Robert Morris, from
							Delaware City to Philadelphia on the Delaware— The other is called the
							Citizen’s Line—and their Steam-boats are the Charles Carroll of
							Carrollton from Baltimore to the Canal; and the William Penn, from
							Philadelphia to the Canal at Delaware City. <persRef ref="kirk-john"
								>John Kirke</persRef> had first applied at the boat of the Citizens
							Line— But by the advice of <persRef ref="sergeant-john"
								>Sergeant</persRef> and <persRef ref="barney-william">W.
								Barney</persRef>, we concluded to take the old Union line, and came
							in the Washington <persRef ref="u">Captain Robinson</persRef> from
							Baltimore. The boats of both lines leave the wharves at six in the
							morning, at half past ten we were in black Creek at the entrance of the
							Canal— Here the passengers and their baggage, passed and were
							transferred into the Canal barge; one of which is connected with each of
							the lines. I was obliged to leave my Carriage and horses, at the
							entrance of the Canal— The barges not being of size to receive and
							transport them— I directed John Kirke to take them by the road over
							which I travelled last Summer; and to join us if possible at the City of
							Delaware landing. And if he should find this impracticable; as Captain
							Robinson thought he would, I ordered him to go up to Newcastle, and take
							the horses and Carriage thence to Philadelphia in the Night boat of the
							Union line— The Canal barges travel at the rate of six miles an hour—
							They are towed by four and sometimes by five horses, in file, with a
							rider on the foremost, and a rider on the hindmost horse—changing horses
							once on the way— They pass under the deep cut bridge and descend in
							eight minutes the lock, four miles from the City of Delaware— The
							tow-path is often barely wide enough, for the horses travelling in
							opposition, to pass by each other. The canal is forty feet wide, and the
							embankments, look as if a severe Storm would make breaches in any part
							of them. At one O’Clock we passed in 8 minutes from the Canal Barge into
							the Steam-boat Robert Morris at the Delaware City, <persRef ref="u"
								>Captain Jenkins</persRef>. John Kirke had not arrived— After
							touching at Newcastle to land and take in passengers, we landed at
							Chesnut Street wharf at Philadelphia in ten hours from Baltimore. This
							is now daily performed by two lines of boats— We had as fellow
							passengers from Baltimore <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Cooper</persRef> of Norfolk, <persRef
								ref="newell-thomas;newell-rebecca">Captain and M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Newell</persRef>, and many others— We
							came to lodge at <persRef ref="head-joseph2">Head’s</persRef> Mansion
							House— Just before reaching the Black Creek Canal Landing, we discovered
							that one of our Trunks had been left behind; but whether at home or at
								<persRef ref="barnum-david">Barnum’s</persRef> in Baltimore we did
							not know. I wrote to Barnum and to my Son <persRef key="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> to enquire after it. In the Evening <persRef
								ref="hoffman-daniel">D. Hoffman</persRef> of Baltimore, and <persRef
								ref="biddle-clement">C. C. Biddle</persRef> with <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef> called upon
							me—and <persRef ref="greenleaf-william">William C. Greenleaf</persRef>
							whom my Son John has engaged to assist him in the business of the Mill—
							He came from Boston yesterday Morning; and proceeds for Washington
							to-morrow—</p>

								Brown</persRef>, who was introduced to me as an eminent practitioner

							owing to the barrenness of the age; and the total vacuity of dramatic
							master-pieces—when I was informed that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D.
							P. Brown himself had recently published a Tragedy, called Sertorius—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown took no offence however at my
							remark, and afterwards sent me a copy of his Tragedy, which I read— It
							requires high talent to compose an indifferent Drama and perhaps I ought
							to distrust my own judgment upon that species of composition. At least I
							have thought so since hearing of the failure of De Montfort, and the
							success of Fazio upon the Stage. My Evening visitors were <persRef

							“What is Truth.”— He said nothing in the discourse of the occasion upon

							answer to <persRef ref="pontiuspilate">Pilate’s</persRef> question— Has
							it ever been answered? Truth has reference to the words and thoughts of
							Man. It is not the mere existence of things nor is it yet the idea of
							the human mind concerning them— Truth is the conformity between the
							words, and thoughts, and realities in the communication of ideas from
							man to man. In the Greek Testament the word is alηθεια, unconcealment—
							It belongs to the properties of the mind rather than to the nature of
							things— Jesus told Pilate that he came into the world to bear witness of
							the Truth; and that every one who was of the Truth heard his voice— That
							truth was that he was the king of the Jews, but that his kingdom was not
							of this world— But the assertion of the kingdom itself is not direct,
							but informed from the question of Pilate— I dined with <persRef
								ref="hopkinson-joseph">Judge Hopkinson</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> had also been invited, but was not

							Night— I supposed it about nine, till as I was returning to my lodgings
							two watchmen, by whom I passed gave me notice of the real hour. A
							principal cause of my remaining so late and talking so incessantly was
							the anxiety grating all the time upon my mind.</p>

						<p><date>31. V: </date>Monday— From Philadelphia to New-Brunswick.</p>
						<p>I passed a sleepless Night, in unremitted Agitation, at hearing nothing
							from <persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirke</persRef>, the horses and
							Carriage. Soon after rising this morning I went to the Chesnut Street
							wharf, on board the Robert Morris, and enquired of <persRef ref="u"
								>Captain Jenkins</persRef> if he could give me any information of my
							Coachman, Carriage and Horses— He told me that they had come up in the
							boat from Newcastle on Friday Night—and that Kirke, supposing that we
							had gone on to New-York, proceeded immediately in the boat to Trenton,
							without stopping at all at Philadelphia— I was thus relieved from deep
							anxiety, and our course was plain before us— After breakfast I called at
							the United States Bank, and saw <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddle</persRef> the President. He had
							passed part of Saturday Evening with us— I had received on Saturday from
								<persRef ref="rundle-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Rundle</persRef> Treasurer of the Schuylkill permanent bridge,
							dividends on my stock since Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1824. by a
							check on one of the banks of Philadelphia, for which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddle gave me in exchange one upon the
							U.S. Branch Bank in Boston— I also called on <persRef
								ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef>—the Russian Minister at
							his lodgings, and found <persRef ref="newell-thomas">Captain
								Newell</persRef> with him— He is waiting for the Chargé d’Affaires
								<persRef ref="lomonosoff-sergie">Lomonossof</persRef>, and is then
							to embark for Europe, on leave of absence— I did not expect ever to see
							him again, and parted from him, with good wishes that he might have a
							pleasant voyage and prosperous after-times. <pb n="465" type="ms"/>At
							noon we took the Burlington Steam-boat— We found <persRef
								ref="vaughan-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Vaughan</persRef> at the wharf to see us off— While waiting for the
							boat in a shop at the corner of the street I saw Baron Krudener pass by—
							But <persRef ref="wallenstein-julius">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wallenstein</persRef> joined us, and told me that the Baron had been
							very desirous of having a conversation with me, and much mortified that
							he had company with him when I called at his lodgings— That he wished
							much to see me again, and would for that purpose meet me either at
							New-York or at Boston— I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wallenstein to assure the Baron that I should be happy to meet him at
							Boston at any time during the Summer; but that I should make no stay at
							New-York. The Steam boat landed us at Bordentown between three and four
							O’Clock—on board the boat was a family of Quakers among whom <persRef
								ref="hunt-john2">John Hunt</persRef> of Darby and <persRef ref="u"
								>his wife</persRef>, who gave me a very cordial invitation to his
							house, if I should ever pass that way— And <persRef ref="taylor-anthony"
								>Anthony Taylor</persRef>, whom I had met in the boat last December;
							and who also invited me to his house near Bristol— We rode in the Stage
							form Bordentown to Trenton, 7. miles; and made enquiries there at
							several public houses for John Kirke, our horses and Carriage, but could
							hear nothing of them. He had not even been seen at any of the Stage or
							Steam-boat Houses— I was uncertain whether he had gone on to New-York,
							or remained waiting for us at some other public house in Trenton— We had
							lost the chance of proceeding in the Stage; but I took a separate
							Carriage with a pair of Horses, and came on, after calling at <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Southard’s</persRef> house, and requesting him to ascertain whether
							our Coachman was in Trenton; and if he was to direct him to come on to
							us at New-York— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard warmly invited
							us to alight at his house, but we could not stay— We saw his brother
								<persRef ref="southard-isaac">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Southard</persRef> with him at his door. We came on through
							Princeton to <persRef ref="u">Follett’s</persRef> at New-Brunswick,
							where we arrived at half-past nine in the Evening— Kirke had been there
							Saturday Night, and went on Sunday Morning to New-York— I met this
							morning on the wharf at Philadelphia, <persRef ref="storrs-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> H. R. Storrs</persRef>, member from
							the interior of New-York of the House of Representatives; who came from
