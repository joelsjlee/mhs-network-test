						<p><date>1. VI. </date>Rain, part of the Night and this morning, with frost,

								Patterson</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thomas</persRef> of Baltimore paid me a morning visit—
							They are delegates from the Baltimore railroad company; and are here
							upon some application from them to Congress for assistance— They
							expressed themselves as they have repeatedly done before, for the aid
							which I gave them, in the services of several Engineers who were public
							Officers; and said they had now hopes of obtaining assistance; but
							complained of the hostility to them of <persRef ref="mercer-charles">C.
								F. Mercer</persRef>— I walked round the Capitol Square, and upon my
							return was overtaken by <persRef ref="silsbee-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Silsbee</persRef>. He spoke of the
							prospect of difficulty in agreeing upon a candidate for Governor in
							Massachusetts if <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lincoln</persRef> should decline a <pb n="362" type="ms"
							/>re-election— He said he understood Lincoln to have promised that he
							would not decline, if there should be a prospect of <persRef
								ref="otis-harrison">Otis’s</persRef> being elected in his place. I
							had a harrassing day and evening; for having reached in my chapter upon
							the Russian and Turkish War the period of the commencement of
							hostilities in May 1828— I found myself almost entirely destitute of
							materials—having nothing but the English Annual Register of 1828 for the
							transactions of that campaign, and very much perplexed how to construct
							a narrative from that without making a servile copy of it— <persRef
								ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef> had lent me a file of
							the French Journal of S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Petersburg from
							April till September 1829. but it is quite incomplete and has not even a
							regular series of the bulletins of the Russian army: nor does it come
							down to the conclusion of the Treaty of Peace at Adrinople 14.
							September— The day and Evening were swallowed up in a hasty glance over
							the Russian bulletins and despatches and I was yet not able to make out
							a thread even for a summary of Events, nor could I write a line of my
							chapter— The day was gone too and I had not written a Letter— Read a few
							Letters in the second book of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero’s</persRef> Epistles to <persRef ref="atticus-titus"
								>Atticus</persRef>; but my attention was so much distracted by my
							other enquiries that I more imperfectly understood these— Some of the
							Letters are written from Rome, Atticus being in Greece or Epirus—and
							some from Antium, Tres Tabernae and Formiae, where Cicero had a farm;
							Atticus being at Rome.— In one of the Letters from Formiae he humorously
							complains of being disturbed by a crowd of visitors—My house says he is
							a tavern bar-room, not a farm-house— Of the Formians in general I say
							nothing. They are not troublesome to me after ten in the morning. But
							here is my next neighbour <persRef ref="arrius-caius">Caius
								Arrius</persRef>—he has almost become my bedfellow— He absolutely
							refuses to return to Rome, for the sake of philosophising with me every
							day, and all day long— Then on the other side there is that <persRef
								ref="sebosus">Sebosus</persRef>, the intimate friend of <persRef
								ref="catulus-quintus">Catulus</persRef>— Where shall I take refuge?
							Faith I would forthwith start for Arpinum, if I had not reason to expect
							you here at Formiae, at least the day before the Nones of May— But only
							think to what men, my ears are doomed to listen. A man might make a
							cheap purchase, by an offer for my farm of Formiae, now while these men
							are with me— A fine time truly for “great undertaking, of deep
							meditation, and leisure.” And yet it shall be done—and with no sparing
							of labour.— This is his epistolary Style
							Painting—Characters—Satire—Sentiment—warm friendship—delicate
							compliment—ardent aspirations to great atchievement, inflexible
							resolution to accomplish it and persevering labour, all in the compass
							of six lines, expressed in the tone of familiar conversation and with
							perfect simplicity—</p>

						<p>My Catarrhal Cough almost breaks me down. It was near Sun-rise when I
							rose— I lost my walk before breakfast; and my reading of the Epistles to
								<persRef ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>— I am arrested in my
							narrative of the Russian and Turkish War; and found I had nothing but
							the English Annual Register of 1828 to make it up. The file of the
							French Journal of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg sent me by
								<persRef ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef>, is only of
							1829 and very incomplete— I wrote to <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef>, of the Department of
							State, requesting the loan of their file for the last two years: and he
							sent it, but it was much more incomplete than that of the Baron— I sent
							to the Baron, <pb n="363" type="ms"/>to enquire if he was at home, and
							to say that if he was I would call upon him. He immediately afterwards
							came to see me— I asked him if he had any narrative of the campaign of
							1828 that he could lend me— He said he had a small French pamphlet of
							observations written he believed by <persRef ref="jomini-henri">General
								Jominy</persRef> which he would send me. I asked also for the loan
							of a map which he promised. He said he had mentioned to his Government
							the substance of his preceding Conversations with me, and his wish to be
							furnished with documents relating to the Turkish War, to communicate to
							me; as I was engaged upon Memoirs relating to my own political career— I
							repeated my thanks for his kindness; and said that in frankness I ought
							to tell him I had another object in view, besides what personally
							concerned myself; in the enquiries I was making of him I could not now
							fully explain it to him; though I would hereafter— I trusted it was such
							as would not be disagreeable to his government, or to himself, which he
							said he did not doubt— I said I did not wish him to mention this to his
							Government, though I had thought proper to say so much to him to account
							for the trouble I had repeatedly given him in asking information of him—
							I spoke of the recent accounts from Europe— He had received nothing
							special, but said the <persRef ref="nicholas-i">Emperor</persRef> had
							met with a very serious accident—having risen in the Night upon hearing
							one of his children cry in the chamber next to his—going from one
							chamber to the other he had fallen, and struck his head on the floor— He
							had been several days ill, and was entirely recovered— He spoke of the
							Affairs of Greece; said he thought it probable Russia had assented that
								<persRef ref="leopold2">Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg</persRef>
							should be the Sovereign of Greece— That the consequence would be that
								<persRef ref="kapodistrias-john">Count Capo d’Istrias</persRef>
							would retire; and that Prince Leopold within twelve or eighteen Months
							would find himself in a Hornet’s Nest in which he could not live— He
							said that this excessive anxiety of the British Government to keep
							Greece under their own controul arose from the fear of losing the Ionian
							Islands, where, as well as at Malta, they were much detested— <persRef
								ref="krebs-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Krebs</persRef>
							came after dinner, and told me he was a native of Philadelphia, but had
							resided some years at Frederictown Maryland— He said he proposed to

							gratify his curiosity— Met <persRef ref="rush-richard">M<hi

							Consulate of <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Julius Caesar</persRef> and of
								<persRef ref="bibulus-marcus">Bibulus</persRef>; and are full of
							lamentations and of grievous anticipations of the future: he is
							indignant at the shameful triumvirate of Caesar, <persRef ref="pompey"
								>Pompey</persRef> and <persRef ref="crassus-marcus"
								>Crassus</persRef>. In the Letters towards the close of the book, he
							begins to be fearful of the manoeuvres practiced against him by <persRef
								ref="clodius-publius">Publius Clodius</persRef>: who being of a
							Patrician family, became a Plebeian by adoption, in order that he might
							be enabled to stand as a Candidate for election as a Tribune of the
							People— And with the favour and assistance of Caesar he succeeded.
							Cicero sees the storm coming; with professed tranquility, but with real
							deep agitation— He hopes for support from Pompey; who fails him in his
							need— He declines offers from Caesar whose conduct as Consul he
							detested. He frequently throws out uneasiness at his situation; wishes
							that he had never meddled with public affairs, and frequently repeats
							the ardent desire of devoting himself entirely to literature and Study.
							At one time he proposes to undertake a great Geographical work; but soon
							after gives it up— The latest of the Letters vehemently urge <pb n="364"
								type="ms"/>Atticus to come to his assistance at Rome— <persRef
								ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef> sent me the French
							pamphlet on the Russian Campaign of 1828 against the Turks, which I

							December of that year— The scantiness of materials is vexatious, and the
							files both of the Department of State and of <persRef
								ref="krudener-paul">Baron</persRef>, are provokingly deficient— I
							read this morning to the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Letter of the

							at Thessalonica, at the house of <persRef ref="plancius-cneius">Cneius
								Plancius</persRef> the Quaestor who received and harboured him. The
							Letters are written in great dejection of Spirit; and in a querulous
							tone not altogether Roman, nor philosophical. But his house at Rome and
							his two villas at Tusculum and Formiae had been destroyed. He was
							proscribed as a criminal and Clodius had introduced into his Law,
							provisions interdicting the People themselves from ever repealing it.
							And by a diabolical <pb n="365" type="ms"/>refinement of malignity, the
							ground upon which his house stood had by a religious solemnity been
							consecrated to Liberty. In these Letters written during his exile there
							is no mixture of Greek.</p>

							were here. I was gathering all the information that I could upon the

								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							book, to the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of the fourth— Those of the
							third book were all written while he was in banishment— The 23<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> Letter contains his argument upon the
							nullity and absurdity of Laws pretending to be unrepealable— For in
							repealing the Law, says he, you repeal the very clause by which it is
							declared unrepealable— The Letters of the fourth book, were written in
							the four years immediately after his return to Rome— His exile continued
							about eighteen Months, but the last Letter of the third Book was written
							in January, and is utterly despairing. The first of the fourth book was
							dated in September, and gives an account of his return to Rome— The
							second mentions his Oration, to the Pontiffs for his House, and says
							that if he ever was any thing as an Orator, and even if he never was any
							thing before, yet this Oration was such as he could not deny to be
							eloquent— That it must be preserved as a model for young men, and
							promises to send him a copy— In this third he says distinctly that if
								<persRef ref="clodius-publius">Clodius</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="milo-titus">Milo</persRef> should meet, he believes that Milo
							would kill Clodius— The description that he gives of the violence and

								>President’s private Secretary</persRef>, and who lives at the

							He uses personal influence with the wives of his partisans to prevail
							upon them to countenance this woman by visiting her— There is a story
							current here which whether true or false is significant of the general

							conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Donelson, and for
							three quarters of an hour urged her with pathetic eloquence to visit
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Eaton— That she defended as well as

							Eaton saw the carriage standing before the door— The next day D<hi

						<p>When I rose this morning I found the thermometer outside of the Northern
							window at 12. On returning from my walk it had fallen to 10, about
							Sunrise. Heard <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel"
								>Frothingham</persRef> from Genesis 27.2. “I know not the day of my
							Death.” a very well written discourse upon Death— He spoke of the
							antient symbolical representations of death on monuments—A Genius with
							inverted and extinguished torch; and blamed the modern exchange of it
							for a Skeleton— He thought that our custom of holding out the idea of
							Death as hideous and horrible was ill-judge and expanded with much
							illustration the thought expressed by <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Lord
								Bacon</persRef>, that there is in the human heart no passion so
							feeble, but it often overcomes the fear of death— The first part of the
							Sermon was discursive— Towards the close it marked the uncertainties of
							death as of three kinds— The time—the manner—and the consequences— The
							moral lesson from the uncertainty of the time, was the duty of being
							always prepared—from that of the manner, that it should not be caused or
							hastened by ourselves—from the consequences to others that we should
							leave consolations for those afflicted by our deaths in the memory of
							our Lives, and prepare the consequences to ourselves so that our
							departure from this life may be but entrance upon a better— In speaking
							upon Death, the chief difficulty of a preacher is to avoid common places
							too much beaten— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham had not much
							of them. He had taken something from <persRef ref="lessing-gotthold"
								>Lessing</persRef> as well as from Bacon; but there was no flagging
							of interest while he spoke. I called at <persRef ref="blake-unknown"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Blake’s</persRef> after the
							Service, and there saw Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							<persRef ref="crowninshield-benjamin">Crowninshield</persRef> and

								ref="gilpin-joshua">Gilpin</persRef> afterwards came in; and
								<persRef ref="dwight-henry">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Dwight</persRef> as a visitor— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gilpin
							remembered his having met me in London in the year 1796. which I
							recollected, but not his person, which in 34 years has undergone as
							great a change as mine— And mine is such that no one now knows me from
							the portrait painted of me by Copley that year, though it was then a
							very exact likeness— As I was returning from Church it began to Snow,
							and continued snowing till evening, but the thermometer rose only to 18.
							I kept house the remnant of the day. Read many pages in different
							chapters of that farrago of piety and of absurdity, sense and nonsense
							the Koran— Read Epistles to <persRef ref="atticus-titus"
								>Atticus</persRef> from 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of the
								4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> to 11<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Book. The 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> (last) of Book 4. tells the scandalous
							bargain of the Consuls and others upon which <persRef
								ref="montesquieu-charles">Montesquieu</persRef> has commented— The
								5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Book consists of Letters written
							while <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> was Proconsul in
							Cilicia; and upon his voyage and Journey thither— The first exhibits a
							picture of domestic discord, from the life between his brother <persRef
								ref="cicero-quintus">Quintus</persRef> and his wife <persRef
								ref="pomponia">Pomponia</persRef>, Sister of Atticus— The most
							remarkable feature in those Letters is the constant and extreme anxiety
							with which he deprecates the continuance of his Proconsuler command
							beyond one year—and his passion for returning to that Scene of violence
							and corruption the City of Rome— He says there were those who did not
							believe him.</p>

						<p>Finding the Thermometer this morning at 12 when I rose, and the Snow upon

							till 3 in the afternoon, and wrote before breakfast upon my war chapter—
							I wrote a note to <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Brent</persRef> enquiring if he had not more numbers of
							the S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg Journal, and he sent me
							two with a note, to say that was all he had— I was ashore; and thought I
							should have no stores for my campaign, but the English Annual Register,
							when I received a Letter from <persRef ref="blunt-joseph"
								>Blunt</persRef>; with the French Annuaire Historique Universel pour
							1828. par <persRef ref="lesur-charles">C. L. Lesur</persRef>—a work
							which it appears has been published yearly, commencing with 1818. It is
							in imitation of the plan of the English Annual Register; but with
							various modifications. I found upon a cursory glance at the Chapters
							upon Russian and Turkish Affairs, that it was more copious, more
							interesting and more impartial than the corresponding chapters in the
							English work. I gave to it the remainder of the day. I had read in the
							morning from the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> to the 20<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of the Epistles to <persRef
								ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>— They turn upon many things
							which without a commentary I cannot understand— Upon his extreme anxiety
							to get rid of his proconsulship, after one year of service— The cause of
							which he explains in a few lines of the 15<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Letter—“The field is not large enough for that excursive
							Spirit, with which you are not unacquainted. It is incredibly tedious to
							me— There is no splendour of service for my industry. I forsooth am
							dispensing justice at Laodicea, and <persRef ref="plotius-aulus">Aulus

							have the name of Commander of two scanty Legions? In short I do not want
							these things. I want light, the forum, the City, my home, you. I will
							bear this, as well as I can— But let it be only for a year.” The Picture
							that he draws of his own practice in the Government of the Province,
							contrasted with that of those who preceded him, gives but a gloomy idea
							of the Roman proconsular rule— The 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Letter gives the account of his taking Pindenissae on the day of the
							Saturnalia, and of his being saluted as Imperator— “My encampment says
							he, for a few days upon the Issus the same that was occupied against
								<persRef ref="darius-iii">Darius</persRef>, by <persRef

						<p>Finding my Thermometer this morning at 6. I was deterred from walking
							before breakfast; but observed the effect of holding a lanthern before

							should be indebted for it entirely to me— I sent him to Algiers in 1825
							to learn as many of the oriental languages as he could; and he has
							learnt Arabic, Turkish, Persian, and the lingua franca— I walked between
							two and four— Met <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript"

							I had a recollection of the facts in this case— I told him I had, and
							what they were; and I read to him the passages in my Diary during the

							with Spain, France or England, I insisted invariably upon all the claims
							of the United States to their utmost extent: and whenever any thing was
							conceded it was by direction of the President himself, and always after

						<p>In my walk this morning, I met <persRef ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice

							walked down with me to its termination opposite the yard of the Treasury
							building. I asked him who, since the decease of the late <persRef
								ref="washington-bushrod">Judge Washington</persRef>, was the owner
							of <persRef ref="washington-george">President Washington’s</persRef>
							papers. He said he did not know but that they were now in the possession
							of <persRef ref="sparks-jared">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sparkes</persRef> who was to publish his Letters, and some of the
							Letters to him— I asked the judge if there ever had been an adjudication
							in England, of the <hi rend="italic">property</hi> of Epistolary
							Correspondence— He knew of none. I mentioned the opinion or statement in
							a late number of the North American Review, that the property is in the
							writer of the Letter, to whom or to whose Representatives it ought to be
							returned after the decease of the receiver— He said he had formed no
							deliberate opinion upon the question, but that his first crude
							impression was that the property was in the receiver, a property
							qualified by the confidence of the writer— I mentioned to him the
							extraordinary character of the recent publication of <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson’s</persRef> papers; which have given rise to a scene as
							extraordinary in the Senate of the United States— Jefferson makes a
							minute 13 February 1801. that <persRef ref="livingston-edward">Edward
								Livingston</persRef> told him, <persRef ref="bayard-james"
								>Bayard</persRef> had offered <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">Sam.
								Smith</persRef> the Office of Secretary of War, if he would vote for
								<persRef ref="burr-aaron">Burr</persRef> which <persRef
								ref="nicholas-wilson">W. C. Nicholas</persRef> had confirmed. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s Executor now publishes this
							minute— <persRef ref="hayne-robert">Hayne</persRef> last week to gratify
							the malignity of his nature, reads from a volume of Jefferson’s works,
							his tale of my having told him that certain federalists in New-England,
							during the War plotted a dismemberment of the Union during the late War—
							No answer was made to this: but <persRef ref="clayton-john"
								>Clayton</persRef> a Senator from Delaware, read this minute about
							Bayard; and called upon Sam Smith and Edward Livingston to say whether
							it was true. Smith declared in the most explicit manner that neither
							Bayard nor any other man ever made any such proposal to him. Edward
							Livingston said he had tasked his memory to the utmost, and had been
							unable to recollect anything about it— <persRef ref="benton-thomas"
								>Benton</persRef> bristled up, and blustered about attempts to
							impeach the veracity of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson—
							Clayton answered that his object was not to impeach <pb n="371"
								type="ms"/>the veracity of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson,
							but to vindicate the character of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard,
							and that he had attained his object— That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Benton had chosen to fall into a furious passion about it, which to him
							Clayton was a matter of great Indifference— I said the most
							extraordinary part of this minute of Jefferson’s was that it was the
							direct reverse of the real fact: as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bayard had told me what passed at that interview between him and Smith—
							The Judge said he had also told it to him. He added that he himself had
							been here, a witness of that Scene—altogether indifferent upon which of
							the two men the choice of the house would fall, and that by comparing
							what he then saw, with what afterwards came to pass, there were certain
							conclusions which it was very difficult to resist—but he did not say
							what they were. I suppose he meant that Livingston, who was there making
							his own bargain for his vote; told Jefferson this tale of Bayard’s
							offers to Smith, to make Jefferson out-bid Burr for Livingston’s own
							vote— Livingston was accordingly appointed District Attorney at
							New-York; and in due time went off with a hundred thousand dollars of
							the public money, to Louisiana: the judgment for which has never been
							paid till within the last six Months— I passed this day at home without

							I had visits this Evening from <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi

								ref="taliaferro-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John

							before the Supreme Court— He forgot to bring with him the paper that I
							had lent him at Philadelphia— He comes to sustain a cause in which the
							States of New-Jersey and New-York are at issue. I read three Letters of
							the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Book of the Epistles to <persRef
								ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>— In the preceding book there
							are three of four Letters of apology concerning a pecuniary interest of
								<persRef ref="brutus-marcus">Brutus</persRef> in no wise creditable
							to him. Bonds had been taken from the inhabitants of Salamis to one
								<persRef ref="scaptius-marcus">Scaptius</persRef>—for a large sum of
							money. Scaptius with a Troop of Horse furnished him by <persRef
								ref="pulcher-appius">Appius</persRef> another Proconsul, had
							summoned the Senate of Salamis; and surrounding with his horsemen the
							place of their meeting to compel them to pay the money; held them in
							duress till five of the Senators perished with Hunger— <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> upon his arrival hearing of
							this, not only took away the horsemen from Scaptius, but even sent them
							out of the Island— But he sent for the Salaminian Senators and obtained
							a promise from them to pay the money within the terms allowed by Law;
							terms which Scaptius rejected, insisting upon usurious interest. It
							appears that Brutus took much offence at Cicero’s humane interference,
							and finally made known that the debt was really due to him, and that the
							name of Scaptius was merely a cover to the transaction— Cicero complains
							that all the Letters of Brutus to him are haughty and overbearing— The
							Letters of the seventh Book were written precisely when the civil war
							between <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="pompey">Pompey</persRef> was kindling. Cicero saw distinctly
							what a fearful thing it was, and to what fatal consequences it must
							lead. His Letters are full of the embarrassments of his own situation—
							He saw that the cause of Pompey was the cause of his Country; but that
							Caesar in all probability would prevail; and <pb n="372" type="ms"/>even
							if Pompey should be victorious there would still be an end of public
							liberty. In the third Letter he answers a question which Atticus had
							just put to him in one of his: what he would say—when the question
							should be asked of him in Senate “What say you, Marcus Tullius?[”] I
							will answer says he “I concur with Cneius Pompeius—but I will privately
							advise Pompey to an accommodation— For this is my Sentiment—the danger
							is extreme, you who are at Rome know best—but this I see that we have to
							do with a man desperately audacious, and prepared for every thing—that
							every convict, every man of ruined reputation, every man who <hi
								rend="italic">deserves</hi> conviction or infamy, goes for him;
							almost all the young men, all that worthless rabble of the City, the
							popular tribunes, with <persRef ref="cassius">Caius Cassius</persRef>,
							and the whole tribe of insolvent debtors—far more numerous I learn, that
							I had expected— That Cause wants nothing but a Cause— In every thing
							else it abounds.”— This picture was as true as it was gloomy.</p>

								Frothingham</persRef> called, and mentioned, that he proposed to
							leave the City; on Monday morning, to return to Boston. I invited him to
							dine with us to-morrow; which he promised. There was an auction of Books
							this Evening, which my Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef>
							attended— I wrote to <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and
							continued writing upon the chapter of the Russian and Turkish War— I
							read from the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> to the 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Epistle of the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Book to <persRef ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>— In
							all these Letters he shews the most earnest desire to avoid the civil
							War; and time after time repeats that he thinks it would be much better
							to yield to <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef> every thing
							that he required, than to set him at defiance by War. In the 6<hi

							adds you will enquire “what think you? Not what I shall say— I <hi
								rend="italic">think</hi> every thing is to be done, to avoid the
							resort to arms: I shall <hi rend="italic">say</hi> the same as <persRef
								ref="pompey">Pompey</persRef>: nor am I ashamed so to do— This is
							another sore evil in the Commonwealth: and for particular reasons it
							would not be right for me to differ from Pompey in affairs of so much
							importance.” In the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> after repeating his
							opinion that for the sake of Peace, Caesar’s demands should be complied
							with, he adds “you say, make battle, sooner than submit. but how—if
							vanquished to be proscribed? if victorious, still to be enslaved? What
							then you ask, will you do?— Like the herd—when turned out they follow
							the flock of their own kind— As the bullock in the herd, so I will
							follow, the good men, or those who are called good; though they rush to
							ruin.” In the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> he tells of a
							conversation he had had with Pompey, who did not appear to him even to
							desire Peace— He had a vehement contempt for Caesar, in the Event of
							War; and entire confidence in his own force and in that of the Republic.
							In the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> he tells Atticus, of the sudden
							stop he had taken to leave the City, before day, and says He knows not
							what Pompey will do—“But unless I am insane, every thing yet done has
							been foolish and heedless”— In the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							there are excellent moral reflections upon the madness and wretchedness
							of Caesar’s conduct; and upon the humiliating abandonment of the City by
							Pompey. In the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> he mentions a
							conference he had held with the <persRef ref="lentulus-publius">Consul
								Lentulus</persRef> at Formiae— All he says was full of fear and of
							error— In all these Letters he asks advice from Atticus what he shall
							do, and how he shall dispose of <persRef ref="terentia">his
								wife</persRef>, <persRef ref="tullia">daughter</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus2">Son</persRef>, as well as of himself.

								Frothingham</persRef> from Romans 6.1 [“]What shall we say then?
							shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? 2. God forbid.” This
							Sermon was quite equal to those I had heard the two preceding Sunday— It
							was upon the abuse of the goodness of God 1. By ingratitude 2. by
							transgression 3. By impenitence— The introduction, explained the
							occasion upon which this sentiment was expressed by the <persRef
								ref="paul">Apostle</persRef>— As the conclusion of an Argument from
							the abounding mercies of God, surpassing even the sins of his creatures—
							This occasion he said had passed away— It was applicable to the converts
							to Christianity of that age, and could have no reference to the
							circumstances of our own times. But there was a slight modification of
							it quite applicable at this day, and to multitudes of our fellow
							Christians of whom if we could not say shall we continue in sin, in
							order that grace may abound; it might with great propriety be asked,
							shall we continue in Sin, <hi rend="italic">because</hi> Grace abounds?
							This was but too common— And he illustrated each of the points in which
							he had specified the abuses of the divine goodness, with great
							force—enlarging especially in beautiful language, and by no common place
							thoughts upon the vice of intemperence. The composition of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s Sermons, is remarkable among
							other merits by the method of his divisions: resembling those of the
							French preachers; particularly <persRef ref="massillon-jean"
								>Massillon</persRef>. After the morning Service I called to see
								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener’s</persRef>, where I found young
								<persRef ref="u">Fulton</persRef>, who introduced himself to me. The
							Baron told me that two Naval Officers, <persRef ref="u">Captain
								Avinoff</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Amossoff</persRef>, with whom he sent me Cards a few
							days since, were at his house. He said he was about purchasing a
							Corvette of 30 Guns which had been built at Philadelphia, for the
							Mexican Government, but which had remained here because it had not been
							paid for. He said that these Officers had been sent here to visit and
							examine our naval Establishments— That <persRef ref="hull-isaac">Captain
								Hull</persRef> had been very obliging in shewing them the Navy-Yard
							here; and that the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> had
							spoken to him in liberal terms, upon the subject of their inquiries. But
							he thought they had met with some obstacles, which would not have
							occurred under the preceding Administration; particularly in regard to
							the construction of the powder magazines, in our ships of War— I had a
							long conversation with the Baron upon the present state of the Affairs
							of Greece, which I told him I thought it would yet take a long time to
							settle— He said he was going in a few days to Philadelphia; to stay
							there perhaps a fortnight, and then return here. As I was coming home I
							met at my door, <persRef ref="white-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> White</persRef> the Delegate from Florida, who was
							calling to pay me a visit— He has obtained the withdrawal of nomination

							it would be impossible to collect a number of infamous and degraded
							characters <pb n="374" type="ms"/>in the list of Officers of the United
							States, equal to that in the list of Nominations now before the Senate.
							He had hoped that the whole tribe of Editors of Newspapers would be

							ever being controuled hereafter— Possibly <persRef ref="hill-isaac"
								>Isaac Hill</persRef> might be rejected; he feared no other of the

							believed would be rejected. The evidence of his infamy, in transactions
							of private Life was accessible, and would if necessary be produced. But
							I very strongly doubt whether any one of the nominations will be
							rejected. He said that with regard to the arbitrary removals from
							Office; there was not an entire agreement between the opponents of the
							present Administration themselves as to the Constitutional principle— He
							inclined to the opinion that the concurrence of the Senate to the
							removal may be inferred as necessary, because it is necessary for an
							appointment— But some were of opinion that the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">president</persRef> had only the power of
							suspending an Officer, and if the person whom he nominated as Successor
							should be rejected by the Senate, then the previous incumbent still
							continued in Office— I said that the Discretionary power of the
							President to remove was settled by Law, and by the uniform practice of
							forty years, I thought it correctly settled; but if the discretion was
							palpably abused, I thought it impeachable misdemeanor— In questioning
							however this abuse of power, I thought it would be unsafe and certainly
							unsuccessful to advance any new principle. He said there would be a call

							nearly as profligate as the present, and recover from it to pure and
							quiet elections— I hope that it may do so again. Every present symptom
							indeed is gloomy and discouraging—every thing looks to decay and not to

						<p>No interruption, and after the morning walk, I had a continual pressure
							of occupation; writing little but reading almost the whole day— I
							finished the Book of Ecclesiasticus; or Wisdom of the Son of Sirach;
							which I have often read before; and always with much satisfaction— It
							was written during the time of the Ptolemies, and after the age of
								<persRef ref="plato">Plato</persRef>. It is in imitation of the
							Proverbs of <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>; but like most of
							the other Aprocryphal books with the continuity of thought usual in
							Greek compositions— It is remarkable that in the Scriptures, excepting
							one or two allusions in <persRef ref="paul">Paul’s</persRef> Epistles,
							there is no reference to the Grecian Literature. They appear to have had
							no acquaintance with it— Nor had any of the Grecian writers any
							acquaintance with the Literature of the Hebrews— <persRef ref="juvenal"
								>Juvenal</persRef> and <persRef ref="tacitus">Tacitus</persRef> had
								<hi rend="italic">heard</hi> something of the Hebrew Books, but
							certainly did not understand them— <persRef ref="longinus-cassius">Longinus</persRef> quotes the first chapter of
							Genesis, for an example of sublimity; but when Longinus lived
							Christianity was soon to become the Religion of the Roman Empire <pb
								n="375" type="ms"/>The Grecian principles of composition would have
							been improved by a critical analysis of the Hebrew Books— Sententious
							sayings in Greece preceded the continuous Style— The figurative language
							of <persRef ref="pythagoras">Pythagoras</persRef>, was more obscure than
							the Proverbs of Solomon— The Sayings of the Wise men of Greece were much
							of the same character— The Son of Sirach is more diffusive and more
							didactic— It resembles an Edition of the Proverbs of Solomon with a
							Commentary— The morals inculcated in the book are righteousness, Piety
							to God, Reverence to Parents and to old age— Severe discipline to
							children, prudence, temperance, Justice, and Fortitude— There is great
							change in passing from these to the Epistles of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>— I have read within the last
							three days from the 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> to the 26<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and last Letter of the 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Book, and twelve of the eighth Book. In
							this last there are two Letters from <persRef ref="pompey"
								>Pompey</persRef> to Cicero, requesting him to come to him at
							Brundisium; with Cicero’s Answers, declining to go— There is also a
							Letter from Pompey to the Consuls <persRef ref="marcellus-caius">Caius
								Marcellus</persRef>, and <persRef ref="lentulus-lucius">Lucius
								Lentulus</persRef>; and three Letters from Pompey to <persRef
								ref="ahenobarbus-lucius">Lucius Domitius</persRef>. The Letters of
							Pompey are all well written— Throughout these Books, Cicero continues to
							shew extreme solicitude and anxiety what he shall do— His friendship for
							Pompey constrains him to follow his fortunes, while his opinion is that
								<persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef> will prevail, and he
							has evidently a much higher opinion of Caesar’s abilities than of
							Pompey’s— The characters of the two men are well exhibited in <persRef
								ref="lucanus-marcus">Lucan’s</persRef> Pharsalia— I have also looked
							into the first Book of Caesar’s Commentaries on the Civil War, to mark
							how he tells his own Story. He does not make it much better— It is a
							piteous tale to read— My chapter on the Turkish and Russian War
							harrasses me— I am drawing towards a close of the campaign of 1828—and
							was hunting up the Journal of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg
							for accounts of that of 1829. which I must collect from the Russian
							Bulletins— It will be a long and very tedious compilation.</p>

						<p>Rose two hours later than my usual time, and was proportionably belated

							make way for <persRef ref="moore-thomas3">Tom P. Moore</persRef>, a man
							generally despised, but who has ingratiated himself with <persRef
								ref="bolivar-simon">Bolivar</persRef> as he did with <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> by sycophancy—
							Harrison was but a short time there; but long enough to get involved in
							some of their party divisions— It was perhaps impossible to avoid it—
							Harrison says that Bolivar’s friends openly avow their purpose to make
							Bolivar king or Emperor and say that General Jackson intends to do the
							same in this Country. He says also that he did not while he was
							Minister, take any part in the internal dissensions of that People, but
							that after he had been succeeded by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Moore, he had written a Letter to General Bolivar, to dissuade him from
							the establishment of a Monarchy— Which Letter he said he intended to
							publish. I asked him if it was true that Venezuela had determined to
							separate from the Republic of Colombia— He thought it would, if Bolivar
							should assume the Crown— This however he believed he would not do. He
							would content himself with the title of President for Life— He said that
							Bolivar had applied to the British Government, for support to his
							project of establishing a Monarchy and the answer was that Great Britain
							took a deep interest in the welfare of the people of Colombia, but would
							not interfere with their interior Government. If they should however
							call a European Prince to the throne, no English Prince could accept it,
							and there would be great inconvenience should the choice fall upon any
							other than a Prince of Spain. The conduct of Bolivar, has for many years
							been equivocal— As a Military Leader, his course has been despotic and
							sanguinary— His principles of Government have been <pb n="376" type="ms"
							/>always monarchical, but for himself he has repeatedly played off the
							farce of renouncing his power and going into retirement— He still holds
							out this pretence, while at the same time he cannot disguise his
							hankering after a crown— <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi

							the Republic has fallen? how keen—how watchful—how ready— Faith if he
							should commit no murder or robbery, they who have most dreaded him will
							come most to love him— In the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> he
							encloses copy of a Letter from <persRef ref="balbus-lucius"
								>Balbus</persRef> to him, earnestly entreating him to use his
							influence to reconcile Caesar and Pompey together; and protesting that
							Caesar will do any thing that he Cicero should advise, and that he has a

								<persRef ref="pompey">Pompey</persRef> had abandoned Rome and fled
							to Brundisium: pursued and besieged by <persRef ref="caesar-julius"
								>Caesar</persRef>— <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> was
							all this time at Formiae; undetermined whether to follow Pompey, to go
							to Rome, or to remain where he was— Caesar neither proscribed portions
							nor plundered private property. Pompey threatened both, and many of his
							partizans, did so more than himself. Cicero was constantly reproaching
							himself for not following Pompey, and constantly censuring Pompey’s
							conduct— The 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Letter in this book, is
							more than half in Greek—a Series of questions which he says he is
							discussing with himself, as to the duties of a Citizen, in various
							cases, when his Country is oppressed by a tyrant— There is a Letter from
							Caesar to Cicero, requesting him to meet him at Rome; and assist him
							with his Counsels; his dignity, and his reputation.— A Similar Letter
							from <persRef ref="balbus-lucius">Balbus</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="oppius-gaius">Oppius</persRef> to Cicero, and one from Balbus
							alone. Caesar felt the want of the countenance of so distinguished a
							Man. The tenth Letter is a long review of all the Letters recently
							received by him from Atticus. In speaking of Pompey; he says that at the
							bottom of his Soul, he Sullaturises and proscripturises. Meaning to say
							that he intends to follow the example of <persRef ref="sylla-lucius"
								>Sylla’s</persRef> proscriptions.</p>

							Greece; and I should lament much that you have done against <persRef
								ref="pompey">Pompey</persRef>— But said Caesar, I will not have

							where I must either speak thus, and say many other things about which it
							would be impossible for me to be there—or else not to go— Caesar finally
							asked him to think further of it; which Cicero promised—and they parted—
							From that Time Cicero waited only for an opportunity to cross over into

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Norton</persRef> who called upon

								<persRef ref="norton-hariet">his daughter</persRef>. Tracy is now a

							the anti-masonic fever came on in the State of New-York— Norton said in
							substance that it was going on conquering and to conquer— That it had
							elected, and his Son in Law Tracy to the Senate of New-York. That he
							believed it would carry the next election for Governor of New-York; and
							they expected would next year command Majorities in Massachusetts and
							Pennsylvania— He said he had a Letter from M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Tracy, advising them here to take no part in favour of
							either of the old hack candidates for the next Presidency; meaning
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef>; <persRef

								>Clay</persRef>—for that the Antimasons might very probably be able
							hereafter to start and carry a Candidate of their own; or at all Events
							decide the contest by throwing their weight into the Scale of the one
							whom they should prefer. I asked Clark if he was not himself a Mason— He
							said he had been—but that he had renounced the craft before this
							question about <persRef ref="morgan-william2">Morgan</persRef> had
							arisen— Clark enquired of me, if I had not told <persRef
								ref="storrs-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Storrs</persRef>,
							that I knew <persRef ref="platt-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Platt</persRef> whom I had caused to be appointed Postmaster at
							Utica, to be a Jackson man— I said I had some recollection of having
							told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Storrs, that I had heard so— Clark
							said he himself had been a candidate for the Office, and had been well
							satisfied with the appointment of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Platt—
							That Platt had now been removed, and a third person had been appointed
							in his place— That they were all three Jackson men, and he wanted to get
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Platt restored— I told him that <pb
								n="380" type="ms"/>if I had known Platt to be a Jackson Man, that
							had been no recommendation of him to me— That I should have preferred
							the appointment of a friend of my own, but I directed the appointment of
							Platt, because he was best qualified for the place and was most desired
							by the Inhabitants of the Place— I had been exceedingly censured by my
							friends for appointing Jackson men at all, and I had certainly not
							appointed them in preference to my own friends with pleasure— I had
							neither appointed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Platt nor him because
							they were Jackson men— He said that <hi rend="italic">he</hi>, had been
							for Jackson, because he was against any person’s being President more
							than one term— But there was a more conclusive impulse with him than
							that— He saw it was likely to be the strongest side— The <persRef

								Joshua N. Danforth</persRef>— They said they had collected nearly
							contributions enough for the erection of their buildings, and when that
							should be completed they hoped they should not need to beg any longer— A
							man by the name of <persRef ref="u">Stewart</persRef> brought me a Razor
							Strop superior as he said to all others, which he left with me to try—
							My reading and writing tries me by peine forte et dure.— In the Bible I
							am upon the prophet <persRef ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef>— Sublime
							beyond all written composition, in some particular passages—obscure,
							unintelligible almost throughout— A collection of rhapsodies, without
							apparent connection with one another—wild and wonderful—and of which it
							seems to me the more I read, the less I understand— The National
							Intelligencer had this day half a recent speech of <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>, which has been much celebrated in reply to a
							violent invective against him of <persRef ref="hayne-robert">A. Y.
								Hayne</persRef>— It fills almost two sides of the paper, and the
							other half is to come on Thursday. It is defensive of himself, and of
							New-England, but carries the war effectively into the enemy’s Territory—
							It is a remarkable instance of readiness in debate—a reply of at least
							four hours to a Speech, of equal length— It demolishes the whole fabrick
							of Hayne’s speech so that it leaves scarcely the wreck to be seen— There
							was also in the National Journal a third part of a speech of <persRef
								ref="barton-david">Barton</persRef>, Senator from Missouri in the
							same debate; as severe upon <persRef ref="benton-thomas"
								>Benton</persRef> his Colleague as Webster’s upon Hayne— This debate
							is a symptom of the Times— Personalities, malignities and hatreds seem
							to take the place of all enlarged <pb n="381" type="ms"/>discussions of
							public concerns.— I read also yesterday and this day the 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> book of the Epistles to <persRef
								ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>— There are 25 of them, written
							partly while he was with <persRef ref="pompey">Pompey</persRef> in

							returned, and where he remained a whole year, not daring to return to

								ref="cicero-quintus">Quintus</persRef> with <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus2">his Son</persRef>, not only deserted him, but
							endeavoured to make their own Peace with Caesar by accusing him— In the

								Tudor</persRef> called upon me to say that there was here an Italian
							Gentlemen, who had a Letter from General Washington written to his
							father, and who wished to pay me a visit. I received him, and his name
							is <persRef ref="dalverme-vitaliano">Dal Verme</persRef>, brother to
								<persRef ref="dalverme-jacques">one of the same name</persRef> who
							visited me three or four Summers since at Quincy. This person like his
							brother appears to be merely a visitor of curiosity. He has been three
							or four Months in this Country at Boston—New-York &amp;c— He told me
							that before he came to this Country he had visited Russia and Persia;
							about the latter of which I asked him some questions— He told me that
							the <persRef ref="fath-ali">Shah of Persia</persRef> had about two
							hundred children— That eleven of them were Governors of Provinces; and
							that was the Reason why he had prevailed upon Russia to recognize
								<persRef ref="abbasmirza">Abbas Mirza</persRef>, by Treaty as his
							Successor. <persRef ref="westbrook-cornelius">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Westbrook</persRef> and <persRef ref="rapalje-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rapalje</persRef>, are from
							Fish-kill Landing, and brought Letters of Introduction from my niece
								<persRef ref="dewindt-caroline">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> De
								Wint</persRef>. The propose leaving the city to return home
							to-morrow Morning. I finished the Chapter upon Turkey in 1828 and
							commenced that upon the campaign of 1829. This last is the most arduous
							part of the work which now absorbs too exclusively my time— I am reading
							over the second Time an Article in the Quarterly Review of last
							November, upon European Turkey; an Article of 44 pages, reviewing four
							books upon Turkey and the whole purport of which is to shew that the
							Ottoman Nation “is the bitterest enemy to the human race, and the
							severest scourge that was ever sent by Providence to chastise mankind”
							and yet manifesting the most extreme anxiety for the preservation of its
							power; and the most unappeasable jealousy of Russia— At this second
							reading I observe with concern how little remained upon my memory of the
							first— Nor is it by many degrees the only evidence I have of the decay
							of Memory— It is vain to weep or pray upon this subject, but if it may
							render me suitably distrustful of the other faculties of the mind which
							must also be upon the decline—if it may render me less dogmatical in my
							own opinions and more charitable to those of others—if it may prepare me
							for resignation to the will ofHeaven under all the privations which must
							henceforth accumulate upon me, and if it may set me upon seeking with
							sincerity the means of protracting the possession of what remains; and
							of supplying it with aids and resources, the calamity may yet be
							mitigated, and old Age may be not without either its usefulness or its
							pleasures. I received this morning a Letter from <persRef
								ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph Blunt</persRef>, which I answered and sent
							him my fifth parcel of four sheets.</p>

						<p>I had a sprinkling of rain in my walk this morning. No visitor the whole
							day long except <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B. Johnson</persRef>— Working upon
							the campaign of 1829. with no other guide than the French Journal of
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg, and a very imperfect
							file of that— The bulletin’s and Reports from the commanding Generals
							are so copious that they would, make of themselves a large volume, but
							the task is to abridge, and to read at the same time with a Spirit of
							criticism, and it is military criticism— To select from a despatch of
							four or six folio pages, the incidents which constitute the import part
							of the transaction to reduce them within a narrow compass, and to
							connect them together in a regular chain of narrative is a task worthy
							of a thinking mind, and to compress the whole so as to make it
							interesting to the general reader is still more difficult— It severely
							tries my industry and intellect; and now absorbs at least six hours
							every day of my time. In the campaign of 1829. two Russian Armies, were
							in great and constant activity at the same time—one in Asia, the Army of
							the Caucasus— The other the Army upon and beyond the Danube, which
							finally crossed the Balkans and dictated Peace at Adrianople— The
							cotemporaneous movements of these army must be so managed in the
							narrative that they may not interfere with each other— This is new work
							to me, and presses anxiously upon me— <persRef key="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> and <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> dined
							at <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Park Custis</persRef>, of Arlington House— The other day, on the
							anniversary of <persRef ref="washington-george">Washington’s</persRef>
							birthday, <persRef ref="mitchell-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mitchell</persRef> of Maryland moved for a Committee, to consider of

							transportation of her husbands remains to the Capitol, upon condition
							that she herself should be transported with him, and that some promise
							to that effect was made to her by <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Custis’s Letter was
							to enquire if there was any evidence of this in my father’s papers, and
							if there was, to request that I would communicate it to the Committee I
							examined the Papers and Letter Books that I have here; but found
							nothing.</p>

							not have gone near a man, who had dismissed not only him but his Son

								Brent</persRef> to lend me from the Department of State <persRef
								ref="mill-james">Mills’s</persRef> History of British India, which
							he promised— I have read the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Book of
							the Epistles to <persRef ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>— There
							are 53 of them, all short. Written after he had been relieved from the
							apprehension of being proscribed by <persRef ref="caesar-julius"
								>Caesar</persRef>; after the death of his daughter <persRef
								ref="tullia">Tullia</persRef>. Many of them relate to his project of
							building a Fane; as a permanent sepulchral Monument— He justifies
							himself for his extreme affliction at the loss of his daughter, and
							repeatedly declares that his only consolation is in writing for
							publication— There is more obscurity in these Letters than in those of
							the preceding Books— Many of them are intentionally obscure—broken
							hints— Allusions to things which had passed between them, and which
							would not have been understood even by his cotemporaries— The perpetual
							interlarding of Greek returns— In the time of his great distresses he
							had dropped his Greek— In the 49<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Letter
							there is a broad hint that he wishes Caesar may be assassinated— Eum
							συνναον Quirino malo quam Saluti— I had rather he should share a Temple
							with <persRef ref="quirinus">Quirinus</persRef> than with Safety. If
							this Letter had been intercepted by Caesar he would have understood it
							in an instant. The Letters have much about purchasing Gardens; and much
							about his philosophical treatises which he was then composing: He
							mentions frequently his wife <persRef ref="terentia">Terentia</persRef>,
							but always so as not to disclose his meaning.</p>

						<p><date>27. IV. </date>Saturday. Sun rose 6:26.</p>
						<p>I rose at four and walk round the Capitol Square, returning before
							Sun-rise: but from the eastern window he is intercepted. I had no
							visitors, but was closely engaged all day in the Russian and Turkish War
							pushing on with the Campaign of <persRef ref="paskevitch-ivan">Count
								Paskevitch</persRef> of Erivan in 1829— This is mere drudgery, to
							pick out a connected narrative from a succession of Reports and
							Bulletins— There is also the inconvenience that all these materials are
							of one side—the Turks having neither bulletins nor printing presses. It
							is probable that if the other side should also tell their story, the
							Russian victories would not be quite so splendid, and would appear to
							have been rather more dearly purchased. There is some difficulty in
							abridging narratives of sieges and battles; and for a person not
							practically familiar with them some hazard of committing ridiculous
							blunders— But I drive through my work, hoping that it will take me not
							more than another fortnight— I read twenty Letters of the 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Book of the Epistles to <persRef
								ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>— They appear to have been
							written principally at Asturae— They relate among other things to his
							composition of the Books de Oratore de Finibus the Academic Questions,
							and de Officiis— He was long determining whether to address one of the
							Books to <persRef ref="varro-marcus">Varro</persRef> or not— Also of the
							persons whom he shall introduce as Interlocutors. He speaks with high
							self-approbation upon the books de Oratore— The Letters are again filled
							with Greek; and his language is very difficult to understand, having
							been purposefully written <pb n="384" type="ms"/>as he says in one place
							αφεϛερος, and in another διa σεμειων. What he apprehended his
							correspondent himself would not understand cannot be very easy to a
							reader of this age, and the Graeco Latin Glossary in the Clavis does not
							always explain the Greek words so as to make them intelligible— I have
							also read in the English Quarterly Review an Article upon the Life and
							writings of <persRef ref="parr-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Samuel Parr</persRef>, which has led me to some reflections— Parr
							was a whig, and the greatest Classical Scholar in England. The reviewer
							is a Tory, and while acknowledging the Genius and Learning, and amiable
							character of Parr, constantly labours to make him ridiculous; and to
							disparage the application of his Talents— There needs another side of
							the subject to be seen: for the Reviewer makes out his case, by shewing
							the grossest inconsistencies of opinion, in Parr’s correspondence, and
							although there are eight Volumes of the Works there is no one great work
							to go down to Posterity— The criticisms upon the Sermons, upon the
							Epitaphs, upon the Style of Parr, are written in a Spirit of unkindness;
							but are yet plausible— Living it is good to receive instruction from an
							enemy Dead, it is glorious to receive extorted commendation from a foe—
							We saw this day the death of <persRef ref="brooks-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> P. C. Brooks</persRef>, announced in
							the New-York American— She died last Sunday A heavy loss to her husband
							and family—</p>

								Adams</persRef> and <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> went
							with me and heard <persRef ref="campbell-john">M<hi rend="superscript"

							treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where

							visits from <persRef ref="barrell-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barrell</persRef>, who introduced <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bruin</persRef> a stranger from
							New-York, and from <persRef ref="dwight-henry">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Dwight</persRef>. I asked him to enquire of <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>, if he had within the last fortnight sent me a
							note which had received no answer; and told him that yesterday for the
							first time, I had heard there was such a note, which had been delivered
							to a servant at the door, but which I had never received— He promised to
							make the enquiry, and to let me know. <persRef ref="white-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> White</persRef> of Florida called upon
							me this afternoon, and brought me <persRef ref="white-eleanor">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> White’s</persRef> Album, in which she
							requested that I would write some lines. White says that the Judiciary
							committee of the Senate have unanimously reported against the
							confirmation, of two nominations to office in Florida, against which he
							protested; and he had no doubt they would be rejected. He told me of a
							conversation he had lately entertained with <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
								>Calhoun</persRef> the Vice-President, in which White suggested to
							him the injudiciousness of the violent attacks of his partizans against
							New-England— That <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van-Buren</persRef> was
							taking advantage of it, and might have the whole Eastern influence
							thrown into his scale by it which otherwise Calhoun might expect for
							himself— He said Calhoun appeared to be exceedingly at a loss what to
							do. Said that he had been obliged by his position to take the lead in
							the opposition to <persRef ref="eaton-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Eaton</persRef>— That he did not know what things were
							coming to— <pb n="385" type="ms"/>That the payment of a National debt
							was in any Country a Revolution— That he had no feeling of
							unfriendliness to me, and would now have visited me, but for fears of
							its being misrepresented— That if I would have consulted him four years
							ago, and not have appointed <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> Secretary of State, I
							should now have been President of the United States &amp;c— White had
							this conversation with Calhoun, at the suggestion of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster—who told him that he should hold
							his course Independent of all parties; and should play second fiddle to
							no man— But wondered that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun did not
							see his own interest to avoid indisposing all New-England against him—
							White said Calhoun professed to have no apprehension that Clay would
							ever again be a formidable candidate for the Presidency— He also told me
							that <persRef ref="troup-george">Troup</persRef> had resigned his Seat
							as a Senator from Georgia, and that <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">W. H. Crawford</persRef> would be
							appointed in his place— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and
								<persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript"

								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">T. B. Johnson’s</persRef>. I heard M<hi

							Corinthians 10.11. “Now all these things happened unto them for
							ensamples: and they are written for our Admonition, upon whom the ends
