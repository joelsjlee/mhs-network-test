						<p><persRef ref="spear-william">William Spear</persRef> called here this
							morning and told me that <persRef ref="spear-daniel">his
								brother</persRef> had got poisoned last week in the woods, with
							dogwood— That his face was so much swollen and inflamed that he could
							not see, out of his eyes; and that he would not be able to hold the Sale
							of Lots of standing wood, advertised for next Thursday. As the
							advertisement has been sent into the neighbouring towns, he thought the
							sale could not be postponed, and proposed that it should be made by
								<persRef ref="thayer-minot">Minot Thayer</persRef> of Weymouth in
							his place; to which I assented. He said this dogwood poison generally
							kept a person confined about a week— <persRef ref="davenport-rufus">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rufus Davenport</persRef> was here,
							with one of his pamphlets for which I <pb n="23" type="ms"/>had
							subscribed, entitled “Right Aim” chiefly to urge the abolition of
							imprisonment for debt, and with proposals for other subscriptions, to be
							confined to the Ladies— I did not incline further to countenance this
							mode of mendicancy— In the Nursery I planted three Cross furrows West of
							the Alley; yet in the Stony barren—Juglans Porcina dulcis—with Chesnuts,
							Acorns and Apple seeds—one Medford Shagbark, and one English Walnut—
							Opened four Cross furrows East of the Alley— On this first day of
							November I observe the foliage of the trees. The leaves have fallen
							almost entirely from the Elms— They have changed colour upon all the
							Oaks, but a great part of those on the English Oaks are yet green— Those
							of the Peach trees, are of a dirty crimson and brown— Many of the young
							Apple trees yet retain their leaves; and some of them are still green—
							Those of the young Catalpa, are parched by the frost— I finished reading
								<persRef ref="pingre-alexandre">Pingré’s</persRef> translation of
							the Poem of <persRef ref="aratus-poet">Aratus</persRef> as translated by
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="grotius-hugo">Grotius</persRef>— The original Poem is extant;
							and it is that from which <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t.</hi> Paul</persRef> quoted half a line, in his Sermon to the
							Athenians— “For we are also his offspring.” This Poem was also
							translated into Latin verse, by <persRef ref="germanicus">Germanicus
								Caesar</persRef> and by <persRef ref="avienus-festus">Festus
								Avienus</persRef>— Fragments of which works are likewise extant. It
							is merely a poetical description of the Constellations of the Northern
							Hemisphere according to the Astronomical system of <persRef
								ref="eudoxus">Eudoxus</persRef>—but the work of <persRef
								ref="manilius-marcus">Manilius</persRef> is of the same kind, and
							far more comprehensive. But in these works every thing is artificial,
							fictitious and imaginary— Not one of the Constellations bears the most
							distant resemblance to the persons and animals from which they were
							named— With most of them fables of the Grecian Mythology are connected;
							but there is nothing in the aspect of the Constellations to remind you
							of them— To understand the Poem of Aratus you must first be perfectly
							familiar with the Grecian Mythology, and habitually familiar with the
							Nightly course of the Northern Constellations— The descriptions refer
							partly to the fabulous persons and their Stories, and partly to the
							configurations and motions of the Clusters of Stars— It is a poem much
							like the Loves of the Triangles— Among the Greeks there was Religion
							also mingled with it— Each of the Planets was a God— Many of the
							Constellations were families of divinities; and men and women and
							Animals and even inanimate objects like the Lyre of <persRef
								ref="orpheus">Orpheus</persRef>, the sword of <persRef ref="orion"
								>Orion</persRef>, the wheat ear of the virgin, and the Scales of
								<persRef ref="astraea">Astraea</persRef> were all placed among the
							Stars— The Poem of Aratus may yet afford amusement by comparing its
							descriptions, with the present courses of the Northern Constellations—
								<persRef ref="spear-lucretia">Lucretia Spear</persRef> left us this
							day— I attempted in the Evening to read an Article in the North American
							Review; but the Article or I was too sleepy— I read some part of
								<persRef ref="tudor-william2">W. Tudor’s</persRef> Journal.</p>

							and repeated the invitation to me, to be present at the Marriage, which

							the Orations of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> and one
							Section of the Oration for <persRef ref="quintius-publius"
								>Quintius</persRef>. The preface complains of the multitude of

							notes, of which he declares his purpose to select and republish a small
							portion— He promises a great part of those of <persRef
								ref="vettori-piero">Victorius</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="manutius-paulus">Manutius</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="lambin-denis">Lambinus</persRef> and <persRef ref="gruter-jan"

								ref="duc-fronton">Fronto Ducaeus</persRef>, whose learning and

							learning, but to your eloquence, and which is more desirable than all
							the rest to your virtue.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirke</persRef> brought me out from Boston
							last Evening a box of Chesnuts, Acorns and Sweet-gum Apples, which my
							Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> has sent me from
							Washington— I began planting them this Morning, in the furrows East of
							the Alley, from which the large Stones have been taken up— Few if any of
							them will come up— They were packed in Bran— All, with the exception of
							two or three Acorns, floated upon water. The Chesnuts had been very good
							but are dried up— The Chesnut and Acorn will not bear exposure to the
							air even for a very few days without losing their weight and their germ.
							It was but the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last month that I
							purchased six Quarts of Chesnuts, of a <persRef ref="jones-john6"
								>man</persRef> from N. Hampshire almost every one of which sunk in
							water— They have been kept in my chamber closet in a basket, and now at
							least one half of them float— I never shall have any success in planting
							while these properties of the seed are overlooked— The properties of the
							Soil are equally important, and those of the climate cannot be
							disregarded with impunity— With the Liquidamber Apples, and Chesnuts
							there are Red, black, Chesnut, Post, and Willow Oak Acorns; which I put
							into the ground with scarce an expectation that any one of them will
							come up— With them therefore I planted store of Apple seeds, and of
							Juglans Porcina, of which as it is a sort of weed among trees I promise
							myself a plentiful crop— I planted one singular shaped Hickory nut in
							its external shell, in a flower Pot— The white Oak Acorns which I
							planted in two glass tumblers the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of
							last Month, have pushed down—their tap roots so that one of them had
							this Morning reached the bottom of the glass— That is had grown four
							inches— That glass was out one Night, when there was a copious rain—
							This afternoon I rode up to <persRef ref="capen-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Capen’s</persRef>, and visited his
							nursery— He has many young apple, Pear, and Peach-trees for Sale. He
							shewed me <pb n="25" type="ms"/>also a variety of apples very large, but
							mostly worm-eaten— Among the rest, the golden and common Russet,
							Packham, Seek no further and Governor’s Apple, of the last of which I
							took one with me— Returning I sought in the <persRef
								ref="atherton-unknown">Atherton</persRef> pasture, for the wild pear
							tree, upon which I found last year several pears, but did not find it—
							But I did find a few more Atherton Crabs, and in the adjoining old
							Orchard a tree loaded with a small red Apple resembling in colour and
							appearance the Virginian Redstreak— Its taste was a mild and pleasant
							acid though without the flavour of the Redstreak— I gathered some of
							them to plant. Called at <persRef key="adams-thomas">my
								brother’s</persRef> as I was returning home, and borrowed of
								<persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef>, the genealogical
							family Chart— Read <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> for
								<persRef ref="quintius-publius">Quintius</persRef> before daylight,
							and <persRef ref="tudor-william2">William Tudor’s</persRef> journal of
							his Voyage from Boston to Valparaiso and Lima, in 1823 and 24— It is
							prefaced by a caution and apology to the reader for the dulness and
							minuteness of its contents— He was a solitary passenger with <persRef
								ref="u">Captain Gerry</persRef> to Valparaiso, and there embarked in
							the Franklin 74—then commanded by <persRef ref="stewart-charles"
								>Commodore Stewart</persRef>, <persRef ref="stewart-delia">his
								Sister’s</persRef> husband— She with <persRef ref="stewart-delia2"
								>her family</persRef> were then on board— The Journal is dull, and
							yet not uninteresting— The transitions of climate and Seasons three
							times in the course of a four Month’s voyage, are well-noted— No
							accident occurred on board the ships, and only two or three of those
							sudden and violent alarms to which all Sea voyages are liable— There
							were gales of wind, but no hurricanes, and breakers but no contact with
							them— The books that he read on the passage, were little worth,
							excepting <persRef ref="donquixote">Don Quixote</persRef> his remarks
							upon which and upon <persRef ref="cervantes-miguel">Cervantes</persRef>

							small parcels of land, adjoining to him at his house and on the Mount
							Wollaston farm beach— After visiting my Nursery, and planting two
							Eastern Cross rows, with Washington Chesnuts, Acorns and Liquidamber
							buttons, Juglans Porcina Amara. 1 Medford Shagbark, Apple-seeds,
							Stranger berries, and floating, White Oak Acorns, I went with <persRef
								ref="farrar-salmon">S. Farrar</persRef> to the Field, Joy, and
							Borland lots, where <persRef ref="thayer-minot">Minot Thayer</persRef>
							was selling at Auction my wood standing upon the Land, chiefly Pine— I
							found there was a considerable number of persons assembled— Fifty-one
							lots for purchasers were laid out and about half of them had been sold—
							The prices were low, but it was not probable that more would be obtained
							by postponing the Sale; and Thayer the Auctioneer who was bewailing
							aloud the very low rate at which the lots were successively struck off,
							whispered to me immediately afterwards, that they would probably never
							sell better— I directed two of the best lots to be reserved for my own
							consumption, and spoke to <persRef ref="spear-william">William
								Spear</persRef>, to cut the wood in the winter, and bring it to me
							in the Spring— I shall thus ascertain the average quantity of wood which
							is taken from each lot— A man named <persRef ref="beals-ezra">Ezra
								Beale</persRef> who purchased several Lots, said he had purchased
							one last year from which he had taken 13. Cords of wood, and had paid
							13. dollars for the Lot—and that it was the cheapest purchase of wood he
							had ever made— I believe the whole of my Sales last year, yielded me
							about that average—one dollar a Cord— And pinewood will not produce
							more— I came home about noon, and <pb n="26" type="ms"/>after dinner
							went with John Kirke to Boston— First to my Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> House and at six O’Clock to
								<persRef ref="mclean-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								M’lean’s</persRef> N. 44. Beacon Street, where I was present at the
							ceremony of her marriage, with <persRef ref="lee-william">M<hi

							performed by the <persRef ref="green-james">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Green</persRef>— There
							was a peculiarity in this solemnization, which excited feelings and
							reflections different from those of any other wedding at which I had
							ever been present— The parties are each about three score years of age—
							I knew them both in the heyday of youth before either of them was first
							married— I then also knew <persRef ref="mclean-john3;lee-susan2">their
								former Partners</persRef>, now in the grave— The numerous family of
							the Amory’s in both branches were social companions of my youth. Of six
							brothers of the present bride, the three Survivors <persRef
								ref="amory-john3">John</persRef>, <persRef ref="amory-rufus"
								>Rufus</persRef> and <persRef ref="amory-francis">Francis</persRef>

								ref="amory-rebecca">M<hi rend="supersccript">rs</hi>
								Lowell</persRef> with <persRef ref="lowell-john">her

							M’lean has no children; but about half the company present were of a

							<persRef ref="gray-john">John Gray</persRef>, <persRef ref="russell-joseph3">Joseph Russell</persRef>—

								>Thomas</persRef> was there, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Green prayed for him and <persRef ref="lee-susan;lee-mary">his
								Sisters</persRef>, as part of the marriage Service— This was one of
							the singularities of the occasion— The couple thus united cannot have

							faces where I had seen roses in bloom, were now furrowed, wrinkled and
							haggard— I too have gone through a corresponding change, and was an

							Shagbarks, and called at <persRef ref="briesler-john"
								>Briesler’s</persRef> shop for a new supply— Of a Barrell that he
							had, not more than a Pint and a half would sink in Water— Yet they have
							been kept in an open Barrell in a shop where there is no fire— This
							confirms all my preceding experience that these three kinds of seeds can
							be safely kept for planting only by covering them with damp earth or
							sand— My Acorns this day planted were those which I last gathered:
							probably too late in the Season— I attempt to keep, in damp sand, and
							earth a few Chesnuts and Shagbarks, to plant in the Spring— I came home
							to dinner, and returned to lay out the ground for the Orchard— <persRef
								ref="spear-lemuel">Lemuel Spear</persRef> was then there; with his
							brother— Measuring from the Eastern border, at the distances of two Rods
							each we marked the places for ten Trees, fronting the Road— Then
							Northward in a line parallel to the Eastern Border over fifteen furrows
							included within the Square places for 150 trees.— There was left on the
							Western side within the border space for four shortened rows, North and
							South, of 13. 11. 9. and 7. trees—say forty, and two short rows fronting
							the road, with 4. and 1.—whole number 195 trees— I proposed to Alpheus
							Spear to pick out for me at <persRef ref="capen-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Capen’s</persRef>, twenty-five trees,
							for the alternate places on the outer rows of the Square, thinking that
							if he picked them himself he would have a personal impulse to tend them
							more carefully, but he declined choosing the trees, and said his brother
							Lemuel understood more about trees than he did.— I told them I should
							put pumice in the places of the alternate stands, to raise the Stocks
							from the Seed— Lemuel thought it would be less trouble to plant the
							pumice in a row, and transplant the trees after they should come up; but
							I want to have the trees stand for life, where they shall come up—and I
							propose to set out a part of these trees at this Season, and the rest in
							the Spring; to observe which of them will thrive best— <persRef
								key="adams-thomas">My brother</persRef> was here before dinner. The
							Newspaper of this Evening, brought the last returns of the Congressional
							Election for the District of Plymouth. Twenty-two Towns gave 2565 votes,
							of which 1817 were for John Quincy Adams, 373 for <persRef
								ref="thompson-arad">Arad Thompson</persRef> (Jacksonite) 279 for
								<persRef ref="baylies-william">William Baylies</persRef> (federal,)
							and 96 scattering votes— The authentic returns will perhaps make some
							slight difference in the number of votes, but can make none in the
							result— I am a member elect of the twenty-second Congress.</p>

						<p>My Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came out from
							Boston, dined with us, and returned this Evening. I heard <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef>
							in the forenoon from John 3.20. “For every one that doeth evil hateth
							the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be
							reproved”—and in the afternoon from 1. Timothy 1.17. “Now unto the king,
							eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for
							ever and ever. Amen.” These were both old Sermons— Spent the Evening in
							writing; and reflecting upon this new incident which has drifted me back
							again amidst the Breakers of the Political Ocean— It is also a novelty
							in the history of the Country; and as a precedent may have no
							unimportant bearing upon future Events— By the Constitution of the
							United States, the President is re-eligible as long as he lives—
								<persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="madison-james">Madison</persRef>, voluntarily retired after one
							re-election—and Jefferson no doubt intended to make the example a
							practical exposition of Constitutional principle— It was followed by
								<persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef>, perhaps with not much cordiality; and will be
							continued as long as a Presidential Term of eight years shall wear out
							the popularity of the person holding the Office. One of the consequences
							of this has been and will be that Ex President’s will survive many years
							the termination of their Offices— That as individuals they will take a
							part in public affairs, and that they will sometimes solicit, and
							sometimes be elected to subordinate Offices— All the preceding
							President’s have held Offices of a public nature, after the expiration
							of their Presidential Service— None however as a member of either house
							of Congress; and there are many who think it now a derogatory descent—
							This is a mere prejudice; and had I alledged my former Station as a
							Reason for rejecting the suffrages of the People, assigning me a Seat in
							the House of Representatives, I should not merely have been chargeable
							with Arrogance, but should have exposed myself to ridicule. So far as
							concerns myself I consider this new Call to the public Service as a
							misfortune: inasmuch as it takes from me the last hope of an old age of
							quiet and leisure. I am still to be buffeted with political rancour and
							personal malignity; with more than equal chances of losing the favour
							even of those who now think they honour themselves by their suffrages
							more than me. My return to public life in a subordinate Station is
							disagreeable to my family and disapproved by some of my friends; though
							no one of them has expressed that disapprobation to me— For the
							discharge of the duties of this particular Station I never was eminently
							qualified; possessing no talent for extemporaneous public speaking; and
							at this time being in the decline of my faculties both of mind and body.
							This event therefore gives me deep concern and anxious forebodings. Yet
							can I not withhold my grateful acknowledgment to the disposer of human
							Events, and to the People of my native region for this unexpected
							testimonial of their continued confidence, after all the combinations of
							personal rivals, and political competitors to shake it— [“]The heart
							knoweth its own bitterness; and a Stranger, intermeddleth not with its
							joys”— No one knows, and few conceive the agony of mind that I have
							suffered from the time that I was made by circumstances, and not by my
							volition a candidate for the Presidency till I was dismissed from that
							Station by the failure of my Re-election— They were feelings to be
							suppressed, and they were suppressed—no human being has ever heard me
							complain— Domestic Calamity far heavier than any political
							disappointment or disaster can possibly be, overtook me immediately
							after my fall from power, and the moment of my distress was seized, by
							an old antagonist, <pb n="29" type="ms"/>to indulge a hatred overflowing
							with the concentrated rancour of forty years; and who could not resist
							the pleasure of giving me what he thought the finishing blow, at the
							moment when he saw me down— It seemed as if I was deserted by all
							mankind, and precisely at that time the American Academy of Arts and
							Sciences, a Literary and Scientific Institution of my native State,
							which for a Series of years during my prosperity had annually elected me
							their President when it was impossible for me to attend their Meetings,
							thought proper to substitute another President in my place— In the
							French Opera of <persRef ref="richard-i">Richard Coeur de
							Lion</persRef>, the minstrel <persRef ref="blondeldenesle"
								>Blondel</persRef>, sings under the walls of his prison a song
							beginning</p>
						<lg>
							<l>“Oh! Richard! Oh! mon Roi—</l>
							<l>L’Univers t’abandonne.”</l>
						</lg>
						<p>when I first heard this Song, forty-five years ago, at one of the first
							Representations of that delightful play, it made an indelible impression
							upon my memory, without imagining that I should ever feel its force so
							much closer home— In the year 1829. scarce a day passed that did not
							bring it to my thoughts— In the course of past Winter a vacancy occurred
							in the Board of Overseers of Harvard University— Absent, I was very
							unexpectedly elected to fill that vacancy— I attributed this to the
							personal friendship and influence of <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2"
								>President Quincy</persRef>— But this call upon me by the People of
							the District in which I reside, to represent them in Congress, has been
							spontaneous; and although counteracted by a double opposition;
							federalist and Jacksonite, I have received nearly three votes in four,
							throughout the district. My Election as President of the United States
							was not half so gratifying to my inmost Soul— No election or appointment
							conferred upon me ever gave me so much pleasure— I say this to record my
							Sentiments—but no Stranger intermeddleth with my Joys, and the dearest
							of my friends have no sympathy with my Sensations.</p>

						<p>The dry blow has been variegated last Night, with a little Rain, and rain
							again this Evening; but I spent the morning after breakfast in my
							Nursery. Finished planting the cross furrows East of the Alley, with the
							Chesnuts and Acorns from Washington; mixed with Juglans Amara and
							dulcis, Shagbarks, Apple seeds and Stranger berries. Added one furrow
							length ways, from the young Apple tree upwards to the young Peach trees—
							Found a large bough broken and hanging down from my Shagbark tree in the
							Garden, which I planted Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1804 I took it
							off with my handsaw, and will use it for index Stakes— My two years old
							red Oak is stripp’d of all its leaves. Two still adhere to the yearling
							below; but the leaves of the English Oaks have not yet begun to fall—
							Half of them retain their colour still— The rest are turning yellow— I
							finished reading the Oration for <persRef ref="roscius-sextus">Roscius
								of Ameria</persRef> this morning, and thus complete the perusal of
							the existing works of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>,
							begun last December— I read also that part of the Dedication of <persRef
								ref="ernesti-johann">Ernesti</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="stieglitz-christian">Stigliz</persRef>, which is missing in my
							Copy of Ernesti’s second Edition— It is worthy of more than one
							reperusal— Had I forty years ago duly read this Dedication, and
							perseveringly devoted the leisure of one year without interruption to
							the Study of Cicero in his own language, my time would have been better
							occupied than it was, and perhaps my life might have been more useful to
							my Country and my fellow creatures than it has been— I gave too much of
							my youth to written translations—from <persRef ref="phaedrus"
								>Phaedrus</persRef>, <persRef ref="suetonius">Suetonius</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>, <persRef ref="virgil"

								ref="tacitus">Tacitus</persRef>, <pb n="30" type="ms"/>and <persRef

								ref="wieland-christoph">Wieland</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="vongentz-friedrich">Gentz</persRef>—and <persRef
								ref="gellert-christian">Gellert</persRef>— The Dedication to Stigliz
							is an argument in behalf of classical Literature, and embraces all that
							can be said in its favour— It treats with just contempt the idea that
							the eminent Greek and Latin authors are to be studied merely for the
							acquisition of the Languages— It considers the Classics as masters of
							morals; teachers of practical wisdom and virtue— It breathes the Spirit
							of Greece and Rome, and swells with the enthusiasm of Liberty and of
							intellectual Power— Of Cicero, I have more to say hereafter.</p>

						<p>A stormy morning with rain which kept me within doors. <persRef
								ref="hall-joseph">Judge Hall</persRef>, with <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bartlett</persRef> called to see me—he
							told me they had been attending the probate Court for Norfolk County—
								<persRef ref="hall-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Hall</persRef> the judge’s wife died about a fortnight since of a
							pulmonary disease and <persRef ref="u">his daughter</persRef> is now in the last Stage of a
							consumption— He has consequently been for several months in deep
							distress, with those harrowing agitations under which one sees two of
							the dearest relations of human existence perishing by slow and
							irremediable degrees— As always happens in such cases, he has taken the
							impression that the medical treatment of the sufferers has been bad, and
							he told me of the manner somewhat harsh in which he had within a few
							days dismissed <persRef ref="warren-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Warren</persRef>, with <persRef ref="jackson-james3">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jackson</persRef>, whom he had called
							in for consultation, and employed <persRef ref="u">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jeffers</persRef> a much younger man
							in their place. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jackson used to discover
							the state of Miss Hall’s lungs an instrument of French invention called
							a Stethoscope; but the alarm and agitation which its application caused,
							aggravated severely the symptoms of her disease, and induced the
							determination of the judge to take other advice— He flatters himself
							with a feeble hope, destined to disappointment: whether the change of
							treatment will hasten or retard by a few days the impending issue is
							uncertain— I had intended to attend the probate Court to-morrow,
							concluding that the <persRef ref="leland-sherman">judge</persRef> would
							as usual sit again but after dinner, I took my papers with me to shew
							them to him, and found him on the point of adjourning his Court, without
							intending to sit to-morrow— I told him I wished to return again the
							Account which I had filed last year; filling the blank left for the
							allowance to the Executors with the amount fixed by his general Rule,
							two and a half per Cent on the property returned; and presenting the
							transactions since last year, in a subsequent and distinct Account, to
							which he assented— He thought there would be no occasion for a notice to
							all the parties interested in the Will, to authorise the allowance fixed
							by a general rule, and said there had been a recent decision of the
							Supreme Court, that the Settlement of an Executor or Administrator’s
							Account by a Judge of Probate whether with or without notice to all
							parties, might be subsequently revised. I told him that the Papers would
							require the signature of my Co-Executor, <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2"
								>President Quincy</persRef>, and that I would present them at the
							Court to be held the next Month at Dedham— I afterwards called for half
							an hour at <persRef key="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef>, who
							returned while I was there, having in the mean time been to my house—

						<p>Stormy weather continued, with intermission of the rain— I finished my

							Alley, planted with two rows of Juglans Amara, and one over them of
							Apple-seeds— I pruned some of my young Apple, Apricot, and Cherry
							trees—and took off one twig from the Red Oak— Cropped all the new shoots
							but one upon the willow in the Summer garden cellar— I seek experience,
							and every trifle in vegetation has become an important affair to me— As
							bodily exercise, the two hours a day that I have spent throughout the
							Season, at work with the Spade and Hoe, have been greatly serviceable to

							the first of May next for the remainder— I settled with him and his

							and cart the wood upon the two lots reserved for my own use— The Deacon
							could not repress the overflow of his masonic feelings, and complained
							of the Resolutions of the Anti-masonic Convention which nominated me for

								ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef>, brought a load of wood,
							and promised to bring another on Saturday, and two Loads of Seaweed to
							morrow— The weather is unpropitious too for fencing and planting at my

							cease to grow, and opened two trenches between the rows of English Oaks,
							set out by my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>— After
							dinner, I walked over the hills to the <persRef ref="atherton-unknown"
								>Atherton</persRef> Pasture, in search of the wild Pear-tree from
							which I wished to procure seeds for Stocks— I was again disapointed not
							finding the tree— But in the adjoining Orchard I gathered a number of
							very small apples, from two trees bearing natural fruit, one the red
							streak from which I had already gathered some, the other a pale whitish
							crab— These are just now ripe, many of them still hanging on the Trees—
							These Apples though very small, are for the most part sound at the Core,
							and the seeds are in perfect condition— I propose to plant some of each
							of them with Stakes, designating their several kinds, and to watch their
							vegetation, and if so it may be, their production.— I gathered also a
							number of the bitter pignuts, fallen from the trees. Very few of these
							Nuts sink in Water— Most of them float under the surface, and those
							appear on cracking to have sound kernels; but very light, and withering
							easily.— The sweet <pb n="32" type="ms"/>pignut is specifically heavier
							than the shagbark, and sinks in water like lead— I have read in <persRef
								ref="wells-william">Wells</persRef> and <persRef ref="lilly-robert"
								>Lilly’s</persRef> Edition of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef>, the general Preface of <persRef
								ref="ernesti-johann">Ernesti</persRef> to his Edition of 1772—a new
							preface, differing totally from that of his first Edition published in
							1737.— In the original preface he gives an account of his motives to
							that undertaking, which was, by the advice of <persRef
								ref="gessner-solomon">Gesner</persRef>, a complete Edition of
							Cicero, from the text of that of <persRef ref="gronovius-jacobus"

								ref="davies-john">Davis</persRef> and <persRef ref="pearce-zachary"
								>Pearce</persRef>—without Notes, but with Arguments or Tables of
							Contents to the various books, mostly new, and with the Clavis, the
							design, motive and purpose of which he explains. But in this last
							Preface is a valuable Dissertation, first upon the principles of
							Criticism, which ought to be applied by an Editor of Cicero to his task,
							and then a statement how far they had been applied by those Editors who
							had preceded him— This includes a notice of the earlier Editions of all
							the remaining works of Cicero from that of <persRef

						<p>The Northeast Storm which commenced last Saturday still continues— Last
							Night and throughout this day there were successive showers, with
							intermissions— <persRef key="adams-thomas">My brother</persRef> dined
							with us, and told me some curious anecdotes, about the masonic and
							anti-masonic snarl which is running like a poisonous weed over the
							Country— He says that the state of <persRef ref="cutler-benjamin2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutler’s</persRef> health, is not the
							reason of his having parted from his flock. But he is a free mason; and
							was required by some of his principal supporters to renounce the craft
							or his parish, and chose the latter alternative— He spoke of several
							pamphlets relating to <persRef ref="thacher-moses">Moses
								Thacher</persRef>, a clergyman, and seceding Mason, now a Senator in
							the State Legislature, and recently the Anti-masonic Candidate for the
							Norfolk District, to Congress— He also told me that in 1804. at
							Philadelphia, he was Counsel for a man, upon some Indictment— That his
							case was so desperate that he advised him to make no defence— That the
							man told him he would try the cause, and if there was a Mason upon the
							Jury he should get clear—which accordingly happened. He said <persRef ref="miller-edward">Edward
							Miller</persRef>, had shewn him some weeks since a Newspaper, containing a list of
							all the masons in this and several of the neighbouring towns— In squally
							weather we sometimes see Strata of clouds one, above another, and blown
							in directions opposite to each other— So it is with Masonry and
							Antimasonry; and there is what at one time was called a tertium quid, a
							counter check to Anti-masonry, consisting of persons not themselves
							Masons, but allied with them in opposition to Anti-masonry— This
							junction has decided the recent elections in the State of New-York—
								<persRef ref="leland-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph
								P. Leland</persRef> is a Nursery man, from Sherburne, who was
							disposed to sell me some fruit trees, of which I told him I might want
							some next Spring, but had no occasion for any now— I enquired his price,
							which he said for good trees was 30 Cents apiece; but he assured me that
							it did not pay for raising them— I asked if he engrafted upon Suckers:
							he said, not the trees for Sale— I asked what seeds he used— He said the
							seeds of fruit from <pb n="33" type="ms"/>natural trees— That few of the
							Seeds from engrafted trees would come up, and those that did, were not
							so good for Stocks— He said he usually grafted upon Stocks the third, or
							fourth year from the seed, when they would sometimes grow six feet in
							one Summer. I read this Morning <persRef ref="ernesti-johann"
								>Ernesti’s</persRef> preface to the Rhetorical works of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>, and the four Books addressed
							to <persRef ref="herennius-gaius">Herennius</persRef>— He says there is
							no Classical author of whom there are more antient manuscripts, and
							early Editions, than of the Rhetorics to Herennius; because there are
							none which in former ages were more studied; but that so great had been
							the change of taste, and so little were those books read in his time,
							that he grudged all the labour he had bestowed upon them, and was
							heartily rejoiced when he got to the end of it, aware as he was that it
							would be of little use to any one— On the other hand he was delighted
							with the occupation of revising the commenting upon the Books de
							Oratore, which he inclines to think the most perfect of the works of
							Cicero— I read also the dedication by <persRef ref="vettori-piero">Peter
								Victorius</persRef>, to his friend <persRef
								ref="cavalcanti-bartolomeo">Cavalcanti</persRef> of his
							Castigationes in Ciceronem, of which I have a copy printed by <persRef

								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>—<persRef ref="manutius-paulus"
								>Paulus Manutius</persRef>, upon the Epistles to <persRef

								ref="cicero-quintus">Quintus Cicero</persRef>, Printed at Francfort
							by <persRef ref="wechelus-andreas">Andrew Wechel</persRef> 1580—and
								<persRef ref="schott-andre">Andreas Schottus</persRef> de Nodis
							Ciceronis Antwerp, printed by <persRef ref="beller-gaspar">Gaspar
								Beller</persRef> 1613— Also to the Specimen of outward Eloquence of

							in the Oration for <persRef ref="archias-aulus"
							>Archias</persRef>—Amsterdam, <persRef ref="wetstein-henry"
								>Wetstein</persRef> 1697. There are useful observations in all these
							books, but that which struck me most, and which I thought applicable to
							the excursive tendency of my reading at present, was the quotation by
								<persRef ref="vettori-piero">Peter Victorius</persRef> of a quaint
							saying from a noble <persRef ref="sophocles">Greek Tragedian</persRef>
							whom he does not name— πόνος, πόνω, πόνον φέρει (Labour, brings labour
							to labour.) So I returned to the Historia Ciceronis, by <persRef
								ref="fabricius-franciscus">Francis Fabricius</persRef>, first
							published at Cologne in 1564. and republished with the <persRef
								ref="elzevir">Elzevir</persRef> Editions of <persRef

							Ernesti and <persRef ref="olivet-pierre">D’Olivet</persRef>— But omitted
							from the republication of Ernesti’s Edition by <persRef
								ref="wells-william">Wells</persRef> and <persRef ref="lilly-robert"
								>Lilly</persRef>— The History of Fabricius is divided into 64.
							chapters, one for each year of the Life of Cicero; and at the head of
							each chapter he gives the year of Rome the names of the Consuls of the
							year, and the corresponding age of Cicero— As I propose to persevere in
							the daily reading of Latin, I had thoughts of passing now to another
							author, and am balancing between <persRef ref="plinytheyounger">Pliny
								junior</persRef>, <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="livius-titus">Livy</persRef>, <persRef ref="tacitus"
								>Tacitus</persRef> and <persRef ref="seneca">Seneca</persRef>. But I
							have not yet given one entire year to Cicero, and with <persRef
								ref="casaubon-isaac">Casaubon</persRef> and Ernesti; I think two
							scarcely sufficient to read meditate and inwardly digest his works— I
							have yet to consult his commentators, Translators and expounders
							English, French and German— I received a letter from my Son <persRef

							corroborates the opinion expressed by <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef>, and of which I was already convinced that the
							state of my affairs requires me to go, for part of the Winter to
							Washington— John’s Letter to his Mother, very earnestly urges that we

							do as I should think proper. I answered John’s Letter, expecting to
							proceed after the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of next month, when I

						<p>The Storm with occasional Showers continues. Ninth day.— Heard <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef>
							in the morning from Matthew 6.31. “Therefore take no thought, saying,
							what shall we eat? or what shall we drink? or wherewithal shall we be
							clothed?” and in the afternoon, from Mark 12.37. “And the common People,
							heard him gladly.” It was so dark that M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Whitney had great difficulty in reading his Sermons, and in the
							afternoon, was obliged to have one of the window blinds opened in the
							midst of his discourse. The whole Service occupied less than an hour
							each time— The morning Sermon was upon one of those passages in the new
							Testament, which discountenance the excess of worldly cares— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney observed that though seemingly
							variant, it was not in reality inconsistent with other parts of
							Scripture which very emphatically recommend laborious diligence, and a
							watchful regard to worldly interests— There is indeed a very remarkable
							difference between the Instructions of <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon</persRef> in the Proverbs, and the lessons of Jesus to his
							disciples— The Proverbs are full of rebukes upon the Sluggard— Jesus
							forbids all taking thought of the morrow— Solomon refers to the example
							of the Ant— Jesus to the Lilies of the field; which neither toil, nor
							spin; though Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of them—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney pointed out the correct
							meaning of the words of Jesus, which is a caution against excessive or
							carking care, and cited with approbation a recent translation of the
							Scriptures which in this passage renders the words of the original, by
							anxious care— The purpose of the precept is to enjoin trust in God, and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney’s Argument was in the true
							Spirit of his text— He exhorted his hearers also to discard too anxious
							a thought for worldly goods, by estimating them at their true value; of
							little worth in comparison with spiritual blessings; and at the same
							time warned them not to neglect that sober, cheerful, and diligent
							regard for their own interests and the comforts of those dependent upon
							them, which has the sanction of the Scriptures as well as the Seal of
							all experience— The afternoon text prepared the auditory for a
							democratic discourse, but it was not invidiously so— It appeared to have
							been written some years since, and from the difficulties in the delivery
							that the Preacher had not very recently read it— In the Evening I
							finished reading to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef>, <persRef ref="galt-john">Galt’s</persRef> Life of
								<persRef ref="byron-george">Lord Byron</persRef>. This person has
							now been seven years dead, and the public interest in him has not
							abated— He was one of the wonders of his age, and was like <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon Buonaparte</persRef> the Torso of
							a <persRef ref="hercules">Hercules</persRef>—A Grand Homme manqué. A
							club-footed <persRef ref="apollo">Apollo</persRef>, in mind as in
							person. There are sublime and beautiful passages of detail in his
							Poetry, and if he had finished his <persRef ref="donjuan">Don
								Juan</persRef>, it would have been a worthy companion to <persRef
								ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire’s</persRef> Pucelle, in the Temple
							of Cloacina, upon the summit of Parnassus— Galt had a slight
							acquaintance with him, having been for some time a fellow passenger with
							him on his first voyage to Greece, and feels kind to his Memory. He
							publishes this life of him because he says <persRef ref="moore-thomas"
								>Moore’s</persRef> has not been satisfactory to the <pb n="35"
								type="ms"/>Public— This book is very amusing—seldom tedious, and has
							passages of fine writing— But he ranks Byron rather above <persRef
								ref="milton-john">Milton</persRef> as a Poet, and is half-inclined
							to give him the Pas—before <persRef ref="shakespeare-william"
								>Shakespear</persRef>. He shews that Byron was jealous of
							Shakespear, and that he was very indignant at being compared to <persRef
								ref="rousseau-john">Rousseau</persRef>, because Rousseau was the Son
							of a watchmaker— He likens Byron to <persRef ref="sanzio-raffaello"
								>Raphael</persRef>— If Raphael had introduced his own Portrait into
							every picture he ever painted; and given himself in every picture the
							attributes of some fine mad devil of Pandemonium, there would have been
							more resemblance between him, and the noble Poet.</p>

							between the row of this years Apple trees from the Seed, and <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> English Oaks— Also a row of

								>Alpheus Spear</persRef> brought a load of wood, and took down my
							purchase of 30. Russet Apples trees; which he is to set out on Saturday,
							if the weather should be fair— This morning was the thirteenth of Clouds
							and gloom, but the afternoon cleared off fine. In the assortment of
								<persRef key="adams-john">my fathers</persRef> papers I found the
							whole correspondence relating to the army of 1798. which was an intrigue
							of <persRef ref="hamilton-alexander">Alexander Hamilton’s</persRef>, to
							get an army raised under the preposterous panic of an invasion from
							France; with himself at the head of the army, under the nominal command
							of <persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>, whose
							countenance and influence were necessary to make the army palatable to
							the Nation— Hamilton had first wrought upon the feelings of Washington,
							to concur in this plan. Till Washington made it an indispensable
							condition of his own acceptance that Hamilton should be the first Major
							General under him— In the Revolutionary War Hamilton had borne no higher
							rank than that of a Colonel— <persRef ref="knox-henry2">Knox</persRef>
							had been a Major General and <persRef ref="pinckney-charles">Charles
								Cotesworth Pinckney</persRef> had ranked above Hamilton— Knox had
							been since the Peace of 1783 Secretary of War both under the
							Confederation Congress, and under Washington, while President— But
							Washington now in the most peremptory manner insisted that both Hamilton
							and Pinckney should be placed above Knox. His will prevailed, and Knox
							refused to serve— Pinckney consented to serve under Hamilton, and
							offered to serve under Knox; but the arrangement was made at
							Washington’s Dictation, and the proposal was not made to Knox to rank
							between Hamilton and Pinckney. This transaction was the primary cause of
							the overthrow of the federal party, and of the failure of my father’s
							Re-election— The raising of the Army was an unnecessary, and unpopular
							measure— The appointment of Hamilton and Pinckney over the head of Knox,
							was a slight upon New-England— The army itself raised and maintained at
							an enormous expence, was perfectly useless when raised, and Hamilton to
							save his darling chance of commanding in chief the Army, was driven to
							desperation by my fathers taking away both the pretexts for keeping up
							the army—removing all pretence of a foreign War, by a Treaty with
							France, and all danger of internal commotion by pardoning the Insurgents
							of Pennsylvania— Hamilton first attempted to get Washington and then
							Pinckney up against my fathers re-election, and though he failed in both
							those projects, he split up the federal party and brought <persRef

						<p>Sent <persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirke</persRef> into Boston this

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathaniel Curtis</persRef>— Went
							with <persRef ref="farrar-salmon">Salmon Farrar</persRef> to the Mount
							Wollaston farm, and there with <persRef ref="spear-lemuel;spear-alpheus"
								>Lemuel and Alpheus Spear</persRef>, set out the thirty Apple-trees
							which I purchased last Wednesday— They are in Rows, nearly North and
							South nearest to the house— Four Rows alternately of eight and seven
							each— The alternate stands I planted with pomace and Apple-seeds,
							setting a stake in the centre where I propose the tree shall stand, and
							scattering round each Stake, 20 or 30 Apple-seeds mixing in each hill,
							with the pomace two or three seeds from Office Apples or Penn’s <pb
								n="39" type="ms"/>Hill Redstreaks— Lemuel Spear told me that my
							Trees were four years old from the graft; and shewed me on the Stem and
							branches the growth of each year. He thought it would be much cheaper
							for me to set out the whole Orchard with such trees than to raise one
							half of the Stocks as I propose from the Seed— This no doubt is true—
							Should the Plantation of my Seeds and Pomace succeed, I cannot expect
							that the Trees from the seed will be more advanced in growth, in seven
							years from this time, than those which I now set out are already— In
							less than fifteen years none of them can be expected to bear their
							natural fruit—nor can I flatter myself that I shall live to witness this
							result of the experiment. But I may live to see the success or failure
							of the experiment; and possibly to make observations upon the growth of
							the Trees which may be useful hereafter to others. The future condition,
							relative strength fertility and duration of these two Classes of Trees
							may be remarked for a century to come, upon this single Orchard— The
							comparative growth and thriftiness of Oaks, Chesnuts, and Shagbark
							Hickories and Button woods, may be noted, by a glance at the same spot,
							less than five Acres in extent—while I have life and health myself I
							shall assiduously mark its progress and vicissitudes, and hope that the
							infection of curiosity and observation may pass to my Son Charles, or
							some other Successor, through whom it may finally result to the
							improvement of the Agriculture of the Country; and particularly to the
							cultivation of Forest and Fruit trees— I was anxious already to
							ascertain if any of the nuts and acorns which I planted the 23<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of last Month, had begun to take root,
							and with Alpheus Spear, I uncovered two of the Hills— In one of them we
							found an Acorn and Chesnut unaltered, and without sign of vegetation— In
							the other the Acorn had taken rank hold of the ground by a taproot— If
							one in ten that I planted takes root, the border will have in it the
							germ of a venerable grove which in a century from this day may cover the
							now naked Mount with Oaks as sturdy as those which more than two
							centuries since <persRef ref="wollaston-richard">Captain
								Wollaston</persRef> found upon it— The stumps of two or three of
							these, still decaying on the Western declivity, attest their gigantic
							stature when living; but an old cedar at the bottom of the North-eastern
							side, and an old Apple-tree on the decline of the ridge are the only
							trees now standing upon it— We finished our work for the day about half
							past two O’Clock, and I came home— Spear’s men were finishing the
							Rail-fence round the future Orchard while we were setting out the Trees
							and planting the Pomace and seeds— Charles and his wife came out while
							we were at dinner— <persRef ref="spear-daniel">Deacon Spear</persRef>
							gave me a certificate.</p>

							not only the numerous passages of the Epistles and other writings of
							Cicero, in which he makes mention of himself, but also the passages of
							all the cotemporaneous and subsequent classical Latin authors,
							authenticating the other facts. This Historia Ciceronis was published
							about the year 1560. <persRef ref="middleton-conyers"

						<p>One fair day. I finished reading the Historia of <persRef

							Article upon <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>, in <persRef
								ref="ernesti-johann">Ernesti’s</persRef> Edition of the Bibliotheca

								>Atticus</persRef>, <persRef ref="cicero-quintus">Quintus
								Cicero</persRef> and <persRef ref="brutus-marcus">Marcus
								Brutus</persRef>— Ernesti says that no books of Cicero have been so
							much read as the familiar Epistles and none so little as those to
							Atticus— The causes of which he states to be the peculiar fitness of the
							former for teaching at once the Latin Language, and the Epistolary
							Style; and the extreme difficulty of the letter—written in half
							sentences, and often with studied obscurity—to which I added the
							perpetual recurrence of Greek words— I had thoughts of taking up now the
							Epistles of <persRef ref="plinytheyounger">Pliny</persRef>, and borrowed
							from the Town’s Library the Quarto Edition by <persRef
								ref="longolius-paul">Longolius</persRef>, for the sake of the large
							Type; but did not begin it— I planted in the Nursery; at the
							Stony-barren, East of the Alley one cross-row of pomace but upon
							attempting to open a cross-row westward found the ground beneath the
							surface so choaked up with Stones that I was fain to call for the spade
							the Crowbar, and <persRef ref="farrar-salmon">S. Farrar</persRef> to get
							them out— I then made him take up fourteen of the seventeen young
							Apple-trees, clustered on the spot where four years ago, a heap of
							Pomace was cast, and replanted twelve of them in a row, about four feet
							apart from each other—and two on the Western side under shelter of the
							Wall— He took up also four of the three years old peach trees, and set
							them out in the garden— These are among the remnants of the wreck of my
							first seed and Stone plantations— They are discouraging— Every one of
							the Peach-trees had a worm preying upon its vitals at the root; which
							though cut out and destroyed, casts ominous conjecture upon the fate of
							the Trees next Spring and Summer— The Apple-trees are barely alive;
							wretchedly misshapen things, and such as a Seedsman would think only fit
							to be thrown away—but they are the best yet living of my plantation
							here— I had one uncommonly successful Season at Washington; but was then
							taken away from my plants; while the main body of my seeds here were
							sown upon Stony ground, and perished because they would not take Root— I
							am still prepared for disappointments, and hope only to persevere in

						<p>North-East Storm—realized the threat of the large circle round the Moon.
							The early morning lowered and blew, without rain— With <persRef
								ref="farrar-salmon">Salmon Farrar</persRef>, I took up eight 3 years
							old Peach trees, and set them out in the Garden— All of them had worms
							at the root, excepting two from which they had been extracted in the
							Summer— Rain came to aggravate the Storm and I postponed the further
							transplantation of my trees. Remainder of the day confined to the house
							by the Storm—waded along in the Article of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef> in the Bibliotheca Latina of <persRef
								ref="fabricius-johann">Fabricius</persRef>— He referred to the 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							chapters of the vindication of Cicero from calumnies by <persRef
								ref="schott-andre">Andreas Schottus</persRef>, which I read— These
							relate to the charge against him, that he was sarcastic and given to
							ridicule, as he undoubtedly was— Schottus was a Jesuit and defends him
							gravely. Ridicule is one of the most powerful weapons of eloquence;
							beyond all measure more powerful than invective— I have also nearly read
							through a Quarto Volume of Fragments, illustrative of the Bible, added
							to the English Translation of <persRef ref="calmet-augustin"
								>Calmet</persRef>; a work adorned with numerous Copper Plates— The
							anonymous author is self sufficient, and I begrudge the Time I am
							wasting upon his lucubrations. For the last week I have been reading his
							new version of <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon’s</persRef> Song, which he
							represents as a Dramatic Eclogue divided into six days; the principal
							Personages of which are Solomon and Pharaoh’s daughter—each with a train
							of attendants— The History of Solomon informs us that he wrote a
							thousand Songs, of which this alone has been preserved— As an Oriental
							Epithalamium it is exquisitely beautiful; but it is idle to think of
							reducing it to the standard of European poetry, antient or modern, and
							in the mystical meaning attributed to it by some theologians I have
							little faith— The exposition of it by the Translator of Calmet is not
							satisfactory to me— He has improved upon the common translation in a few
							passages, and by shewing that some of the expressions hitherto applied
							to naked beauties are mere allusions to the attire of the party, has
							expurgated the most exceptionable parts of the book— Two hours of the
							Evening were spent in reading <persRef ref="moore-thomas"

							went. The rain and the wind continued increasing the whole day, till it
							was little short of a hurricane— In the afternoon, I was obliged to
							darken my chamber by shutting the blinds of my Eastern Windows, and to
							light a lamp before four O’Clock. Confined to the house, yet wrote
							nothing excepting in this book— Reading Miscellaneous— <persRef

							of <persRef ref="longolius-paul">Longolius</persRef>— Also <persRef
								ref="boyle-john4">Lord Orrery’s</persRef> English Translation of
							them, with his <pb n="43" type="ms"/>commentary upon each Letter— The
							Letters are of a character altogether different from those of Cicero;
							but are equally characteristic of the age in which they were written—and
							of the Government then existing— Written for the publication, or at
							least for preservation. Every Letter is a Dissertation, and they are
							full of ingenious reflections and virtuous Sentiments— The first to
								<persRef ref="clarus-septitius">Septitius Clarus</persRef> is a
							dedication to him of the collection, formed at his request— The fifth to
								<persRef ref="romanus-vaconius">Vaconius Romanus</persRef> is a
							bitter invective against <persRef ref="regulus-marcus">Marcus
								Regulus</persRef> the infamous Prosecutor under the Reign of
								<persRef ref="domitian">Domitian</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="arulenus-rusticus">Rusticus Arulenus</persRef>— Pliny’s Letter
							was written shortly after the Death of Domitian, and he relates a base
							attempt of Regulus, to ensnare him by captious questions; his own
							evasions, and the anxious solicitude of Regulus since the accession of
								<persRef ref="trajan">Trajan</persRef>, for a reconciliation with
							Pliny— The sixth is a Letter to <persRef ref="tacitus"
							>Tacitus</persRef>, about boar hunting, and the 8<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>About Midnight last Night, the Sky cleared off and it was for a short

							Greenleaf promised to go and meet Mr Curtis to-morrow— Going to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> T. Greenleaf’s I picked up from the ground
							near his house two small berries, which were of the same kind, with
							those of which I have planted a number, and called them stranger

							standing in the road near the Wall— I shewed the berry to M<hi

							what it was— After tasting it he said it was a Juniper berry, and
							referring to the tree <pb n="44" type="ms"/>whence they had fallen, said
							that many years since, a man named <persRef ref="u">Tyrrell</persRef>
							then living had shewn him that tree then small, and told him it was a
							Juniper tree, and the only one in the Town of Quincy— But he observed,
							first that the berry was not quite ripe, and then that it had a stone,
							whereas the Juniper berry has seeds— And he said that when a boy, the
							French fleet, being in Boston he had passed days and Nights in boiling
							down Juniper berries to an Electuary for medicinal use by the Surgeons
							of that fleet. But Tyrrell’s information was erroneous— The tree is not
							a Juniper; nor is the tree the <hi rend="superscript">only</hi> one of
							its kind in Quincy— I must still call the fruit a Stranger; though being
							a Stone fruit, it is not a berry. In the afternoon I walked to <persRef

							Whence come they? whither were they going? and what is the distance to

						<p>The Sky was swept of its clouds in the course of the Night, and this day
							was clear and cold Sunshine with a brisk Northwester. <persRef
								ref="kirk-john">John Kirke</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="farrar-salmon">Farrar</persRef> brought from Medford, Thursday
							Evening 80 grafted Baldwin Apple— Excepting one which proved to be a
							natural, ungrafted tree— Yesterday Kirke took them to <persRef
								ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear’s</persRef>, and this morning I
							went there with S. Farrar, a basket full of pomace, and six being the
							remnant of the Woodhouse or Office Apples which I had kept from the
								17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August for the Seed— Alpheus
							Spear was going to Boston, but <persRef ref="spear-lemuel"
								>Lemuel</persRef> and a workman were already setting out the Trees—
							In the course of the day, Spear and his man set out 70 of the Trees,
							while Farrar and I were planting the alternate stands for the Trees with
							Pomace and Seeds— At One O’Clock we came home to dine and for a fresh
							supply of Pomace. We returned before three, and finished at the dusk of
							the Evening— The Orchard is now completed— One hundred Apple-trees are
							set out, with ninety seven alternate Hills planted with Pomace and
							Apple-seeds, with the purpose and wish that in the twentieth century,
							which with the blessing of God—my Grand-children <hi rend="italic"
								>may</hi> live to see, an Apple-tree from a seed planted by my hand,
							may bear not forbidden fruit, upon every one of the Hills— Mount
							Wollaston has belonged to my Ancestors and to me about 190 years—that is
							from the Settlement of Braintree to this day— It was covered at first
							with Oaks of the Forest— One old Apple-tree is now its only shelter from
							the Storm— It is now pregnant with at least ten thousand seeds of fruit
							and forest, mostly planted by my hand, and in a century from this day
							may bear timber for the floating Castles of my Country, and fruit for
							the subsistence health and comfort of my descendants. To all which the
							blessing and sanction is indispensable, of the giver of all Good, and
							which with humble diffidence and hope, I invoke. <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S. Adams</persRef> dined with us, and

								n="45" type="ms"/><persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi

							the Evening, and brought me a Note from <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathaniel Curtis</persRef>, with
							whom he completed the transfer of the Neponset Bridge Shares— I finished
							reading the first Book of <persRef ref="plinytheyounger"
								>Pliny’s</persRef> Letters with <persRef ref="boyle-john4"
								>Orrery’s</persRef> Translation this Morning, and read two hours of
							the Evening in <persRef ref="moore-thomas">Moore’s</persRef> Life of
								<persRef ref="byron-george">Byron</persRef>— There were ten of the
							Medford Apple-trees left, which Farrar brought back from the Mount, and
							which I propose to set out near my house.</p>

							of Milton, who is a very zealous anti-mason. He was one of the Delegates
							at the National Convention held in September last at Philadelphia.— The
							Anti-masonic fever assumes a variety of aspects, and is destined to
							produce extraordinary Effects upon the political Institutions of this
							Country— The Masons and Anti-masons are already organized as two
							opposite great political parties, and they are much embittered against
							each other— The Anti-masons, avow the principle of refusing their votes
							for any public office whatever to any member of the Order— Their
							Candidates are strictly Anti-masonic— There has always been a strong
							latent influence of Masonry operating upon Elections, but it has been
							generally been disclaimed, and often passed unperceived. It can now no
							longer be concealed or disguised— At the recent Election in the State of
							New-York the issue throughout the State was controuled by the Masonic
							contest alone. 120000 votes were cast for <persRef ref="granger-francis"
								>Granger</persRef> the Anti-masonic Candidate for Governor— The
							Election was carried against him by a majority of only 8000 votes: and a
							much greater number than that were given by Masons opposed on all other
							grounds to the successful Canditate, but who sacrificed all other
							opinions and prejudices to prevent the Anti-masonic triumph— And they
							did prevent it— Anti-masonry is however now so fully organized that it
							will probably prevail in the New-York Elections, in one or two years— It
							is remarkable that the Antimasonic fermentation has spread only in the
							States where there are no Slaves— At the general Antimasonic Convention
							held at Philadelphia last September, there were delegations from most of
							the Northern States, and scarcely any from those of the South— It has
							been my endeavour to keep myself wholly aloof from this question— I have
							not however been permitted to remain neutral to it, and in more than one
							instance have felt the secret operations of Masonic animosity and
							resentment— The great danger of Anti-masonry is in its combinations with
							other political parties, and in the uses which faction may make of it—
							But the Spirit is up, and will not soon be</p>

						<p><persRef ref="turner-peter">Peter Turner</persRef> called here this
							morning, and I had a discussion with him upon the comparative merits of
							certain Boots and shoes of his making— He took my box of shaving
							implements to make a leather covering for it— <persRef
								ref="hardwick-joseph">Joseph Hardwick</persRef> came and made me an
							offer of 70 dollars for a year’s Rent of the house in which he lives— He
							gives 100 dollars for this year, and that has been the Rent paid by the
								<persRef ref="u">Curtis’s</persRef> for eight or ten years before—
							But rents in Quincy have fallen— I told him he might have the house,
							without the privilege of the barn, for 80 dollars; but he declined
							taking it at that rate— So it rests till next March. I received a Note
							from <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bailey</persRef>, with a printed copy from <persRef
								ref="morton-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morton</persRef>,
							of the Proceedings of the United-States Anti-Masonic Convention, held at
							Philadelphia 11. Sept<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1830. and a request
							that I would lend Mr Morton, the book I had last night mentioned—Les
							Francs Maçons Ecraséz; but on looking over my library, I could not find
							it— It has like many others disappeared and I know not even where to
							enquire for it— The day was lowering, but permitted a visit to my
							Nursery and Garden. I took up 8 young Peach and 3. Plum-trees from the
							Summer house Cellar, and set them out in the Garden— Took up also 3
							young Cherry-trees, from under the two bearing trees where they had
							grown from fallen Stones, self-planted— I had about 6 inches deep of
							Earth from the garden, deposited in the Summer house Cellar—to shelter
							the roots of the young trees left there from the frost, and to raise the
							surface of the ground— I also deposited a remnant of Pomace in a large
							Book-box opposite my chamber window. <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellis</persRef> of Dedham sent me a
							basket of Apples of various kinds—Baldwin, Black Gilliflower, Queen’s
							pippin, Russetten, Sidney Smith and others— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Ellis himself came after dinner and spent an hour or more
							with me, and gave me some account of himself and his history. He is a
							Surveyor and has been a Senator from the County of Norfolk in the State

							Measures which I did not remember having sent him.</p>

						<p><date>30. IV:15. </date>Tuesday. North-east Storm, with flooding rain the
							whole day. This weather confined me to the house, and it makes the
							climate as dark and gloomy as November in London— In the morning I
							finished reading the second book of <persRef ref="plinytheyounger"
								>Pliny’s</persRef> Epistles, and <persRef ref="boyle-john4">Lord
								Orrery’s</persRef> Translation of them, and here I must suspend my
							classical reading for the present— There cannot be a greater contrast of
							Epistolary Style, than between the Letters of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> and those of Pliny— They are of
							themselves pictures of the respective times in which they were written—
							There is an atmosphere of republicanism about every line written by
							Cicero—a perfume of absolute monarchy, about every word of Pliny. My
							Classmate at College <persRef ref="learned-ebenezer">Learned</persRef>
							used to say that his Theme, was a very different thing, when written in
							his gown and slippers, with unshaven beard, and face unwashed, from what
							it was when he had prepared himself for writing in a clean ruffled
							shirt, his best new coat and silk Stockings— His compositions in full
							dress were in his own estimate far superior to those written in
							deshabille— Now Pliny writes in all the formal <pb n="47" type="ms"
							/>dignity of Laticlave, and Cicero in the loosest and most careless
							Pallium; but the comparison brings to a conclusion quite the reverse of
							that of my friend Learned. Yet the Letters of Pliny are richly worthy of
							the care with which they have been preserved— They are literary Jewels
							of pure brilliancy—full of thought, of sentiments of morality. The first
							Letter of the second book, giving an account of the funeral honours paid
							to <persRef ref="rufus-lucius">Verginius Rufus</persRef>, is admirable,
							though it leaves us to regret that the funeral Oration by the Consul
								<persRef ref="tacitus">Tacitus</persRef> has not been preserved— The
							third is perhaps an exaggerated eulogium of a Greek declaimer or
							Lecturer upon all subjects after the manner of the Sophists— His name
							was <persRef ref="isaeus">Isaeus</persRef>, and his powers of
							extemporaneous declamation according to the Statement of Pliny, were
							transcendent— In this Letter he tells the Story of an Inhabitant of
							Gades, who spurr’d by the fame of <persRef ref="livius-titus"
								>Livy</persRef> the historian, went from the extremity of the Earth
							(I suppose from Cadix to Rome,[)] to see him, and then immediately
							returned— He relates also the anecdote of <persRef ref="aeschines"
								>AEschines</persRef> reading at Rhodes the Oration of <persRef
								ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef> against himself, and asking
							what they would have thought if they had heard the beast himself? a
							story told also by Cicero, but not by <persRef ref="plutarch"
								>Plutarch</persRef>— The Letter to <persRef ref="calvina"
								>Calvina</persRef> touches upon the laws of inheritance and
							insolvency, and is the evidence of a very generous action in Pliny, by
							remitting to the Lady a heavy debt, due from her father’s Estate to him—
							The Letter to <persRef ref="lupercus">Lupercus</persRef>, encloses part
							of an Oration by Pliny for his perusal and criticism— The next to
								<persRef ref="avitus">Avitus</persRef> tells of a supper which Pliny
							attended and at which the entertainer gave better fare and better wines
							to one part of his guests than to the others; a practice not uncommon
							then, but which Pliny justly censures. The 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> to <persRef ref="macrinus">Macrinus</persRef>, tells of a
							triumphant Statue decreed the preceding day, by the Senate, on the
							proposal of <persRef ref="trajan">Trajan</persRef>, to <persRef
								ref="spurinna-titus">Vestricius Spurinna</persRef>— The 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> is a short Letter to <persRef
								ref="caninius-rufus">Caninius</persRef> whom he congratulates upon
							his enjoying the pleasures of the Country; and laments that the
							multiplicity of business deprives him of the same comforts— The 9<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> is a warm canvassing Letter, in behalf
							of his young friend <persRef ref="erucius-sextus">Sextus
								Erucius</persRef>, a candidate for the office of tribune by election
							of the Senate— The 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> is an ardent
							persuasive to <persRef ref="octavius">Octavius</persRef> to publish his
							works; of which he speaks in terms of high admiration— The 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> to
								<persRef ref="arrianus">Arrianus</persRef>, are Reports of the
							proceedings in the Senate upon the impeachment of <persRef
								ref="priscus-marius">Marius Priscus</persRef> who had been Proconsul
							in Africa, by the People of the Province and afterwards of <persRef
								ref="firminus-hostilius">Hostilius Firminus</persRef> the Legate of
							Marius— Pliny and Tacitus were the Prosecutors— Marius was defended by
								<persRef ref="liberalis-salvius">Salvius Liberalis</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="front-tiberius">Fronto Catius</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="marcellinus-claudius">Claudius Marcellinus</persRef> defended
								<persRef ref="marcianus-flavius">Flavius Marcianus</persRef> one of
							the accomplices of Marius— Pliny says that he spoke five hours, and that
							Tacitus was most eloquent and solemn— The accused were all condemned.
							The 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> is to another Priscus warmly
							recommending <persRef ref="romanus-vaconius">Voconius Romanus</persRef>—
							The 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> is a ludicrous description of the
							manner in which causes were argued before the Centumvirs—a burlesque
							upon judicial trials— The 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> a Letter of
							seven lines, contains three ingenious moral reflections. The 16<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> is another example of disinterested and
							generous probity— The 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> a description of
							his Laurentine villa— The 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> a promise to
							select and engage a preceptor for the children of the brother of
								<persRef ref="mauricus">Mauricus</persRef>. The 19<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> assents to the request of <persRef
								ref="cerealis">Cerealis</persRef> that Pliny would recite one of his
							Orations to several of his friends—and the 20<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> relates to <persRef ref="calvisius">Calvisius</persRef>
							three instances of base intrigues of <persRef ref="regulas"
								>Regulas</persRef>—to enrich himself by swindling acquisitions of
							Legacies— In the Evening I read <persRef ref="moore-thomas"
								>Moore’s</persRef> Life of <persRef ref="byron-george">Lord
								Byron</persRef>.</p>
