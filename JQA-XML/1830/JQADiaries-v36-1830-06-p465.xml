						<p>We embarked at six this morning in the Steamboat Thistle from
							New-Brunswick and landed at New-York at ten. There was rain during great
							part of the passage— At Perth-Amboy, <persRef ref="lamb-unknown">Major
								Lamb</persRef> came onboard the boat, and came to New-York— He has
							leased his house there to a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crane</persRef>, who keeps it as a Hotel. At New-York we
							came to the Washington Hotel newly fitted up—and kept by <persRef
								ref="hamilton-james2">Hamilton</persRef>, who heretofore kept the
							Exchange Hotel in Boston— We only stopp’d to dine; and found that
								<persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirke</persRef>, with the Horses and
							Carriage was at the City <pb n="466" type="ms"/>Hotel. At Hamilton’s I
							received several visitors; <persRef ref="wolcott-oliver">Oliver
								Wolcott</persRef>, a man whose condition somewhat resembles my own—
							Having survived the age of active life, he has no fixed abode; but
							resides chiefly with his Children. He is nearly or quite four-score
							years of age; and until about three years past was Governor of
							Connecticut— They then quietly dropp’d him and elected <persRef
								ref="tomlinson-gideon">Gideon Tomlinson</persRef> in his place— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wolcott appears to retain possession of
							his faculties, and was much disposed to conversation upon the prevailing
							politics of the time— But we were very soon interrupted, against my
							inclination, for I should have been glad to listen long to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wolcott. He views the prospects of the
							Union, with great sagacity, and with hopes more sanguine than mine— He
							thinks the continuance of the Union will depend upon the heavy
							population of Pennsylvania; and that its gravitation will preserve the
							Union— He holds the South-Carolina turbulence, rather too much in
							contempt— The domineering Spirit, naturally springs from the institution
							of Slavery; and when as in South-Carolina, the Slaves are more numerous
							than their masters; the domineering Spirit, is wrought up to its highest
							pitch of intenseness— The South-Carolinians are attempting to govern the
							Union as they govern their Slaves, and there are too many indications
							that abetted as they are by all the Slave-driving interest of the Union,
							the free portion of the population will cower before them, and truckle
							to their insolence. This is my apprehension. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Wolcott considers their bullying only according to its own
							character, and supposes it will be harmless because it is impotent—
								<persRef ref="johnson-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Johnson</persRef> of Utica with <persRef ref="johnson-abigail">his
								wife</persRef> youngest daughter of my brother <persRef
								key="adams-charles">Charles</persRef>, is upon an excursion to the
							South, for her health—which is suffering with rhumatism— <persRef
								ref="johnson-alexander2">His Son</persRef> is a stout boy of
							thirteen, whom he says he proposes sending to Cambridge— <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vosberg</persRef> paid me a
							visit of curiosity—an entire Stranger, who was disposed to give me
							biographical anecdotes of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van
								Buren</persRef>, the present Secretary of State: Vosberg says that
							he and Van-Buren were born in the same village— <persRef
								ref="vanburen-abraham;u">Their fathers</persRef> next door
							neighbours, and that he has known him from childhood. The best thing
							that he had to tell of Martin, before he became a patriot was that on
							his father’s death, he relieved himself from responsibility for his
							debts by pleading the Statute of Limitations— The Teacher was a young
							man whose name he told me, but I did not retain it in Memory. <persRef
								ref="chaumont-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Le Ray</persRef>
							told me that he should present his claim to Congress on account of
								<persRef ref="chaumont-jacques">his father’s</persRef> services
							during the War of our Revolution, if a favourable opportunity should
							occur— He shewed me a recommendatory Letter from <persRef
								ref="lafayette">General La Fayette</persRef> to me which he asked my
							permission to retain, and to use if necessary, to which I consented— He
							told me he had been totally ruined by the New-York Canals— His immense
							Estate in Lands being distant from the Canals, and having thereby sunk
							three fourths of their value— He lives now barely by the forbearance and
							kindness of his creditors. <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Blunt</persRef> came into Hamilton’s
							while we were at dinner— Told us <persRef ref="king-charles">Charles
								King</persRef> and <persRef ref="king-eliza">his wife</persRef> were
							gone this day to Albany, to attend the wedding of <persRef
								ref="vanrensselaer-stephen">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Van
								Rensselaer’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="u">daughter</persRef>. Told me also that <persRef
								ref="hamilton-alexander">Alexander Hamilton’s</persRef> papers were
							now in the hands of <persRef ref="baylies-francis">Francis
								Baylies</persRef>, who is to write the biography— We embarked in the
							Steam-boat President <persRef ref="bunker-robert">Captain R. S.
								Bunker</persRef> and at 4. P.M. left the wharf in the North-river
							near the Battery which the Rhode-Island Steam-boats now frequent. The
							weather was still overcast and gloomy. Wind East. The only fellow
							passengers whom I knew, were a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Johnson</persRef>, and another whose name I did not
							recollect, both of Baltimore— Our navigation was rapid, but there was no
							favourable change in the weather— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"

						<p><date>2. V. </date>Wednesday.— Landed at
							Providence— Quincy.</p>
						<p>We passed an uncomfortable night. Before three in the morning I was
							awakened, by the rolling of the Boat: we had passed out of the Sound at
							the East end of Long-Island— The wind still East—a heavy swell, and many
							of the Passengers Sea-sick— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> quite ill— The <persRef ref="adams-mary4">child</persRef>
							unwell, but not thoroughly Sea-sick— The fog so thick that for two hours
							or more we lay to every five or ten minutes to sound— The Benjamin
							Franklin pass’d in sight, about Sunrise, having passed the night at
							Newport— A thick fog, which dispersed as we were reaching that harbour—
							At nine we came to the wharf at Providence, just before which M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams had a faint turn— I hesitated
							whether we should not all stop for the day at Providence, but she
							recovered and urged me to proceed in the Stage; intending to come on
							herself in the Carriage as far as Walpole this Evening— I came with
								<persRef ref="william2">William</persRef>—the black man in the
							Stage— It stopp’d for five minutes at Attleborough where I saw <persRef
								ref="hatch-israel">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Hatch</persRef>— We dined at <persRef ref="fuller-stephen"
								>Fuller’s</persRef> in Walpole— At Dedham I quitted the Stage, in
							which I had as fellow passengers a <persRef ref="u">Major
								Coffin</persRef>, and a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Glover</persRef>, both apparently Officers in the
							British Service, from Canada— From Dedham I came in an open Jersey
							Waggon with one horse; driven by <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gay</persRef> to Quincy, where I
							arrived with William at five in the afternoon— I found in the house a
							woman, my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> Cook,
							whom he had left here to receive us— <persRef key="adams-thomas">My
								brother’s</persRef> Son <persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph
								Harrod</persRef> soon afterwards came in— I wrote a Letter to my Son
							Charles to be sent in to Boston, by the Milkman to-morrow morning.</p>

						<p><date>3. V. </date>Thursday.</p>
						<p><persRef key="adams-thomas">My brother</persRef> and his daughter,
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S.</persRef> were here this
							morning. My Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> came out from
							Boston— I expected my family would have arrived here before dinner, and
							had again half a day of anxious expectation, and suspense— They arrived
							at six in the Evening having come this day the whole way from
							Providence. They landed there yesterday shortly after I came off in the
							Stage: and as I had advised they went to the Franklin house, to give the
							horses and take themselves a short repose. They were at the point of
							leaving the House to proceed to Walpole, when <persRef key="adams-john2"
								>John’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="adams-mary4">child</persRef> was suddenly seized with a
							fainting or convulsion fit— The alarm to <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, was
							inexpressible—for a short time they thought the child dead— A warm bath
							recovered her, and they sent for <persRef ref="mauran-joseph">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mauran</persRef>, who attended
							repeatedly in the course of the day. This accident was attributed to the
							effect of the violent motion of the Steamboat on the nervous system of
							the child. They remained over Night at Providence; and came from thence
							this morning. And thus Providence in judgment has yet remembered mercy.
							There is no other shelter from the storm— The child though still pale,
							appears to be quite recovered— My brother and <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">his daughters</persRef> were again here this
							Evening— My Son Charles and his wife returned to Boston— On arriving
							here yesterday I resumed my daily reading of three chapters of the
							Bible, at the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of Matthew; and
							this morning I took up again the Orations of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>, and read his defence of
								<persRef ref="rabirius-gaius">Caius Rabirius</persRef>, charged by
							the Tribune of the People <persRef ref="labienus-titus">Titus
								Labienus</persRef> with the crime of Perduellion—a complication of
							murder and treason. Thirty-six years before, the factious tribune
								<persRef ref="saturninus-lucius">Saturninus</persRef> had been
							killed in a popular tumult excited by himself. <persRef
								ref="labienus-quintus">Quintus Labienus</persRef> perished with him—
							His nephew Titus Labienus, being one of the Tribunes of the People, the
							year when Cicero was Consul, brought this accusation against <pb n="468"
								type="ms"/>Rabirius for having killed Saturninus— It was one of
								<persRef ref="caesar-julius">Julius Caesar’s</persRef> intrigues, to
							put down the Senatorial party— The cause was first tried by Duumvirs,
							drawn by lot, and Caesar was one of them— They condemned Rabirius, who
							appealed to the People. The defence of Cicero was delivered before them,
							but Labienus had limited the time allowed Cicero for speaking to half an
							hour. Part even of the Oration delivered in that time is lost. The
							finest passage of it is the turn which the Orator gave to a shout of the
							multitude to silence him upon his declaring his regret that he could not
							admit that Saturninus had fallen by the hand of Rabirius— He says he is
							happy to hear the shout because it shewed how small a portion of his
							hearers concurred in it—and that the Roman People would hardly have made
							him their Consul, if he could have been intimidated by so feeble a
							clamour as that— A second shout he remarks was weaker than the first,
							and he advises the clamourers to be silent, and withhold the proof of
							their folly and of their scarcity— It seems there was yet so much danger
							for Rabirius, that the Praetor <persRef ref="metellusceler-quintus"
								>Metellus Celer</persRef>, took down the standard on the Janiculum,
							which de facto dissolved the Meeting of the People, and Rabirius thus
							escaped condemnation.</p>

							wife of <persRef ref="dawes-henry">Henry Dawes</persRef>, with one Child
							there. Called afterwards at my brother’s. I read this morning the first
							Oration against <persRef ref="catiline">Catiline</persRef>: it is short,
							and I think I had translated it forty years ago. But I find in <persRef
								ref="ernesti-johann">Ernesti’s</persRef> Edition of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>, before the Orations against
								<persRef ref="rullus-publius">Rullus</persRef>, the fragments of the
							two Orations for <persRef ref="cornelius-caius">Caïus
								Cornelius</persRef>, and of one in Toga candida against his
							competitors for the Consulship, <persRef ref="hybrida-gaius">Caïus
								Antonius</persRef> and Catiline. These fragments are principally
							preserved by <persRef ref="asconius-quintus">Asconius
							Pedianus</persRef>— The two Orations for Cornelius are mentioned as
							among the greatest of his efforts, and he cites passages from them in
							his Orator ch. 67. and 70. I read these fragments but find nothing in
							them very remarkable— My progress here will be much more slow, with the
							same devotion of Time than it was at Washington. There I had nothing but
							the text of Cicero, in the pocket volumes of the Regent’s Classics— What
							I did not understand, I was obliged to pass over— Here I have many
							Editions of Cicero. Translations French and English. <persRef
								ref="prevost-antoine">Prevost’s</persRef> translation of <persRef
								ref="middleton-conyers">Middleton’s</persRef> life of the Orator,
							Dictionaries Commentators, Histories of Rome; and Dissertations upon
							Roman Manners, Government and Institutions— It is the race of the dog
							and the tortoise— Great part of this morning was absorbed in looking up
							the works that I possess relating to Cicero— The first is an Edition in
							nine Quarto Volumes, of <persRef ref="olivet-pierre">Joseph
								d’Olivet</persRef>, ad usum Delphini, printed by <persRef
								ref="manfre-giovanni">John Manfré</persRef> at Padua 1753— The
							principal merit of this work is the large type in which it is printed.
							The Indexes in the ninth Volume are useful, and it contains the Historia
							Ciceronis in annals by <persRef ref="fabricius-franciscus">Francis
								Fabricius</persRef>, perhaps the model of Middleton— 2. The second
							Edition of John Augustus Ernesti—6 Volumes Octavo—printed at Halle 1757.
							The second Volume containing the Orations is divided into two volumes,
							and the last volume is the Clavis, worth more for <pb n="469" type="ms"
							/>the illustration of Cicero, than all the other Commentaries upon
							Cicero ever written. It is in five Indexes 1. of Laws. 2. Geographical
							3. Historical 4. Latinity. 5 Graeco-Latin— The Regent’s Edition, omits
							from the Clavis the Index of Latinity. 3. The Edition by <persRef
								ref="u">Sallemand</persRef>. 14. Volumes duodecimo. of the <persRef
								ref="barbour-francis">Barbour</persRef> collection—merely the text;
							with Ernesti’s Arguments: very convenient for reading. 4. <persRef

								>Lilly’s</persRef> Boston Edition 12. Volumes duodecimo. I left at
							Washington. 5. The Edition of <persRef ref="godefroy-denis">Dionysius

							from 2. Corinthians 1.3.4. [“]Blessed be God, even the Father of our
							Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort: 4.
							Who comforteth us in all our tribulations.” a text well suited to the
							condition of my mind. The communion was administered after the usual
							service. A heavy rain prevented my attendance in the afternoon— <persRef
								ref="dearborn-henry2">General Dearborn</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef>
							took tea here— Dearborn who was removed from the Office of Collector at
							Boston is now a member of the Senate from the County of Norfolk in the
							State Legislature— They are now in Session, but will adjourn to-morrow,
							or the next day— The first Session of the 21<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> Congress, was closed last Monday. Of the four Bills of
							internal improvement, which passed both houses of Congress on Saturday
							the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> approved only one;
							and with that he sent a Message announcing that he signed it with the
							Understanding that it should receive a particular Construction— As it
							was an Appropriation for a road, the construction of the Laws will
							depend entirely upon himself but this explanatory Message, qualifying
							the signature of the President to an Act of Congress, is unexampled in
							this Country, and contrary to the Spirit of the Constitution—a
							Usurpation of the judiciary power, and susceptible of great abuse as a
							precedent— The Appropriation for the Road from Washington to Frederick
							he returned to the Senate with his objections, and the subsequent vote
							upon it there was 22 for and 16 against it. His negative thus controuls
							decided majorities in both houses of Congress— He defeated the
							appropriation for the continuation of the Cumberland Road, and the Bill
							authorizing the erection of several new Light-house, and directing many
							new surveys, in a different manner. When the joint Committee of the two
							Houses went to inform him that they were ready to adjourn, and to
							enquire if he had any further communication to make to them; he said he
							had nothing further, except that he retained those two Bills for further
							consideration. The provision of the Constitution is that a Bill
							presented to him shall become a Law, without his signature, if not
							returned by him within ten days, Sundays excepted; unless the Congress
							by their adjournment <hi rend="italic">prevent</hi> its return. His
							remark to the Committee doubtless was to give warning that Congress by
							their adjournment would prevent his returning those Bills— These are
							remarkable Events as bringing into operation Constitutional principles—
							The Presidential veto has hitherto been exercised with great reserve.
							Not more than four or five acts of Congress have been thus arrested by
							six Presidents and in forty years— He has rejected four in three days.
							The overseer ascendency is complete.</p>

						<p>This was the day of the Artillery Election; a sort of traditionary

							and obtained leave of absence for the day: and <persRef
								ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi></persRef> postponed work till to-morrow— The last time I
							was in the State on the day of the Artillery Election was in 1809. when
							they handled me roughly in their toasts— They now invited me to their
							feast— Had the weather been ever so fine, I could have taken no pleasure
							in it—but the day was showery. <persRef ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Holbrook</persRef> was here, a second
							time last Evening, and again this Morning— <persRef

							the right side of the face— <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus

							took a ride after dinner with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="adams-mary4">her child</persRef>; and in the Evening
								<pb n="471" type="ms"/>walked to <persRef key="adams-thomas">my

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Price Greenleaf</persRef> overtook me,
							and offered his services for arranging my library, or copying papers— He
							also conversed with me upon my trees, almost all those which I raised
							from the seed, acorn and nut, having perished— This is owing to the want
							of continued attention—to my absences every winter, and my return so
							late in the Season— The winter is especially the time when they most
							require care— I am then absent and they are totally neglected. In the
							course of the last Summer, I found also that it was too late in life for
							me to commence labouring with the spade and hoe. It gave me several
							sharp touches of rhumatism and lumbago— For pleasure and for advantage
							so far as I may yet derive any, the most effective resource for me is my
							books. I read yesterday the third, and this morning the fourth of the
							Orations against <persRef ref="catiline">Catiline</persRef>— The whole
							four are not so long as the single Oration for <persRef
								ref="roscius-sextus">Roscius of Ameria</persRef>— Not one of them
							could have taken half an hour in the delivery— There is something
							astonishing in the Scenery of these Speeches— The apostrophe to Catiline
							with which the first commences is a Coup de Theatre— It seems like an
							incident purposely devised to kindle and display the Eloquence of the
							greatest Orator that ever lived. The appearance of Catiline in the
							Senate, after two Nights of conspiracy for the destruction of the City,
							is an event scarcely conceivable— Yet had Catiline not been there, no
							Oration could have been delivered— An incident equally wonderful, and of
							the same character gave rise to the third Oration—namely the production
							in the Senate of the intercepted Letters written by the conspirators
							with Catiline, and the compulsion put upon them to acknowledge their own
							handwriting. The fourth Oration is upon the same question discussed
							between <persRef ref="cato-marcus">Cato</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef> in <persRef ref="sallust"
								>Sallust</persRef>— The Address with which <persRef

						<p>Heavy Showers of rain through the day, with cold weather. <persRef

								Holbrook</persRef> was here this morning— <persRef

							terrific attack of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Anthony’s fire that I

							here and settled his Rent with me to the first of April—and gave me the

							first of January last, acknowledged and recorded of three Acres of
							Salt-marsh more or less, adjoining upon the Mount Woolaston farm— He
							likewise sent me this Evening a Cow— My chief occupation now, next to my
							reading is, redeeming the arrearages of this Diary, with the increasing
							difficulty of writing, and now with the distressing illness of my wife,
							so disturbing the tranquility of the mind necessary for writing, that
							the record partakes of its infirmities— Its progress is also slackened
							and at the close of every day I am scarcely more advanced than at the
							beginning— This morning I commenced reading the Oration for <persRef
								ref="murena-lucius">Murena</persRef>, one of those which I had read
							and studied when I was first at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Petersburg in 1781— I have also read the Advertisement of the <persRef
								ref="prevost-antoine">Abbé Prevot</persRef>; pre-fixed to his
							Translation of <persRef ref="middleton-conyers">Middleton’s</persRef>
							life of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>; and the
							translation of Middleton’s preface— There are in both, notices of Roman
							customs, Laws, and Manners <pb n="472" type="ms"/>necessary to be known
							for the perfect understanding of Cicero. And I am looking into a thick
							Quarto Volume of <persRef ref="gronovius-johann">John Frederic Gronovius
								de Sestertiis</persRef>, which I suppose contains a full account of
							the monies and modes of accounting of the Greeks and Romans. The Book

							the <persRef ref="elzevir">Elzevir</persRef> Cicero had been dedicated
							to him as Prince of Orange by <persRef ref="schrevelius-theodorus"
								>Schrevelius</persRef>. There is a complication in the Roman modes
							of counting money, and of computing time which I never understood, and
							which often perplexes me, in reading the Latin authors— The arrangement
							of the days of the Month into Ides, Nones and Calends, with the custom
							of reckoning backwards so many days before each of those periods is
							unnatural and absurd— The forms of counting money, and of denoting the
							rates of interest, are still more intricate; but the very looking into
							those books, consumes too much of my time—how shall I study them? and
							cui bono? <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S. Adams</persRef> came
							to spend some days with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef>— I

						<p>Cold and Showery morning which still confined me to the house. After

								Bowditch</persRef>, and <persRef ref="treadwell-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tredwell</persRef>, the former and
							present President’s of the association of Mechanics in Boston, came to
							request me to deliver the introductory Lecture, to the course which is
							to be given, next Winter— It is to commence in October— The introductory
							Lectures of the preceding years have been given by <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="story-joseph">Judge Story</persRef>. I was in hopes I should
							have escaped this tax, which will give me much trouble and vexation,
							without credit to myself, or I fear benefit to any one else— I told
							them, that it would afford me great pleasure to comply with this
							invitation, which I felt as an honour conferred upon me— That the only
							consideration which could cause a single moment of hesitation in my
							mind, was a deep, and sincere distrust of my own qualifications to
							discharge the duty which I should assume— I was not acquainted with the
							precise objects of the Mechanic Association; and so far as I had an idea
							of the courses of Lectures which had been delivered to them; they were
							subjects with which my mind was not familiar, and towards which not much
							of my attention had ever been turned. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Tredwell said that he would furnish me with the annual Reports upon the
								<pb n="473" type="ms"/>objects of the Institution, which had been
							published, and they would give me the desired information— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bowditch mentioned my Report upon weights
							and Measures, as proving that I had been no stranger to the discussion
							of scientific subjects— I finally requested a few days for
							consideration, and assured them that I would very cheerfully undertake
							the task, if I could bring myself to the opinion that I could say any
							thing worthy of being heard— I planted in the Garden, five Walnuts given
							me last Winter by <persRef ref="roberdeau-mary">Mary
							Roberdeau</persRef>, and transplanted several Apple trees, just up from
							seeds which I sowed last Summer. They came up in clusters, and the day
							after I arrived, in weeding round some of them, I plucked up one of them
							by mistake for a weed— I immediately set it out, without expecting it
							would live, but it is now alive—and thriving. My walnuts, which are very
							large, I fear have been kept too long— The weather cleared off this
							afternoon, and I rode with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs. </hi>Nowland</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">child</persRef> to the new Meeting-House in
							Braintree, thence across to Weymouth and back over Penn’s Hill—
							Returning I stop’d, to visit <persRef ref="marston-john">M<hi

								ref="greenleaf-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J.

								B. Adams j<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> to <persRef
								ref="adams-ann">his mother</persRef>. Returning home I saw a very
							brilliant Northern Light; and a luminous Arch from Southeast to
							Northwest, quite across the Heavens, like that which I had seen in
							September 1827— The fever and inflammation with which <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> is afflicted subsides
							very slowly— <persRef ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Holbrook</persRef> this day intermitted his visit. I finished
							reading the Oration for <persRef ref="murena-lucius">Murena</persRef>,
							one of the favourites of the Translators. What versatility of Genius!
							This Oration was delivered in the very crisis of <persRef ref="catiline"
								>Catiline’s</persRef> conspiracy— Murena was already elected Consul
							as one of the Successors of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef>— Accused of Ambitus, or election bribery, by
								<persRef ref="rufus-servius">Servius Sulpitius</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="cato-marcus">Cato</persRef>, and defended by Cicero
							who had himself carried through a law, sharpening the penalties of that
							Offence— Murena was acquitted, and served his year as Consul— The
							management of the cause is inimitable— <persRef ref="demosthenes"
								>Demosthenes</persRef> could not have delivered such an Oration. The
							great struggle of the Speaker is against the weight of character of the
							accusers; both his personal friends; men of great talents and of
							admirable virtue— He treats them with the most respectful deference; but
							gets the laugh upon them both— Sulpicius for his lawyer’s
							technicalities—Cato for his Stoicism. There is a comparative estimate of
							military service, the profession of the Law, and popular eloquence,
							adapted to the state of the question and to Roman customs and opinions—
							The defence of Murena, upon the facts of alleged bribery, had already
							been made by <persRef ref="hortalus-quintus">Hortensius</persRef>; and
							although Cicero at the request of Murena, returned to it, and replied to
							the charges of the <persRef ref="sulpiciustheyounger">younger
								Sulpicius</persRef> and of <persRef ref="posthumius"
								>Posthumius</persRef>, that part of the Oration is lost. The case
							that he made upon the facts was doubtless strong; for it is remarkable
							of Cicero that his management of facts always carries conviction as
							irresistible as his arguments— You can never part from him without
							saying he was right.</p>

							for which he is already somewhat in advance— It has not been practicable
							to sell advantageously my part of the Lands either at Princeton or at
							Charlestown. <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Quincy</persRef> the President of Harvard University <pb
								n="475" type="ms"/>called, and gave me a copy of the three Volumes
							just published, of the Catalogue of the Library of the University— A
							fourth Volume, containing the maps and Charts is yet to come out— The
							Catalogue is first Alphabetical, in two Volumes, without discrimination
							of Subject or size annexing the format, to each work— The third Volume
							is a systematic Index, in which the works are divided into six Classes,
							and each Class, excepting the last, works relating to America, into
							several Sections. The Preface to the first Volume of the Catalogue,
							contains a brief account of the formation of the Library, and notices of
							the donors, in which my father’s name and mine are included— But M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy said there was no trace among the
							papers in his Office of the donations; or of what books they consisted—
							I told him I had no very distinct recollection of them; but there were
							three books, of which I could speak with certainty—<persRef
								ref="vanloon-gerard">Van Loon’s</persRef> Medallic History of the
							Netherlands, <persRef ref="catrou-francois">Catrou</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="rouille-pierre">Rouillés</persRef> Roman History, and
							the Collection of Memoirs of the History of France— We found them all in
							the Catalogue, but the Collection of Memoirs incomplete, and he said
							that some years since they sold their duplicates, and the History of
							Catron and Rouillé was one of them, which he himself purchased— It was
							an unbound copy, mine was bound. I observed that a new Treasurer had
							been elected— <persRef ref="ward-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ward</persRef> in the place of <persRef ref="francis-ebenezer">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis</persRef>, resigned— The cause
							of which, he said was ill health— I thought M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Quincy spoke in a less sanguine tone of the prospects of
							improvement at the College, than he did last year— He asked something
							about the annuity from W. N. Boylston’s benefactions; which I told him I
							had spoken of to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis this morning. He
							spoke also of the Account of Administration, on <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Estate; and said he would
							attend at the next Probate Court at Quincy. The present judge is
								<persRef ref="leland-sherman">Sherman Leland</persRef>—<persRef
								ref="robbins-edward">judge Robbins</persRef> having died in the
							course of the last year. I rode this afternoon with <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail2"
								>Abigail S. Adams</persRef>, towards Weymouth and to the Mount
							Wollaston beach— We left Abigail at <persRef ref="brooks-peter">her

						<p>There was a thunder shower this morning; which roused me before the Sun—
							Cold Rain all the Morning. Heard <persRef ref="pierpont-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pierpont</persRef> this morning from
							Exodus 20.5. “For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God.”—and in the
							afternoon from Hebrews 11.4. “he, being dead, yet speaketh.” I do not
							remember having heard him preach before; and his reputation being very
							high, neither of his Sermons entirely fulfilled my expectations— His
							manner and delivery are cold; though he is an elegant Poet— His Style is
							ornamental, but not remarkable for energy, or precision— His stamp is
							not deep, or my mind was not in the proper state to receive its
							impression— He dined with me, and I collected more thoughts from his
							conversation than from his discourses— He made several remarks upon the
							book of <persRef ref="job">Job</persRef>, which he thinks was not
							written by <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>—nor even a Hebrew Book.
							It is Arabian— No one of the names of the actors in it, are mentioned in
							any other part of the Scriptures; nor is there any allusion in any part
							of the Book to the Mosaic History— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Pierpont believes Job to have been a descendant of <persRef
								ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef>; but not of <persRef ref="jacob"
								>Jacob</persRef>. He thinks that the name of <persRef ref="satan"
								>Satan</persRef>, was borrowed by the Hebrews from the Chaldeans.
							Upon my remarking that the first occasion upon which Satan is named is
							in the account of <persRef ref="david">David’s</persRef> numbering the
							People; he said it was—in the Book of Chronicles. 1.21.1. probably
							written during or after the Babylonian captivity—but that in the other
							account of the same event—2. Samuel 24.1. the purpose of David is said
							to have been moved by the Lord— With regard to a future State; the ideas
							and opinions of the Jews appear to have been cotemporaneous with those
							of the Heathens— It was not communicated with the Law from Sinai— A dim
							and obscure conception of it, is found in the <pb n="476" type="ms"
							/>evocation of the shade of <persRef ref="samuel">Samuel</persRef>—
							Something more distinct in the Book of <persRef ref="daniel"
								>Daniel</persRef>; and still more so in the apocryphal books of the
								<persRef ref="maccabees">Maccabees</persRef>— The same difference is
							perceptible between the Elysian fields of <persRef ref="homer"
								>Homer</persRef>, and those of <persRef ref="virgil"
								>Virgil</persRef>. I spoke of the prophecies in the Old Testament,
							the application of which is made in the New Testament to the person, and
							mission of Christ; most particularly that of Isaiah 7.14. applied
							Matthew 1.23. of this prophecy as first delivered to <persRef ref="ahaz"
								>Ahaz</persRef>, and all the circumstances attending it, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierpont gave from memory a very exact
							account, and appeared to think that there had been a fulfilment of it at
							the time; although that is not mentioned in the narrative— The events
							announced by the prophet, and of which the birth of the child from a
							virgin was the miraculous sign, did happen and are recorded, and it is
							to be presumed that the sign itself was accomplished— I asked him if he
							thought the prophet <persRef ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef> himself had
							any conception of the application which his prophesy was ultimately to
							receive; or whether the Prophets were like <persRef ref="hamlet"
								>Hamlet’s</persRef> flute, which he presents to his associates, and
							tells them if they will give it breath, and govern its vantages, it
							would discourse most excellent music— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Pierpont said that was a great and very difficult question— I mentioned
							to him the strange and wonderful passage in one of <persRef ref="plato"
								>Plato’s</persRef> dialogues where <persRef ref="socrates"
								>Socrates</persRef> says that there must come a special messenger
							from Heaven, to reveal the future state of the human Soul—and I noticed
							the weakness of the argument of immortality in the Phaedon— But M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pierpont is not more familiar with Plato,
							than <persRef ref="story-joseph">judge Story</persRef>— <persRef

						<p>My Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> came out from Boston, upon a
							visit to us for some days. In the Evening I called at <persRef

							paid a visit; and afterwards I went to <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf’s</persRef>.
							The Evening was thus consumed— I wrote this afternoon, as Administrator
							de bonis non, of <persRef ref="boylston-thomas2">Thomas
								Boylston</persRef> with the Will annexed, a Letter to <persRef
								ref="baring-thomas;baring-john">Thomas and John Baring</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="bates-joshua">Joshua Bates</persRef>, to be sent with
							the Letter and Power, and Statement of facts of the Executors of
								<persRef ref="boylston-ward">Ward N Boylston</persRef>— I have read
							since Thursday the Orations for <persRef ref="sulla-publius">Publius
								Sulla</persRef>, for <persRef ref="archias-aulus">Archias the
								Poet</persRef>; and this morning began that for Lucius Flaccus
							Sulla, had been together with <persRef ref="paetus-publius"
								>Autronius</persRef> a candidate for the Consulship, two years
							before <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>— Their competitors,
								<persRef ref="cotta-lucius">Lucius Cotta</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="torquatus-lucius">Lucius Torquatus</persRef>, had impeached
							them for bribery, (ambitus) and both of them had been condemned—whereby
							Cotta and Torquatus had been proclaimed Consuls. The first conspiracy of
								<persRef ref="catiline">Catiline</persRef> immediately afterwards
							followed, but proved abortive. After the suppression of the second
							conspiracy of Catiline by Cicero, when Consul, and under his immediate
							Successors, <persRef ref="silanus-deciums">Silanus</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="murena-lucius">Murena</persRef>, Sulla was accused by
							the Son of Torquatus, as an accomplice of Catiline in both the
							conspiracies. With regard to the first he had been defended by <persRef
								ref="hortalus-quintus">Hortensius</persRef>, and this Oration is the
							defence by Cicero, not only of Sulla, but of himself upon the second;
							for young Torquatus in his accusation of Sulla, had very rudely and
							severely censured Cicero for undertaking the defence of Sulla. A full
							half of the Oration is embraced therefore by the Orator’s vindication of
							himself. Torquatus had charged him first with gross inconsistency, after
							his extraordinary zeal for the suppression of the conspiracy, in
							becoming the defender of Sulla—to which Cicero replies by enquiring why
							Torquatus confines the charge to him? why he did not extend <pb n="477"
								type="ms"/>it to Hortensius, who had also defended Sulla. He
							declares with much solemnity his own belief of Sulla’s innocence, and
							that no evidence had been exhibited to him of his guilt— Torquatus who
							was of a high Patrician family, had sneered at Cicero’s birth at
							Arpinum, and said he was the third foreign king of Rome— Cicero repels
							the imputation very indignantly, tells Torquatus that all cannot be
							patricians; and turns the tables upon him by shewing that his own mother
							came from one of the municipal cities, so that upon his own principle he
							was himself a foreigner— But Torquatus had affectedly lamented the
							execution of the conspirators; and thereby contributed to inflame the
							popular prejudices against Cicero for that act— Upon this point Cicero
							replies with painfully suppressed anger, and a boast of moderation,
							mingled with threats— Sulla was acquitted; and there was in fact no
							substantial Evidence against him; but he was one of the bad men of the
							age, and lived to be one of the Lieutenant Generals of <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef> at the Battle of Pharsalia.</p>

							signed also in duplicates the Letter with the Statement of facts to

								<persRef ref="gill-moses">Gill</persRef>, upon T. Boylston Estate,
							on account of the sum recovered from the French Government, and M<hi

							Charles to-morrow Morning to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis, who
							will go to Princeton, and get it executed by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gill. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston said there
							was a Note from Gill to her husband, of one thousand dollars, to set off
							against the claim of his when recovered— The Power referred to an
							Account of Petty Vaughan, acknowledging the receipt of the sum from the
							French Government, as annexed— This account was among the papers in my
							possession— Charles made a copy of it this evening— After my business
							done, I called at <persRef ref="wells-william">Wells</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="lilly-robert">Lilly’s</persRef> shop, and took the
								84<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> number of the English Quarterly
							Review, and bespoke the subsequent numbers of this and of the Edinburgh
							Review, to be delivered to me here instead of at Washington until next
							October— I strayed also to several other shops and made purchases of
							sundry Articles necessary for the use of the household; among which a
							pair of house Scales and Iron weights from four pounds to 1/4 of an
							ounce. I met in the Streets <persRef ref="hubbard-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Hubbard</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="morgan-charles">Captain Morgan</persRef> of the Navy. We dined
							with Charles— <persRef ref="gorham-julia">Miss Julia Gorham</persRef>
							was there— We all returned to Quincy before Evening— It was the first
							day of full Summer heat of this Season— I was unable to write— I yet
							adhere to my Ciceronian studies, and on Sunday read the Oration for
								<persRef ref="archias-aulus">Archias</persRef>—This is the organic
							law of human Literature— If <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef> had never atchieved any thing else but the
							composition of this Speech he would have been an eminent benefactor of
							his kind. The occasion of its delivery was a captious question made by
							some malignant dunce named <persRef ref="gratius">Gratius</persRef>
							<pb n="478" type="ms"/>whether Archias was a Roman citizen— He was a
							native of Antioch, and had been made a Citizen of Heraclea in Sicily— By
							a Law of <persRef ref="silvanus-plautius">Silvanus</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="carbo-gnaeus">Carbo</persRef>, otherwise called the
							Law Plautia-Papiria, persons inscribed as Citizens of the confederate
							Citizens (of which Heraclea was one[)], if when the Law was enacted they
							had their domicil in Italy, acquired the right of Roman Citizens by
							appearing before the Praetor, and claiming it within 60 days. All this
							Archias had done, but the public Register of Heraclea had been burnt in
							the Italic War; and there was a lack of evidence by the Record. It was
							supplied by the Testimony of respectable witnesses— The facts were
							sufficiently proved, and Cicero says not much about them: but the
							panegyric upon Literature, the profound philosophy and the connection of
							the arts with the progress of human virtue are original in this speech,
							and form with it an epoch in the advancement of civilization and
							morals.</p>

							chilly East wind— Then a light thunder shower, and a sultry evening.
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> is still
							confined to her chamber and almost entirely to her bed. Edward Everett
							gave me a pamphlet copy of his speech in the House of Representatives,
							on the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May against the Bill for the
							removal of the Indians, and I have received from <persRef
								ref="treadwell-daniel">Daniel Treadwell</persRef> a Letter, and
							several pamphlets relating to the Mechanics Institution in Boston; but
							they give me no encouragement to undertake the delivery of the
							Introductory Lecture next October. I finished reading the Oration for
								<persRef ref="flaccus-lucius">Flaccus</persRef>. He had been one of
							the Praetors, when <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> was
							Consul and was among the most active and efficient of his Assistants in
							suppressing the conspiracy of <persRef ref="catiline"
							>Catiline</persRef>; afterwards he had been three years Governor of the
							Province of Asia, and at the expiration of that Service, was prosecuted
							by <persRef ref="laelius-decimus">Decimus Laelius</persRef> de
							repetundis; that is for illegal extortion upon the inhabitants of the
							Province, which included Greece. The Law was provided to compel the
							restitution for monies or other property taken unlawfully; but the Roman
							Governor, had numberless modes of plundering the people— This
							prosecution, Cicero considers, as instigated by his enemies, and
							intended for a prelude to a direct attack upon him— He tells the judges
							that they are trying, not the cause of a few obscure provincial
							witnesses brought there upon compassion; but their own cause—that of
							their wives and children, of their Country; of the whole Roman People—
							That they are in effect trying over again the conspiracy of Catiline— A
							considerable part of this Oration is lost— The defence consists first in
							amplification of the previous good character of Flaccus— Secondly of his
							most important services in overthrowing Catiline’s conspiracy— Thirdly
							in a general impeachment of the credibility of all the witnesses against
							him; and fourthly in a refutation of particular charges, and a scrutiny
							of the characters of the witnesses by name. It is not the practice of
							Cicero, to spare the characters of witnesses who testify against his
							Clients <pb n="479" type="ms"/>and in this case he treats them with
							great severity. There is in the fourth Section, a very remarkable
							character given of the Greeks as a Nation— He allows them literature,
							discipline in many arts, pleasantness of discourse, shrewdness of
							genius—eloquence, and other indefinite merits—but denies them veracity,
							and all credibility in testimony. He treats the Greeks of Asia Minor
							with still greater severity, and quotes a sarcastic proverb against each
							of the four Nations, the Phrygians, Mysians, Carians and Lydians— There
							is a passage in the 28<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section concerning
							the Jews which is not intelligible to me— He calls their Religion a
							barbarous superstition— Flaccus was acquitted.</p>

						<p>A very warm Night; and the weather continuing this morning at high Summer
							heat, I took a bath at <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf’s</persRef> wharf,
							and swam from the upper to the lower wharf— It being the first time for
							the Season—the swimming distance was almost too great, and I returned
							well wearied— <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> left us for a visit
							to Medford— I planted a sixth Pennsylvanian Walnut, but they have been
							so carelessly kept, that the germ has withered; they float upon water,
							and the shells have split open. I likewise planted fourteen peach
							stones, which have been kept over winter, but almost all which sunk in
							Water— My fruit-trees, which I have attempted to raise from the stone
							and seed, perish in two different ways—in Summer, by the heat of the
							Sun, and in winter by the frost— From this fate are exempted, in a great
							measure the Horse Chesnuts—the Elms—Peaches, Plums, Apples and Apricots—
							But very few of the Oaks; and much to my surprize hitherto none of the
							Hickory Walnuts— It is indispensable to guard the young trees the first,
							and second Winter against the effect of the frosts, and this, not being
							here in the winter I have never done— Very few of my trees therefore
							survive— There is an enormous difference in the growth of trees of the
							same kind— One of the Horse Chesnuts, planted in the Summer house cellar
							in 1826. is now five feet high; others are 3 and 4 feet— In my Nursery
							there are a number, but none of them more than one foot above ground.
							The Stocks of many of the trees, after the first year become distorted—
							The stems of the Oaks run up excessively Slender, and the leaves,
							unnaturally large— For these and many other distempers of infancy which
							I have observed, I know not the remedy. Some of my walnuts which had
							died to the root, and come up again in the Summer house-cellar, have
							been killed by the Sun—others are saved by the Sheltering leaves of the
							Horse-chesnuts— <persRef ref="farrar-augustus">Farrar</persRef> has
							sowed the Oaks that I purchased the last Summer, in the Nursery, and
							they have come up, but look very thin and poor, and almost smothered
							with weeds— I paid an Evening visit to my next door neighbour <persRef
								ref="beale-george">George W. Beale</persRef> who is a good farmer
							and planter of trees— But he gives formidable accounts of the insects
							which swarm among them— The rose-bugs, are just now come to prey upon
							the Roses which are in full bloom— They swarm also upon the leaves of
							the Elm, which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale says is attacked by
							a more formidable enemy in the form of a large black worm of the
							Caterpillar kind— He says too that the Caterpillar and the Canker worm
							are both now very destructive to the apple orchards in this
							neighbourhood— It would be worthy of the agricultural and horticultural
							Societies to institute formal researches and enquiries into the natural
							history of fruit trees, and of the insects which prey upon them. For
							myself, I shall probably continue, as long as my life and health will
							admit to sow and plant every Summer seeds Stones and Acorns, the Trees
							from which will continue to perish, by frost and by Sun, by insect and
							by disease; all for want of continued attention and systematic pursuit—
							I am yet convinced that much useful service to the Country might thus be
							performed, by the raising of forest trees; but it would require a
							permanency of property, not adapted to our political Institutions and
							Laws; with us each Generation looks only to itself.</p>

							three hours— <persRef key="adams-thomas">My brother’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="adams-abigail2;adams-elizabeth">two daughters</persRef>
							were here. I spent an hour of the Evening at <persRef

								Greenleaf’s</persRef>— My brother and his daughters with <persRef
								ref="gourgas-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gourgas</persRef>
							were there— <persRef ref="quincy-josiah;quincy-mary2">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Quincy</persRef> paid us a visit while I was out this Evening— They
							came yesterday to <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President
								Quincy’s</persRef> Seat in this Town to spend the Summer. I read
							yesterday the Oration to the Senate, and this day that to the People
							after his return from exile— In the year of Rome 696. <persRef
								ref="piso-lucius">Lucius Calpurnius Piso</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gabinius-aulus">Aulus Gabinius</persRef> being Consuls, the
							fifth year after that of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef>
							Consulate, and the year immediately after that of <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Julius Caesar</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bibulus-marcus">Bibulus</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="clodius-publius">Publius Clodius</persRef> had obtained a
							decree of the People against Cicero, interdicting him from fire and
							water, and confiscating his Estates— The pretext for this was, that
							Cicero had caused Roman Citizens the accomplices of <persRef
								ref="catiline">Catiline</persRef> to be put to death without trial
							and contrary to Law— Clodius had accomplished this by a Series of the
							most profligate and outrageous acts—but Clodius was throughout the whole
							transaction, merely the tool of Caesar; and could not have succeeded
							without base connivance on the part of <persRef ref="pompey"
								>Pompey</persRef> and <persRef ref="crassus-marcus">Crassus</persRef>— It was at the time of the first
							Triumvirate— To effect his purpose Clodius a Patrician and Senator, had
							got himself adopted as the Son of a Plebeian young enough to be his Son;
							and then had got elected a tribune of the People. The decree was
							obtained by violence in a tumultuous assembly of the people— Cicero
							might have defended himself with the assistance of his friends, but it
							would have made a civil War, and he preferred going into exile. He was
							recalled about 16 months afterwards; and delivered the Oration to the
							Senate to thank them for their exertions in his favour— In the first
							Letter of the fourth book of his Epistles to <persRef
								ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef> he gives a very particular
							account of his return, and mentions his oration to the Senate on the
							Nones or 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September, the day after he
							arrived at Rome— It is full of thanks, and praise to the Consuls of that
							year <persRef ref="lentulus-publius">Lentulus Spinther</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="metellusnepos-quintus">Metellus Nepos</persRef>; of
							seven Praetors, of whom, especially <persRef ref="milo-titus"
								>Milo</persRef> and <persRef ref="sextius-publius"
							>Sextius</persRef>, and of eight tribunes of the People—but his
							invective against the Consuls of the preceding year, is extremely
							violent, and scurrilous. He represents Gabinius as an effeminate
							Epicurean, and abuses Piso for the swarthiness of his complexion. The
							Oration to the People, was delivered if at-all, two days after that to
							the Senate— Many passages in both Orations are the same— The praise of
							Pompey is too extravagant; and indeed his discourse concerning persons,
							both laudatory and vituperative, is exaggerated to absurdity. Sounding
							like dedications to kings.</p>

								ref="crafts-eliphalet">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crafts</persRef> of Bridgwater This morning from Psalm 30.5. “In his
							favour is life.” and in the afternoon from 2. Samuel 12.7 “Thou art the
							man.”— The texts were more impressive than the Sermons— Moral discourses
							upon benevolence have no doubt at all times their merit. Most of the
							preachers with whom <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Whitney</persRef> is associated, preach them all
							together— They are apt to dispose the hearer to sleep— They are perhaps
							easier to write than historical, doctrinal or controversial Sermons— But
							they do not irresistibly fix the attention— Of all Sermons that I have
							ever heard or read, those of <persRef ref="sterne-lawrence"
								>Sterne</persRef>, have left the deepest mark upon my memory— They
							are almost all parables— Jesus himself delivered most of his
							Instructions in parables; and it would be a suitable enquiry for a
							Christian Minister, whether this may not be considered as demonstrative
							proof that it is the most effective of all modes of Instruction. There
							are in the Scriptures numerous individual characters of whom something
							is related sufficient to form the subject of a parable—which with a
							little exertion of the imagination may be wrought into a
							narrative—decorated with argument, and pointed with a moral— Without
							persons there can be no pathos— Abstraction has no blood. Next to the
							historical Sermons, those of argument illustrating obscurities of
							natural or revealed religion are most agreeable to me— <persRef
								ref="massillon-jean">Massillon</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="tillotson-john">Tillotson</persRef> are, next to Sterne those
							of whose Sermons I retain the most durable Memory— <persRef

							of <persRef ref="butler-samuel3">Butler</persRef>, particularly the
							Sermons upon human Nature; and upon the Character of <persRef
								ref="balaam">Balaam</persRef>—and also his Analogy— I read them
							about twenty years ago, but without retaining much of their contents— I
							propose therefore to give them another perusal, and this day took up an
							Edition of the Analogy, published at London about the year 1780— I read
							only a long preliminary discourse, being a defence of Bishop Butler
							against a charge which seems to have been made against him after his
							death; that he became a convert to popery; and died in Communion with
							the Church of Rome— His memory was first vindicated by <persRef
								ref="secker-thomas">Archbishop Secker</persRef>, a Charge to the
							Clergy of his diocese, dwelling earnestly on external Religion, and a
							crucifix which he had laid in his chapel gave rise to the rumour, for
							the truth of which no more substantial Evidence was ever produced.</p>

						<p>I intended to have gone in to Boston with <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> this morning, and the Chaise was brought for us
							to the door, but there was a North east storm coming and it began just
							then to rain. We both concluded to stay and employed all the morning
							till dinner time in assorting the Books of the Library, and continuing
							the Catalogue— We had a fire in the dining room, and the Storm continued
							with heavy rain, and some thunder and lightening till approaching
							Sunset— I began yesterday to read <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero’s</persRef> Oration for his house, and continued this day. I
							brought up also the arrears of this Journal, and should henceforth be at
							liberty to pursue the occupation which I long since determined to
							undertake; upon which I did so little last Summer and have since
							entirely neglected— The very magnitude of the work deters me from the
							persevering application to it which it requires— There is a luxurious
							idleness in the possession of a considerable Library, and which I now
							find irresistible. While I take the Catalogue of my books; every volume
							that I take down to have its title recorded tempts me to look into it,
							and leads to a multitude of enquiries which waste time— I have a Letter
							from <persRef ref="waterhouse-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Waterhouse</persRef>, in which he mentions that he has sent to the
							Printer, his essay to prove that <persRef ref="pitt-william">Lord
								Chatham</persRef> was the author of Junius. A pertinacious attempt
							has lately been made to prove that <persRef ref="hornetooke-john">Horne
								Tooke</persRef> was the author of that literary prodigy— Nothing in
							literary or political History has ever more powerfully displayed the
							operation of Mystery upon the minds of men than the Letters of Junius.
							He declares himself that his secret is his own, and that it shall perish
							with him— This declaration has probably sharpened the curiosity of many
							readers, and has produced pamphlet after pamphlet, and volume after
							volume to fix the authorship, upon every possible person— Of the
							internal evidence of the Letters, there are two things which render it
							improbable that Chatham was the author— The panegyric upon himself—and
							the positive and explicit dissent from his avowed opinions upon no less
							a question than that between Great Britain and the American Colonies.
							The violence, the ingratitude, the duplicity, the malignity, the moral
							perversity, and the religious infidelity with which Junius abounds, were
							not in the known character of Lord Chatham, who if the fact should be
							proved upon him would lose reputation for virtue without gaining any
							thing upon the score of talent.</p>

						<p>I went in to Boston with <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>,

								ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H.
								Foster’s</persRef>, and at <persRef ref="everett-alexander">A. H.
								Everett’s</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Foster is
							recovering from sickness— I had a conversation upon subjects of
							Literature and Politics with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett. We
							spoke of the proposed memoir of the Life of <persRef
								ref="tudor-william2">William Tudor</persRef>, concerning whom he
							mentioned several facts of which he has lately acquired information—
							There are yet not sufficient materials upon which to commence the work—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett expressed some
							dissatisfaction that the members of Congress friendly to the election of
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> to the next Presidency, did not make a formal
							nomination of him before the close of the late Session of Congress— He
							thinks it was prevented by <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef>, who he supposes has
							views upon that office for himself. He says that <persRef
								ref="johnston-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Johnston</persRef> of Louisiana, was very anxious for a nomination
							which would have been made had it not been prevented by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster <pb n="483" type="ms"/>I told him
							that if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster had advised against a
							nomination, under expectations of being himself a Candidate, I thought
							he would be disappointed, but his advice against a nomination by members
							of Congress was good— Any Congressional nomination will injure the man
							in whose favour it will be made— I said it was impossible to foresee
							what the fluctuations of popular opinion would be— Hitherto there were
							symptoms of changes of opinion among the members of Congress, but none
							among the People— These could be indicated only by the Elections, and it
							would be unsafe policy to anticipate them— I had great doubts whether
							the majorities in the Legislatures of five States would be changed by
							the approaching Elections, and was far from certain that the next
							Legislature of Kentucky would nominate M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay in opposition to the re-election of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>General Jackson</persRef>— The whole strength of the present
							Administration rests upon his personal popularity, founded upon his
							military services— He has surrendered the Indians to the States, within
							the bounds of which they are located—this will confirm and strengthen
							his popularity in those States—especially as he has burdened the Union
							with the expence of removing and indemnifying the Indians— He has taken
							practical ground against internal improvements and domestic
							Industry—which will strengthen him in all the Southern States. He has as
							might have been expected thrown his whole weight into the Slave-holding
							scale; and that interest is so compact, so cemented and so fervent in
							action, that there is every prospect it will overpower the discordant
							and loosely patched policy of the free. The Cause of internal
							improvement will sink; and that of domestic Industry will fall with or
							after it— There is at present a great probability that this system will
							be supported by a majority of the People— If the Presidential election
							should be connected with this question and turn upon it M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay will be the Candidate of internal
							improvement, and of the manufactures. But it will be a minority. The
							anti-masonick spirit will operate against him in New-York, and perhaps
							elsewhere— Everett said that he had been solicited to publish in the
							North-American Review an Anti-masonic Article in answer to a violent
							masonic article in the last number of <persRef ref="walsh-robert"
								>Walsh’s</persRef> Review; but he had declined— But he said he was
							assured the anti-masons here would support M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay— But Clay is a Mason, and will not take any ground
							against them— It was near one O’Clock when I left M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett, and met <persRef
								ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Curtis</persRef> at my Son Charles’s Office. He told me that
								<persRef ref="francis-ebenezer">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Francis</persRef> the Treasurer of Harvard College, who had intended
							to purchase the mortgage of the Trustees of the Tremont Theatre had

						<p>I was quite unwell the whole day with my Cold, which again threatens my
							lungs— Sore throat, hoarseness and Catarrh, are constantly returning
							upon me; and for the last nine Months I have never been entirely free
							from them— <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to
							Boston and returned here to dine— From dinner till tea time we employed
							upon the Catalogue, and I took a ride with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary;adams-abigail4">two daughters in Law</persRef>, in
							the Carriage— I yesterday finished reading <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero’s</persRef> Oration for his House, and this morning began
							upon that concerning the answers of the Haruspices— The Oration for his
							House, was one of those in which Cicero most prided himself— In the
							second Epistle of the fourth Book of the Letters to <persRef
								ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>, he relates the circumstances
							and on which it was delivered— After he went into Exile, <persRef
								ref="clodius-publius">Clodius</persRef> had demolished his house,
							and to prevent the possibility that the Sand upon which it had stood
							should ever be restored to him, had caused it to be consecrated by
							religious solemnities, and a temple to be built upon it, consecrated to
							Liberty. But now the friends of Cicero insisted not only that Cicero’s
							land should be restored to him, but that his house should be rebuilt at
							the public expense. The Senate referred the question, as to the
							religious consecration of the place to <pb n="484" type="ms"/>the
							College of Pontiffs, before whom this Oration was delivered. In his
							letter to Atticus he says that if he never was eloquent upon any other
							occasion he was upon that, and that he should send it to him soon; that
							it might be useful to the young men of his time. It is among the
							Orations of the French translation of <persRef ref="wailly-noel"
								>Wailly</persRef>, but it is not one of those which I think the most
							pleasing. The first part of it has no relation to the question upon
							trial— It is a defence of the Senate, and of Cicero himself for having
							conferred upon <persRef ref="pompey">Pompey</persRef>, extraordinary
							powers to provide supplies of corn, for the people— A power for which
							there was apparently no necessity; and which became the cause of <unclear>much</unclear>
							after usurpation— The rest of the Oration, turns chiefly upon objections
							to mere formalities of performance in religious ceremonies— Clodius
							could not dedicate a Temple to Liberty, because he was not lawfully a
							Tribune— He was no Tribune, because he had not been legally adopted:
							because the consecration had been pronounced, not by the whole College
							of Pontiffs but only by one; a young man, a family relation of
							Clodius—unwillingly—and in an irregular member—finally because, no
							private property could be lawfully consecrated, but by virtue of a
							special edict of the People— This last reason was all sufficient, for
							Clodius had acted without any such edict of the People; and the rest of
							the argument appears to be superfluous— It is surprizing how the Orator
							upon such a subject could excite any interest at-all—and whatever
							interest there ever was, is extinguished by the abolition of the
							Religion under which the consecration had taken place. Clodius was a
							profligate, and unprincipled hypocrite, as well in religion as in
							Politics— His profanation of the mysteries of the Bona Dea, proved his
							shameless contempt of the Religion of his Country— The greater part of
							this Oration is a continued strain of invective against him— In Section
							35. a bitter stroke of Irony, in reply to a sneer of Clodius, charging
							him with affecting the Power of <persRef ref="jupiter"
							>Jupiter</persRef>— In Section 41. a beautiful philosophical Sentiment
							upon piety to the Gods— In Section 31. he styles the Gracchi most
							seditious men— He had spoken of them more favourably in one of the
							Orations against the Agrarian Law of <persRef ref="rullus-publius"
								>Rullus</persRef>— In speaking or writing of historical Events and
							characters it is well to remember at one time what has been said or
							written at another.</p>

							Louisa brought me two bundles of copies of <persRef key="adams-abigail"
								>my beloved mother’s</persRef> Letters; with some manuscript
							extracts of mine made from my youthful readings, while I was studying
							Law at Newbury-Port. I finished reading the Oration upon the Answers of
							the Haruspices; which is still more connected with the Religious
							superstitions of the age than the Oration for <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">his</persRef> house— A Story had been gotten up,
							and circulated to the great dismay of the masters of the world, that
							strange subterraneous noises, and a horrible clashing of Arms had been
							heard in the neighbourhood of Rome— The alarm was so great that the
							Senate referred the question to the Haruspices, what this new Wonder be
							must be understood to portend— They consulted the Etruscan Books, and
							answered the reference of the Senate, in writing— They declared that the
							Gods were highly offended, and that supplications to them must
							immediately decreed— They specified several transgressions which had
							been committed; among which one was, that sacred and religious places
								<pb n="485" type="ms"/>had been profaned— <persRef
								ref="clodius-publius">Clodius</persRef> the infamous and perpetual
							persecutor of Cicero immediately seized upon this part of the
							declaration, and attempted to persuade the people, that it applied to
							the restitution of Cicero’s House and Land— In this Oration, delivered
							in the Senate, Cicero retorts the charge upon him, and by a special
							analysis of every part of the Answers argues with great force and
							ingenuity, that it all applies to the crimes of Clodius— We know at
							present that all this was imaginary, but from the earnestness with which
							he argues the case, we cannot forbear to believe that he was very
							sincere in his convictions, and really thought that the Gods were
							denouncing Clodius from under-ground— There appears to have been no
							question for discussion— The object of Cicero, was immediately to
							discredit the pretension of Clodius; and to suppress instantly the
							attempt to enlist the religious fears of the People against him and his

							of Clodius in pretending any concern for religion; with the crimes under
							which he was living. The answers of the Aruspices indicated a convulsed
							and gloomy state of public feeling, and Cicero himself largely partakes
							of it— The peroration is full of dejection and despondency— He despairs

								Chandler</persRef>, and a dinner at 3. at the Railway house— M<hi

							I told him, with suitable acknowledgments for the favour that I
							apprehended the state of my health would not admit of my attendance— I
							observed that I would send him a written answer if it was desired; but
							that I wished to avoid all public meetings— He said my verbal answer

								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>, who approved of the omission to nominate him at the
							West as entirely satisfactory. I thought the state of public opinion
							would be collected from the result of the elections which will commence
							the next Month in Louisiana, and then follow successively in the other
							Western States till the Winter— Nothing is more delusive than
							anticipations of the event of elections, and expectations of great
							changes in popular suffrages are almost always disappointed— I suppose
							that the sacrifice of the Indians, and of the interest of internal
							improvement and domestic Industry, will strengthen rather than weaken
							the popularity of the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">present
								Administration</persRef>— I have cherished the principle and the
							system of internal improvement under a conviction that it was for this
							Nation the only path to increasing comforts and well being, to honour,
							to glory, and finally to the general improvement of the condition of
							mankind— This system has had its fluctuations from the time of the
							Establishment of the present Constitution of the United States— During
							the Administration of <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>, it was constantly
							acquiring strength in Congress and in the public opinion— It was then
							favoured by <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lowndes-william">Lowndes</persRef>, both of whom had hopes of
							rising upon it, and with them the State of South-Carolina was devoted to
							it— The combination in Congress, became by their means so strong that it
							overpowered the resistance of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							<pb n="486" type="ms"/>Monroe, and produced the Act of Congress of April
							1824— The Slave-holders of the South have since discovered that it will
							operate against their interests— Calhoun has turned his back upon it;
							and Jackson who to promote his election and obtain Western votes
							truckled to it for a time, has now taken his decided stand against it—
							My devotion to it has sharpened all the fangs of envy and malice against
							it, and multitudes oppose it, only because its success would contribute
							to my reputation— The cause will no doubt survive me; and if the union
							is destined to continue, will no doubt ultimately triumph— At present it
							is desperate— <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to

							were here this Evening— When I came here last Summer, I undertook to
							labour personally in my garden with the spade and hoe. Perhaps at the
							age of thirty, this discipline might have been found practicable— I
							persevered in it, till repeated attacks of rhumatism and lumbago warned
							me that these labours were not suitable for me, and I desisted— I now
							visit my garden from time to time, but without the spade or hoe— The two
							bearing cherry trees are just now stripped of their last fruit, before
							it was ripe—partly by the birds; and partly for family consumption in
							tarts. I have this day buried, in one of my old seed boxes, a handfull
							of Stones from these cherries to ascertain if they will vegetate. My
							Summer house cellar, is nearly full of trees two and three years old,
							and most of them now fit for transplanting. The growth of the Oaks, Elms
							and Horse-chesnuts chiefly demands observation. The shoot of the Oak, of
							the present year has recently put forth in two or three of the Trees,
							and not in the others. A twig of willow that I stuck down, two years
							since took root, and are now so flourishing that eight or ten days since
							I cut off its stem, say six or eight inches above the ground. I mark
							this day three new shoots coming out upon the stump— The most remarkable
							fact, of my young Oaks is the smallness of their Stems—and so it is of
							the Apples, peaches, and Plums. Of Cherries, I believe there is but one
							living which came up from the Stone.</p>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Green</persRef>, a young man
							settled at Lechmere’s Point— His morning text was from John 20.29.
							[“]Jesus saith unto him, <persRef ref="thomas2">Thomas</persRef>,
							because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that
							have not seen, and yet have believed”— That of the afternoon was from
							Luke 17.20. [“]And when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the
							kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, the kingdom of
							God cometh not with observation: 21. Neither shall they say, lo here! or
							lo there! for behold, the kingdom of God is, within you.”— There is much
							to say upon this text which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Green did not
							say— He explained what he understood by the word observation—that is
							outward <pb n="487" type="ms"/>Shew, but he did not expound the terms
							kingdom of God—words used in the new Testament, in several different
							senses— A copious exposition of the words, with illustrating references
							to all the passages of the Gospels where they are used would belong to
							the subject of a discourse upon this text— The kingdom of God, is an
							expression, first introduced by Jesus Christ himself, and a part of the
							prayer which he taught his disciples is that it may come— The question
							of the Pharisees, probably alluded to that passage of his prayer; and
							the answer is equally adapted to it— The kingdom of God, will not come
							by the sound of a trumpet; or the shout of Victory— The kingdom of God
							is within you. It is the purification of the heart from evil passions—
							It is a life of Charity and Love— I read also two Sermon’s of <persRef
								ref="barrow-isaac">Barrow</persRef> upon the Love of God— I cannot
							discover the beauty or sublimity of this writers Style, of which I have
							heard much—nor account for the resuscitation of his fame in the recent
							critical Legislation of England— In these Sermons he undertakes to
							define the Love of God; and a more clumsy, loose, parenthetical,
							ungrammatical Sentence of English was never written— He conveys no
							distinct idea; and gives no shadow of a reason for the power of the
							Sentiment in the heart of man. The Love of God is in the Religion of
								<persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef> the first of human duties;
							because obedience to the Will of God embraces the whole duty of Man—
							Barrow confuses what was clear instead of elucidating what was obscure.
							But I must pause— <persRef ref="sprague-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>I went in to Boston this morning with <persRef ref="kirk-john">John
								Kirke</persRef>; attended at the Probate Office, and returned the
							Judge’s warrant for taking an Inventory of the Estate of <persRef
								ref="boylston-thomas2">Thomas Boylston</persRef>, and also the
							affidavit that I had given the necessary notices of my appointment as
							Administrator de bonis non, with the Will annexed of his goods and
							Estate— An entry was made on the back of the order for taking the
							Inventory, that no Assets have been found within this Commonwealth— That
							the only property of the deceased that has come to my knowledge is a sum
							of about forty thousand dollars, received by <persRef
								ref="vaughan-petty">Petty Vaughan</persRef> at London; and that if
							any property of the deceased should hereafter come into my possession, I
							would duly account for the same— <persRef ref="heard-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Heard</persRef>
							the Register told me that I was entitled to a copy of these papers which
							would be ready to be delivered to me in a fortnight— I then went to my
							Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> Office, and after
							executing sundry family commissions, at the sound of the Clock at one
							departed and returned to Quincy— I had received an invitation from the
							Charlestown Lyceum to attend at their celebration of the second
							centennial anniversary of the landing at that place. <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> delivered the Oration,
							at three in the afternoon. I had also an invitation from <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin</persRef>, to his
							house, after the Address—but the hours did not suit my convenience, and
							I neglected to attend. But there is always dissipation of a day when I
							go to Boston— I wasted the afternoon in finishing the fourth and last
							Volume of the Correspondence of <persRef ref="deffand-marie">Madame du
								Deffand</persRef>. Her Letters to <persRef ref="voltaire-francois"
								>Voltaire</persRef> are far less pleasing or curious than those to
								<persRef ref="walpole-horace">Horace Walpole</persRef>— Her
							Portraits have no features— Her Letters to Voltaire consist of unceasing
							complaints of ennui—the tediousness of Life—gross adulation of her
							correspondent, and constant teizing of him to send her his writings. <pb
								n="488" type="ms"/>I finished also the Oration of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>, for <persRef
								ref="sextius-publius">Publius Sextius</persRef>.— It is not among
							the select Orations translated either into French or English: but as a
							historical monument it is equal in interest, to any one of the whole
							collection. It is one of the longest that have been preserved; and
							contains a full exposition of the causes of his own exile, and of his
							motives for submitting to it; rather than defend himself by civil War—
							In the violent struggles for his recall Sextius had been one of the
							principal actors in his favour; and in a riot between a party of men
							headed by him, and the ruffian gang of <persRef ref="clodius-publius"
								>Clodius</persRef>, he had been wounded and left for dead in the
							Street— For this affair he was prosecuted, upon the Lutatian Law,
							against armed violence (de vi,) and was defended by <persRef
								ref="hortalus-quintus">Hortensius</persRef> and others as well as by
							Cicero— His Oration is more a defence of himself than of Sextius— There
							is much both of invective and of ridicule cast upon the two Consuls of
							the year of exile, <persRef ref="piso-lucius">Piso</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="gabinius-aulus">Gabinius</persRef>; a very pleasant
							and humorous exhibition of the Epicurean Philosophy; and a very lively
							description of the two great political parties in Rome—the populares and
							the optimates— The duty of Patriotism, and of setting toil and danger at
							defiance for the service of the Republic, is set forth with equal ardour
							and beauty; and the injustice of condemning Sextius for Violence, in a
							fray from which he had barely escaped with Life is shewn with
							irresistible force— Evening party at <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">T.

						<p><date>29. IV:20. </date>Tuesday.</p>
						<p>The day passed without interruption of visitors; but was eroded by
							trivial household concerns, always annoying to me, because I have passed
							my life in ignorance of them. The important business of this morning was
							to refine with the yolk’s and shells of a dozen eggs, a pipe of Madeira
							Wine— I visited my garden—in which nothing draws my attention, but the
							results of my experiments to raise trees from the seed, nut and stone.
							In the Summer house-cellar there are Seven Oaks; all by the leaf
							apparently Chesnut white Oaks— The Acorns were planted about the 1<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of October 1826— They came up in May
							1827. and this is the fourth year of their growth. The stems are
							slender; the leaves very large— The height of the tallest, before this
							years growth<space/>inches— The same tree has since I arrived here put out a
							shoot<space/>inches long, but it is attacked by large Ants, which have eaten
							up most of its leaves as they were unfolding; and one of which I found
							working at the joint from which it sprouted to cut it off— The single
							Hickory Walnut tree, of which I planted the nut in October 1804. bears
							fruit again this year. The nuts were first perceptible some days after I
							came, and are now rapidly growing in size— There are in the garden below
							sixteen apple-trees from seeds which I planted last Summer, two of which
							may possibly live. I now regret that I did not sow and plant more last
							year— After dinner, I slept an hour, began to read <persRef
								ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire’s</persRef> Commentary upon
								<persRef ref="corneille-pierre">Corneille</persRef>— Bathed and swam
							at the wharf, and found the day gone; and nothing done— In the Morning I
							had read the Oration against <persRef ref="vatinius-publius"
								>Vatinius</persRef>, which consists of a Series of interrogatories—
							A furious invective in the form of Questions. Vatinius had been produced
							as a witness against <persRef ref="sextius-publius">Sextius</persRef>;
							and had testified against him— <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Ciceros</persRef> object was to discredit his testimony, and he
							charges him in the most unqualified manner with lying—tells him that no
							man thinks him fit to live and that he would have passed over in silence
							his testimony as too contemptible for notice, had he not thought it best
							to break down his impudence, and entangle him in the net of his own
							inconsistencies, by putting to him a few questions— Vatinius had been a
							tribune of the People when <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>
							was Consul; and had been one of his devoted instruments— He now
							endeavoured to sustain himself by alledging the <pb n="489" type="ms"
							/>authority of Caesar, and the weight of this allegation in the address
							with which Cicero encounters and evades it— One of the heaviest charges
							against Vatinius, is that he appeared dressed in black—cum toga pulla,
							at a public banquet given by <persRef ref="arrius-quintus">Quintus
								Arrius</persRef>— The contrast of the black and the white
							garment—atratus et albatus is here strongly marked, and shews how among
							the Romans, Sentiment was connected with manners— This Vatinius and the
								<persRef ref="gabinius-aulus">Consul Gabinius</persRef> were the men
							with whom Cicero afterwards at the instance of <persRef ref="pompey"
								>Pompey</persRef> and under the fear of the first triumvirate became
							reconciled—and for which he apologises in the Letter to <persRef
								ref="lentulus-publius">Lentulus</persRef> 1.9.</p>
