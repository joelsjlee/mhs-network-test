						<p>Thick fog this morning and afterwards a South wind, as predicted last
							Evening by <persRef ref="miller-edward">Edward Miller</persRef>— Heard <persRef ref="whitney-peter">P.
								Whitney</persRef> in the morning from Romans 12.1. “I beseech you
							therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies
							a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
							service.” The Sermon was an earnest exhortation to the members of the
							Congregation, to join in Communion with the Church— And the communion
							was administered— <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C Smith</persRef>
							dined with us— The afternoon discourse was from Luke 10.38. [“]Now it
							came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village; and
							a certain woman, named <persRef ref="martha">Martha</persRef> received
							him into her house. 39. And she had a sister, called <persRef
								ref="mary3">Mary</persRef>, which also Sat at Jesus’ feet, and heard
							his word. 40. But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to
							him and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my Sister hath left me to
							serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. 41. And Jesus answered,
							and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about
							many things: 42. But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that
							good part which shall not be taken away from her.” This as M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney observed is a very instructive
							narration; and pointedly marks a preference of religious and
							intellectual pursuit, even to the obligations of hospitality— It is a
							profoundly moral lesson, and contains one of the principal
							characteristics of the Christian religion— After the Evening service, I
							was reading to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>
							part of a chapter of <persRef ref="butler-joseph">Butler’s</persRef>
							analogy, when <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">General Dearborn</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Degrand</persRef> came in, and spent the Evening here— I began this
							morning the Philosophical works of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef> with the Treatise de finibus bonorum et
							malorum—This work I have never read— It contains the exposition of the
							principles of the three great sects of the Grecian Philosophy— The
							Epicurean, the Stoic, and the peripatetic— It is in five books,
							addressed to <persRef ref="brutus-marcus">Marcus Brutus</persRef>, in
							return for one, by Brutus addressed to him upon Virtue— The first book
							is a dialogue between <persRef ref="torquatus-lucius">Lucius
								Torquatus</persRef>, <persRef ref="triarius-caius">Caius
								Triarius</persRef>, and Cicero himself, at his Cumanum, or villa at
							Cumae, where they were visiting him— I read 11. Sections of the first
							Book, and then read an English Translation of the same, which I find
							among the books of <persRef key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef>
							Library; called Tully’s five Books de finibus, or concerning the last
							Object of Desire and Aversion. Done into English by <persRef
								ref="parker-samuel4">S. P. Gent</persRef>—revised and compared with
							the Original, with a recommendatory Preface by <persRef
								ref="collier-jeremy">Jeremy Collier</persRef>, M.A. together with an
							Apology for the philosophical writings of Cicero, in a letter to the
							Translator, by <persRef ref="dodwell-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Henry Dodwell</persRef>: published by <persRef
								ref="tonson-jacob">Jacob Tonson</persRef> in 1702— S. P. was Parker—
							The names of Collier and Dodwell are eminent in English Literature.</p>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis</persRef> told him he
							could borrow money to any amount, at five per Cent interest, giving
							security— I promised to deliver up his note and to discharge the
							mortgage at any day when it might suit his convenience to make the
							payment— I planted a row of 24 crushed Whortleberries, along by the
							western Wall of my Nursery— Filled 3 book boxes with Earth, and
							stationed them in the garden, near the gate of my Nursery—for
							promiscuous experiments—to pass the winter sub dio. Planted two balsam

								ref="homer-jonathan">Rev Jonathan Homer</persRef> of Newton called
							to see me this afternoon— He has been some time engaged up<unclear>on</unclear> a history
							of the English Translations of the Bible, from that of <persRef

								ref="freeman-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
								Freeman</persRef>, still Pastor of the Chapel Church in Boston— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Homer left with me a printed notice of
							this work, extracted from the Boston daily Commercial Gazette. In the
							Evening I rode with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> to the
							beach below Mount Wollaston. Finished reading the first Book of Cicero
							de Finibus, and afterwards read <persRef ref="parker-samuel4"
								>Parker’s</persRef> English translation of it. The introduction is
							an apology by <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> for writing
							upon these philosophical subjects; whence it appears that there were
							many of his cotemporaries, who blamed him for this employment of part of
							his time— They thought there was no use in meddling with the philosophy
							of the Greeks—and they maintained even that the Latin language was not
							suitable for philosophical disquisition. Cicero maintains on the
							contrary that the Latin language is richer than the Greek— There was
							indeed no moral philosophy at Rome before Cicero— Their young men were
							sent for Instruction to Athens; and there were taught the Grecian
							Philosophy— They adopted according to their individual characters, one
							or other of the systems of the Grecian Schools, and some were
							Epicureans, some Stoics, and some peripatetics, or Academics— There was
							no Original Roman philosophy; <persRef ref="lucretiuscarus-titus"
								>Lucretius</persRef> was a cotemporary of Cicero, and his Poem was
							an exposition of the Epicurean System, in beautiful verse. <persRef ref="torquatus-lucius">Torquatus</persRef> in
							this dialogue, delivers it in elegant prose—and he gives very plausible
							answers to the common objections against the System. The Style, as that
							of all Cicero’s writings is flowing and easy—adapted to the subject;
							between the undress of the familiar Epistles, and the formal array of
							the Orations.</p>

						<p>I went to Boston with <persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirke</persRef> in

							at Boston; and took the certificate of that fact from the Cashier; which
							I immediately enclosed in a Letter to the Lieutenant, who is stationed
							at Fort Moultrie, on Sullivan’s Island, near Charleston, South-Carolina—
							I made some acquisitions of hard-ware at <persRef ref="brooks-charles2"

						<p>The annoyance of Wasps, flies, black ants, Squash bugs, Turnep worms, and
							insects numberless, is inseparable from the interest and pleasure of
							plantation. The gourd and the worm of Jonah, are descriptive of natural
							phenomena and human passions operative alike in all ages— Every plant
							that I raise from the seed takes hold of my affections; and when it
							perishes by a stroke of the Sun, or winter’s frost, or a voracious
							insect, I feel a disappointed hope— As the nutmeg peaches ripen, wasps
							and flies fasten upon them: the decay of rottenness immediately
							commences; and the wasps and flies eat the ripening side in to the
							Stone. I found this morning, in that condition, all those which had
							yesterday the appearance of immediate ripening. I plucked and planted a
							row of them in the middle book-box—and several old Horse-chesnuts by the
							limeseeds and whortle berries in the Nursery. Swam from wharf to wharf.

							Book de Finibus in which <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>
							sets forth in full detail his objections to the Epicurean System of
							Philosophy. This enquiry after the summum bonum, or the end of human
							existence, was pursued with great ardour by the Grecian
							Philosophers—different minds came to different conclusions— But these
							conclusions were all speculative—they had no sanction of superior
							authority— Their operation upon human conduct was therefore imperfect.
							Epicurus taught that the supreme good was sensual pleasure—and that all
							evil resolved itself into pain— There were however two other varieties
							of the Epicurean philosophy—one which considered the absence of pain the
							supreme good—and the other, durable or permanent pleasure. <persRef
								ref="zeno">Zeno</persRef> placed the Supreme good in Virtue, and
							this was the foundation of the Stoic Philosophy— The Academick, and
							Peripatetic Schools, of <persRef ref="plato">Plato</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="aristotle">Aristotle</persRef>, formed a middle term
							between the rigorous doctrines of Zeno, and the laxity of <persRef
								ref="epicurus">Epicurus</persRef>— They considered Virtue as the
							Supreme good; but that the external advantages of Fortune were also
							good; and that Virtue was not of itself all sufficient for human
							happiness. The demonstration against the Doctrine of Epicurus in this
							book is complete— The end of human existence is not <hi rend="italic"
								>enjoyment</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">action</hi>. The mischief of
							the Epicurean theory was not so much in itself, as in the influence
							which it exercised over human action— He guarded it partially, by
							teaching that the highest and only perfect <pb n="515" type="ms"
							/>enjoyment consisted in the practice of virtue, and <persRef
								ref="torquatus-lucius">Torquatus</persRef> boasts that Epicurus
							himself was eminently virtuous both in life and death— Cicero gives a
							Letter from Epicurus written on the day of his death to <persRef
								ref="hermarchus">Hermachus</persRef>, written under the agony of the
							Stone, in which he declares himself though suffering the extremity of
							the Stone, still happy in the remembrance of his great discoveries—and
							recommends to his friend to take care of the children of <persRef
								ref="metrodorus">Metrodorus</persRef>: and Cicero remarks the utter
							inconsistency of this Letter with the principles of its author— The
							tendency of Epicureanism has always been to the corruption of morals;
							nor have any of his disciples in any age been remarkable for their
							virtue—</p>

							copied by the Register of Deeds, on his Record; and then entered upon my
							copy; which is the quasi-deed, and my voucher of title— I read twelve
							Sections of the third book of de Finibus— This is a different dialogue
							from that of the two first Books— The interlocutors now, are <persRef

							exhibited at Rome—to look up some Treatises of <persRef ref="aristotle"
								>Aristotle</persRef> which he wished to consult: and meets there
							Cato surrounded by volumes of the Stoic writers— This naturally
							introduces a Conversation upon the Stoic doctrines, which at the request
							of Cicero, Cato fully sets forth— He begins by expressing an earnest
							wish that Cicero would adopt those doctrines, telling him with a
							flattering compliment, that he above all other men should maintain that
							Virtue is the only good. Cicero insists that the difference between the
							Peripatetics and Stoics was merely on words; Cato undertakes to shew
							great and essential differences between them.</p>

							The principles of the Stoic Philosophy were sublime. But it may be
							doubted whether <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>, though
							speaking in the name of <persRef ref="catoyounger">Cato</persRef> has
							altogether fairly set them forth. There is a leaning to the ridiculous
							even in this statement of the case. Cato acknowledges that there is some
							obscurity in the language used by the Stoics; and complains that he has
							no suitable words to render many Greek expressions which they employed—
							They made very nice discriminations, and used some captious Syllogisms.
							There is more of enthusiasm than of philosophy in Cato’s preference of
							this sect— But it is was a doctrine eminently conducive to the dignity
							of human nature— And it was the doctrine of Cato and <persRef
								ref="brutus-marcus">Marcus Brutus</persRef>, the two men of their
							age the most virtuous.</p>

								<persRef ref="cleanthes">Cleanthes</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="chrysippus">Chrysippus</persRef> had written upon Rhetoric,
							excellent works for a dumb man to read— The Academic school he says
							divided the nature of man into body and Soul, attributing to each its
							appropriate virtues, and giving to the Soul a high pre-eminence over the
							body— But the principles of the Stoics were suitable only for a being
							consisting only of a Soul, and without body— As those of the Epicureans
							were for a mere body without a Soul.</p>

							is a partial exposition by <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
							>Cicero</persRef>, of the moral philosophy of the Academic and
							Peripatetic Schools—with the view only to refute that of the Stoics— His
							objections to the Doctrines of <persRef ref="zeno">Zeno</persRef> are,
							that so far as they are good, they were taken from <persRef ref="plato"
								>Plato</persRef> and <persRef ref="aristotle">Aristotle</persRef>,
							and their followers: and that whatever of new there is, in them is
							either useless, trivial or absurd— He tells <persRef ref="catoyounger"
								>Cato</persRef> that he will not now handle the subject with him as
							he did, in the defence of <persRef ref="murena-lucius"
							>Muraena</persRef>, when he had adapted his discourse to the multitude,
							attending at the trial, and said much to please the crowd; but he
							insists that the Stoic denial that pain is an evil is absurd, and their
							subterfuges, admitting that health, and riches, and honours and power,
							and in short all comforts other than virtue are desirables or
							preferables, and the reverse of them rejectables, though neither good
							nor evil, are ridiculous— Cato intimates that all these objections, are
							merely popular and not philosophical— Says he will take some other day
							to reply to them all, as he is able to do, and then after a courteous
							interchange of compliments the dialogue closes.</p>

						<p>I attended at <persRef ref="u">French’s</persRef> Tavern the probate
							Court now held by <persRef ref="leland-sherman">Sherman Leland</persRef>
							the present Judge— <persRef ref="robbins-edward">Edward Hutchinson
								Robbins</persRef> the late judge died in the course of the last
							Winter. I enquired for the account which I had filed last November; but
							judge Robbins had passed no order upon it, and as there was a charge
							left in Blank, of compensation to the Executors, he said he had
							established a rule that before allowing such an account notice must be
							given to all persons interested in the Estate— After some conversation
							and enquiries he advised me to withdraw the Account presented by me last
							November, to add to it all the charges which have since occurred, and
							present it again— I accordingly took it back; and a copy of the
							Supplementary Inventory, returned last November— The judge gave me also
							a printed copy of a Rule established by himself of compensation to be
							allowed to Executors, Administrators and Trustees; and proposed that I
							should make the charge conformably to it, though he did not intend it as
							positively applicable to past cases— I told him I should be satisfied to
							conform to the rule, and to give notice to all the parties interested. I
							was desirous however of having the Settlement of the Estate as soon
							completed as possible— After dinner I took a bath, and swam from wharf
							to wharf alone. The <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary"
								>Ladies</persRef> and <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> took
							a ride to Dorchester. I began the fifth Book de Finibus, and was twice
							in the Garden.— In the morning trimmed a young Elm tree, and found one
							just up from the seed— My willow stem in the Summerhouse cellar is 26
							inches long, and continues growing half an inch a day— The Shellbarks in
							the cellar appear to be dying. The ground is too low and damp for them—
							My English Oak, one plum tree in the cellar, and four or five of the
							Apple trees from the seed of last Summer, have taken a second start of
							growth and put forth new stem shoots within the last three weeks— The
							Chesnut, Red and Washington Oaks stopped growing about the 1<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of July, and will put forth no more
							leaves this year. The horse-chesnuts formed a terminal stem-bud from
							which the perpendicular shoot will open next Spring— I plucked the three
							last nutmeg peaches— After dinner I planted along the Eastern fence a
							row of Lime seeds, woodhouse apple seeds, white currants, and
							blackberries, multiplying the plantations in the hope that some of them
							will come up, and wishing to ascertain if the seed will bear its
							kind.</p>

							Politicians and Orators of the Age, often mentioned in the other

							occasion a question for Piso to answer— Rather assuming himself the
							character of a Pyrrhonian, and charging the Peripatetics themselves with
							inconsistency in their controversy with the Stoics— These five Books
							contain an excellent Summary of the three great Grecian systems of
							Philosophy: and a controversial view of two of them the Epicurean and
							Stoic. The work would have been more perfect, if Cicero had given in the
							name of <persRef ref="catoyounger">Cato</persRef>, the argument against
							the Peripatetics— As it is we have both sides of the question concerning
							the Epicureans and Stoics—and only one for the Academy. The disciples of
								<persRef ref="epicurus">Epicurus</persRef>, of <persRef
								ref="socrates">Socrates</persRef>, and of <persRef ref="zeno"
								>Zeno</persRef>, were as enthusiastically attached to their Masters,
							as the followers of <persRef ref="luther-martin">Luther</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="calvin-john">Calvin</persRef> are in modern times— It
							is very remarkable that there was no Roman system of Philosophy. The
							Greeks appear to have exhausted the Powers of the human mind upon the
							Subject— But probably no one of the Greeks, wrote upon philosophical
							subjects with so much eloquence as Cicero, excepting Plato.</p>

							3. a row of wood-house Apple seeds— Under Eastern fence, cherry-Stones
							Pear-seeds and a few wild cherries under South fence, right hand of gate

							his opinion upon some controvertible point which Cicero then discusses
							with him; in Socratic interrogations and remarks— The Editors have
							divided the dialogue, between Cicero and an Auditor, whose respective
							parts in the discourse they have designated by the initials A. and M.
							for Auditor and Marcus. In the first Book the Auditor commences by
							saying abruptly “I think death is an evil,” which position, Marcus

								Josiah Quincy</persRef> paid us an afternoon visit— I finished

							in it is admirable— Philosophy had undoubtedly great influence upon the
							conduct of individuals in the age of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef>, and upon his own particularly— The question
							whether Death was an Evil, was perhaps an idle one— Nature has implanted
							in all animated beings a horror of Death, and has made it doubly
							terrible to man, by the agonies and convulsions which usually precede
							and attend it; as well as by that interest in the future, which Cicero
							considers as an argument in favour of the immortality of the Soul. But
							God has given to Man, both reason and Passions to check, or as <persRef
								ref="bacon-francis">Lord Bacon</persRef> says to mate the fear of
							Death— Many human beings welcome it.— Many fly to it, and probably there
							is no aged individual of the human family, but has often desired it. The
							moment of death is the cessation of suffering, and therefore not in
							itself painful— The sincere believer in Christianity longs for death,
							but dares not hasten to it: and in spite of all belief he dreads and
							shrinks from it. I have read this Dissertation, at the most favourable
							moment of my life for giving it all its weight—when I have no plausible
							motive for wishing to live, when every thing that I foresee and believe
							of futurity, makes Death desirable, and when I have the clearest
							indications that it is near at hand— I should belie my Conscience should
							I not acknowledge that the Love of Life, and the horror of dissolution,
							is as strong in me as it <pb n="522" type="ms"/>ever was at any period
							of my existence, and that I deeply feel the hollowness of the whole
							argument of Cicero— It is utterly delusive— Yet I do not believe my hold
							upon life more tenacious than that of most other human beings,
							especially of those who have great enjoyment of Life— It was a shrewd
							saying of <persRef ref="sappho">Sappho</persRef>, mentioned in a Note to
								<persRef ref="olivet-pierre">d’Olivet’s</persRef> translation, that
							Death was an evil; inasmuch as none of the Gods had ever chosen to die—
							But although the main argument of this Dissertation is fallacious, the

						<p>The adherence of my Catarrhal Cough, and the Nightly spasms, which are

							/>The time of ripening of much fruit is now coming on from day to day;
							and as a great proportion of the seeds will not bear keeping dry a
							single day, I am continually planting them, with the intention of
							stocking the half of my Nursery yet disengaged with seedling fruit-trees
							to come up next Spring or Summer. Serit arbores quae alteri seculo
							prosint; is my apology to myself for the Time, I employ upon this
							subject— I also propose it as a mode of exercise for health; though it
							has not hitherto answered that expectation— I have no substitute for
							it—and the disposition to make experiments to ascertain what seed will
							come up and what is the relation between the seed, and the plant that
							springs from it leads me to much hobby horsical trifling— Let this pass
							for my general confession, if it may not serve for my justification—
								<persRef ref="farrar-isaac">Isaac Farrar</persRef>, gathered this
							day the Woodhouse Apples to take to Boston Market— I took a peck of them
							myself, for seed; but they are not ripe, and should have remained on the
							tree till about the first of September— Gathered the Jargonelle Pears on
							the small tree—not quite ripe— The tree and fruit in decay— Picked up
							wind-fallen Sugar Pears, and planted a row of the seeds in the middle
							box— A row of sweeting Apple seeds with one nutmeg Peach stone, and one
							R. D. Horse Plum Stone, under Eastern fence— <persRef ref="davis-rufus"
								>Rufus Davis</persRef> brought yesterday some horse plums of which I
							took 3. Pints, six dozen, for seed— But they are not ripe— I finished
							reading the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Tusculan; upon bearing
							pain—and began the third; upon Affliction— The second is more for
							practical use than the first—instructive; fortifying and consolatory. It
							is particularly adapted to my circumstances, and ought to be profitable
							to me— There are several considerable extracts from Greek Poets:
								<persRef ref="sophocles">Sophocles</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="aeschylus">AEschylus</persRef> and <persRef ref="homer"
								>Homer</persRef>, translated by <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"

						<p>Planted the Limeseeds given me by <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">Daniel
								Greenleaf</persRef>, in a heap at the bottom of the Nursery. A row
							of wild Cherries in Book box 3— That fruit is now ripening— And I
							deposited Cores of the sugar pear, also now ripening, under the five
							stands, where I propose to raise Standard fruit trees— By planting in
							each a variety; and of several fruits I wish to ensure a standard of
							some fruit in each stand. If many fail there will be multiplied chances
							for one to succeed in each place— It was my Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> birth-day, and may this
							occasion be allowed me for supplicating a blessing upon his Life!— We
							continued the Catalogue after dinner.— And I walked over the Hill in
							front of the house— Gathered a handfull of Wild Cherries, and one of
							Limeseeds from the Tree on the Hancock lot— They are far fresher than
							any of those given me by Daniel Greenleaf and have living kernels within
							them; but they float in water and I think will never vegetate— The
							Evening was merely cool and my pains returned with more of menace than
							of severity— I sought for them in bed as the Clock rung nine— I this day
							finished the reading of the Bible, which I began about the first of May
							last year— This reading has not been so profitable to me as it ought to
							have been— Among the decays of Age, which I cannot dissemble to myself
							is a falling off in the discipline of the mind. The operation of the
							mind in reading should be like that of the leech upon the body: but the
							leech sometimes wanders over the veins, without taking hold of any one,
							and so it is in the dissipation of Spirits, which comes on with the
							lassitude of years— In my frequent perusals of the Bible heretofore, I
							have perhaps gathered all of the important religious and moral
							instruction that I am capable of receiving from it; and as for biblical
							criticism or controversy, the remnant of <pb n="524" type="ms"/>my days
							if devoted exclusively to these studies, would leave me a mere smatterer
							in them. The attempt therefore would be worse than useless, and I
							purposely abstain from it. In reflecting upon the Time which I still
							devote to reading, and in meeting the question, what purpose it answers,
							I find that the object of reading is different at different periods of
							life. In Youth it is for instruction; for the acquisition of knowledge
							and the practical improvement of it. In age, it is for pleasure and
							pastime. The morning hours which I now devote—one to the Bible, and two
							to <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>, bear no fruits— I fear
							they add little to my knowledge, and nothing to my capacity to do good—
							They are hours of high enjoyment—but this is not the end of life— If I
							could hope for a protracted term of possible activity it would become an
							indispensable duty to alter this arrangement— To commence the day with
							action, and to postpone speculation and reading, at least until after
							breakfast— And so if I recover health and efficient Resolution, I will
							do.</p>

						<p><date>19. IV. </date>Thursday. Boston— Meeting— Overseers of Harvard

						<p>I saw the dog star this morning—half an hour risen at a quarter past four
							O’Clock. It is therefore certain that with a clear sky, he might have
							been seen at least ten days earlier: and if the dog days have any
							meaning, they terminate in this Latitude about the ninth or tenth of

								>Charles</persRef>, and <persRef ref="buchanan-robert">Lieut<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Buchanan</persRef>— Visited <persRef
								ref="welles-john">John Welles</persRef> and <persRef

								ref="cruft-edward">Edward Cruft</persRef> with whom and his Son
								<persRef ref="cruft-william">William</persRef> I went to see an
							Anaconda, from Java, and two Boa Constrictors from Sumatra—a small
							Alligator, and a Harlequin or diamond Snake— None of these Serpents was
							venomous. And the Anaconda, and the two Boas having been fed yesterday
							each with a rabbit, they were this day very sluggish; coiled and
							intertwined with each other and lying nearly torpid in their cages the
							keeper himself could rouse them to very little action.— The Anaconda,
							the largest of the three was about 14 feet long—his body about the size
							of a Man’s thigh, about the centre swolen with the whole rabbet upon
							which he had feasted yesterday, as were the two others. Their principal
							movement was frequently thrusting out a thready and forked tongue— There
							was much resemblance between them; and their colours were disgustingly
							beautiful— They were perfectly tame and gentle, and their keeper handled
							them at his pleasure. I called upon Judge Davis and sat an hour with him
							conversing upon Railways, City Government, theological controversy,
								<persRef ref="stuart-moses">Professor Stuart</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="channing-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Channing</persRef>— We went together to the Meeting of the Overseers
							of Harvard University, at the Council Chamber— At 1/2 past twelve
							O’Clock the <persRef ref="winthrop-thomas">Lieutenant Governor
								Winthrop</persRef> took the Chair— <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2"
								>President Quincy</persRef> proposed several new By-Laws or
							Ordinances, which had been adopted by the Corporation; tending to the
							new tension of discipline; two or three of which were adopted without
							opposition. There was one, to authorize the President, at the written
							request of Parents to license the attendance of individual Students at
							the theatre in Boston, which <persRef ref="austin-james">James T.
								Austin</persRef> opposed. He gave a horrible description of the
							licentiousness in the region of the Tremont Theatre, and protested
							against any colour of sanction to be given for attendance by any Student
							at the Theatre, under any circumstances whatever— The President said
							this Picture was entirely new to him and that he would not press the
							ordinance further— <persRef ref="pierce-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pearce</persRef> the Minister of Brookline, seconded the
							views of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Austin, and said that the only
							graduate of several years, at Cambridge for several years, had narrowly
							escaped total ruin, by seduction at the Theatre to an infamous <pb
								n="525" type="ms"/>marriage— The subject was postponed and referred
							to a Committee of 3. Judge Davis, J. T. Austin and <persRef
								ref="savage-james">Savage</persRef>, to report— Several honorary
							degrees were proposed; one of a medical doctorate to a person resident
							at Quebec; which was opposed by <persRef ref="spooner-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Spooner</persRef>. There was a rule
							that there should be thirty days interval between the proposition to the
							Overseers of these honorary degrees and their confirmation— There was a
							question made whether this rule should be suspended which passed in the
							negative. The Meeting was adjourned before two O’Clock to commencement
							Morning— About twenty Members in attendance, a majority of whom were
							Boston Clergymen. I returned to Charles’s office; where Lieutenant
							Buchanan soon joined us having paid his visit to fort Independence, and
							we returned to Quincy to dine— Unfortunately unhorsed a man at the Cross
							street at the bottom of the Mall, by running the Pole of the carriage
							upon him— He was hurt, but able to remount his horse, though already too
							much steeped in Spirit— Visited the garden after dinner. Planted
							Plum-stones, Pear Cores, and the Lime Seeds I had gathered the Evening
							before last— Began reading the Bible again, and finished the third
							Tusculan, upon Affliction— I read the first chapter of Genesis, in the
							Greek Septuagint; but the type is too small for my eye sight.</p>

						<p>Sirius was about fifteen minutes above the horizon when I rose at four
							this morning, and I saw him still at 4:40 about half an hour before the

							Sept</unclear>uagint Bible, I have reverted to the English, three chapters a day,
							with two or three pages of the illustrations added to the English
							Translation of <persRef ref="calmet-augustin">Calmet</persRef>, which
							are altogether different from the Dissertations of Calmet himself. Began
							the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Tusculan, upon the Passions—of
							which I read 13 Sections, and afterwards the translation of the same by
								<persRef ref="olivet-pierre">D’Olivet</persRef>— The translation of
							the third is by <persRef ref="bouhier-jean">Bouhier</persRef>, who like
							almost all French Translators takes inexcusable Liberties with his
							original—omitting large passages, and particularly the whole of the
							fourth and fifth Sections— They contain a curious philological
							disquisition upon the terms used in the Greek and Latin Languages to
							designate the Passions— He seems perplexed with the Greek word πάθη
							which he says in Latin signifies <hi rend="italic">morbus</hi>—but he
							prefers to translate it <hi rend="italic">perturbationes</hi>. He does
							not use the word Passio nor was it then a word known to the Latin
							Language. The earliest authority in <persRef ref="gesner-conrad"
								>Gesner’s</persRef> Thesaurus for the term Passio, for Passions, is
								<persRef ref="firmicusmaternus">Firmicus</persRef>, a Christian
							writer of the fourth Century— The observation of the Passions
							presupposes a distinction between body and Soul; and the Classification
							of the Passions was naturally incidental, to the theory that the Seat of
							the Passions is not in the body— These Speculations are all Greek, and
							almost all from Socrates— The word aegritudo, seems to import nothing
							but sickness, and that perhaps is the reason why in this Tusculan Cicero
							states the Greek term πάθη to be also equivalent to sickness— But the
							subject discussed is affliction, and the doctrine taught is that the
							wise man, must not be accessible to it, or rather that he must encounter
							and subdue it. There are many admirable observations upon it, and if
							read and meditated upon in youth this philosophy must contribute to form

						<p><persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="buchanan-robert">Lieutenant Buchanan</persRef> went to Nahant
							and returned about nine this Evening— I attempted to change the order of
							my daily occupations, and after the reading of the Bible to write in
							this diary but did not finish the record of yesterday before breakfast.
							I planted 12 whole R. D. horse Plums, in a Row under the Eastern fence
							placing a small Index Stake at one end and a marked Stone which I
							covered with the Earth at the other; dropping cores of Pears with the
							seeds in them in the intervals between the Plums— In the Garden I put a
							whole plum not R. D. under five of the stands. <persRef
								ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef>
							came and introduced to me a young man named <persRef ref="u"
								>Lovering</persRef> of Medway, who is about finishing the study of
							the Law, and has the intention of going to settle at Cincinnati, in the
							State of Ohio. He seemed to be concerned at the accounts of the recent
							Elections in Kentucky which have terminated unfavourably to <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>— To
							close the afternoon I rambled over the hill opposite my house, for
							exercise—taking note of plants and trees as I went— The wild Cherries
							are riper on the young than on old Trees— I mark them as successively
							ripe, from 15. August to 15 September— I gathered a handful of them for
							seed and for steeping in New-England Rum. The trees bear plentifully
							this year. So do the Walnuts, both Pignut and Shellbark; of which there
							are upwards of thirty trees on these Hills—all but three or four from
							Pignuts. The dewberry, or Low Blackberry, and high Blackberry vines
							cover much of the ground; but bear little fruit, and are totally
							neglected. The wild Cherry; the Shellbark and Pignut Hickories and the
							Blackberries are indigenous Plants of this Country, and it is remarkable
							that they are never cultivated— Yet the trees are among the most useful
							plants that earth produces; the fruit and the wood of both being very
							valuable— The principal objection to the Cherry tree is that it harbours
							Caterpillars; an evil to be remedied by attention and Industry. The
							Caterpillars annoy the Hickory also and I strip’d off a Nest of them
							from one of my trees— I found only one Oak—a very fine, large Black Oak,
							but upon which there was not an Acorn to be seen— I met several other
							trees and shrubs which I did not know, and one or two grape-vines— The
							fertility of Nature in all her reigns, baffles human curiosity, and I
							never can take a walk for observation or musing, but I meet multitudes
							of Plants, Insects and birds, the names, properties, and uses of which
							equally convict me of my ignorance— Ignorance invincible, for the books
							upon natural history give no account of the greater part of these
							productions, and the farmers who spend their lives among them know less
							of them than I do— I read 13. Sections of the fourth Tusculan, Original
							and <persRef ref="olivet-pierre">D’Olivet’s</persRef> French

							were not yet fulfilled— The text of his afternoon Sermon was from Acts
							17.30. “And the times of this ignorance God winked at, but now

							all the other passages of the New Testament, in which Jesus Christ is
							expressly denominated a man— There are other passages as unequivocal in
							which he is acknowledged as God— The Trinitarian doctrine of the double

						<p><date>23. IV:30. </date>Monday— Heavy Rain and thunder shower in the
							Night— <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> goes to Boston at
							8 in the Morning, and returns between 2 and 3. to dine— I planted 12
							whole wild Cherries next the Row of R. D. Plums, under the East fence,
							and a cross row of six in the middle book box— Also 2. Nutmeg Peach
							Stones between the book boxes— Gathered a small basket of Horse-Plums,
							and a like quantity of Catherine Pears—also sweeting Apples. The Sugar
							Pears fall about a bushel a day from the Tree— I plant pear Cores and
							apple seeds between the whole wild Cherries— Opened a box of Port wine
							from Washington—40 Bottles entire and 6 broken— Inspected the Cellars
							and gave directions for keeping them in order— After dinner I went with
							Charles to one of my Railway lots to see if there was any Oak or walnut
							wood there which would now be fit for cutting down, for fuel: the stock
							I had provided for last Autumn beginning to run low. We found the wood
							all too small— We went to the top of the Tower built by <persRef
								ref="perkins-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Perkins</persRef> at the ledge. It has 58 steps within. The Stone
							cutters are now at work in the rear of it— The atmosphere was beclouded
							and hazy which abridged the beautiful Prospect from the Tower— I took
								<persRef ref="farrar-salmon">Salmon Farrar</persRef> with me, and
							brought home 2 Clusters of ripe Pokeberries, and several twigs of native
							Bass-wood, covered with seeds now ripening, which I suppose more likely
							to vegetate than those of the exotic Lime-tree— They have fresh and
							apparently sound kernels in them, but they still float in water, which
							renders their germinating faculty doubtful— I read fourteen Sections of
							the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Tusculan and <persRef
								ref="bouhier-jean">Bouhier’s</persRef> Translation. <pb n="528"
								type="ms"/>The purpose of the fourth Tusculan is to prove that the
							wise man is not affected by any of the Passions— The subject follows in
							regular order, after the consideration of Death, Pain, and
							affliction—and the whole is connected with the Books de Finibus— In the
							study of Self-knowledge, the first enquiry naturally was for the supreme
							good; and next to that how to guard against the ills of Life— The
							Epicureans and Stoics rushed into the two extremes—one centering all
							human happiness in sensual enjoyment. The other excluding the body
							altogether— But it was an admirable conclusion to arrive at that the
							Supreme good consisted in virtue; and it will remain for ever true, that
							the highest happiness consists in the practice of virtue— Bodily pain,
							and perturbation of mind are however evils— The classification of the
							Passions in this Treatise, is somewhat imperfect— The term aegritudo is
							not exactly rendered by affliction—from its derivation it imports
							sickness, and in the third Tusculan is used for the sickness of the
							heart caused by affliction in general. In the fourth it is classed with
							Fear among the painful perturbations; while Cupidity or Lust, and
							excessive Joy are considered as the perturbations of Pleasure. There are
							passages where he seems disposed to confine the perturbations to four as
							counterparts to the Cardinal Virtues; but at other places he includes
							envy, malice, Anger, Pity, and Love among the Passions— There is much of
							the Orator in his discourse upon Love— His general argument is that
							opinion is the foundation of all the Passions. That they are therefore
							voluntary, and ought to be always under the controul of that Will— That
							the controuler of them is Virtue, and that the wise mans happiness
							consists in having them under complete controul—</p>

								>Cicero’s</persRef> Oration for <persRef ref="archias-aulus"
								>Archias</persRef> and in one against <persRef ref="catiline"

							There was some ignorant and malicious chicanery made about the

							been construed according to its intention—to forbid the continuance of

							if the People in America spoke English as he did; and whether they wrote

								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							expecting that the new Elections in Kentucky would give an overwhelming

							re-election of General Jackson— The result of the Elections has been a
							great disappointment— The latest accounts however being more favourable
							than those which preceded— He said it was probable the Anti-masonic

							having been received from <persRef ref="clark-james">M<hi

							which I had inclined to accept but the storm of yesterday continued and
							increased to a Tempest, with floods of rain; which confined us all to
							the house, and almost overflowed with it with leakage— Before the rain
							came on I visited my garden and Nursery— Planted 1. Willow and 1. Water

							middle wood-box; and a row of Water Oak Acorns, mixed with Plum-Stones,

							and Catherine Pears, falling ripe— Spent the afternoon in making the
							Catalogue of my German Books; which we did not finish— Read 12 Sections
							of the Lucullus, or Academics of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef>— An incomplete work of which the Letters to
								<persRef ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef> 16. and 19 of the

							an exposition of the Academic system of Philosophy founded by <persRef

							Treatise in two books, one entitled <persRef ref="catulus"
								>Catulus</persRef> and the other <persRef ref="lucullus2"
								>Lucullus</persRef>. This second Book is the one yet extant, and
							which I am reading— On reflection he changed the names of the

								>Hortensius</persRef> and Catulus, who were little versed in these
							Speculations to <persRef ref="catoyounger">Cato</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="brutus-marcus">Brutus</persRef>. But receiving a Letter from
							Atticus advising him to address some Treatise of his to <persRef
								ref="varro-marcus">Varro</persRef>, he immediately took the hint,
							wrote the work over again in four Books, and made Varro and Atticus the
							interlocutors, with himself. Of this second work, only a part of the
							first book has escaped the ravages of time so that what we have is the
							second Book of the first Edition, and a part of the first Book of the
							second. In both Cicero speaks as the defender of the Academic
							philosophy— The objection urged against which was, the principle of the
							uncertainty of human knowledge.</p>

								<persRef key="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef> yet lived here, a
							Cock and three hens— But they had diseases incident to dunghill fowls,
							perhaps contracted on the voyage from France; and a merciless War was
							waged upon the Cock, by the Cocks of other breeds then upon the farm—
							When I came here last Summer, the Cock and three hens, two black and one
							speckled were here; but there was no one here able to pay the attention
							necessary to propagate the breed— One of the Black Hens brooded upon a
							Nest of 12 eggs, not her own, but of the common breed— These she hatched
							and brought up; and when I left here last December nine of them were
							fowls nearly full grown and in perfect health— The speckled Hen, brooded
							for a time upon a Nest of seventeen eggs of the right kind, made for her
							by <persRef ref="thomas-john3">John Thomas</persRef>; but she was a bad
							Hen, and ate up her own eggs— The old cock was nearly or quite blind
							from his battles— When I returned here last June, the Cock and one of
							the black Hens were gone— <persRef ref="farrar-isaac">Isaac
								Farrar</persRef> told me they disappeared last Winter, one Night
							with several of his own fowls— He knew not what had become of them—
							There remained only one of the black Hens and the Speckle, which was
							diseased— <persRef ref="pitts-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Pitts</persRef> and <persRef ref="kirk-elizabeth">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Kirke</persRef> understand the
							management of fowls, and the same black hen which raised last year a
							spurious brood, was brought to set this year on a nest of 19 eggs of
							which she hatched on the last of July, only five, one of these died, and
							she has now four chickens, four weeks old, three of which are black, as
							herself and one dark brown— They are of the true breed, and the tuft is
							just beginning to shew itself on the top of the head— They are the
							finest breed of the dunghill fowls for the table and for the eggs—both
							being nearly double the size of the common fowls of this Country—
							General Dearborn has been still less successful with his fowls than we
							with ours, and as I enquired of him several times how they were, the
							last time he was here he said he would send me his cock and hen, that
							they might be all together, and thus a better chance of preserving the
							breed— The Cock is younger than the one I had before; and better
							conditioned; but the hen is a speckle, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Pitts found on examination that both of them had the pip—
							They were no sooner set down in the Clothes-line yard than the Cock was
							furiously attacked by a young Cock of my last years brood, who has had
							the rule, the present Season, till now, and in the course of three hours
							they had three pitched battles: the yearling Cock, though much smaller,
							being of a more martial breed than the Norman—till at last the speckled
							hen interfered, and the young cock retired— <persRef

							were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to
							hear some new thing.” The first of these Sermons was upon the dangerous
							and pernicious character of consciencious error, and the second was upon
							the evil consequences of indulging the love of novelty and the
							disposition to excitement—both ingenious and well written— In the first
							there was a rapid sketch of the Character of <persRef ref="paul">S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>, and in the second of
							the Athenian People, indicating an inquisitive and meditative mind— The
							texts were well selected to illustrate moral principles of no trivial

							His style is polished and ornamental— He was listened to with universal
							attention. He dined with us— He is a Son of the <persRef
								ref="hedge-levi">Professor of moral philosophy</persRef> and was a
							Classmate of my Son Charles. I bathed with Charles at 5 this afternoon,
							but the tide was still so low that we were obliged to go in at the beach
							instead of the wharf— I had after it a troublesome pain in the left

							of Apples and Pears in March—and that the grafting should in both cases
							be done about a month afterwards— I finished reading the <persRef
								ref="lucullus2">Lucullus</persRef>; being the second Book of the
							first work of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> upon the
							Academic philosophy. It is a dialogue supposed to have been held at the
							villa of <persRef ref="hortensius">Hortensius</persRef> at Bauli, with
							Lucullus and <persRef ref="catulus">Catulus</persRef>, at whose house
							there had been another the preceding day— That was the first Book of the

							a philosophical argument between <persRef ref="antiochus"
								>Antiochus</persRef> and <persRef ref="philo">Philo</persRef> two of
							the Greek Philosophers, upon the total uncertainty of human knowledge,
							which was maintained by Philo and contested by Antiochus, and which
							constituted the difference between the old and the new Academy— Lucullus
							after stating the whole reasoning of Antiochus to prove the certainty of
							human knowledge declares his assent to that opinion; and Catulus calls
							upon Cicero for his defence of the opposite doctrine, which he
							accordingly gives, and shews that it was the original doctrine of

						<p>My bath of last Evening was succeeded by pains in my left side all night,
							and increased Catarrh this Morning— Planted a Row of Willow Oak Acorns,
							staked with that name, at the bottom of the Nursery and as it is
							extremely doubtful whether any of them will ever come up, I intermixed
							with them, Water-Oak Acorns Pear Cores, Apple-seeds, Bass wood seeds,
							and steeped Currants— At different depths in the same row. I received a
							morning visit from <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Poinsett</persRef> who introduced to me <persRef
								ref="zavala-lorenzo">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sevalla</persRef>, Governor of the State of Mexico, but now in
							exile— This gentleman manifested a strong feeling for the condition of
							his Country, and an anxious desire for the establishment in it of a
							system of free and orderly Government—but he appeared to entertain
							better wishes than hopes. Poinsett said he had come away from
							South-Carolina, because it was in every respect too hot for him— The
							People of that State have been wrought up into a state of frenzy against
							the Tariff, and there is a party among them avowing the determination to
							nullify the Law by the authority of the State. For this paroxysm of
							popular rage, there is no cause, but it verifies an observation of
								<persRef ref="bacon-francis">Lord Bacon</persRef> that most popular
							tumults and dissensions arise without adequate cause. Poinsett says that
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> is at the bottom of it
							all; and is now the instigator of the most violent measures— He further
							said that he himself had consented to be a candidate for the State
							Legislature— <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to
							Boston, and returned to dine. I rode towards Evening with <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary;adams-abigail4">my daughters</persRef> to
							Braintree— Gathered Plums in the Line yard—late. Most of them decayed on
							the tree— Those gathered between the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							and 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> have ripened well in the house— I
							read the fragment of the first Book of the Academics of the second
							Edition which remains—probably not more than a fourth part of the Book—
							The 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Letter of the 9<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> Book of the familiar Epistles, or the
								14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of the 11<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> book of <persRef ref="melmoth-william">Melmoth’s</persRef>
							Translation is that with which <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef> addressed his four Books of Academics to <persRef
								ref="varro-marcus">Varro</persRef>— The interlocutors are Cicero,
							Varro and <persRef ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>—at the Cuman
							Villa of Varro, the discussion is upon the comparative merits of the old
							or <persRef ref="plato">Plato’s</persRef> Academy, and the new, founded
							by <persRef ref="arcesilaus">Arcesilas</persRef>— The account of them is
							given by Varro in the remaining fragment; but it is broken off at the
								12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section. In the books that are
							lost Cicero maintained the entire uncertainty of human knowledge. He had
							in these Treatises, set forth his own preference for the old Academy,
							and his reasons for it— The loss of them has left imperfect that
							complete and connected system of Grecian moral philosophy, composed by
							Cicero in the last years of his life, after the usurpation of <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>, had discarded him from all
							active co-operation in public affairs.</p>

							bottling of the Pipe of Madeira Wine. Two Musk Melons ripe at the bottom
							of the Nursery; gathered them— After dinner I strolled over the Hill to
							the old Trask garden spot and marked the condition of the trees— There
							are about forty Hickory Trees among which five or six Shellbarks well
							laden with fruit— One very fine and large black Oak, and one or two
							smaller ones; but none bearing Acorns— One Ash with quantities of its
							seed pods hanging upon it, not yet ripe a considerable growth of Cedars,
							and of the Juniper three or four Elms, and as many old Pear Trees— A
							part of the ground is growing over to wood. The wild Cherries on the old
							Tree <pb n="534" type="ms"/>are not yet ripe— Returning home, I spoke to
								<persRef ref="farrar-isaac">Isaac Farrar</persRef> of the Shellbark

							garden, and especially in the Nursery of trees. The fancy for planting
							alteri seculo, for the next century has become a marotte; and the

							planted seeds or Stones of fruit trees almost every day of this month;
							and the digging and planting have exercised me about 2 hours every

							nuts to continue this planting through the next Month, and part of
