						<p>As I went out this morning I found the weather had cleared of with a very
							light frost. The day was uncommonly fine. I had no expectation of
							visitors, and anticipated that I might commence the year with some
							occupation in which I could persevere through the year should my days
							and health be so far prolonged— I was first called down to <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> who told me that his public service in preparing
							the documents to be laid before the <persRef ref="william-i">king of the
								Netherlands</persRef> was now completed— That it finished yesterday,
							and that he proposed to leave the City to-morrow to return to his family
							at New-York. He brought with me a collection of the printed Statements
							made by this Government and that of Great-Britain to the king of the
							Netherlands upon the Eastern boundary controversy— He said there was one
							more statement not yet printed; but which when ready he would send to
							me. He said his residence was in Pennsylvania, but he had taken up a
							temporary abode at New-York; for the sake of <persRef
								ref="gallatin-hannay">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> who wished to be near <persRef

							Ball on the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January to invite my
							attendance, and that Gen<hi rend="superscript">l. </hi>Van Ness would
							have come with them; but was confined by illness to his bed— I desired
							them to return my thanks to the subscribers for their invitation, and
							express to them my regret that owing to the present circumstances of my
							family, I must decline attendance at any Public Company— The invitation
							itself surprised me— I suppose it a well intended proposition of General
							Macomb, as a compliment to me, and as an effort to give the Ball itself
							some colour of a celebration not entirely sycophantic— I had been
							desirous of having some conversation with <persRef ref="krudener-paul"
								>Baron Krudener</persRef>; but we were so repeatedly interrupted,
							that we had the opportunity to say very little— He told me that he had
							been specially instructed by the <persRef ref="nicholas-i"
								>Emperor</persRef> to communicate to me his Sentiments of entire
							satisfaction, and of gratitude, at the management and character of the
							Relations between the United States and Russia, during my
							Administration, and that the only wish which the Emperor could
							entertain, with regard to those Relations would be that the same Spirit
							should prevail during the administration of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">my Successor</persRef>— I desired him to make
							known to the Emperor my sensibility to the favourable estimate he had
							made of my intentions— And I added that I had felt an urgent inclination
							to tell him how much pleasure I had taken in the splendid success of the
							Emperor’s career since his accession to the Crown— At the same time I
							could not with-hold my testimonial of affectionate attachment to the
							memory of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef>. I
							said further that I was persuaded the friendly course of policy towards
							Russia pursued by the preceding Administrations would be continued by
							the present. He was not altogether satisfied of this— I told him that
							our political opinions were sometimes a little too much biased by
							English Literature and Politics; but that the general Sentiments of the
							People of this Country upon this subject were sound— He said he thought
							so, but he had perceived an earnestness of anxiety to court the favour
							of Great-Britain, which had given him much uneasiness— He had seen a
							number of speculations in Newspapers upon the military movements of the
							Emperor, full of the rankest prejudices, and malevolence of the English
							and all in the papers devoted to the present Administration— After
							enduring this patiently for some time, he had thought it best to go and
							have an explanation about it with <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren</persRef>. He was just going
							to tell me the purport of this conference, when <persRef
								ref="chase-philander">Bishop Chase</persRef> came in, soon
							afterwards followed by <persRef ref="taylor-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor</persRef> and the Baron took
							leave, saying that he would call for me again— I asked him if he had any
							published memoirs or narrative of the transactions of Russia, since the
							accession of the Emperor Nicholas; but he had on—nor even, a copy of the
							Treaty of Ackermann— Bishop Chase told me of the progress he has made
							and is making in the building of his College in Ohio, and of his hopes
							that he shall now succeed in obtaining a grant of Land from Congress to
							assist him in bringing it to completion— <persRef ref="maury-richard"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Maury</persRef> told me he

							Presbyterian Church, from Acts 8.1. “And <persRef ref="paul"
								>Saul</persRef> was consenting unto his death.” A lecture upon the
							character of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul before his conversion—
							I was not very well; much fatigued; and not duly attentive to the
							preacher. After returning home, I found myself, utterly unable to read
							or write, owing to a heaviness and lassitude, which grows upon me with
							age, and which I attempted in vain to overcome. <persRef
								ref="lee-william">William Lee</persRef> came about nine in the

							New-York, and told me he saw <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> the evening before
							last at Baltimore— He says Gallatin spoke to him slightingly of the
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> and members of the
							Administration—commented upon the President’s obstinacy and ignorance;
							and said if <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson</persRef> had
							treated him, as Jackson treats all the members of his Cabinet, he would
							immediately have resigned his Office— Lee told me also that <persRef
								ref="huygens-constantia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Huygens</persRef> had told him of her refusal at <persRef
								ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener’s</persRef> party to go to the
							Supper Room with <persRef ref="eaton-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Eaton</persRef> the Secretary of War, and of the Baron’s
							expostulation with her upon her refusal— She has now sent out Cards for
							an Evening party herself, to which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
								<persRef ref="eaton-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Eaton</persRef> are not invited— I read but little this day, and
							wrote little— But yesterday I began the sketch of a chapter for <persRef
								ref="blunt-joseph">Blunt’s</persRef> Annual Register, which now for
							two Months, must supersede almost every thing else, and which I have
							rashly undertaken. I have borrowed <persRef ref="gibbon-edward"
								>Gibbon’s</persRef> History from the Department of State and the
							English Annual Register for 1827. I have barely commenced reading
							Gibbon’s 50<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter and already slacken
							in the reading of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef>
							Orator— I met this morning one of the most striking and beautiful
							passages in that Treatise—where in a single paragraph of the 26<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section he gives the rules and
							restrictions under which the Orator should use the weapon of ridicule.
							In this as well as in the dialogues de Oratore and that de Claris
							Oratoribus he often repeats the precept of enlivening eloquence with
							pleasantry.</p>

							intimated any design on the part of their Government, to claim the

							That they were very desirous of drawing a new line, but did not pretend

								>Gibbons</persRef> 50<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter which
							gives an abridged account of the life of <persRef ref="mahomet"
								>Mahomet</persRef>— I never can read this author without
							indignation— Yet his irony, his bitter indifference , and his art of
							insinuation may be studied to advantage— His keenest sarcasms upon
							Christianity and the Bible, are in distant allusions— His philosophy is
							shallow, and always infested with anti-religious acrimony— I read a few
							more Sections of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> Orator,
							regretting that my attention is forcibly withdrawn from the subject—</p>

								Thompson’s</persRef> with an order from the <persRef
								ref="blunt-joseph">Blunt’s</persRef> for some books; but told him I
							wished only to consult and return them. He had not the last years Annual
							Register, either English or American— I paid a visit to <persRef
								ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef> and spent an hour with
							him, in conversation upon Russia and Turkey. He had over his
							mantle-piece a Portrait of the <persRef ref="nicholas-i">Emperor
								Nicholas</persRef>, which he said was an excellent likeness, and in
							which he has apparently eleven or twelve years more upon his head than
							when I last saw him in England— I told him that I expected and hoped
							great things from him for the benefit of mankind. I hoped he would expel
							the Turks from Russia, and at least make great advances towards the
							extinction of the Mahometan imposture— I regretted that he had now
							stopped short of Constantinople; but as the Emperor had yet the prospect
							of a long reign before him it would be impossible for him to remain long
							at Peace with the Turks— The power of Russia was great, and was in his
							hands— I hoped and believed it was given him by Providence for good
							purposes and there was none in my belief more wise and good, than that
							of the total expulsion of the Turks from Europe; and at least securing
							protection and the freedom of religious worship to Christians in every
							part of the Mahometan Dominions— He did not appear to think this an
							extravagant idea; but he feared the jealousies and animosities of the
							other European Powers; especially of Great-Britain. He spoke of the
							Emperor with great affection— Said he was entirely devoted to his
							duties— That he had led a laborious life—had no mistress; no extravagant
							or expensive taste—delighted to pass his leisure time in the bosom of
							his family; wasted none of it in hunting, and instead of seizing the
							opportunity of acquiring personal military glory <pb n="338" type="ms"
							/>in the recent campaign, he had deliberately remained at home and
							suffered <persRef ref="diebitsch-ivan">General Diebitsch</persRef> to
							gather all its laurels— The Baron gave me a summary of the Events of the
							Reign from the Embassy of the <persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of
								Wellington</persRef> to compliment him and settle the Affairs of
							Greece, to the Treaty of Ackermann to the Protocol of a 4. April 1826.
							then to the Treaty of London of 6. July 1827—the Battle of Navarino and
							the Turkish Manifesto against Russia, whence down to the present moment
							he said the policy of Great-Britain had produced the effect which they
							had specifically intended to prevent. He promised me a file of the
							French Journal of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg for the
							last year— This conversation gave me something like a clue to the Events
							of which I am to pursue the thread. While we were at dinner <persRef
								ref="gerry-elbridge2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gerry</persRef>
							came in, and in great agitation told us that the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> had yesterday sent to the
							Senate a nomination of <persRef ref="mcneil-john">General
								M’Neill</persRef> as Surveyor of the Port of Boston in his place—
							And that when he went to him this day, and reminded him of his promise,
							he flew into a passion, denied that he made him any promise, and ordered
							him out of his house, for his impertinence in circulating a report that
							he had. <persRef ref="hayne-robert">General Hayne</persRef> the Senator
							from South-Carolina was present and advised Gerry to take this answer as
							conclusive. Gerry went to <persRef ref="ingham-samuel">Ingham</persRef>
							who at first refused to see him, and when he did receive him sullenly
							refused to give him any reason, but that Offices were not hereditary.
							Gerry supported from the emoluments of his Office <persRef

								Danforth</persRef> the Minister of the new Presbyterian Church came
							this morning and proposed to me to receive a Class of the infant School,
							at eleven O’Clock— He said they had been last Summer to the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President’s</persRef> and the Trustees wished
							the children might have an opportunity of paying their respects to me
							and exhibiting their Instruction before me. They came at 11. O’Clock
							about 25 children; boys and girls from three to seven years of age; with
							two female teachers one of whom was <persRef ref="u">Miss
								James</persRef>, and with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Danforth
							and <persRef ref="u">his brother</persRef>— They sung two or three
							hymns—repeated the multiplication table, and answered a variety of
							questions upon objects somewhat Scientific. They named in retrograde
							succession all the President’s of the United States, and geographically
							the names of all the States in the Union—and delivered several very
							orthodox religious opinions— This knowledge had all been learnt by rote,
							and doubtless may prove hereafter useful to the children— One of the
							Arts upon which they have been taught to answer questions is
							Architecture— They had a painted view of the Capitol and upon being
							asked of what order the pillars were, answered the Corinthian— They
							answered also to questions upon the separate parts of the Columns and
							told which was the capital, which was the shaft, and which the
							Architrave— But they are not taught practically either of the four rules
							of Arithmetic nor to write. <pb n="339" type="ms"/>The School has been
							in operation about 18 Months: it is intended to be gratuitous, though
							some parents send their children there and pay for their Instruction.
							The school is now kept in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Danforth’s
							church— They wish to raise by subscription and contribution a sum
							sufficient to build a school house, and have raised in part such a fund—
							After they had gone through their exercises I desired that each one of
							the children should come up, and shake hands with me, and tell me his or
							her name, which they did; and they then withdrew— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> was present at the examination— The principal
							advantage of such a School as this appears to be to keep the children
							out of mischief—but for the neglect to teach them writing and
							arithmetic, I know not how to account— The system however, embraces a
							second School of the same children from seven to fourteen years of age.
								<persRef ref="thompson-smith">Judge Thompson</persRef> of the
							Supreme Court paid me a Morning visit— <persRef ref="baldwin-henry"
								>Henry Baldwin</persRef> of Pennsylvania was yesterday nominated as
							Judge of that Court in the place of <persRef ref="washington-bushrod"
								>Bushrod Washington</persRef> deceased, and although his legal
							qualifications are not eminent and his private character is not bright,
							there was reason to apprehend an appointment so much worse that this may
							be hailed as an auspicious event— The nomination was this day confirmed
							by the Senate. There was a flight of Snow this afternoon, but it cleared
							off towards Evening. <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">T. B.
								Johnson</persRef> dined and supped with us— I finished reading this

						<p>Returning from my morning walk, I stop’d at <persRef

								<persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Everett</persRef>— He had not risen, but was called up. I told him
							that <persRef ref="thompson-pishey">P. Thompson</persRef> informed me
							that he had the English Annual Register for 1828. That I had not been
							able to procure it else where, and asked if he could lend it to me. He
							said it was in the Library of Congress, and he would procure it for me—
							I asked him also to furnish me from time to time with a copy of the
							documents printed by order of Congress, as they may be published which
							he promised to send me: he mentioned that he had a Letter yesterday from
								<persRef ref="everett-charlotte">his wife</persRef>—who spoke of
								<persRef ref="brooks-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Brooks</persRef> as being so ill that she might probably not survive
							till the Spring— He said his brother <persRef ref="everett-alexander"
								>Alexander</persRef> wrote him that he should come on here this
							winter— <persRef ref="fendall-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fendall</persRef> paid me a morning visit, and spoke of the
							contested election, between <persRef ref="arnold-thomas"
								>Arnold</persRef> and <persRef ref="lea-pryor">Lea</persRef>, now in
							discussion before the House of Representatives— Arnold has been an
							intrepid adversary to <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef> in Tennessee, and lost the Election in his
							district only by a majority of 217 votes— He comes to contest the
							election against a majority in the House inaccessible to any thing but
							party discipline— Fendall says he made a powerful speech yesterday but
							it was to deaf ears— Fendall mentioned to me the author of the Letters
							in the Newspapers signed <persRef ref="kremer-george">Kremer</persRef>
							and addressed to <persRef ref="randolph-john">John Randolph</persRef>—
							The last gives a burlesque account of <persRef ref="krudener-paul">Baron
								Krudener’s</persRef> late Ball, with cutting severity upon <persRef
								ref="eaton-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Eaton</persRef>— <persRef ref="eaton-john">Eaton’s</persRef> card,
							published on Monday takes no notice of this Letter, but refers to
							another published in sundry Opposition papers, and implicating Eaton in
							the supposed defalcation of <persRef ref="timberlake-john">Purser
								Timberlake</persRef>. The Card says that if a responsible name shall
							appear to support the charge, measures will forthwith be taken to unfold
							the conspiracies in which it originated, and to prove the author a base
							calumniator. Fendall says that another Letter to Kremer will appear— I
							told him I thought the <pb n="340" type="ms"/>writer would do well to
							prepare for other controversy than that of newspapers. The charge
							against Eaton is blasting to his character— The imputations upon his
							wife are deeply defamatory. The case is of a nature to drive him to
							desperation: and Assassination or a deadly duel is the natural
							termination of such a course of incidents as are now in progress—
							Neither M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> nor M<hi rend="superscript"

							without paying— Their creditors took the alarm, seized the Stock of

							He had in vain attempted to obtain employment, at a printing-Office at

							was to make his way as he could to his friends, and to persevere in his

							desirous of knowing whether they had been deposited in the Department of

							cover the ground— I have now books and papers, more than I know how to
							use to best advantage, for composing the chapter of the American Annual

						<p><date>10. III.45. </date>Sunday— Rain.</p>
						<p>My rising hour is irregular, and on waking, I am entirely uncertain of
							the hour. This morning it was short of four; but when once risen it is
							useless to return to bed I am unable to sleep— So after reading four
							chapters of the Proverbs I wrote an hour upon Turks and Russians, and
							then took my walk round the Capitol Hill. The Snow of yesterday was
							gone, and rain was only threatened. <persRef

								<persRef ref="barrell-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barrell</persRef> came home with me to give me the benefit of his
							Umbrella I read a Sermon recently published by <persRef
								ref="brooks-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> C.
								Brooks</persRef> of which he sent me a copy, and the remainder of
							the day was engaged in writing to my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef>—allowing only half an hour to a few pages of
								<persRef ref="upham-edward">Upham’s</persRef> Ottoman History, and
							another to <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> dialogue with
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus2">his Son</persRef> upon the Oratorical
							Partitions. There is a difference between the Style of this Dialogue and
							the others in which Cicero put forth his rhetorical and philosophical
							and moral Treatises. To this there is no introductory proem— It begins
							abruptly by an observation from the Son, that he wishes his father to
							teach him in Latin the lessons upon public speaking, which he had been
							accustomed to give him in Greek; to which the father readily assents—
							The whole dialogue is then in questions put by the Son, and answered by
							the father— There is no discussion; no conflict of opinions as in the
							Dialogues de Oratore; and the Claris Oratoribus— The dialogue is
							therefore much less lively and entertaining— It is rather the anatomy of
							an Oration something like what a dissection of the human body would be
							to a student of Anatomy. The topics to <persRef ref="trebatius-gaius"
								>Trebatius</persRef> are much of the same character except that they
							are professedly an exposition of a Treatise of <persRef ref="aristotle"
								>Aristotle</persRef>— The several Treatises of Cicero make up
							together a complete system of Rhetoric; and each of them appears to be
							adapted to the other— The Dialogues de Oratore, discuss two different
							Systems of public speaking. That de Claris Oratoribus enumerates swarms
							of persons who had passed for Orators at the Time— The Orator is a
							finished portrait of what a public speaker should be— The three
							Treatises together make a complete system of Which the Topics of the
							Partitions are ornamental appendages.</p>

								>M’lean</persRef> with <persRef ref="peters-richard2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Peters</persRef> the Reporter paid me

								>new Judge Henry Baldwin</persRef> has not arrived— The rest are all

								<persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>, but made very little
							progress in my Russian and Turkish War— The partitions and the Topics
							deserve to be profoundly studied— The partitions for a general model
							applicable to the distribution of the parts of any oratorical discourse,
							or indeed of any literary composition. The other for an index to the
							sources of arguments— The partitions shew the lines of discrimination
							between the deliberative, judicial, and demonstrative kinds of oratory;
							and point out the objects common to the Speaker in all of them— To
							inform, to entertain, to move. The judicial cause, the deliberative
							proposition, the demonstrative eulogy or invective, and the conduct of
							the discourse respectively appropriate to each kind— These Treatises of
							Cicero are like the membra disjecta Poetae— It would be an excellent
							exercise for a young man, to compile from them an entire system of
							Rhetoric— I wrote a Note to <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi

						<p>Another cold and clear morning— The Sun rose clear, but partly behind the
							house so that I could not mark the second of his first appearance.
								<persRef ref="fendall-philip">Fendall</persRef> paid me a long
							morning visit, and spoke of his own views and prospects. He is not yet
							certain whether he will go to Kentucky or remain here. There was an
							Evening party at <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> T. B. Johnson’s</persRef> which
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> being confined to her chamber could not
							attend. I went; and <persRef key="adams-john2">my Son</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">his wife</persRef> were there— The
								<persRef ref="ellery-sarah">widow</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="ellery-abraham">Abraham Ellery</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="ellery-unknown2;ellery-unknown3">her two unmarried
								daughters</persRef> were of the company and about thirty others.
							With <persRef ref="johnston-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Johnston</persRef> a Senator from Louisiana, I had a conversation
							upon politics, which resolve themselves still into intrigues for the
							next Presidential Election— Johnston thinks there are three divisions of
							the administration party one of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef> and his friends, who wish for his re-election—one
							for <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren</persRef>, and one for <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
								>Calhoun</persRef>— That Van Buren sees he cannot eight years long
							discharge the duties of the Department of State— That he must succeed at
							the end of the four years or not at all, and that he and his friends
							insist that Jackson has given a pledge that he would not serve longer
							than one term. That Calhoun is equally impatient, and much disposed
							though afraid to declare himself against the leading measures of the
							present administration. But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnston
							supposes that if <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay’s</persRef> friends were to bring him forward as a
							Candidate it would close all the cracks of the Administration party, and
							rivet them together again— I closed the Evening by a Conversation with
								<persRef ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef>, in which with
							a view to acquiring information concerning the Turkish and Russian War,
							I asked him many questions, and gathered some further particulars of
							knowledge of the subject. I enquired of the present state of Greece,
							which is yet precarious and unsettled— He spoke in terms of high esteem
							of <persRef ref="kapodistrias-john">Capo d’Istrias</persRef>— I told him
							I regretted much the basis assured by the three mediatorial powers
							holding Greece to the Servitude of paying tribute to the Turks— I
							thought it unjust in principle, and if it was, ever justifiable all
							claim to it had been forfeited by the obstinate refusal of the <persRef
								ref="mahmudii">Sultan</persRef> to admit the intervention of the
							three powers and by the exterminating War that he had continued to carry
							on against Greece, till the battle of Navarino. <pb n="344" type="ms"/>I
							said I was convinced that Russia would be compelled to recommence the
							War, and that so it would be until the Turks should be expelled from
							Europe— I supposed it highly probable that the Peace would be followed
							by internal convulsions in the Turkish Government, in which Russia would
							find it impossible to avoid interposing—in which opinions he concurred—
							But he complained of the jealous policy of the European allies against
							Russia—of Austria, France, Great Britain— But said Prussia would become
							the great preponderating power in the North of Germany— He said also
							that if <persRef ref="canning-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning</persRef> had not died as he did, there would probably have
							been a War between Russia and England— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Canning he said was a far more impetuous politician than the <persRef
								ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of Wellington</persRef>. I mentioned to
							the Baron the profound religious impressions of the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef> during the latter
							years of his life, and asked him when and how they had originated— He
							said it was from his interviews with the <persRef ref="louiseauguste"
								>Queen of Prussia</persRef>, before the Peace of Tilsit, at the time
							when the City of Memel was all that was left of the Prussian Monarchy—
							That his, <persRef ref="krudener-barbe">Krudener’s mother</persRef> was
							then at Memel and frequently saw the Queen of Prussia, but not then the
							Emperor— That the Religious enthusiasm of the Emperor had afterwards
							been much enflamed by the work of a German named <persRef
								ref="jungstilling-johann">Stilling</persRef>; and that before the
							death of Alexander his mind had been affected to a degree that advantage
							was taken of it by fanatics or imposters who went to him with pretended
							messages from God or from Jesus Christ, to which without crediting them
							altogether he did not with sufficient decision reject— M<hi

							that I would keep in my possession the deeds which he had left here;

							be copied by which he could pay the interest of his debt to me— I
							enquired what he <pb n="345" type="ms"/>received for extra-copying from
							the Department of State— He said they were allowed at the rate of ten
							Cents for every hundred words— That while I was Secretary of State the
							allowance was twelve and a half cents, but it had been reduced by
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Temple</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="clarke-satterlee">Major Clark</persRef> paid me
							morning visits— Clark told me he was lately from Green Bay, where I had
							sent him— <persRef ref="read-george">Captain Read</persRef> is here, as
							a Member of a naval Commission for the examination of Midshipmen— I
							called upon <persRef ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef>, and
							had a long conversation with him upon Russian Affairs— He had mentioned
							to me the Protocol of a Conference between the three Ministers of the
							Powers mediating in the Affairs of Greece, of the 22<hi
								rend="superscript">d. </hi>of March last, which he told me had been
							accepted by the Porter. He had promised to shew it to me— I now asked
							him if he had any papers exhibiting the progress and conclusion of the
							War between Russia and Persia, which followed immediately after the
							accession of the <persRef ref="nicholas-i">Emperor Nicholas</persRef> to
							the throne, and particularly the Treaty of Peace on the conclusion of
							the War.— He said to me that the foundations of the friendly relations
							which subsisted so cordially between Russia, and the United States had
							been laid by my Mission to the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor
								Alexander</persRef>— That the Policy and the feelings of the present
							Emperor were entirely the same as those of his brother had been— That he
							had taken great satisfaction in the happy state of those relations, and
							that he regretted the disposition of the Government of the United States
							was not now so friendly towards Russia as it had been— He complained of
							a paragraph in the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President’s</persRef>
							Message— Of Articles in the New York Enquirer. <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren’s</persRef> particular paper; and of many other incidents
							which he considers as manifestations of temper. He thinks the present
							Administration excessively anxious to conciliate the favour of
							Great-Britain; and is apprehensive that in order to acquire a
							predominating influence here; to put down our manufacturing interest,
							and to inflame the violent sectional passions of the Country, they will
							make great sacrifices; restore to us the intercourse with their
							West-India Colonies, and will even yield to us the Navigation of the
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Lawrence. I told him that I had no
							doubt the British Government would do all they could, but that they
							would find it very difficult to manage their own people— As to the
							West-India trade, I expected they would soon be forced to give up that,
							as the operation of the interdict must necessarily be ruinous to their
							Islands as it always had been; but I expected that in yielding it they
							would obtain equivalents which <pb n="346" type="ms"/>neither the People
							of this Country, nor the necessary majority of two thirds of the Senate
							would approve. The Baron told me that he had asked leave of absence on
							account of his health; which he expected soon to receive, and to go away
							in the course of two or three Months— He had intended to seek employment
							elsewhere though he was sincerely attached to this country—having been
							received and treated here with great and universal kindness— But the
							relations between the two Countries were growing less cordial and more
							delicate— He was conscious that he had not the Talents necessary for the
							management of them. I told him I should regret very much his departure
							from this Country if it should be not to return; though it would afford
							me great pleasure to learn his advancement. But if he should not return
							I hoped the Emperor would send here a person like himself, or like his
							immediate Predecessor <persRef ref="tuyll-diederick">Baron
								Tuyl</persRef>— I could not say precisely the same of <hi
								rend="italic">his</hi> Predecessor <persRef ref="poletica-pierre"
								>Poletica</persRef>, of whom I wished to express no unkind
							Sentiment; but who I believed might be more usefully employed any where
							else than here— He spoke well of Poletica; but admitted that he had
							prejudices in relation to this Country.— The Baron sent me this Evening
							the Treaty of Peace with Persia, the Protocole of 22. March 1829. and
							several other Diplomatic Papers— I answered a Letter from <persRef
								ref="blunt-joseph">Jos. Blunt</persRef>, and wrote to the Postmaster
							General <persRef ref="barry-william">W. T. Barry</persRef> in answer to
							a Letter from the Postmaster <persRef ref="jones-william4">W.

								Hodgson</persRef> called upon me this morning; a young man whom in
							the Summer of the year 1825. I sent to Algiers, and attached to the
							Consulate of the United States there to learn the oriental languages— He
							had an extraordinary facility at learning languages and had already made
							some progress in the Hebrew Arabic and Persian; and we were in this
							Country so destitute of persons versed in the oriental languages that we
							could not even procure a translation of any paper which occasionally
							came to us in Arabic— He has been absent about four years <pb n="347"
								type="ms"/>and has acquired the Arabic, Turkish, the Lingua Franca,
							and the Berber, a language concerning which he has made very interesting
							discoveries— He remained as Charge d’Affaires at Algiers from the time
							when <persRef ref="shaler-william">Shaler</persRef> came away till the
							arrival of <persRef ref="lee-henry3">Henry Lee</persRef> as Consul, and
							returned here a few days since— He told me that he had seen the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren</persRef>, but did not know whether they proposed to give him
							any further employment or not— He said he had brought home some valuable
							books and manuscripts relating to the Oriental Languages which had cost
							him about 1500 dollars; which he had hoped would be taken by the
							Department of State; but he might now find it difficult to dispose of
							them— I advised him to speak of it to <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Brent</persRef>, and if he
							should think it expedient to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren,
							and also to obtain from the Treasury Department the order for the
							admission of the Books, free of duties— I went to <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Doyne’s</persRef>, and enquired for
								<persRef ref="ross-robert2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ross</persRef>, the young man to whom I had promised to sit for my
							Portrait, but he was not at home— I then went to <persRef
								ref="thompson-pishey">P. Thompson’s</persRef> Shop, and borrowed two
							Numbers of <persRef ref="wells-william">Welles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lilly-robert">Lilly’s</persRef> Edition of <persRef
								ref="maltebrun-conrad">Malte Brun’s</persRef> Geography, and
								<persRef ref="sale-george">Sale’s</persRef> Koran— At half past One
							I went to the Capitol, and heard <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett</persRef> in the Hall of The
							House of Representatives, deliver the Anniversary Address to the
							Columbian Institute. The Hall was crowded with company a large portion
							of Ladies.— I sought at first a Seat without the Bar of the House; but
								<persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Huntt</persRef> found me, and urged me, till I took a Chair on the
							floor, just below the Steps to the Speaker’s Chair— <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							the Vice-President, and <persRef ref="martin-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Martin</persRef> a member of the House
							of Representatives came up and spoke to me— There was a small meeting of
							the Institute, in their Apartment; whence they came to the Hall—
								<persRef ref="law-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Law</persRef> presided, and among the members who came up were
								<persRef ref="berrien-john">J. M. Berrien</persRef>, the Attorney
							General, and <persRef ref="ingham-samuel">Samuel D. Ingham</persRef>
							Secretary of the Treasury— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Berrien
							greeted me with a distant Salutation which I returned as distantly—
							Ingham advanced as if intending to accost me; but I barely turned my eye
							upon him and he slunk back with the look of a detected thief— There is a
							portrait of Ingham in <persRef ref="carucci-jacopo">Carucci’s</persRef>
							Picture of the Lord’s Supper— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett’s
							discourse occupied just an hour— It was Literary, Philosophical,
							Scientific and popular—an exposition of the character and usefulness of
							Societies such as the Columbian Institute— A description of many of the
							most important modern inventions and discoveries, and of the manner in
							which they have been made; with several interesting anecdotes relating
							to the discoverors and inventors— He confined his subject to the
							physical Sciences, and did not enter upon the consideration of moral or
							political discovery— That is a wide field yet open; and worthy to be
							explored— He noticed the simplicity of many great discoveries; how
							nearly every human being approaches to them, and yet the application of
							mind necessary for their disclosure and he argued the moral certainty
							that nature had yet in store numerous Secrets in reserve for the
							favourites who will devote their lives to the search of them— He
							introduced also a powerful appeal to the beneficence of Congress in
							behalf of the family of <persRef ref="fulton-robert">Fulton</persRef>—
							Two things in the discourse I regretted to hear— One a seeming admission
							that the power of giving encouragement to Literature and Sciences was
							much greater at least in the State Governments than in that of the
							Union— The other an apparent reflection upon the Supreme Court of the
							United States who he said by a decision had scattered the fortune of
							Fulton to the four winds of Heaven. Before leaving the Hall I spoke to

								Ringgold</persRef> the Marshal, who told me that he expected M<hi

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="campbell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Campbell</persRef>, this morning from Matthew 11.2 “Now when
								<persRef ref="johnthebaptist">John</persRef> had heard in the prison
							the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples. 3. And said unto him,
							Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?” And in the
							Evening from the Acts 9.3. “And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus:
							and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: 4. And he
							fell to the <hi rend="strikethrough">ground</hi> earth, and heard a
							voice saying unto him, <persRef ref="paul">Saul</persRef>, Saul why
							persecutest thou me?” both these were eloquent discourses.
							Argumentative, as is the character of all M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Campbell’s Sermons and delivered in language more elegant than is usual
							among presbyterians— In the morning he urged the meekness and humility,
							and poverty and lowliness of Jesus, as powerful evidence of the divinity
							of his religion—and adduced among the most striking instances of this
							evidence, the fact, that even John the Baptist, the precursor of the
							Messiah, the Messenger of Heaven to announce his advent, and to admonish
							the world, of repentance to reserve him, that even he, at the close of
							his own career, was so doubtful and uncertain whether Jesus was the
							Messiah, that he sent these disciples to enquire of himself as to the
							fact— He noticed also the remarkable answer of Jesus; not directly
							affirming that he was the Messiah; but directing the disciples to go and
							tell John of the miraculous works that he was performing; such as could
							only be performed by the agency of almighty power, and concluding by
							pronouncing blessed whosoever should not be offended in him— He adduced
							the delivery of the Law at Mount Sinai, and the idolatry of the golden
							calf so shortly afterwards, as proving that a magnificent and awful
							display of power, was of little avail, permanently to affect the minds
							of men to the worship of the true God; and the example of <persRef
								ref="mahomet">Mahomet</persRef> to prove that it was an efficient
							agent of corruption and imposture. The evening Sermon upon the character
							of History of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul, at and after his
							conversion. A continuation of the Lecture of the Sunday Evening before
							last— He was here upon beaten ground, and alleged nothing the substance
							of which I had not heard before— He summed up however the Pauline
							argument for Christianity, concisely and in a spirited manner; though he
							finished by entangling it with the doctrine of the atonement, more
							deeply than my belief could follow him— The Presbyterians fairly wear a
							hole through this doctrine by their perpetual friction— After the
							morning service I had for two hours a succession of visitors. First
								<persRef ref="white-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								White</persRef> of Florida, who began to tell me of his recent
							conference with the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>
							upon the removals from Office and substituted Appointments under this
							Administration—to the number of twelve— At a former interview with White
							the Hero had bristled into a Passion, and treated White so rudely that
							he had determined to hold no further intercourse with him; but now he
							sent for him to consult him with regard to the objections against his
							appointments— They are <hi rend="strikethrough">all</hi> bad, and
							extremely odious to the people of the territory. White was repeating to
							me the characters which he gave of them one after the other to the
							General, and if he had extracted the Quintessence of all the
							Penitentiaries of the Union, to represent the virtues of the Government
							in Florida, he could not have made the appointments worse.— But before
							White had got half <pb n="349" type="ms"/>through with his narrative
							other visitors came in, and he went away.— <persRef ref="smith-samuel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S. H. Smith</persRef> came and
							introduced <persRef ref="smith-jonathan">his Son</persRef>— White says
							that the plantation of Live Oaks that I caused to be formed near
							Pensacola, is in an extremely flourishing condition— That <persRef
								ref="branch-john">Branch</persRef>, the present Secretary of the
							Navy wanted to put it down with the other naval establishments; and sent
								<persRef ref="rodgers-john">Commodore Rodgers</persRef> to make a
							Report upon it: but that the report was so highly favourable to it that
							it has been suffered to live— Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							<persRef ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef>, <persRef ref="swann-thomas"
								>Swann</persRef> and <persRef ref="rogers-lloyd">Rogers</persRef>
							came together—and <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Everett</persRef> with <persRef ref="fales-stephen">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fales</persRef>— I asked M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett why he had not yesterday touched
							upon discoveries in morals and politics— He said he had, in his written
							Discourse; but that <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Huntt</persRef> had admonished him not to be too long,
							and he had omitted what would have taken him about twenty minutes more
							to deliver— I received a Note from <persRef ref="ringgold-tench">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> T. Ringgold</persRef> written last
							Evening; informing me that <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef> was at his house; and
							I immediately went to see him— He was coming in a Steam-boat directly to
							this place; but she ran aground, and damaged her machinery—so that he
							landed at Norfolk; came thence in another Steam-boat to Baltimore; and
							thence in a Stage last Evening here— His daughters <persRef
								ref="hay-eliza">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hay</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="monroe-maria">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Gouverneur</persRef> are with him: the latter with a <persRef
								ref="gouverneur-elizabeth">little girl</persRef> four or five years
							old— <persRef ref="mason-john">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Mason</persRef> and <persRef ref="jesup-thomas">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jesup</persRef> were there, and
								<persRef ref="white-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								White</persRef>, a member of the House of Representatives from
							Louisiana came in— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe has been
							dangerously ill; and although a convalescent is much emaciated— He spoke
							of the labours of the Virginia <hi rend="strikethrough">Assembly</hi>
							Convention, which has at last adjourned after agreeing 55 to 41. to a
							project of Constitution to be submitted to the People— I had barely time
							in the Leisure of this day, to answer a Letter from my Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>.</p>

						<p>The night and morning were cloudy, but it cleared away cold, in the
							course of the day— <persRef ref="duval-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Duval</persRef> the Governor of Florida; <persRef
								ref="baldwin-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baldwin</persRef>
							the new judge of the Supreme Court, <persRef ref="torlade-jacob">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Torlade</persRef> the Charge
							d’Affaires from <persRef ref="miguel-i">Don Miguel</persRef> the Soi
							disant king of Portugal, with his <persRef ref="u">Secretary of
								Legation</persRef> whom he introduced to me, and <persRef
								ref="fendall-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fendall</persRef> paid me morning visits— They absorbed the day from
							Breakfast till dinner. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Duval professed
							with anxiety friendly and respectful Sentiments for me, I suppose with
							Sincerity— He obtained partly by my influence the Government of Florida
							from <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef>— He was reappointed by my nomination, and has been
							an uniform, and by no means silent partizan of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>; chiefly because
							Jackson was the enemy of <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>— Duval is conscious of
							the meanness of his conduct to me, and thinks to delude me, as he
							perhaps deludes himself by professions of general respect, and by
							assurances that he never spoke disrespectfully of me. I received perhaps
							two years since an anonymous Letter asserting that he did speak of me
							much otherwise— He told me this day that he knew the person who wrote me
							that Letter— That it was a man whom he had checked at his own table for
							speaking of me with extreme bitterness himself. He also told me that it
							was the appointment of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay as Secretary
							of State that had lost to my Administration the support of all the
							Western States— This I do not believe; but it did not gain the support
							of the Western States. I saw that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Duval
							wished to raise an unfriendly feeling in me against M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, but I did not incline to let him
							imagine he had succeeded— I told him I had nominated M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay to the Office of Secretary of State,
							because he had been a prominent Candidate for the Presidency; for which
							he had received the vote of his own, and of other Western States; and
							because I believed him the man of the Union best fitted for the place of
							Secretary of State; and his Execution of its duties had confirmed me in
							that opinion— That before that time I had been engaged <pb n="350"
								type="ms"/>at different periods in public affairs with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and had thought that his treatment
							of me had not been friendly— I had even believed that he had encouraged
							the base attacks of <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">Jonathan
								Russell</persRef> upon me— I now believed he had not; at least to
							the extent that I had supposed— I had been so ill treated by every
							public man whom circumstances had brought into competition with me, that
							I was in the habit of making allowances for them— That <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef>, <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>, General Jackson,
							and <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt Clinton</persRef> had all
							treated me with gross injustice, and all in return for acts of kindness
							and services on my part. For I could say in the presence of heaven and
							earth that I had never done any one of them wrong— He said he was
							thoroughly convinced that I had never done any man wrong. Judge Baldwin
							paid me a short visit— This is another politician of equivocal morality;
							but I hope will make a more impartial judge— I told him that I had been
							gratified by his appointment; which was true; because I had dreaded the
							appointment of <persRef ref="gibson-john">Gibson</persRef>, the
							Chief-Justice of Pennsylvania, precisely the most unfit man for the
							Office in the Union— Baldwin made as many professions of respect for my
							character as Duval— Said there had never been any other difference
							between us but upon politics. That he never should forget a conversation
							that he had with me one day at <persRef ref="bomford-george">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Bomford’s</persRef> at the time of
							the Missouri-question; and that he had always done me Justice in
							relation to that subject, as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay could
							inform me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torlade introduced M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Freitas to me; as Secretary to Don
							Miguel’s Legation; and complained that although recognized as the
							diplomatic Representative of Portugal, he had not yet recovered the
							Archives of the Legation from <persRef ref="pereira-joaquin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Barroso Pereira</persRef>— He said
							that he wanted them chiefly for the documents in several cases of
							vessels captured by Baltimore privateers for which some of his
							predecessors had improperly advanced absurd claims upon the Government
							of the United States which could not be responsible for such Acts but he
							wanted the documents to make claim of restitution by individuals and
							before the public tribunals. We had much conversation upon other
							subjects—Sweden, Russia, and former days. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Fendall was here to tell me that he had been unable to procure for me

						</list>
						<p>The Sun rose, looking from the Eastern window, in the interval between
							two Houses: but the range of buildings is such that for several weeks or
							months his rising will be intercepted by them— After breakfast I called
							at <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Everett’s</persRef> lodgings but he was not at home— Then at
								<persRef ref="ross-robert2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ross</persRef>, the portrait Painters from New-Orleans who was also
							gone out— Then at <persRef ref="king-charles2">C. B. King’s</persRef>
							painting Room where I found him painting <persRef ref="maxwell-thomas"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maxwell</persRef>, a member of
							the House of Representatives from the State of New-York. I looked over
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King’s Gallery in which he has some
							new Pictures, and saw <persRef ref="sully-thomas">Sully’s</persRef> copy
							of the Capuchin Chapel— Had half an hour’s conversation with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> King, upon painting and the pictures in
							his collection, and upon a Resolution adopted yesterday in the House of
							Representatives, relating to the distribution of the proceeds of the
							Sales of the Public Lands among the States of the Union— I then called
							upon <persRef ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef>, and had a
							Conversation of more than two hours with him upon the Affairs of Russia
							and Greece and Turkey— I asked him if he had the Treaty Gulistan between
							Russia and Persia, of 12 Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1813. which
							he afterwards sent me in the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of
							the Supplement to <persRef ref="martens-georg">Martens’s</persRef>
							Collection of treaties p. 84. It was only published by a Proclamation of
							the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander</persRef> of 16. July
							1818. I asked <pb n="351" type="ms"/>also for the Commercial Treaty said
							by an Article of the Treaty of Tourkmantchai to be annexed to it, but he
							said he had received none— And I asked if the Protocol of the 22<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March 1829. was a public document— He
							did not know that it had been made entirely public; but mentioned that
							it had been formally stipulated in an Article of the Treaty of Peace of
							Adrianople 14. Sept<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>1829. which had given
							umbrage to Great-Britain— I told him that I should speak my Sentiments
							to him with candour, as a private citizen, and no responsibility
							whatever being attached to them— I thought it would be impossible to
							carry into execution the principles of the Protocol of 22 March 1829.
							and asked how it would be possible to impose a perpetual annual tribute
							upon a people ruined as are the Greeks to a Government of which they
							were professed to be made independent. I said too that I should have
							been more satisfied, if instead of stipulating that the Greeks should
							have been a Monarchical Government, they had been suffered to choose for
							themselves— He said that as to the Tribute he had no doubt <persRef
								ref="kapodistrias-john">Count Capo d’Istrias</persRef> would make
							the strongest Representations against it— For the rest, I knew the
							prejudices against liberal principles in all the monarchical Governments
							of Europe; but I could not imagine the extent to which they were carried
							by Austria— That for a series of years <persRef ref="metternick-klemons"
								>Prince Metternich</persRef> had teized and importuned the Emperor
							Alexander, until he had almost consented to a plan that the Swiss
							Cantons should be abolished and parcelled out among the neighbouring
							monarchies— That he honestly believed he himself being the Russian
							Minister in Switzerland at the time, had prevented this plan from being
							carried into Execution. He enlarged much also upon the policy of
							Great-Britain, and its inveterate hostility against Russia—upon the
							wavering, fluctuating policy of France, and upon the embarrassments of
							the <persRef ref="nicholas-i">Emperor Nicholas</persRef>, thwarted and
							trammeled as he was by those three Powers— He told me that he had given
							and should give to the Emperor a full and minute account of his
							conversations with me, and of the Sentiments I had expressed in them. He
							said too that he had been instructed to communicate to <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> the
							grateful sense of the Russian Government for the friendly disposition
							manifested by him to Russia during the course of my Administration— That
							he had made the communication to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							through his friend <persRef ref="letcher-robert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Letcher</persRef>; and he had recently received the
							answer of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, expressing his
							satisfaction at this testimonial of Esteem from the Emperor. When I came
							home I found Cards from the Ex-President <persRef key="monroe-james"

							and <persRef ref="white-joseph">Joseph M. White</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. B.
								Johnson</persRef> dined with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>us</persRef>, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph M. White,
							spent two hours of the Evening with me. He took back the copy of the
							Letter to <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Van Buren</persRef>, which he had sent me on Sunday Evening, and
							informed me of the interviews he had had with the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> and with Van Buren upon the
							removals and appointments to Office in Florida— White first called upon
							the President, and enquired for the reasons of the removals of twelve
							highly popular Officers— The President flew into a Passion, said he had
							been abused from Dan to Beersheba, for his removals; and that not a
							single man had been removed, but for oppression or defalcation— White
							then went to Van Buren, and repeating what the President had said to
							him, asked for the specific instances of oppression or defalcations,
							that they might be made known to the people of the Territory. Van Buren
							told him the President’s recollection was at fault— That they gave no
							Reasons for their removals— White then applied to individual members of
							the Senate; giving them the characters of the new appointed Officers,
							and pledging himself to prove the disgraceful facts that he laid to
							their charge— This was so far working upon the Senate that three days
							since The President’s <persRef ref="donelson-andrew">private
								Secretary</persRef> wrote to White, requesting him to call upon the
							President that Evening, <pb n="352" type="ms"/>which he did— The
							President then told him that he heard White had been making statements
							abroad against his appointments, and that he had complaints against them
							from others— That he had already revoked one of his appointments, and
							there was a Postmaster who he thought ought to be dismissed— But he
							wished M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White now to give him such
							information respecting them all as he thought proper— White then went
							through the list and mentioned facts respecting almost every one of them
							which shewed them fitter candidates for a Tread-Mill than for public
							office—to which the President listened with tolerable patience, and
							closed the interview by saying he would see to it— One of the worst
							appointments is the <persRef ref="westcott-james">Secretary of the
								Territory</persRef> a protegé of <persRef ref="dickerson-mahlon">M.
								Dickerson</persRef> from New-Jersey, whose chief recommendation was
							his pandering to the malice both of Dickerson and of Jackson by
							slandering <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Southard</persRef>— He first crawled into the
							Department of State as a Clerk, where he soon made himself insupportable
							by his impertinence— Then resigned avowedly to fight a duel— Then
							sneaked dastardly out of the duel; and then was made Secretary of
							Florida, to get rid of his importunities— He has been there long enough
							to make him universally odious, and the President now told White that if
							the appointment had not been made, he would not now nominate him. But as
							it was, he did not see how he could drop him— White prevailed upon
								<persRef ref="duval-william">Duval</persRef> the Governor to go with
							him again to the President last Evening, and testify to the unfitness of
							the man but without effect— White told me numerous anecdotes of current
							transactions, which mark a dissolute and dangerous state of Society; but
							which it would consume too much time to record. I was so much wearied by
							the double exercise of the day that I could not write this Evening.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="handy-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Handy</persRef>
							came this morning with a Letter from <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Baker</persRef>, respecting the
							payment of his Notes to me, and also with a Statement of the Note due to
							me by the Second Presbyterian Church in this place— I took the
								<unclear>latter</unclear> for examination, and with regard to the
							former proposed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Handy to advertise for
							Sale, the House mortgaged to me by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker,
							and if he could obtain a purchaser at what it cost M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker, or near it, then to sell the House
							and pay my debt, retaining the balance of the proceeds at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker’s disposal— And if he could not sell
							it thus, and would fix a price at which I might take it, perhaps the
							debt might be settled in that way. He said he would proceed in that
							manner, having plenary authority from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Baker— Handy spoke of the troublesome controversy into which <persRef
								ref="campbell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Campbell</persRef> has been drawn about <persRef
								ref="eaton-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Eaton</persRef>— I told I had heard many different accounts of that
							affair, but none that I could consider as authentic, and I knew not what
							to believe concerning it. He said that before the inauguration of
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> last March
								<persRef ref="ely-ezra">Ezra Styles Ely</persRef> a Presbyterian
							clergyman of Philadelphia, who had made himself very notorious as a
							partizan for Jackson, came here to congratulate him upon his triumph— He
							then saw here M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell who had been his
							pupil and intimate friend. In conversing with him about the appointments
							of Heads of Departments, which were expected. Campbell told him that he
							hoped <persRef ref="eaton-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Eaton</persRef> would not as the rumour was be appointed Secretary
							of War, as it would injure the character of the Administration; and <pb
								n="353" type="ms"/>and then mentioned that D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi><space/>a physician of Georgetown since deceased had told him
							of facts discreditable to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Eaton— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ely made no use of this confidential
							communication at the time— The character of the woman was however so
							notorious that much opposition was made to the appointment of her
							husband; which nevertheless took place— In July last however Ely wrote
							to General Jackson, a statement of what Campbell had communicated to
							him— Eaton then called upon Campbell for an explanation, and Campbell
							persisted in the Statement he had made— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Eaton went to Philadelphia, and was closeted with Ely— General Jackson
							wrote to Ely requesting him to come here— He came, and he and Campbell
							were both summoned before a Cabinet Meeting, where Campbell persisted in
							his statements, and was treated with great rudeness by the President—
							Afterwards Eaton and his wife had another meeting with Campbell; at
							which Campbell required that another person should be present— Eaton
							proposed <persRef ref="lewis-william3">Major Lewis</persRef>, which
							Campbell declined, but proposed <persRef ref="towson-nathan">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l</hi> Towson</persRef>— At this Meeting
							Eaton positively denied what had passed between them at a former
							interview— He since challenged Campbell to fight him— Campbell declined,
							but proposed meeting him in a Court of Justice— A correspondence ensued
							in which Eaton’s last Letter threatened Campbell to insult him in the
							Street— Handy himself is a Clerk in the fourth Auditor’s Office; and he
							told me of <persRef ref="kendall-amos">Amos Kendall’s</persRef> threats
							to dismiss him because he had published with his name some statement
							respecting my service and loan to the Presbyterian Church— He concluded
							however to spare him. And while Kendall was in Kentucky, the Accounts of
								<persRef ref="timberlake-john">Timberlake</persRef> the purser, M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Eaton’s first husband were sent to him—
							Among them were several Letters from Eaton acknowledging the receipt of
							remittances from him. These remittances have not been credited to
							Timberlake and he is a large defaulter to the Government.— Handy put the

							they passed into those of <persRef ref="branch-john">Branch</persRef>,
							Secretary of the Navy—of <persRef ref="ingham-samuel">Ingham</persRef>,
							Secretary of the Treasury and of the President— They have now been

								<persRef ref="wilkinson-james">General Wilkinson</persRef> had
							petitioned or would petition— She herself was determined not to
							petition: and nothing would induce her to change this determination— But

						<p>It was much to my Surprize broad day-light when I rose this morning, and
							I began my walk after Sunrise, instead of finishing it as usual before—
							This affected my occupations for the whole day— I am now reading
								<persRef ref="solomon">Solomon’s</persRef> Song in the third Volume

								<persRef ref="amory-rufus">R. G. Amory</persRef> paid me a long
							morning visit, and talked as usual upon the general state of politics.
							He has been many years pursuing a claim before Congress, and
							accommodates his opinions to the doctrines of the Times. He spoke of a
							conversation that he had last Evening with some persons from South
							Carolina who were very inquisitive about the consequences of a State’s
							seceding from the Union. <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">Mr T. B.

								Webster</persRef> was here in the Evening, about half an hour before

							as he had been assured it would, that <persRef ref="tazewell-littleton"
								>L. W. Tazewell</persRef> one of the Senators from Virginia should
							not come, some of the nominations would be rejected— It was said to be
							ascertained that 22 Senators would vote against them— There is one
							vacancy by the Death of <persRef ref="reed-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Reed</persRef> from Mississippi—one by
							the absence of <persRef ref="troup-george">G. M. Troup</persRef> of
							Georgia suddenly called home by some domestic occurrence, and who has
							obtained leave of absence for the remainder of the Session— 23. Senators
							administration men remain, and the defection of one of them would turn
							the scale against the nominations— I told him if this was true the
							effect would be that they would purchase the attendance of Tazewell, who
							would sell it upon his own terms— As yet in spite of all their internal
							dissensions they hold together In party dissensions the profligate
							league together more closely than the honest for the very reason that
							individuals have no principle of their own to cling to. I believe that
							all the nominations of any importance will be confirmed— M<hi

							<pb n="355" type="ms"/>he has himself undoubting confidence and says he
							has tried them upon a small Scale. He proposes to take out a Patent at

							to me— It explains nothing—it leads to no new ideas. I think this Song
							of <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef> ought not to have been
							included in the Canon— It is a beautiful Oriental irregular Pastoral
							drama— Solomon wrote a thousand Songs all of which but this one are
							lost. They were therefore not intended for holy writ—not inspiration—
							Nor do I believe it of this. The unnatural fancy that ever bore the name
							of criticism— It has no reference whatever to the Union of Christ and
							the Church— It is oriental poetry, luxurious and sentimental; tender,
							voluptuous and yet not unchaste— The description of Spring is
							exquisite—the dialogue though broken and desultory, pathetic; the
							imagery surprizing, and the moral remarkable as plainly disapproving
							Polygamy— I cannot endure Scott’s Commentary— I am still driving upon

						<p>Heard this morning <persRef ref="lincoln-calvin">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lincoln</persRef>, at the Unitarian Church from
							Galatians 6.5. “For every man shall bear his own burden.” The Gentlemen
							affords a striking example of the extreme importance of pronuntiation,
							to a public Speaker. He is in this particular very defective, and seems
							to have a special fondness for the words which he most cripples. He is
							also more emphatic in his manner than the substance of his discourses
							warrants— This is the last day of his preaching here— He is settled at
							Fitchburg Massachusetts— His sermons are sensible but there is nothing
							in them that stamps itself upon the memory— After the Service I paid a
							visit to <persRef ref="richardson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Richardson</persRef>, at <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Poor’s</persRef>— He told me that <persRef
								ref="frothingham-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Furness</persRef> who will the

							of the <persRef
								ref="johnson-william;duval-gabriel;story-joseph;thompson-smith;mclean-john2;baldwin-henry;marshall-john"
								>Seven Judges of the Supreme Court</persRef>, none of them being at

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> at <persRef
								ref="lindsley-harvey">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lindsly’s</persRef>. Saw him and <persRef ref="webster-caroline"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Webster</persRef> and his
							daughter <persRef ref="webster-julia">Julia</persRef>. M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Webster is a daughter of <persRef
								ref="leroy-herman">Herman Le Roy</persRef>, a very kind friend of
							mine at Amsterdam fifty years ago. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Webster was apparently so much occupied, that I made my visit short. I
							then called upon <persRef ref="taylor-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> J. W. Taylor</persRef> and had much conversation with
							him— He read me a part of a Letter from <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, written in November in
							apparent very good Spirits; and he mentioned the wish of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s friends here that he should now be
							assumed and proclaimed by the friends of the last Administration as
							their Candidate for the next Presidential Election. Taylor himself is
							not inclined to this, and says that Clay has not and never had any party
							in New-York. But he thinks that the friends of the late Administration
							for want of a Leader would range themselves under <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> or <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>. I told him that I thought it
							would be fatal to the prospects of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay,
							if he should be just announced from this place, and that his first
							nomination should come from the West; and from his own State— He said he
							had heard that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun, was attempting to
							turn the anti-masonic tempest to his account, but I believed he would
							not make much of that— I said that I thought a new organization of
							parties with reference to the Presidency must take place. That questions
							will arise from the progress of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">this
								Administration</persRef>, which would divide the Country— That in
							the discussion of these questions M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							may very probably take a lead, which will bring him conspicuously before
							the Country. But that very probably—new men, not yet known, or thought
							of as Candidates may be started and brought forward. In the foreign
							Policy the Negotiations with England, and the project of taking Texas
							may raise such questions— The public Lands, the Indians, the overthrow
							of the Tariff, the putting down of the Navy, may produce them— There are
							combustibles enough; they only want kindling and the torches are at
							hand— He asked me if I thought the present administration would attempt
							to put down the Tariff— I thought they would; and that the apparent
							adhesion of their party to it now, was only to give it value in
							Negotiation with England. They would probably obtain the revocation of
							the British interdict upon our direct trade with their West-India
							Islands, and perhaps the Navigation of the S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Lawrence— The restoration of the West-India trade would
							force itself upon the British Government, by the sufferings of the
							Islands themselves; the Navigation of the S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Lawrence they would yield, because it would be for their
							own Interest, but they would chaffer for them because <pb n="357"
								type="ms"/>they know the present Administration want to obtain them
							as party measures; and they will exact an equivalent for them; which can
							only be at the expense of the Tariff— Their only difficulty will be to
							obtain terms which two thirds of the Senate will ratify. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor seemed surprized at these opinions,
							and thought there was no danger for the Tariff— He asked me why I
							thought there was a disposition to put down the Navy— I referred to the
							Message—to the Report of the <persRef ref="branch-john">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef>; and to the Proceedings now going on in Congress— I
							also expressed my opinions against the distribution to the States of the
							proceeds of the public Lands, and especially against the exclusion of
							the application of them to purposes of internal improvements— Upon some
							of these points M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor’s opinions differ
							essentially from mine— I set with him till he was called to dinner— In
							the Evening I heard <persRef ref="campbell-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Campbell’s</persRef> third and concluding Lecture upon
							the character of <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Paul</persRef> from 2. Corinthians 11.22–27— There was an
							accompaniment to the singing, with an Harmonica—very soft and musical—
								<persRef ref="lovell-joseph">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lovell</persRef> told me they were beginning to introduce this
							instrument into churches as a substitute for the Organ.</p>

						<p><date>25. V. </date>Monday.</p>
						<p>Met <persRef ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice Marshall</persRef> again
							in my morning walk— Having finished reading <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon’s</persRef> Song with <persRef ref="scott-thomas"
								>Scott’s</persRef> Commentary, I took up this morning in the Bible
							without Commentary, the Apocryphal book of the Wisdom of Solomon— From
							the character of its contents it seems more worthy of a place among the
							Canonical Books than the Song— But the Style is different from that of
							any book of the Old Testament— There is a sequence in the Greek
							compositions, not apparent in the didactic Hebrew Books— The turn of
							mind, and modes of expression in the Book of Wisdom, seem to belong to a
							Later Age than the Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and Song. The Sententiousness
							is more peremptory and less argumentative in the Hebrew Books— I
							continue to read about one hour every morning in the works of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>— This day I finished the third
							and began upon the fourth Book of the Rhetorics to <persRef
								ref="herennius-gaius">Herennius</persRef>— This fourth book is upon
							Elocution, by which the author understands the composition of a
							discourse— It begins by a declaration that he will not imitate the
							example of the Greek Rhetoricians who borrow from others the
							illustrations of their precepts; but will invent them all himself; and
							he wastes a long argument to prove that a teacher of the Art should draw
							upon his own resources for his examples as well as for his precepts. The
							examples that he gives are very good, but they regard nothing but
							figures of speech and construction of Sentences. As a System of Rhetoric
							this is a very good work, and embraces within a very small compass the
							theory of the Art. Though very different from the Style of Cicero, it is
							more methodical and complete than any one of his Treatises, though in
							many parts of the first books it is almost the same with Cicero’s books
							de Inventione— It contains many very judicious precepts, some of which
							are not in Cicero— He points out clearly the distinction between the
							Solemn, the Neat and the familiar Style, and gives examples of each,
							well defined. He insists frequently on the absolute necessity of
							frequent practice to render any instruction effective, and he cautions
							against the frequent introduction of moral sentences; observing that
							when rare and judicious they are highly ornamental, and pleasing, but
							when thickly crowded they impress the hearer with the idea that the
							Speaker is employed as a teacher than in action. I was all the day very
							constantly engaged; wrote a Letter to my Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, and made some progress in my
							Russian and Turkish War— Evening quite unwell with a Sore throat.</p>

						<p>Though I rose this morning at four, I went out about ten minutes later
							than usual, and met <persRef ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice

							person named <persRef ref="tree-lambert">Tree</persRef>, brought me from

							Letter from <persRef ref="noyes-thomas">Thomas L. Noyes</persRef> a
							Clerk in the Post-Office, stating that on assorting the Mail this
							morning, he had found it in that condition. It was from New-York,
							Postmarked the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and contained the
							manuscript copy of the Chapter upon the War between Russia and Persia;
							made as I had requested <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Blunt</persRef> that
							it should be made, upon sheets written only on one side of the leaf;
							upon seventeen sheets of Letter paper— I wrote to the <persRef
								ref="barry-william">Postmaster General</persRef>, and enclosed to
							him the torn cover, for his information— I received also a Letter from
								<persRef ref="davis-john3">J. B. Davis</persRef> at Boston,
							enclosing a statement made by <persRef ref="sawyer-william2">William
								Sawyer</persRef> of Charlestown, before a magistrate, of the manner

							Sawyer advanced his money for the publication, and was finally left in
							the lurch by the associates— He wrote to Jonathan Russell last August,
							stating that the loss on the publication had been 500 dollars, and
							calling on him for his portion or one third of the contribution, but
							Russell did not answer his Letter. I received also a Letter from

							interspersed with profound reflections, some of which are not in Cicero—
							One of the great excellences of this Treatise— It contains a complete
							System of Rhetoric which may be read attentively through in three hours—
							Finished reading the two Articles of the November English Quarterly

						<p>The weather alternates warm and cold almost every other day. This morning

							private Correspondence is so great in this Country that it loses almost

							after writing, perceive that much of what I have written is fit only to
							burn— I thought so of half my Letter this day to J. B. Davis, yet
							finally concluded to let it all go— It absorbed the morning; and the
							Turkish and Russian War the remainder of the day; excepting an hour of
							the morning to read 12 Letters of the first Book of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> Epistles to <persRef
								ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>. I still read without <pb

							which I have adopted but lately and which I believe in one years
							practice, an hour every day would make the language more familiar than
							three years of Study, with Commentaries and Dictionaries and
							Dissertations— The Epistles have difficulties peculiar to themselves,
							among which there is a constant interspersion of Greek words, sentences
							and quotations. The Letters to Atticus commence a short time before the
							Consulate of Cicero— There should be a date affixed by the Commentators

							the party was social and pleasant, but there was no very interesting

							the same topics, and his politics are diverting only because there is no
							motive for repeating what he says to injure him— I came home between 8
							and 9. with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt who lodges at my
							neighbour <persRef ref="swann-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Swann’s</persRef>; and met my own Carriage on the way, going for me—
								<persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								T. B. Johnson</persRef> had dined here— I found my cold more
							oppressive, and was obliged to intermit writing and reading for the
							Evening. Read this morning several Letters to <persRef
								ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>— The Account of the Trial of
								<persRef ref="clodius-publius">Clodius</persRef> for his profanation
							of the mysteries pro populo at <persRef ref="caesar-julius"
								>Caesar’s</persRef> house is interesting— His acquittal by the
							venality of a major part of his judges—an enquiry into this iniquity
							instituted by the Senate and a consequent dissension between the two
							orders the Senate and the Knights, among whom the judges had been
							selected. <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">He</persRef> tells of some sharp
							and cutting repartees which passed between himself and Clodius. The
								13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							and 17<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Letters of this book, are studies
							for composition— Others are affecting by the passionate attachment
							disclosed in them for his Tusculanum; and his books. The delight with
							which he retires from the forum the Senate and the Bar, to meditation
							and philosophy— The 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Letter, in which
							he requests Atticus to return to Rome, that his friend may have someone
							with whom he may hold communion, of whom he may take counsel, with whom
							he may laugh without restraint and sigh with the freedom of the fire
							side is inimitably pathetic. In several of the Letters he Mentions a
							manuscript Commentary upon his own Consulate, which he had written in
							Greek. He speaks doubtfully of his Greek Style, which he requests his
							friend to criticise gently— There are some characters admirably drawn:
							and some exquisite strokes of Satire.</p>

						<p>Heard at the Unitarian Church, this morning <persRef
								ref="frothingham-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frothingham</persRef> of Boston from Mark 6.20 “For <persRef
								ref="herod">Herod</persRef> feared <persRef ref="johnthebaptist"
								>John</persRef>, knowing that he was a just man, and an holy, and
							observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him
							gladly.” The Sermon was a very ingenious and apposite commentary upon
							the text; analysing it in all its parts; and making it illustrative of
							the contrasted characters of Herod, and of John the Baptist— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s delivery was good, and the
							small auditory notwithstanding the severity of the weather listened to
							him with undivided attention— The evening was so cold, <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> at 22
							that I did not venture from the House— I stopped at Church to speak to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham— He says that <persRef
								ref="brooks-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brooks</persRef> is
							very dangerously ill— I employed the Evening, in writing to my Son
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">wife</persRef>— In the morning I began
							reading the Book of Ecclesiasticus, or Wisdom of the Son of Sirach,
							which I have always thought the most valuable of the Apocryphal books—
							It is avowedly of the age of the <persRef ref="ptolemy"
								>Ptolemy’s</persRef> during the captivity; and has every appearance
							of being what it purports to be; which is not the character of the
							wisdom of <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>— I finished also the
							first Book of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> Epistles
							to <persRef ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>, and read the first
							Letter of the second Book— His ambition to imitate <persRef
								ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef> appears in a collection of
							his own Orations which he delivered while he was Consul which he
							therefore calls <hi rend="italic">Consulares</hi>, and of which he sends
							a copy to his friend— The Letter upon the misunderstanding between his
							brother <persRef ref="cicero-quintus">Quintus</persRef> and Atticus is
							admirable. In others the strokes of Satire are pungent— The sketches of
							character, blasting—the deep sensibility to patriotism, to friendship,
							to the domestic affections to literature and taste delightful and
							instructive— I wandered over the pages of <persRef ref="sale-george"
								>Sale’s</persRef> Koran this day, to search the passages which
							command war against the infidels— The principal precept is in chapter
							47. which Sale calls <persRef ref="mahomet">Mohammed</persRef>; but
							which in a note he says some entitle War.</p>
