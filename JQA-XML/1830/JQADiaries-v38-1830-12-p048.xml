						<dateline>Wednesday 1. December 1830—</dateline>
						<p><date>1. IV:30— </date>Wednesday. Went to Boston early this morning— Met
								<persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nathaniel Curtis</persRef>, and <persRef ref="ward-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward</persRef>, the Treasurer of
							Harvard University, at the Life Insurance Office in State Street.
								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Quincy</persRef> the President of the University, and <persRef
								ref="bowditch-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bowditch</persRef> a member of the Corporation were also there—
								<persRef ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. N.
								Boylston</persRef> had given two bonds to the President and fellows
							of Harvard College, which his Executors wished to discharge and cancel—
							One for one thousand dollars conditioned for the annual payment of fifty
							dollars, for the elocution prizes— The bond was on its face for 1200
							dollars—but it reserved the right of rescinding the grant within three
							years, and was to be void on the grantors providing by his Will for the
							payment by his Executors of 1000 dollars, which provision he accordingly
							made. Although the bond stipulated for the payment of 50 dollars a year,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston while he lived did actually
							pay sixty—and the same sum has been paid by his Executors since his
							decease. Those payments had been made, till the last Commencement— The
							bond was now paid, with interest to this day, and taken up, with a
							receipt signed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward, entered upon it—
							The other bond was for 1500 dollars, conditioned for the payment of 100
							dollars a year, for the medical prizes: and with this there is a
							mortgage of part of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston’s real
							Estate in Roxbury. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bowditch thought that
							these instruments should not be cancelled unless by a formal vote of the
							Corporation— The whole penalty of the bond, not being equivalent to the
							annuity of 100 dollars. He said that money to a very large amount might
							now be obtained at 4 per Cent annual interest— We were obliged therefore
							to leave this bond and mortgage uncancelled— President Quincy promised
							to meet me, rain or shine, next Tuesday at the Probate Court in Dedham;
							to settle an Executors account, in the Execution of <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Will— Returning to <persRef

						<p><date>2. V:30. </date>Thursday— Thanksgiving day— Heard <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter
								Whitney</persRef>, from 1. Corinthians 4.7. “For who maketh thee to
							differ from another?” The text is susceptible of great variety of
							comment, but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney presented it as
							subject of Thanksgiving to the supreme disposer that he had made us to
							differ from other Nations in our Circumstances, and our Fortunes— He
							pointed out the happy condition of the people of this Country, which is
							perhaps as real, as can belong to the state of man upon Earth; and of
							which none of us are duly sensible— Other nations however have their
							enjoyments, and might perhaps thank God, as sincerely for having made
							them differ from us, as we can for differing from them— The happiness of
							the Romans consisted in War, Liberty, and perpetual civil contention—
							There are Nations now, which can never be satisfied with tranquility—
							Europe is upon the verge <pb n="49" type="ms"/>verge of bloody and long
							convulsions in search of happiness, which I fear we shall lose sooner
							than she will find— To thank God because we are not like other men is a
							practice not commended to imitation in the gospel— This usage of
							commemorating by a yearly religious festival the goodness of God, for
							his blessings bestowed in the course of the year, is wise in itself, and
							something more than a substitute for Christmas, which with the other
							Romish Church festivals our puritan ancestors discarded— The general
							motives for Thanksgiving to God, are—health—a fruitful Season—Peace; and
							contented minds.— A due sense of the goodness of God, is itself among
							the greatest blessings that he bestows— This day was clear and cold—
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Price Greenleaf</persRef> called and took charge of any of my plants
							in flower-pots and Tumblers— I promised to send him one of those, where

								>Charles</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
								wife</persRef>, <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">mine</persRef>
							and myself were the only portion of our family assembled at dinner this
							day— It was yesterday twenty-two years since we last kept thanksgiving
							in this house— Nor have I excepting the last year been within the State
							on a Thanksgiving day since— This was also the birth-day of my Son
								<persRef key="adams-john2">John’s</persRef> eldest daughter <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Louisa</persRef>, who is two years old, and whom
							we duly remembered— After dinner I walked with Charles to the Mount
							Wollaston farm, and inspected the new planted Orchard. <persRef
								ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> was there, and I
							remarked that the violent gales and heavy rains since the Trees were
							planted had already started many of them from the perpendicular line.
							Returning home we called at <persRef key="adams-thomas">my

						<p><date>3. IV:30. </date>Friday— <persRef key="adams-charles2"

								<persRef ref="pitts-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Pitts</persRef>. She proposes going by Land to New Haven, and there
							take a day Steam boat to New-York— As she will probably not reach New
							Haven before this day week, my project is after finishing my business at
							the Probate Court in Dedham next Tuesday, to go from thence into Boston;
							remain there the next day— Take the Stage on Thursday, and overtake my
							wife the next Evening at New-Haven— <persRef key="adams-thomas">My
								brother’s</persRef> daughters <persRef ref="adams-abigail2"
								>Abigail</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth"
								>Elizabeth</persRef> were here when my wife went away, and she
							engaged Abigail to come and stay with me till my departure— I was
							occupied the greater part of the day in preparing my papers for the
							Probate Court— My brother dined with me— <persRef ref="adams-josiah"
								>Josiah Adams</persRef> was here for about an hour before dinner,
							and his brother <persRef ref="adams-ebenezer">Ebenezer</persRef>, as
							long in the afternoon— Josiah agreed that they would take on lease next
							Summer my Druid Lots, bordering upon their Lands; and we spoke of the
							draining of the brook; but without coming to any definitive arrangement
							concerning it— These two brothers reside in two separate small houses,
							on the very spot where their and my Great-grandfather <persRef
								ref="adams-joseph2">Joseph Adams jun<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi></persRef> lived— His eldest Son <persRef
								ref="adams-joseph5">Joseph</persRef> was the Minister at Newington.
							His second Son, <persRef ref="adams-john4">John</persRef> was my
							Grandfather; who settled about a mile distant, at the foot of Penn’s
							Hill— His third Son <persRef ref="adams-ebenezer3">Ebenezer</persRef>
							inherited this paternal Estate, and lived and died on the place; leaving
							it to his Son <persRef ref="adams-ebenezer2">Ebenezer</persRef>, who was
							near about the age of <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef>, and
							was the father of these two brothers. They remain, in precisely the same
							station of life as was held by their and my common ancestor, of whom I
							consider them as exact representatives. They are good farmers, and have
							been victuallers. Josiah is a Deacon of the Church, and <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth6;adams-margaret2">their wives</persRef> are
							both Sisters of <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Whitney</persRef> the Minister of the Parish— It is a
							subject of instructive reflection, to compare the condition of those
							branches <pb n="50" type="ms"/>of the family of Joseph Adams, who have
							received a College Education, with that of those, which have not had
							that Advantage. The Education places them in another sphere of life—but
							who infers from thence that they are happier shocks all common
							sense.</p>

							appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.” After the Sermon

							envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up. 5. Doth not
							behave itself unseemly; seeketh not her own; is not easily provoked;

								>Deacon Spear</persRef> to call on me to-morrow morning, and I told
								<persRef ref="curtis-noah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Noah
								Curtis</persRef> that I should be glad to have the Parish Treasurers
							Note of 1400 dollars to the Executors of <persRef key="adams-john">my

							could have paid it last week; but was not now in funds. I said it would

								<persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel;greenleaf-ezekial">Daniel and Price,
									Greenleaf</persRef> and <persRef ref="miller-edward">Edward Miller</persRef> successively called in
							friendly neighbourhood— I finished reading this morning the third Volume
							of the English Translation of <persRef ref="calmet-augustin"
								>Calmet’s</persRef> Dictionary— Consisting of fragments illustrative
							of the Scriptures. It has greatly disappointed me, and I consider the
							time which I have devoted to it as almost entirely wasted— It is a
							costly work, loaded with a multitude of copper Plate engravings, of very
							little use for the illustration of the Scriptures— Its principal
							pretension is to collect testimony from books of Travels in the East, to
							explain particular passages of the Old Testament— There is a very long
							and very superfluous new Translation of <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon’s</persRef> Song, with a commentary to prove that it was a
							dramatic epithalamium, divided into six Sections of morning and Evening.
							There had been quite enough mystification of Solomon’s Song before— The
							attempt to prove that <persRef ref="jonah">Jonah’s</persRef> whale, or
							great fish was a ship is more reasonable, and not without merit. There
							is nothing better in the Book— The Dissertations upon <persRef
								ref="dagan">Dagon</persRef> and <persRef ref="atargatis"
								>Derketos</persRef> are curious, and led me to wish I could consult
								<persRef ref="selden-john">Selden’s</persRef> book upon the Syrian
							Mythology— The Geography of Palestine at the several periods from
								<persRef ref="abraham">Abraham’s</persRef> emigration out of
							Mesopotamia to the days of the Apostles and the Voyages of <persRef
								ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>, have
							interest, but all that can be known upon this subject may be learnt by
							comparison of the maps in half an hour— The miraculous character of the
							Jewish history is made the more astonishing by taking from the map an
							accurate inspection of the diminutive space within which they were forty
							years wandering between <persRef ref="ramses-ii">Rameses</persRef> and
							the river Jordan, before their establishment in the land of promise—but
							every spot of earth, and every drop of water from Dan to Beersheba, is
							spiritualized by the wonders of the old Testament and the new— It is
							fairy Land— The region of enchantment— The Laws of Nature are now the
							same there as in other parts of the globe; but who can ascend Horeb or
							Sinai, and believe that he is treading upon common dust—who can enter a
							boat upon the Sea of Gennesareth and think that he floats upon a common
							wave— Abbana and Pharpar are Rivers of Damascus, and may be such as they
							were in the days of <persRef ref="naaman">Naaman</persRef>, but what is
							that Jordan, by washing in the waters of which the Leper was cleansed? I
							dare not pursue this subject—but I have derived as yet little
							instruction or edification from the English Editor of Calmet.</p>

								key="adams-john">my father</persRef>; not without some difficulties
							made by the Judge, <persRef ref="leland-sherman">Sherman
								Leland</persRef>, who now proposed to postpone again, the acceptance
							of the accounts to give notice to all concerned before he should pass
							them; though at the Court in Quincy last Month he had told me he should
							dispense with this as an unnecessary formality. I reminded him of that
							circumstance, and of his reference then to a recent decision of the
							Supreme Court of the Commonwealth that a decree of a judge of a Probate
							Court was not necessarily final, for the passage of an Executor’s
							Account; but might be years afterwards revised by the Supreme Court— I
							also informed him that the accounts were prepared in precise conformity
							with his directions— That I proposed making the second distribution of
							the proceeds of the Estate, on the first of January next to the
							devisees. And as I was now going immediately to Washington to pass the
							Winter, I should not for several Months have it in my power to attend
							the Probate Court again— The judge at first seemed unwilling to
							acknowledge my statement of what he had said to me at the last Court in
							Quincy, but <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Haven</persRef> the Register remembered it, and said he had
							understood him as I did— The judge said that if he should pass the
							accounts without an order of notice they would have no validity—that is
							that they might be revised many years hereafter by the Supreme Court— I
							told him I was perfectly willing that they should <pb n="53" type="ms"
							/>remain subject to the revisal of the Supreme Court to the end of time,
							if any of the parties interested should so desire. He finally examined
							the vouchers and passed the Accounts, administering the Oaths to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy and me— After we came out M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy explained the cause of the Judge’s
							mutability since the November Court. He said there was another Executor
							in Court with whom the Judge had been half an hour contesting the same
							point before I came in— The judge having exacted the giving of notice
							from him, had concluded that he could not in presence of the same
							person, dispense with it from us; as he certainly would not, but for
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Haven’s remembrance— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy went with me to <persRef ref="u"
								>Bride’s</persRef> tavern, and thence to the Office of the Register
							of Deeds, and the Office of the Clerk of the Courts— We executed the
							Deed to me of the two remaining Woodlots of my father’s Estate;
							acknowledged it before <persRef ref="ware-jairus">Judge Jairus
								Ware</persRef>, who with <persRef ref="richardson-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> James Richardson</persRef> witnessed
							it; and I left it to be recorded. I executed also a bond to the
							Executors, obligating myself to pay the portion of the second
							distribution to the <persRef ref="adams-john3;adams-isaac;adams-joseph"
								>three children</persRef> of <persRef key="adams-thomas">my
								brothers</persRef>, yet minors, and that part of the bequest to my
							brother conformably to the Will— I signed also an engagement to pay the
							second distribution of 125 dollars to each of the devisees, taking the
							endorsement to me of the Quincy Parish Treasurer’s Note for 1400
							dollars; and a check, transferring to me the balance credited to the
							Executors, in the U.S. Branch Bank Boston; after first giving a check to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy for half the allowance of
							compensation to the Executors— He said he had never intended to make his
							agency in this affair a concern of money; but he would take the check,
							and would readily contribute to the expence of erecting the
							School-house, proposed by my father— After finishing these papers I
							dined at Bride’s and immediately after dinner came into Boston. Alighted
							at my Son Charles’s House, and sent S. Farrar with the horse and Chaise
							back to Quincy. The road from Dedham to Boston was not quite so much
							obstructed with Snow as that from Quincy to Dedham; but the North-west
							gale blew, and the snow was drifting the whole day. I found at his
							house, Letters from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">his
								mother</persRef> to him, written Friday Evening at Waltham and
							Saturday Evening at Worcester; and one to me, of Sunday Evening at
							Sturbridge— I had intended to remain to-morrow at Boston; but
							apprehensive of the obstructions which this fall of Snow may have
							occasioned on the road, and finding that I could finish all the business
							necessary at this time, this Evening, I sent and engaged a Seat in the
							Stage to go at nine to-morrow Morning for Hartford. I was engaged part
							of the Evening with Charles in arrangements of business, and in
							conversation with <persRef ref="davis-john3">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>I had finished reading the second Book of Kings yesterday; and this

								Quincy</persRef> and forwarded, my bank Books to be balanced; and
							left with Charles the necessary directions for the distributions to the

							Brighton, and one at Northbridge— The Carriage went heavily, and the
							wheels were hardly drawn through the drifts of Snow; at Newton just
							before Noon we were fairly stalled. Two Stages, in Sleighs from the
							westward soon came up, and for one of them we exchanged our Carriage. At
							Needham about one we took fresh horses, and were warned that the Stage
							from Hartford which should have reached there yesterday Noon had not yet
							arrived; and that another after attempting to labour through the Snow
							drifts with six Oxen, had failed, and returned back to Sutton— We
							proceeded through Framingham, Upton, and some other town to Hopkinton;
							where they gave us again a Carriage upon wheels, assuring us it would be
							impracticable to travel in a Sleigh; three fourths of the ground being
							bare, and Snow drifts six feet deep across the road for the other
							fourth. We should have dined at Hopkinton at one, but it <pb n="54"

							were to be seen— We came on, fasting through Northbridge to Sutton,
							where about nine in the Evening we obtained a very comfortable Supper—
							We had been obliged to alight several times as well from the Sleigh, as
							from the Coach— Often to turn out from the road into deep furrowed Corn
							field’s—to break up Rail-fences, break down Stone Walls, and drive over
							rock, and through ditches. My companion M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>9. </date>Thursday—at half past one in the morning we arrived at
							Woodstock— This was the place, which in the regular course of the stage
							we should have reached at 7. O’Clock last Evening, and where we should
							have lodged till four this morning— We thought it best however not to
							stop for the short time left, and proceeded as soon as our driver would
							go 1/2 past two. leaving our transient passenger behind— They gave us
							here again a Sleigh which was dragged chiefly over bare ground, through
							Thompson to Ashford—where at 6 in the Morning we found a breakfast in
							waiting for us— The house is kept by a person named <persRef ref="u"
								>Clarke</persRef>, and a family of three generations appeared to be
							in attendance— An old man and <persRef ref="u">woman</persRef> each
							little short of 70. two women in middle age, apparently married, and a
							youth and maiden under twenty, all occupied with the business of the
							house— Our next Stage was Vernon after passing through Tolland a
							handsome Village and the first Town in Connecticut beyond the
							Massachusetts border. At Vernon a Coach with wheels was again given us,
							and we came through Mansfield and East Hartford over the Bridge to
							Hartford— We landed from the Stage, all safe and unhurt, about 1/2 past
							one at the Exchange Coffee-house. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
								>My wife</persRef> not being there, nor at the Hartford Hotel, where

								ref="kirk-john">John Kirk</persRef> at the United States Hotel— She
							came from Sturbridge to Tolland, in the Snow-Storm on Monday— Remained
							at Tolland on Tuesday; and yesterday travelling again with infinite
							difficulty through the Snow arrived here last Evening. One of the horses
							being ill, they could not proceed this day to New-Haven. There was no
							Steam-boat from hence to New-York this day; but the Victory is to go at
							1. P.M. to-morrow. <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Governo</persRef> called upon me to offer his excuses for not
							knowing who I was till we arrived here, and to ask some questions as to
							his means of proceeding to New-York— He is a young French-man, an
							Officer, he says in the service of the Emperor of Brazil— Arrived last
							week at Boston, from Surinam, and seeking a passage now to Rio De
							Janeiro. He speaks not a word of our language, and complains that this
							inability is made a subject of rudeness and ridicule, and not of polite
							and obliging helpfulness as it would be to a stranger in France. He sat
							dull and silent yesterday morning in a corner of the Stage, with a pint
							bottle of cordial, which he applied occasionally to his lips— <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Searle</persRef> I suppose a
							Temperance Society man, at last said to him with a good-humoured
							smile—“not good”— He then <pb n="55" type="ms"/>gave us to understand
							that he could not speak our language and I accosted him in French. He
							was delighted to find some one with whom he could talk, and was
							afterwards full of conversation— He made no further use of his bottle,
							and when I asked him this morning what had become of it, he said he had
							thrown it away— Pride, good-nature and a quick sense of honour were
							discernible in his character. He told me that none of the Frenchmen whom
							he had seen at Boston were persons of distinction, or fit company for
							him— At Vernon, in the bar-room of the house where our horses were
							changed there were two men talking in French, upon France, <persRef
								ref="louis-philippe">Louis Philippe</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>— One of them was evidently an
							American, and spoke with an English accent.— The other seemed to me a
							German; but my fellow-traveller took him for a Frenchman, and I supposed
							would have spoken to him— But he did not, and assigned to me as his
							reason for silence, that he had no doubt the man was quelque Cordonnier—
							We had rain all last Night and part of this Morning while on the road.—
							It recommenced this afternoon and continued all the Evening: not

						<p><persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burgess</persRef> one of
							our last Evening Visitors, brought me this Morning the National
							Intelligencer of last Tuesday, and the Extra Sheet containing the
							Message of the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> at the
							opening of the second Session of the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi>

								Charles Sigourney</persRef>. With <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Adams</persRef> I visited the Asylum of the Deaf and Dumb, and saw
							an exhibition of three of the Classes there—the first of which were all
							natives of Massachusetts—the Legislature of that State having made a
							liberal provision for their support. <persRef ref="clerc-laurent">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Le Clerc</persRef> himself one of the

								<persRef ref="weld-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Weld</persRef> formerly the teacher of the School at Philadelphia,
							and whom we have since seen at Washington is now here— We also saw in a
							separate Apartment, a young woman named <persRef ref="brace-julia">Julia
								Brace</persRef>—deaf, dumb and blind—sitting alone beside a table
							and knitting— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Weld approached and took
							her hand; but she cast off his with apparent displeasure— He attempted
							to take from her lap a handkerchief which she had been hemming; but she
							resisted and struggled to retain it— She took M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Adams’s hand with readiness; felt inquisitively along the
							fringe of her veil, and silk knots of her Cloak, and pressed separately
							the end of each finger of her hand— The matron of the Institution coming
							in she readily received her hand—yielded at once the handkerchief which
							she had denied to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Weld, and threaded a
							needle which the Matron put into her hands to exhibit an example of what
							she could do— We necessarily shortened our visit and returned to the
							Hotel, where <persRef ref="gallaudet-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gallaudet</persRef> called upon me— He is to be
							considered as the first, and principal founder of this Institution— He
							told me there were now sixteen of the same kind in the United States— We
							had given up all idea of going by Land to New-Haven—the roads being
							almost impracticable; and at Noon we embarked in the Steam-boat Victory,
								<persRef ref="u">Captain Sherman</persRef>; who was however not on
							board— A <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Richards</persRef> one of the proprietors acted as Captain: also a
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wurgman</persRef>— I
							made my excuses to <persRef ref="babcock-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Babcock</persRef>, for not visiting <persRef
								ref="babcock-dorothy">his mother</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="babcock-dorothy2">Sister</persRef> owing to the shortness of
							the Time. He followed us on board the boat, and remained with me to the
							last Moment. The Steam-boat M’Donogh, which arrived only this Morning
								<pb n="56" type="ms"/>from New-York, departed again an hour before
							the Victory. All my fellow passengers in the Stage from Boston were in
							the M’Donogh— There is competition, professional and political between
							these Boats— The proprietors of the Victory call her the People’s boat,
							and others call her the Jackson boat— We were urged to take passage in
							the M’Donogh, but had engaged our passage in the other before she
							arrived— The Victory is the boat of greatest speed, and in descending
							the river overtook the M’Donogh just as she reached Saybrook, at the
							dusk of Evening— Both boats were moored here for the Night, unwilling to
							encounter the Gale, and swell, heaving the Waters of the Sound— We were
							visited by several Passengers of the Fanny, a Steam-boat from Norwich
							and New-London which came out on Wednesday but was obliged to put in
							here yesterday and has remained here all this day. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Richards talks of going out at Midnight if
							the gale abates— One reason which he assigns for not going out this
							evening is that it is low-tide—with not more than 4 1/2 feet Water on
							the bar at the mouth of the river, while the boat draws 7 feet— The
							descent of the Connecticut River is pleasant in the mild Seasons and
							with fair weather—but this day was raw and gusty, and the banks of the
							River were powdered and the distant hills bleached with Snow—constantly
							diminishing however, as we came Southward, till at the Mouth of the
							river scarcely any Snow is to be seen— From Boston to Hartford the Storm
							was about of the same continuance, at the same time and fell and drifted
							in the same manner— I am told however that 20 miles west of Hartford
							there was scarcely any fall of Snow— All Rain.</p>

						<p><date>11. VII. </date>Saturday— Steam-boat Victory, from Saybrook to
							New-York.</p>
						<p>We came out from Saybrook, just at Sunrise, with a brisk, cold, Northwest
							wind, almost a gale, and a heavy swell, which made the Ladies, and
							several of the male passengers sick— There was a heavy foaming surf upon
							the bar, but the boat passed over it without striking. The whole day was
							blustering, and banished us mostly from the decks into the Cabins— I had
							a new set of fellow passengers, all total Strangers to me. I had no book
							and was reduced to the resources of Conversation in which I freely (too
							freely) indulged, upon various topics, and with many of the passengers.
							They were of very diverse characters, foreign and domestic, some
							educated, and highly polished, others rude and untutored, coarse and
							vulgar. I was treated with great respect by many of them, and not
							disrespectfully by any one. I discovered the names only of two or three—
							One a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson</persRef>
							of New-York, a merchant of grave and gentle deportment— A young man
							named <persRef ref="u">Hollister</persRef> who spoke much of his claim
							to a patent right, contested and which he could not substantiate for a
							lack of means to feed a Law-suit. With another young man, perhaps named
								<persRef ref="u">Goodwin</persRef>, I had talk upon Electricity,
							Magnetism, Galvanism, Light, the figure of the globe, matter, Spirit,
							and atheistic philosophy. With others I talked Politics, of the recent
							Revolution in France, and the celebration of it at New-York, Prospects
							of War in Europe, and all the topics of the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President’s</persRef> Message. I told of my
							first voyage to France, and others of my adventures— Garrulous Old Age—
							The M’Donogh left Saybrook half an hour before us: but the Victory soon
							came up with her, and ran her out of sight during the day. The Fanny
							followed us out of Connecticut River; but we soon lost Sight of her and
							it was supposed she found the Swell too heavy, and returned or went <pb
								n="57" type="ms"/>in to New-Haven— We buffeted the waves the whole
							day, entered the East-river at Sands’s point at the dusk of Evening, and
							passing Hellgate in the dark, landed between nine and ten at New-York.
							We took lodgings at the City Hotel, kept by <persRef

								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun’s</persRef> proposal to bring

							been referred to by Calhoun, and produced by M<hi rend="superscript"

							writing at all M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe would barely say to
								<persRef ref="rhea-john">John Rhea</persRef> that he might go on.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe said that he had never <hi

							That he had answered Crawford’s to him, concerning it, by referring him
							to the members of the Administration who were present at the

							said he would shew me the correspondence relating to the transactions in

							He was anxious to obtain an increase of his pension of 200 dollars a

							been sufficient for his comfortable maintenance, while he was young, and

							worked upon it himself. But the days of labour of the old man were now

							and support his petition; which I hoped and believed would be
							successful. He expressed deep mortification that the integrity of the
							captors of André should have been disputed— I observed that it never had

							not a single instant in rejecting <pb n="59" type="ms"/>André’s climax

						<p><persRef ref="coale-e">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Coale</persRef> had

							at ten this Morning: but <persRef ref="thomas-philip">M<hi

							of the Rail-road Company; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>one of
							the Directors came just at our breakfast time, and so warmly urged an
							excursion upon the Rail-road both to <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> and myself that we could not refuse. At ten this
							morning therefore we went to the depot in a Carriage belonging to the
							Company, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas, <persRef
								ref="patterson-william3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Patterson</persRef>, and several other directors of the Company were
							with us. And <persRef ref="campbell-william">Sir William
								Campbell</persRef> Chief Justice of Canada, who is travelling
							Southward for his health. We were a few minutes belated in arriving at
							the depot, after the Cars with Passengers had left it. Our horses and
							Carriage were placed upon a rail or trussell and taken part of the way.
							But the centre of the road had been recently repaired; then made muddy
							by heavy rains, and was now heaved up by a sharp frost, above the
							surface of the rail, so that the flange of the wheel had no space at the
							side of the rail, and was running upon the hard ground— Our horses were
							taken out of the Rack, but the Carriage was transported onto the place
							where the Railway crosses the road to Washington 7. Miles from
							Baltimore. Here M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams left us and
							proceeded in her Carriage— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>remained to
							see her safely off. The rest of us were on to <persRef ref="u"
								>Ellicott’s</persRef> Mills in the Car— Several times delayed by
							Cars freighted with Merchandize meeting us, owing to our being out of
							time—and by which there was a difficulty in passing. The returning way
							is not yet finished; so that the Cars in both directions run upon the
							same rail— They are building the second way upon a foundation of solid
							granite. I observed not much progress of the work since I viewed it last
							May, till we came to Ellicott’s Mills, where a high granite bridge of
							three Arches, is thrown over the stream and the road beyond it. The
							railway is now continued on the other side, and nearly 12 miles of it
							are completed— We returned to the half-way-house notwithstanding the
							impediments which delayed our progress, and before 3. were taken up by
							the Stage which had left Baltimore at 2. Several passengers were waiting
							at a neighbouring Inn, having left the Stage while it waited for us, and
							now rejoined it— Sir William Campbell and I lost our dinners by our
							ride, but having taken a heavy and oppressive Cold, the loss was to me a
							salutary privation— Passing by Rossburg, at the dusk of Evening, I saw
							our Carriage standing at the door— From the time it grew dark the roads
							were deep and heavy— Soon after 7. in the Evening I alighted at my Son
								<persRef key="adams-john2">John’s</persRef> house in Washington, and

						<p>I arrived here, with a bad Cold and Cough— Of the same character with
							that which afflicted me the whole of last Winter, and from which I had
							scarcely recovered when I left Quincy. On rising this morning I had
							neither fire to warm me, or light enough to write by till day light. I
							had resumed the reading of the Scriptures yesterday at <persRef
								ref="barnum-david">Barnum’s</persRef> Hotel, where I found a Bible
							in our Parlour— This morning I read 1. Chronicles 7.8.9. and sallied
							forth before daylight for my Morning walk round the Capitol, returning
							shortly after Sunrise. Met <persRef ref="jesup-thomas">General
								Jesup</persRef>, <persRef ref="patterson-daniel">Commodore
								Patterson</persRef> and <persRef ref="cutts-richard">R.
								Cutts</persRef>— I asked the General if <persRef ref="jesup-ann"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Jesup</persRef> was well: He
							said no— He had not had his Clothes off the whole Night— On opening my
							Trunk I found that Neither my Letter Book, nor my Bank Book of the
							Branch here were with me. Wrote to my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> to ascertain if I had left them at Quincy— Wrote
							little else; the power of my hand having nearly deserted me— <persRef
								ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>
							was the only person who called to see me. I received several Letters,
							and the Certificate under the Seal of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
							with the signature of <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Levi
								Lincoln</persRef>, Governor, and of <persRef ref="bangs-edward"
								>Edward D. Bangs</persRef>, Secretary, of my election upon the 1<hi

							which at New-York he mentioned having written to me was little more than
							an enclosure for a printed copy of the Oration delivered by <persRef

							France at New-York— A Letter from <persRef ref="waterhouse-benjamin"

							concerning <persRef ref="adams-samuel">Samuel Adams</persRef>. A long one from a person signing himself Vetus

							a member of the present Congress— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"

							Heard <persRef ref="palfrey-cazneau">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cazenove Palfrey</persRef> now the settled Minister there, from John
							6.68 “Then <persRef ref="peter">Simon Peter</persRef> answered him,
							Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal Life”— The
							Sermon was upon the Office and character of Jesus Christ, according to
							the prevailing Unitarian Doctrines. It was however not controversial—nor
							very impressive. The singing was remarkably good. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Palfrey gave notice that there would be
							service in the Church on Christmas day. My cold and cough were so
							troublesome that I could not attend the Evening service— They also
							disabled me in a great measure from writing. <persRef ref="huntt-henry"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt</persRef> was here but I

								husband</persRef> in the Evening. I received several Letters, still
							addressed to me as a member of the present Congress. My prospects of
							doing any thing this Winter, are most discouraging from the state of my
							health; and with dispositions as earnest and energetic as any that are
							likely to accrue during my present abode at Washington, I was reduced to
							waste much of this day in reading the Water-witch, a new novel or
							Romance by <pb n="64" type="ms"/>our Countryman <persRef
								ref="cooper-james">Cooper</persRef>. Of five or six that he has
							published, all of high reputation, this is the first that I have
							undertaken to read— The author is of the School of <persRef
								ref="scott-walter">Sir Walter Scott</persRef>; and has made himself
							renowned by painting American Scenery—American manners, and
							characters—Savage and Colonial; and especially Sailors and Sea-pieces—
							The men, women and children of this school have a resemblance to nature,
							as coloured wax figures have to human flesh and blood— If the incidents
							are marvellous, they are not required to bear the slightest shew of
							probability. In this work there is a merchant of dutch extraction,
							Alderman of New-York and smuggler—a Patroon of Kinderhook—a damsel
							descended from a French Hugonot; and a king-hating <persRef
								ref="captainludlow">Ludlow</persRef>, who is also Commander of a
							Queen’s Ship— An old French Valet who prefers <persRef
								ref="corneille-pierre">Pierre Corneille</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef>—and a number of
							Negroes, all shrewd and sentimental, all clipping English in the same
							way, and all abstractions without individuality— The mysterious
							personages <persRef ref="masterseadrift">Seadrift</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="tomtiller">Tiller</persRef> are entirely out of Nature, and the
							interest of the book is almost wholly concentrated upon them— The
							dialogue is deficient in simplicity; and among the educated persons
							often unintelligible— Scott has been the principal reviver of this
							Style, which had been laughed out of fashion by <persRef ref="moliere"
								>Moliere</persRef>, and by the Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus— The
								<hi rend="italic">précieux</hi>—or the <hi rend="italic"

						<p>Night sleepless from 1. A.M. There was a light fall of Snow in the Night—
							And a wintry Northwester succeeded in the morning. When just at the dawn
							I walked round the Capitol Square, it was sweeping off the Clouds under
							the sky— After breakfast I walked with my Son <persRef key="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> to the house purchased of <persRef
								ref="baker-daniel">Daniel Baker</persRef>. It was then clear, and
							blowing a gale as of Salt and Nitre. This continued all day and at
							Night. My cough and hoarseness continue troublesome— I answered the
							Letter from <persRef ref="southard-samuel">Samuel L. Southard</persRef>,
							received a few days before I left Quincy. After dinner, I was unable to
							write, and finished reading the Water-witch or Shimmer of the Seas—
							There is not much inventive faculty required for this species of
							composition. The <persRef ref="cooper-james">author</persRef> may
							indulge his imagination without restraint. The delineation of character,
							the description of Scenery, the percussion flash of moral reflection,
							and the painting of the Passions constitute the merits of this Class of
							writers. Their works are not pictures of human life; and are very
							awkward and incorrect representations of manners. In reading <persRef
								ref="gilblas">Gilblas</persRef> I never can divest myself of the
							idea that he was a real personage, and that his Life and adventures were
							precisely those related in the book— There is no illusion in the modern
							Romances. In this book the description of Manhattan Island, Staten
							Island, Long-Island, the Narrows, the Heights of Neversink, and
							Long-Island Sound, are proofs of the author’s intimate knowledge of
							localities, and of an extensive command of language to describe them—
							The Sea-pieces, the atmospherical phenomena, the chase through Hellgate
							without Pilots, the battle between the English and French Cruizers; the
							nocturnal boarding of the English ship by the boats of the French
							frigate. The destruction of the Corvette by fire, and the escape of the
							principal dramatis personae upon the raft, are Scenes wrought with great
							ability and shew the hand of the master— The sweeping off, of the four
							Officers from the raft, the catastrophe of the man who attempted to take
							the Shark, The death of the French <persRef ref="captaindumont">Captain
								Dumont</persRef> and that of the <persRef ref="mastertrysail">Master
								Trysail</persRef>, are described with no inconsiderable pathos; but
							throughout the whole there is a want of the language of nature. The
							principal personages are by a narrative and incidents trampling upon all
							probability brought into situations of extreme danger, and of agonizing
							horror, but as to the movement of the passions, they all remain in the
							most imperturbable tranquility. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cooper
							has great skill in exhibiting physical nature and its operations; but
							seems not equally conversant with or not equally qualified to portray
							the more complicated and more intricate movements of the human
							heart.</p>

						<p>The Night was severely cold, and <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel"
								>Fahrenheit’s</persRef> Thermometer this morning stood at 8. above

							a Letter to my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>— The

							the Evening I had a visit from <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">Dutee J.
								Pearce</persRef> a member of the House of Representatives from
							Rhode-Island— He spoke of the business transacting in the two Houses of

							this day upon an incidental question shewing that it was a party
							prosecution— Lawless himself was upon examination; and after answering
							to a question from the Judge’s Counsel, <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>, that he was
							contingently interested in the event of the suit upon which he had
							criticised the Judge’s decree, declined answering the question to what
								<hi rend="italic">extent</hi> he had been interested— On appeal to
							the Senate whether he should be required to answer, the decision was 23
							to 19 that he should not, by an administration and opposition vote with
							2 or 3 exceptions on each side— Pearce spoke of the correspondence said
							to be pending between <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President
								Jackson</persRef> and <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Vice-President
								Calhoun</persRef>, upon Calhoun’s advice and opinions at the Cabinet
							Meetings in 1818 upon Jackson’s transactions in Florida during the

							the Providence College: settled in Maryland, where he has been a member
							of the Legislature, and Candidate for many Offices; and recently
							appointed through Calhoun’s influence to the Office of Solicitor of the
							Treasury created by an Act of the last Congress. Pearce told me the
							Story of the Correspondence between Jackson and Calhoun, as he had it
							from Maxcy, and his authority was Calhoun. A version accommodated to
							Calhoun’s present interest, and false to the extent of pretending that I
							had in the Cabinet Meetings on the Seminole War concurred with Calhoun
							and the other members of the Administration in wishing to bring Jackson
							to a Court of Inquiry, and that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe
							had supported Jackson against us all!</p>

						<p>The severity of the cold had somewhat abated this Morning: and the wind

							may be proper to share in the general joy and approbation at the triumph

							assign to me. My reasons are that the principal members of the

								Joseph M. White</persRef> the delegate from Florida in the house of

							advertised for Sale a copy of <persRef ref="evelyn-john"
								>Evelyn’s</persRef> Sylva, of the last Edition of 1825. in two
							Quarto Volumes— I sent immediately and purchased it, but the bookseller
							sent me word that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White was at present
							using one of the Volumes of the work, and wished to retain it a day or
							two— White himself confirmed this and I desired him to keep the Volumes
							as <pb n="69" type="ms"/>long as he should have occasion for them— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> White mentioned to me, that in the Reports
							from the Navy Department at this Session of Congress it is announced,
							that after the present year the Plantations of Live-Oaks in Florida,
							which I had commenced, and which are now in a very flourishing State
							will be abandoned and broken up; on the allegation that along the whole
							Coast of Florida, and of Georgia, nature produces the Live Oak in so
							great abundance, that an artificial Plantation can be of no use there.
							This, White says is an egregious misrepresentation, and is contradicted
							by a mass of testimony upon which I commenced the Plantation— There are
							now he says seventy thousand trees on the ground set apart for it by my
							direction, requiring an expense not exceeding seven thousand dollars to
							maintain and which will now be abandoned to perish, or come to nothing.—
							He wishes to have the Plantation established by a special Act of
							Congress, and not to depend on the discretion of the Executive, and was
							now consulting Evelyn, for facts which would aid his argument. He asked
							me to write on the subject, but I thought it would be useless at
							present— I advised him to consult <persRef ref="duhamel-henri">Du

								>Matthew L. Davis</persRef> but one which in the French language was
							susceptible of a construction which placed the United States upon a less

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett</persRef> was here this

									>r</hi> Walsh’s</persRef> Letter, and declined writing for
							publication upon the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President’s</persRef>
							Message, and upon the Colonial Trade question— The time for writing upon

							from certain. The attempt to direct public opinion is always
							hazardous—often desperate—and the moment to act must be waited for with
							untiring Patience, and seized with instinctive sagacity— Preparation for
							it however would be useful—and that I shall neglect. I have begun
							writing with the intention of employing my time to some purpose this

							had been more creditable— He had devoted his times to Poetry, and the

						<p>Rainy Night and Morning. The symptoms of my cough are constantly varying,
							and have threatened to disable me from writing altogether. But having
							yesterday undertaken the recovery of my arrears in this Diary, I devote
							12 days to that work exclusively; allowing a remnant only for writing an
							occasional Letter. Postponed my walk round the Capitol Square from the
							Morning before breakfast, to the afternoon before dinner. I read part of
							the Article in the American Quarterly Review of this Month, upon Banks
							and Currency— It was written by <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>; with great
							ability— I received this morning by the Mail a Newspaper called the
							Miners and Farmer’s Journal. dated 22. Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							1830. and published at Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, North-Carolina— It
							contains an Article purporting to be taken from the Yadkin and Catawba
							Journal, signed by <persRef ref="alexander-joseph">Joseph M’Knitt
								Alexander</persRef>; and headed: Declaration of Independence, by the
							Citizens of Mecklenburg County (then including Cabarrus) North-Carolina,
							on the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> day of May 1775— The paper is
							directed in manuscript to me: headed Proofs of Declaration of
							Independence By Mecklenburg, N<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi> Carolina
							May 20. 1775. Also by Legislature of N<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi>
							Carolina on 12. May 1776. And at the bottom of the first page of the
							paper is written— “As <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s</persRef> denial of the
							above transactions comes to us through a Correspondence with <persRef
								key="adams-john">your father</persRef>—it is hoped this will be
							received and used with that comity with which it is transmitted by your
							friend &amp;c. J. M. Alexander.”— This refers to a Letter from T.
							Jefferson to my father dated 9. July 1819. and published in the late
							Edition of Jefferson’s writings. Vol. 4. p. 314. This Mecklenburg
							Declaration of Independence had already been asserted in several
							Newspapers— Jefferson cites the Essex Register of 22 June 1819. but
							wonders that it had escaped the attention of the Richmond Enquirer and
							of the National Intelligencer. He treats the whole Story as a fraudulent
							fabrication, and unjustifiable Quiz— This paper purports to be a reply
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s Letter— It refers to a
							pamphlet published by <persRef ref="gales-joseph2">Gales</persRef> at
							Raleigh in 1822. and to a number of certificates from various persons,
							but does not give the certificates themselves. The Statement is that two
							persons delegated from each Militia Captain’s Company in the County of
							Mecklenburg, met at Charlotte, on the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							of May 1775. and with many other persons on the next day issued this
							Declaration of Independence, drawn up by a <persRef

							sent by <persRef ref="jack-james">Captain James Jack</persRef> to

							North-Carolina in Congress, <persRef ref="caswell-richard"
								>Caswell</persRef> and <persRef ref="hooper-william"
								>Hooper</persRef>, by whom they were communicated to Congress; not
							officially; because that was thought to be premature. But Jack was

						<p>Notwithstanding the continuance of my Cough, I walk round the Capitol

							member of the House of Representatives from the State of Ohio, and in
							the Evening from <persRef ref="tudor-delia">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Tudor</persRef>, who brought three Packets for <persRef
								ref="bernard-simon">General Bernard</persRef> at New-York which I
							forwarded— Further Accounts were this day received from Europe. Vance
							said that some of the friends of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef> were speaking of the downfal of the Military
							Administration in England—upon which he told them he heartily wished the
							Military administration in this Country would follow their example—and
							their king too. In France there has been also more than one change of
							Ministry— And the convulsion <pb n="72" type="ms"/>in the Netherlands
							has completely separated the two parts of that Kingdom. It appears to be
							impossible that this event should pass off without producing a general
							War in Europe— The movements in the Catholic Netherlands all tend to the
							ultimate reunion of that Country with France— Geographically,
							Historically, by Language, and Religion, they properly belong to France—
							They enjoyed the benefits of that Union, for twenty years from the
							battle of Gemmapes till the overthrow of <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef>, when by the general
							parcelling out of Europe at the Congress of Vienna, they were united
							with the old Dutch Republic to form a kingdom for the house of Orange—
							The <persRef ref="william-i">king of the Netherlands</persRef> is a Man
							of good intentions, moderate abilities, and indefatigable devotion to
							his duties— His Government throughout his dominions has been patriotic
							and paternal. The revolt has not been so much against him, as against
							the unnatural Union into which the Belgians were forced by the Congress
							of Vienna— And the result shews that the Union of men under one
							Government, must be held together by natural ties or by military
							despotism— The disruption of the kingdom of the Netherlands was the
							immediate and inevitable consequence of the Revolution in France— The
							king of the Netherlands, sustained by his Batavian subjects and army,
							but deserted by the Belgian portion of his troops, after a few feeble,
							and ineffectual military Struggles and Proclamations had acknowledged
							the Independence of the Belgian Provinces, as have the five European
							Allies of the Congress of Vienna. But they have forbidden the Belgians
							to constitute a Republic and have recommended to them a Sovereign of the
							House of Nassau— The Belgian provisional Government have agreed to adopt
							a limited Monarchy for their Government; but have excluded forever the
							house of Orange from the throne— Meanwhile Russia, Austria and Prussia
							are raising armies by the hundred thousand. France is doing the same,
							and <persRef ref="ate">Até</persRef> hot from Hell already shews her
							face— There is a premature rancour by the accounts this day received
							that the <persRef ref="nicholas-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef> has

						<p>Morning walk round the Capitol Square. I received visits from <persRef
								ref="burrows-silas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Burrows</persRef> of New-York, and from <persRef
								ref="vaughan-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Vaughan</persRef> the British Minister. Burrows told me that he came
							here to see if he could not prevail upon Congress to pass the bill now
							before them in favour of <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>— Ten or eleven years
							ago, Burrows being then barely of age, was employed I believe as a
							bearer of despatches to Sweden. I heard nothing of him from that time
							till some two or three years since the Newspapers gave notice, that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Burrows had generously lent a thousand
							dollars to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, to enable him with his
							family to visit <persRef ref="monroe-maria">his daughter</persRef> at
							New-York. About four Months since, the Corvette which <persRef
								ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef> had purchased for the
								<persRef ref="nicholas-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef>, having sailed
							from New-York with the Baron on board was overtaken by a Gale or
							Hurricane, which made her a perfect wreck. In this condition, she was
							picked up, by a vessel belonging to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Burrows and brought <pb n="73" type="ms"/>back to New-York. For the
							Service rendered on that occasion M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burrows
							declined receiving any compensation—in consequence of which, by the
							direction of the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>, a
							Letter was written to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burrows by <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren</persRef> presenting to him the thanks of the Government of
							the United States for this signal instance of humanity and disinterested
							magnanimity— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burrows said it was well
							known he was for <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef> for next President of the United States,
							and he fully believed the whole electoral vote of the State of New-York
							would be for Clay— That on his arrival here he immediately received an
							invitation to a private dinner at the Presidents and had dined with him
							yesterday— That he was to dine this day with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Van Buren; who had also sent him a card of invitation from
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan to his Ball to-morrow, and
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Van Buren had invited him to go with
							him in his Carriage— But he was not to be bought, and he had expressed
							his Sentiments so freely to the President that he told him he was the
							most Independent man he had seen since he was President— Last week
								<persRef ref="law-richard">Captain Law</persRef> the Collector of
							the Port of New London was removed and a man from New-Hampshire
							appointed in his place— Burrows said he had told the President it was
							the most unpopular act he had ever done— That Law was a man of most
							respectable character; universally beloved, an old Revolutionary
							Officer, and one of the very few survivors from the old Jersey Prison
							ship— The President told him that he had been prevailed upon to remove
							Captain Law, at the unanimous and earnest representations of all the
							friends of the Administration in New Hampshire but that he would give
							him another Office better than the one he had taken from him. Burrows
							spoke of a line of communication which he had established by regular
							packets from New-York to Carthagena. From thence to Chagres, and thence
							across the Isthmus to Panama— Also of his having volunteered to give
							bond for <persRef ref="swartwout-samuel">Samuel Swartwout</persRef>,
							when he was appointed Collector, at New-York, and could not otherwise
							have made up the amount of bonds required by Law; and could not have
							held the Office. Swartwout had refused to remove any of the friends of
							the last Administration from their places in the Custom house, and last
							week was attacked for this forbearance in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Van Burens paper the New-York Courier and Enquirer. He wished me to
							speak to <persRef ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef> in behalf of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, which I promised to do, and
							said he had persuaded <persRef ref="mallary-rollin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mallary</persRef> of Vermont to
							support the Bill—but that the great difficulty was with the members from
							Virginia— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan brought a couple of
							Vials of black drops which he had received from England— I returned the
							visits of <persRef ref="dickinson-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								J. D. Dickinson</persRef> and <persRef ref="tayloe-benjamin">B. O.
								Tayloe</persRef>, of J. W. Taylor and <persRef ref="vance-joseph"
								>Vance</persRef>—<persRef ref="davis-matthew">Matthew L.
								Davis</persRef> and <persRef ref="gouverneur-samuel"
								>Gouverneur</persRef>; only the last of whom I found at his
							lodgings— With him were <persRef ref="ringgold-tench">Marshal
								Ringgold</persRef>
							<persRef ref="ward-aaron">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward</persRef>
							formerly a member of Congress from the State of New York, and also a
							member elect of the next Congress from the District of Sleepy Hollow as
							he said— There was also a <persRef ref="magennis-arthur">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Magennis</persRef> from Missouri, one
							of the witnesses on the trial now before the Senate of <persRef
								ref="peck-james">judge Peck</persRef>, and as I perceived a
							willing witness against him— I called at the shop of <persRef
								ref="stone-william">W. J. Stone</persRef> the Engraver to enquire
							concerning a copper-plate which I wish to have engraved. He shewed me a
							number of complicated machines of his own invention, for the exercise of
							his art as an Engraver; also collections of precious Stones and of
							Minerals which he said he had imported from Heidelberg in Germany; all
							proving his ingenuity, and his turn to philosophical enquiries— Stone is
							an English Artist, whom I employed much, while I was in the <pb n="74"
								type="ms"/>department of State, and who engraved the fac-simile of
							the Declaration of Independence— With <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> I attended this Evening a Concert by <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Knight</persRef>, at the
							Unitarian Church— She sang “Comfort ye my People”—and “Angels ever
							bright and fair”—remarkably well— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Franklin’s</persRef> “Let the bright
							Seraphim” was less succesful— The company was very thin—not exceeding 30
							persons.</p>

						<p>Warm and sultry— Rain with Thunder and Lightening shortly after I rose.
							It appeared to pass off, and as if clearing up— Before Sunrise I took my
							walk round the Capitol Square, but before reaching home was overtaken by
							a very heavy thunder shower— Being near <persRef ref="barnard-frederick"
								>Barnard’s</persRef> Hotel I took shelter in <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Everett’s</persRef> Apartment, and found him just risen— I desired

									rend="superscript">r</hi> William Tudor’s</persRef> Journals and

							leave them at Quincy; and should therefore not be able to prepare the
							Article upon his life for the April number of the North American Review:
							but as it was my intention to return early in the Spring to Quincy I
							hoped to have it ready for the July number— The French Minister <persRef
								ref="rouxderochelle-jean">Roux de Rochelle</persRef> with <persRef
								ref="rouxderochelle-adelaide">his wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="rouxderochelle-jules">Son</persRef>, paid us a morning visit
							but <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> was confined to her chamber and unable
							to receive the Lady. I was engaged all the remainder of the day in

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> The first week of the month I
							was occupied at Quincy in preparing for my departure for this place— The
							next ten days was upon the road travelling hither—and the last fortnight
							having been resuming my habits of idle industry with a severe cold and
							cough upon me the whole time— My hour of rising has been irregular from
							half past three to seven; sleepless Nights having been followed by
							others of longer than my usual term of repose— This Diary had run in
							arrear from the close of the last Month until Christmas day— Undertaking
							since then to retrieve those arrears I have been able to do scarcely any
							thing else; and have another week of the same labour before me— We
							breakfast between nine and ten— Dine at four and my usual hour for
							retiring to bed is from ten to eleven— I now read very little of any
							thing, and spend from six to eight hours of every day in writing— My
							only exercise is a walk round the Capitol Square which according to the
							state of the weather I take before breakfast or before dinner. A small
							portion of time is engaged in receiving and returning visits.</p>
						<p>The year has past away— I close it with gratitude to a kind Providence
							for the numerous enjoyments it has brought with it. Humbled in Spirit
							but resigned for those which it has denied; and with keen self
							disapprobation for the time which has been wasted and irretrievably
							lost. May the future be more profitable!</p>
