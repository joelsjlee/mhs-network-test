						<p>Rain great part of the Night, and continued this morning so that I lost
							my walk before breakfast— Visit from <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Coffin</persRef> of Boston— Drove
							along in the drudgery of the Russian and Turkish War, and am now
							abstracting from the accounts of the Battle of Koulevtcha or Pravody,
							which settled the result of the War, and it may be the future fate of
							the Ottoman Empire— From two to four O’Clock I took a ride on horseback,
							a mode of exercise which I believe indispensable to me for health; but
							troublesome and dangerous. I walked part of the way home, chilled
							through, but was obliged to spend the whole Evening in writing. My chief
							pleasure is in reading the Epistles to <persRef ref="atticus-titus"
								>Atticus</persRef> which are yet teazing by their obscurity— I have
							now finished the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> book; the last before
							the assassination of <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>. In
							the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Letter he says he had received <hi
								rend="italic">consolatory</hi> Letters from Caesar, I suppose upon
							the death of his daughter <persRef ref="tullia">Tullia</persRef>. After
							this he appears to have been under no personal apprehension for his own
							safety while Caesar lived— But there are in many of the subsequent
							Letters half suppressed disclosures of the deep anguish in which he
							lived— He says in the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Letter that
							things have been done which it was impossible for him not to disapprove.
							But he adds “I may fairly care nothing about them, which I do— But a
							truce with trifles.[”] In the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> there is
							a critical analysis of the word “<hi rend="italic">in hibere</hi>,”
							which he had used in one of his books addressed to <persRef
								ref="varro-marcus">Varro</persRef>— He says he had mistaken its
							meaning and desires Atticus to ask Varro to change it— In the 23<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> he complains that he cannot live with
								<persRef ref="brutus-marcus">Brutus</persRef>, and asseverates that
							his property gives him more pain than pleasure— Pain that he has no one
							to whom to leave it, which takes from him all enjoyment in its
							possession— In the 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> he intimates a fear
							that Varro who he <pb n="386" type="ms"/>says is a tetchy man, may think
							the part assigned to him in the dialogue, not equal to that which
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> had reserved to
							himself— He speaks several times of a Letter which he proposed writing
							to Caesar; in the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> he sends a copy of
							it to Atticus— By the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> it appears it
							had been submitted to some friends of Caesar, who object to parts of it;
							upon which Cicero concludes not to send it at-all. In the 28<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> he returns to it again; and says how
							shameful would flattery in me, to whom even life itself is a reproach.
							In the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> he styles <persRef
								ref="cornificia">Cornificia</persRef>, an old woman, of many
							nuptials. In the 31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> he repels with
							indignation the pretence that Caesar had declared he would do nothing,
							but by Cicero’s advice— Let us said he throw away all this; and be half
							free; as I may be by keeping in my solitude, and being silent— In the
								40<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> he says—what? does Brutus announce
							that <hi rend="italic">He</hi> (Caesar) is getting among the good men?
							brave news: but where are they? unless he has hung himself— In the 42<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> he tells a dialogue with the <persRef
								ref="cicero-quintus2">Son</persRef> of his brother <persRef
								ref="cicero-quintus">Quintus</persRef> who came to him professing
							penitence— Here says he I practiced some of your eloquence for I was
							silent— In the 52<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> and last Letter, he
							gives an account of a visit which Caesar had paid him in which he had
							entertained him; at the Saturnalia, three months before the Ides of
							March— He says Caesar was very pleasant: Said nothing of politics—much
							of politics—very amiable—but not such a one, to whom he could very
							cheerfully say—pray come again.</p>

						<list>
							<item>Baussier</item>
						</list>
						<p>Resumed my walk round the centre of the Capitol Square, with a keen
							Northwest wind, and a flight of Snow— Riding on horseback as yet is too
							severe an exercise. A <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baussier</persRef> came and enquired for a Memorial which he says he
							addressed and delivered to me, about December 1826—concerning a
							prosecution commenced by <persRef ref="macpherson-john2">J.
								M’Pherson</persRef> Consul of the United States at
							Carthagena—against him, as Master of a Merchant Vessel, for not
							delivering to him his Register. The object of the memorial was to obtain
							a dismission of the prosecution, there having been as he thought good
							reason, for his refusing to deliver to the Consul his papers; though he
							did not very clearly explain what it was— He said that he had neglected
							attending to the prosecution in Court, and now learned there was a
							judgment against him— I had some obscure recollection of such an
							application, and said I would have search made for the Memorial— My Son
								<persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> did accordingly make
							search but found not the Memorial— In my narrative of the Russian and
							Turkish War, I have come to the Battle of Pravody or of Koulevtcha, on
							the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June last, which gave its final
							colour to the issue of the War, and nearly got through the event of that
							day— As this is the first attempt I have made at regular historical
							composition, I endeavor to reflect as I proceed upon the principles by
							which the work should be put together— My materials are most provokingly
							deficient— For the War with Persia, I had scarcely any thing but the
							English annual Register of 1827. For year 1828 I have little more than
							the French Annuaire; and for the year 1829. absolutely nothing but two
							broken files of the Journal of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Petersburg both of which do not make a complete one; and neither of them
							bringing down the <pb n="387" type="ms"/>official Reports of the
							Generals later than the 1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of September— A
							copy of the Treaty of Peace signed at Adrianople, the 14<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September cut out from a Newspaper is
							the only other document or voucher that I have— The narrative therefore
							is patch-works loosely put together, and with unseemly chasms, for the
							want of such simple documents as bulletins and official Reports— The
							plans of campaign I find it more easy to understand than I had expected—
							The narratives of Battles, I am obliged to take from Ex parte Reports,
							which are not entirely to be trusted— If the Story were told on both
							sides there might be not less difficulty to come at the truth—but in the
							great events there is no mistake— In abridging the official Reports of
							Battles, I endeavour to retain the critical incidents of the day; and
							the graphic descriptions—special traits of valour and occasional
							conceptions of genius which influence the fortune of the day— I group
							together the Transactions of each army, and the proceedings of the fleet
							as much as possible by themselves— The Affairs of Greece may have a
							separate chapter; and another is devoted to those of Turkey in 1828—
							There should be one for 1829. but I have no materials. I can give
							therefore no unity to the work. It is a collection of fragments— A
								<persRef ref="joseph3">Joseph’s</persRef> Coat of many Colours— Nor
							can I so well put into it the heart, with the system of Arteries and
							veins through which might run one stream of pure political and religious
							morality little exposed to the surface, but felt in every pulsation—
							Thus should history be written—and lastly a rapid Style, enlivened by
							sagacity and inspirited with meditation should give to the whole the
							attraction of interest to grapple the attention of the reader— Multum
							abludit imago.</p>

								Emmons</persRef>.—M D—his Epick Poem of forty Canto’s about 1000
							lines in each, called the Fredoniad, or Independence Preserved—the
							largest Poem, William says, that ever was published in America— Some
							seven or eight years since, the D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> sent me
							one Canto, perhaps the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> in manuscript,
							asking my critical opinion, whether, it ought to be published or not— It
							was a delicate question— I thought the Poetry upon a level with that of
								<persRef ref="milman-henry">Milman’s</persRef> Fazio, or of much
							that I have written myself— I kept the Manuscript from mere bashfulness
							to answer the Poet’s searching enquiry, till he took an alarm for the
							fate of his beloved offspring, and in an agony of terror lest it should
							be lost, wrote to me requesting I would return it— I sent it back,
							declining as civilly as I could to give an opinion as to the expediency
							of publication— Three or four years afterwards, I escaped a worse fate
							by promising to take two copies of the book when published— It was
							published in 1827. and I took the two copies—four Volumes—forty Cantos—
							At least thirty thousand verses— The last couplet of which take for a

						<lg>

								>Pitkin’s</persRef> History— I asked Fendall if he had commenced
							upon his History of the late Administration; he said he had not; but
							proposed to begin upon it very shortly— <persRef ref="handy-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Handy</persRef> was here this morning,
							and mentioned that he had advertised <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker’s</persRef> house, but could get
							no purchaser for it— One person only had offered; and he wanted a credit
							of four or five years— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Handy asked me
							what I should be willing to give for the house— I told him not more than
							1500 dollars— He said he would write to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Baker, to which I consented, and told him I was willing he should take
							six Months more to ascertain if he could get a higher price for the
							House— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Handy told me that copies of the
							papers relating to <persRef ref="timberlake-john">Timberlake’s</persRef>
							Affairs had been sent to the Senate— That Timberlake as Purser to the
							Frigate Constitution was succeeded by a Man named <persRef
								ref="randolph-robert">Randolph</persRef>— That Randolph received
							after Timberlake’s death a large sum of public money with which he paid
							for purchases—made by Timberlake and took the receipts as if paid by
							him— In consequence of which the honest Auditor and Comptroller now
							insist of crediting Timberlake with the payments; and charging Randolph
							with the money. Randolph complained of all this in vain; till being a
							Virginian, he went to the <persRef ref="tazewell-littleton;tyler-john"
								>Senators</persRef> of the State, and under apprehensions that they
							would take his part, M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Randolph is to be
							allowed to state his accounts and to have the benefit of his vouchers.
							The copies of the Papers are before the Senate, but the examination of
							Randolph’s Accounts is to be made not by Handy, whose business it is;
							but by some other Clerk, selected by <persRef ref="kendall-amos"
								>Kendall</persRef> and <persRef ref="hill-isaac">Hill</persRef>—
							There is a possibility that by these samples of their address Kendall or
							Hill may fail to be confirmed in their Offices by the Senate— In
							anticipation of which there is a project for the appointment of a third
							deputy Post-master General, and sixteen Clerks. These appointments are
							made without the concurrence of the Senate, and Kendall is to be the

							upon the subject which now occupies me— The first is a historical review
							of the eight Wars between Russia and Turkey which preceded the last.
							There is in this review, reference made to at least thirty authors,
							French, English, German, Italian and Russian, to scarcely one of which I
							can have access— The writer appears to be familiar with them all—
								<persRef ref="karamzin-nikolay">Karamsin’s</persRef> History of

							History of the Ottoman Empire are works new to me— He says that Von
							Hammer is the most eminent Oriental Scholar that has ever appeared in
							Germany, and except <persRef ref="silvestre-antoine">Sylvestre de
								Sacy</persRef>, has no rival in Europe— There is a short abstract of
							the causes and issue of every War between Russia and Turkey, from the
							first in 1569. to the eighth from 1807 to 1812—an animated account of
							the establishment of the House of Romanoff upon the throne of the Czars,
							in 1613. a rapid sketch of the character of <persRef ref="alexeimikhailovich">Alexis</persRef>, father of <persRef
								ref="peter-the-great">Peter the Great</persRef>; and some dramatic
							touches of the History of Peter himself. A Satirical attack upon the
							Austrian Government for ingratitude to <persRef ref="eugene">Prince

							person is no favourite of mine— He was a <persRef ref="coriolanus-gaius"
								>Coriolanus</persRef>— A Frenchman; born a Subject of <persRef

							invaded his Country and fought numbers of bloody battles against her— He
							went over to England too to raise a riot against the Tories, with the
								<persRef ref="churchill-john">Duke of Malborough</persRef>— There
							are other things too much against this same Prince in despite of his
							high reputation— The Article on <persRef ref="mahomet"
								>Mahommed</persRef> is not equal to the first, but has much
							information— The author Professes acquaintance with the Oriental
							Languages, and gives a severe criticism upon the Koran.</p>

							excessively crowded party last Evening at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Van Buren’s— I had some Conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Vaughan, upon <persRef ref="hall-basil">Captain Hall’s</persRef> Travels
							in the United States; and told him I thought Nations might avail
							themselves profitably of the observations of Strangers, not friendly to
							them; by learning something of their faults— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Van Buren after dinner, asked me if I had read <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson’s</persRef> Memoirs and Correspondence recently published—
							I said I had not yet looked into the Book, though I had a copy of it. He
							said there was in one of the Volumes a considerable Correspondence with
								<persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef>. I observed that there
							were some singular things in the book; and that they had given occasion
							to an interesting Scene in the Senate of the United States— He had said
							the book was very interesting— He said he thought <persRef
								ref="clayton-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clayton</persRef>
							had been very wrong in introducing it into the Senate— I said I was not
							of that opinion— I thought the Senate was precisely the place, where it
							was proper that the exposure of the falsehood should be made— The book
							had already been introduced by <persRef ref="hayne-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hayne</persRef>, to read a statement
							from it concerning me quite as false as that respecting <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard</persRef>—
							But that which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clayton read, was a gross
							imputation upon the integrity of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard—a
							Man who was dead— The person stated by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jefferson, as having told him the tale, and the person upon whom the
							corrupt attempt was said to have been made were now both present in the
							Senate— A more signal refutation of falsehood could not be given— The
							man named by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson as the propagator
							of the Report was there— The Man to whom M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bayard was charged with having made the dishonourable proposals was
							there— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clayton calls upon each of them to
							answer for himself. <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">Samuel Smith</persRef>
							the man alledged to have been tampered with, denies it openly,
							explicitly, without qualification— <persRef ref="livingston-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Livingston</persRef>, the alledged
							Reporter, tasks his recollection and remembers nothing— The Slander is
							put down in the face of the Nation; and I rejoiced at it— He said he had
							not read the debate, and did not know that the book had already been
							introduced— That it was impossible to suppose M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Jefferson had not received the information; he supposed
							therefore that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Livingston, had given it;
							but that he had been mistaken— I said to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Van Buren that he would do well to read the debate, which I thought the
							most important one that had taken place since the existence of the
							Government— The two doctrines were now before the Nation, and the
							existence of the Union, depended, as I fully believed upon that
							question. I said I well knew that the tale about Bayard and S. Smith, in
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jefferson’s book was <pb n="391"
								type="ms"/>false; for Bayard had more than once, told me himself the
							whole Story of that transaction— It was directly the reverse of what it
							appears in the Book— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> and <persRef

						<p>Heard at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church this Morning,
								<persRef ref="brownell-thomas">Bishop Brownell</persRef> from
							Matthew 6.10. “Thy kingdom come.” There was a collection taken up; in
							behalf of the Episcopal Society of foreign Missions, and the Sermon was
							an exhortation to beneficence in favour of that Society— It was a
							serious plain discourse, in a very temperate style of Eloquence, well
							written, with occasional elegance, read with propriety, but with little
							animation— There was more fire in <persRef ref="heber-reginald">Bishop
								Heber’s</persRef> hymn than in any other part of the Service— The
							Bishop was more argumentative than rhetorical, and after stating some
							encouraging facts relating to the Society, devoted the remainder of his
							time to answering objections. As we returned from Church I had a visit
							from <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel
								Brent</persRef>, and asked him, if he could furnish me with a copy
							of my Letter to <persRef ref="mallary-rollin">M<hi rend="superscript"

							Porter had a copy of that Letter in the hand-writing of <persRef
								ref="maury-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Maury</persRef>,
							but that there was no copy of it in the Office— I mentioned to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent my wish to have copies made out for
							me, of all the papers written by me while I was in the Department of
							State; and proposed to employ <persRef ref="brown-william10">M<hi

							I desired him to ask <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren’s</persRef> permission for
							that purpose, which he promised to do— I asked him also for the loan of
							some more books; particularly <persRef ref="maltebrun-conrad"
								>Malte-Brun’s</persRef> Geography, which he said he would send if at
							the Department. In the Evening I went with <persRef

							1.27. “Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of

						<p>I rose this morning by moon light, thinking it daylight— Walked out

							Citizens of New-Jersey, all now in attendance upon the Supreme Court of
							the United States. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard has been home
							since he visited me before; and returned— He now brought me back the
							manuscript which I had left with him at Philadelphia; and concerning
							which he said he would call and have a conversation with me— I have read
							a second time the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Book of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> Epistles to <persRef
								ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>— They were written between
							January and July of the year after the death of <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>, while he was deliberating
							whether he should go to Athens or remain in Italy— In the first Letter
							he mentions the sudden Death of a Physician named <persRef ref="alexio"
								>Alexio</persRef>, upon which he moralizes—concluding that for all
							these things there is this only consolation that we are born to such
							condition that we can refuse nothing which may happen to man— He says
							that <persRef ref="brutus-marcus">Brutus</persRef> has sent him, to
							correct the Speech which he had made at the Capitol—(at the Murder of
							Caesar) He pronounces the Speech well written, in very elegant language—
							He himself would in such case have spoken more ardently— But he could
							not correct the Speech of Brutus because it was suited to his
							character.— The person of the Speaker must be considered: and Brutus’s
							Oration was perfect, according to his theory <pb n="392" type="ms"/>of
							the best mode of public speaking. Cicero asks Atticus what he thinks of
							it, fears that from his name of Atticus he will have a preference for
							the Attic Style; but hints that the thunderbolts of <persRef
								ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef> prove that the attic style
							can express great passion— He thinks Brutus’s speech too cold— In the
								4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Letter, he says that as things are
							going on he delights not in the Ides of March— That man (Caesar) would
							not have been so bad as these— Although he is dead, we are not free—
							Such a Master would have been good. I blush, believe me; but I had
							written and will not erase it— In the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							he writes of his interview with Brutus and <persRef ref="cassius"
								>Cassius</persRef> at Antium: upon which he concludes to go to
							Greece, and says <persRef ref="dolabella-publius">Dolabella</persRef>
							has given him a free Legation— In the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							he mentions <persRef ref="augustuscaesar">Octavius</persRef> with
							doubts— In the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> he encloses copies of a
							Letter from him to Dolabella— In the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							he is greatly displeased at hearing Caesar called an illustrious Man—
							And says he will go away; not to fly; but in the hope of a better death—
							In the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> he describes effectively his
							parting from Atticus and says he will send him his book upon glory— In
							the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> he complains of <persRef

						<p>In my morning walk I overtook <persRef ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice
								Marshall</persRef>, and walked with him from the hither end of the
							Pennsylvania Avenue, to his lodgings at <persRef ref="gadsby-john"
								>Gadsby’s</persRef>. He told me that the Supreme Court had before
							them questions upon the validity of large Land Grants in Missouri, and
							were much perplexed to ascertain the authenticity of the Titles; and he
							asked if through an official application to the Spanish Government
							authentic copies of their grants might not be obtained. I said it would
							I thought at least be expedient to make the application, though I had
							not much confidence in the result— There is a very formal Code in four
							folio Volumes of Spanish Laws of the Indies—in which the title
							concerning land-grants is very short— It allows only of grants of very
							small extent, and always upon rigorous conditions of Settlement— But the
							practice was very different from the Law— The kings themselves made
							enormous grants to favourites or purchasers; often without conditions of
							Settlement— They often gave power to the Governors to make grants; and
							the Governors often made grants without authority; and many of them
							appear to have been carried into effect— Of all such grants probably no
							record or trace could be found among the archives of Spain— But there
							would be another and a greater hazard in the event of such application—
							The chance that the Archive would follow from the grant, instead of the
							grant from the Archive— That is that the holders of enormous spurious
							grants would find the means of fabricating the record as well as the
							grant, by gilding the palm of the Archivist himself— Of Records of that
							kind no small number has been imported from the Havanna into Florida
							since the cession of that Province— I mentioned also another ground of
							distrust in Spain’s Records of Colonial Land titles— The Office of
							Archivist was purchasable, and he considered the Records in his Office,
							as his own property. This was the ground upon which the <pb n="393"
								type="ms"/>keeper of that Office at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Augustine had refused to deliver up the Records in his possession— There
							was also a great Mass of Florida Documents lost on the passage from
							Florida to the Havanna—having been taken by a Pirate— <persRef
								ref="niles-hezekiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Niles</persRef>
							the Editor of the Register at Baltimore paid me a morning visit, and had
							some conversation with me upon the Tariff— I called this Evening at
								<persRef ref="coxe-walter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Coxe’s</persRef> house to see <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef>; but he was out—

						<p><date>12. IV:15— </date>Friday.</p>
						<p>Returned from my walk before Sunrise— Day without interruption of
							visitors. finished my Chapter on the Russian and Turkish War—Campaign of
							1829. and commenced that upon Greece— Wrote to <persRef
								ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph Blunt</persRef>, and enclosed the seventh
							parcel of four sheets of Manuscript— The pressure of this occupation
							with all the others that I have is almost distracting— I begin with
							three chapters of the prophets; much of them so unintelligible that it
							were a desperate pursuit even to seek their meaning— Then eight or ten
							Epistles of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>; followed by
							two pages of Turkish War, sundry Articles of Reviews and Speeches in
							Congress published in the Newspapers— Not a moment of leisure is left
							me; and my Journal even loses some of its dulness— I have finished
							reading the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and last Book of Cicero’s
							Epistles to <persRef ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>— This book
							begins at the time when he left his home intending to proceed to Athens,
							there to remain till the commencement of the next year when other
							Consuls were to come into Office. It finishes when he had determined
							upon returning immediately to Rome. The last of all the Letters is
							indeed merely an enclosure of copies of three to <persRef
								ref="plancus-lucius">Plancus</persRef>, two to <persRef
								ref="capito-gaius">Capito</persRef>, and one to <persRef
								ref="cupiennius-gaius">Cupiennius</persRef> recommending the case of
							the Buthrotians— The townsmen of Atticus in Epirus— <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef> had after his victory in the
							civil War, issued a decree for distributing Lands to his Soldiers in
							Epirus— The Lands of the inhabitants of Buthrotum had been taken to
							satisfy some of these grants— Cicero at the instance of Atticus had
							remonstrated in behalf of the Buthrotians— Caesar had issued an order
							that none of those Lands should be taken; and that if any of them should
							be taken, they should be restored to their owners, and the new claimant
							should be indemnified elsewhere— Then came Caesar’s Death; after which
							the new possessors insisted upon holding the Lands by his grant and the
							Buthrotians—upon holding their own by his decree. Plancus was appointed
							by the Consuls to investigate the case and decide according to <pb
								n="395" type="ms"/>the Acts of Caesar. The Letters to Plancus are
							Letters of earnest solicitation in behalf of the Buthrotians— Those to
							Capito and Cupiennius, are to ask for their influence with Plancus. It
							appears that one of the last philosophical Treatises that Cicero ever
							wrote was upon Glory, “De Gloria.” And it is one of those that are lost—
							There is in this Book a Letter from <persRef ref="hirtius-aulus"
								>Hirtius</persRef> to Cicero: and one from Cicero to <persRef
								ref="dolabella-publius">Dolabella</persRef>— Dates of time and
							place, the res nummaria, many of the Roman Laws, and biographical
							accounts of persons, are all wanted for explanation— The Clavis of
							<persRef ref="ernesti-johann">Ernesti</persRef> is imperfect upon all those points; and if I should ever have
							the time I shall want to read these Letters again, with a translation,
							Commentary, and <persRef ref="middleton-conyers">Middleton’s</persRef>

							and to his friends— He says that his legal majority of Votes in the

							last two years have befallen me, and of which scarcely a single day
							passes without bringing its portion— I see nothing else in prospect—and
							the real woes that come are embittered with an undefined terror, of
							deeper calamities which are not foreseen; but will be felt sooner than

								ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="hellen-thomas">Thomas J. Hellen</persRef>, for the
							expenses of his subsistence and education which I advanced for him,
							while he was at Cambridge— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye was his
							Guardian and my account solely for monies advanced has been due nearly
							two years— The judge of the Orphan’s Court made the most senseless and
							absurd objections against it in the first instance; which he afterwards
							gave up; and now M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye says there are
							difficulties which he will explain to me in a few days— After finishing
							the Letters of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>, I have read over again the
							Life of Atticus by <persRef ref="nepos-cornelius">Cornelius
								Nepos</persRef>— It is nearly half a century since I read with my
							Latin teacher at Leyden. There is something worthy of remark in that
							affectionate intimacy between two such men as Cicero and Atticus; who as
							Nepos says was in equal esteem with <persRef ref="antony-mark">Mark
								Antony</persRef> and in still more intimate connection afterwards
							with <persRef ref="augustuscaesar">Augustus Caesar</persRef>— For
								<persRef ref="agrippa-marcus2">Agrippa</persRef> married the
								<persRef ref="attica-pomponia">daughter</persRef> of Atticus—and
								<persRef ref="agrippina-vipsania"><hi rend="italic">her</hi>
								daughter</persRef> was married to the Emperor <persRef
								ref="tiberius">Tiberius</persRef>—a very bad, but splendid marriage—
							Nepos says that he published the Life of Atticus while he was living;
							and only added the account of his Death after it happened. He
							deliberately starved himself to Death at the age of 77, having a fistula
							and a fever— Nepos says in the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							chapter, after remarking that Atticus when very young enjoyed the
							intimacy of <persRef ref="sylla-lucius">Sylla</persRef>, then old; and
							when himself old, that of <persRef ref="brutus-marcus">Brutus</persRef>
							in youth, as well as that of <persRef ref="hortensius-quintus"
								>Hortensius</persRef>, and of Cicero his own cotemporaries, adds
							that of Cicero’s friendship for him <pb n="396" type="ms"/>the proof
							exists, not only in the books published by Cicero, in which he makes
							mention of him, but in sixteen volumes of Epistles to Atticus, written
							from the time of his consulate to the latest period: which whosoever
							reads will not much need a connected history of those times— For they
								disclose<hi rend="strikethrough">s</hi> all the passions of the
							chiefs, the vices of the leaders, the changes in public Affairs so
							completely that nothing is left concealed—shewing that prudence is a
							sort of prophetic power: for Cicero not only tells what happened in his
							own life, but predicted the future; and prophetically sung what is now
							coming to pass— There is mention made in Epistle 5. of the 16<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Book to Atticus, of Cornelius Nepos.</p>

								Campbell</persRef> at the Presbyterian Church; in the Morning from
							Matthew 24.44. “Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye
							think not, the Son of man cometh.” The duty of being always prepared for
							Death, and the general neglect of that duty, are subjects so constantly
							recurring to every Christian teacher that it would seem as if nothing
							but common place can be said about it— No preacher could discourse upon
							it so impressively to me, as my own conscience brings to it my daily
							meditations— All as yet to no purpose— <persRef ref="charles-v">Charles
								the fifth</persRef> probably brought on his own death prematurely;
							by getting up a funeral service for himself while he lived— I would
							think of it every day and every hour of the day; might I be prepared for

								>Lazarus</persRef>. Luke 16.19–31. [“]There was a certain rich man,
							which was clothed in purple, and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every
							day.” &amp;c to the end of the Chapter— This parable was spoken at a
							time when it is said the Pharisees who are covetous, derided him— It is
							a doctrine specially pointed against the pursuit of Riches— The rich man
							employed his wealth merely for dress and high feeding— No crime is
							charged upon him— Gorgeous Apparel and sumptuous fare, are the only
							faults imputed to him— Lazarus was not only a poor man, but a beggar,
							diseased and nearly famished— The parable seems to teach that enjoyment
							in this Life is itself criminal, and that suffering is itself a title to
							felicity here after— The concern of the rich man, for his brothers,
							while he is himself suffering the Torments of Hell, is a virtuous
							Sentiment, and pleads in his behalf. The main lesson of the parable is
							to restrain the passion for wealth— <persRef ref="swann-thomas">M<hi

						<p>Returned from my morning’s walk in time to see the Sun-rise— <persRef
								ref="peters-richard2">R. Peters</persRef> sent me the copy of the
							Opinion of the Supreme Court upon the Missouri case— It declares an Act
							of the Legislature of Missouri null and void; as being in violation of
							the Constitution of the United States. I received also a Letter from
								<persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Blunt</persRef>, with the sixth Quire of
							my Manuscript on the Russian and Turkish War— I have begun reading the
							Epistles of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> ad Diversos—
							The first Book consists of nine Letters, addressed to <persRef
								ref="lentulus-publius">Publius Lentulus</persRef>, Proconsul, and
							afterwards Imperator, and one to <persRef ref="valerius-lucius">Lucius
								Valerius</persRef>, a Lawyer whom he had recommended to Lentulus—
							This was one of Cicero’s most intimate friends— It was while he was
							Consul, and at his proposition that Cicero was recalled from exile, and
							had his property restored to him— The Letters are written in a style of
							affectionate friendship, and gratitude. Lentulus was Proconsul in
							Cilicia, and was anxious to obtain a Commission from the Senate, to
							restore by Military force <persRef ref="ptolemy-xii">Ptolemy</persRef>,
							king of Egypt— Cicero made every exertion in his power to get the decree
							of the Senate authorising the Commission; but there was a Sibylline
							verse against armies in Egypt, and the intrigues of <persRef
								ref="pompey">Pompey’s</persRef> partizans, and of the enemies of
							Lentulus and of Cicero, defeated the project— The Letters of Cicero,
							give accounts from Time to Time of what was doing in the Senate. The
							ninth is a very long one, in answer to enquiries from Lentulus, how it
							happened that he Cicero had become reconciled to <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>, <persRef ref="crassus-marcus"
								>Crassus</persRef>, and even <persRef ref="vatinius-publius"
								>Vatinius</persRef>— This was at the time, of the first Triumvirate,
							between Pompey, Caesar and Crassus— His principal Reasons were, the
							obligations he was under to Pompey, and the impossibility of
							accomplishing any thing in the Senate against the united influence of
							those three Men— He adverts to the general Rule that a public man should
							accommodate his conduct to time and circumstances—non idem semper
							dicere, sed idem semper spectare debemus.— In this same Letter he
							mentions the three Books that he had written de Oratore— These Letters
							are easier to understand than those to <persRef ref="atticus-titus"
								>Atticus</persRef>—having none of the Greek interlarding’s, and none
							of the designed obscurities— Lentulus was the immediate Predecessor of
								<persRef ref="pulcher-appius">Appius Claudius</persRef>, and he of
							Cicero as Proconsul in Cilicia— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"

							New-York. Judge Spencer is appointed a Commissioner to take my answers
							to these Depositions, and requests me to name a time when I can receive
							him— The <persRef ref="dalverme-vitaliano">Count dal Verme</persRef>
							paid me an Evening visit to take leave. He is going immediately to
							Virginia, and thence to New-Orleans— He told me he had heard some of the
							Debates in the Senate; which were interesting; but although a great
							Traveller, there is nothing in his Conversation which shews why he
							travels. The second Book of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero’s</persRef> Epistles ad diversos contains seven Letters to
								<persRef ref="curio-gaius">Caius Curio</persRef>, nine to <persRef
								ref="rufus-marcus">Marcus Coelius Rufus</persRef>, one to <persRef
								ref="sallustius-caninius">Caninius Sallustius</persRef>; one to
								<persRef ref="thermus-quintus">Quintus Thermus</persRef>, and one to
								<persRef ref="caldus-gaius">Caius Coelius Caldus</persRef>.— They
							are all written after Cicero’s return from exile, and most of them while
							Cicero was pro consul in Cilicia. The Letters to Curio, are hortatory;
							as from an old to a young man; urging him to a career of Patriotism and
							glory. One of them; very short is a Letter of condolence upon the Death
							of <persRef ref="curio-gaius2">Curio’s father</persRef>. The next <pb
								n="398" type="ms"/>is an apology for having advised Curio’s freedman
								<persRef ref="rupa">Rupa</persRef>, not to promise the exhibition of
							games, at the funeral— The reasons that he assigns for which are that
							Curio himself was absent. That all his friends were averse to the
							exhibition— That the People did not expect them; and that every body was
							weary of those exhibitions— The 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Letter
							is a most ardent solicitation to Curio, for his support in <persRef
								ref="milo">Milo’s</persRef> canvas for the Consulate. The 7<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> is from Cilicia, to Curio as a Tribune
							of the People—asking his influence to prevent the prorogation of
							Cicero’s Government— The Letters to Coelius are upon various subjects—
							Coelius had very earnestly urged him to take the side of <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>, in the civil War, because it
							was the strongest. to which Cicero answers with great firmness and
							dignity— Curio and Coelius were both political trimmers—but it did not
							save them— Both perished in the civil Wars— Coelius Caldus, was the
							Quaestor to whom Cicero on leaving his Province left the command— He
							declined leaving it to his own brother as his Legate, to avoid
							misrepresentations— He chose to leave it to no Legate; but to the
							regular Public Officer, chosen by the People and assigned by lot.— I
							have also read a number of Articles in the late Reviews— One
							particularly by <persRef ref="everett-alexander">A. H.
							Everett</persRef>, republished in a pamphlet, entitled British Opinions
							on the Protecting System— This is chiefly in reply to the stupendous
								<persRef ref="smith-adam">political economist</persRef> of the
							Edinburgh, and proves his utter ignorance of the Subject and the absurd
							inconsistency of his argument.</p>

							Bishop Hobart preferring a Society for distributing the Episcopal Prayer
							Book— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bayard thought M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jay, had much the advantage of the Bishop
							in that controversy. I began reading the third Book of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> Epistles ad Diversos— I have
							also been reading several Articles in late Reviews. I have now in hand
							the 99<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> number of the Edinburgh—for
							October 1829. republished at Boston in February.— The first Article is a
							newly published life of <persRef ref="locke-john">John Locke</persRef>
							with Extracts from his Correspondence, Journals and Common Place Books,
							by <persRef ref="king-peter">Lord King</persRef> who is said to be the
							Representative of his Family. The Reviewer declines making an Article
							upon the Life and Writings of Locke, reserving that for another
							occasion; but now confines himself to the Book— There is an extract of a
							very good Letter to <persRef ref="mordaunt-charles">Lord
								Peterborough</persRef> upon Education— There is some account of
							Locke’s intimate connection with the first <persRef ref="cooper-anthony"
								>Earl of Shaftesbury</persRef>, and its origin, which was
							accidental— But <persRef ref="grahame-james">Grahame’s</persRef> History
							contains much more upon this subject— The extracts from his Journal are
							interesting; but his ideas upon classical Learning and upon History are
							marked with the peculiar character of his mind—Metaphysical— It is an
							old charge upon Locke, that he thought <persRef ref="blackmore-richard"
								>Blackmore</persRef>
							<pb n="399" type="ms"/>a great Poet— There is perhaps an exaggerated
							account of the Popish Plot, and an account of Lockes removal from the
							Studentship of Christ Church College at Oxford—and he afterwards went
							into exile— His intimacy with <persRef ref="newton-isaac">Sir Isaac
								Newton</persRef> is a subject of much interest—though it appears to
							have been partially interrupted by suspicions on the part of Newton
							which bear an appearance of insanity— It is remarkable that this
							publication should have been so long delayed— Locke died in 1704. one
							hundred and twenty six years since— That inedited works of his should so
							long have existed without publication is surprizing.</p>

							selected and read over the whole succession of Extracts from the English

							Of the military Operations I found nothing but lame accounts of small

						<p>As I went out; a quarter before five, Venus was rising and after my

								Lee</persRef> paid me a morning visit, for conversation— The
							ransacking of newspapers continued all the rest of the day; as I draw
							towards the close of my Grecian Chapter— The third book of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> Epistles ad Diversos,
							consists of 13. Letters to <persRef ref="pulcher-appius">Appius Claudius
								Pulcher</persRef>, brother of the infamous <persRef
								ref="clodius-publius">Publius Clodius</persRef>— Appius was the
							immediate predecessor of Cicero, as Proconsul in Cilicia. The Letters
							commence at the time when Cicero was going to the Province, and were all
							written during the year of his service there— They all indicate a very
							anxious desire of Cicero to be upon terms of friendship and of good
							Offices with Pulcher; but are full of complaints at his conduct in
							return— The Letters of Appius are not given; but from the references to
							them in the answers it is apparent that they also were querimonious— It
							appears that he arrogated not a little to himself, from his Patrician
							birth, in his intercourse with Cicero, who in one of the Letters
							chastises him for it. He tells him fairly that he thinks neither
							Appiety, nor Lentulity have any concern with the relations between them.
							Almost every one of Cicero’s Letters contains sharp rebuke of Claudius’s
							injurious conduct, and yet offers of friendship, and assurances of
							perfect good will— Immediately after Appius’s return to Rome, he was
							accused of Majesty and of Ambitus, by <persRef ref="dolabella-publius"
								>Dolabella</persRef> who just at that time had married Cicero’s
							Daughter <persRef ref="tullia">Tullia</persRef>— Cicero takes great
							pains to convince him, that he had in no wise connived at these
							Accusations, and did not approve them. He says too that he had no hand
							in the marriage; but that it was made in his absence by his family
							without at-all consulting him— Appius was acquitted upon both the
							accusations, and was elected Censor, upon all which Cicero offers him
							his Congratulations. In the last Letter of the Book he intimates
							obscurely the hint of a hope that he might effect a reconciliation
							between Appius and Dolabella. The most remarkable feature of the
							Correspondence is the keenness of reproach, coupled with the earnest
							professions of friendship with which it abounds— Appius was father in
							Law to <persRef ref="brutus-marcus">Brutus</persRef>, and his daughter
							married one of the Sons of <persRef ref="pompey">Pompey</persRef>. He
							perished in the Civil Wars.</p>

								Vance</persRef>, member of the house of Representatives, introduced
							this <persRef ref="pugh-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pugh</persRef>, a native of Ireland, but who has been thirty years
							in this Country, and resides in the State of Ohio. He shewed me
							certificates from <persRef ref="creighton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Creighton</persRef>, and from
								<persRef ref="baldwin-henry">Judge Baldwin</persRef> that they had
							known him these twenty years. <persRef ref="ruggles-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ruggles</persRef>, the Senator from
							Ohio, introduced also two persons of his acquaintance— <persRef
								ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef> sat with me perhaps two
							hours— The sale of his furniture has been twice postponed: the second
							time from this day till further notice. He told me that more than a
							month since he had received information, that leave of absence had been
							granted him according to his application, <pb n="401" type="ms"/>but
							that four Packets had since arrived, and yet he had not received his
							official permission— He should therefore go in a day or two to
							Philadelphia; and return here, to wait for his despatch— He said he
							should leave young <persRef ref="krehmer-george">Krehmer</persRef> here
							as Charge d’Affaires; but that <persRef ref="lomonosoff-sergie">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lomonossoff</persRef> was coming out
							in that capacity— I had much conversation with the Baron, upon the
							Affairs of Russia, and of Turkey, and of Greece.— The allied Powers have
							not yet definitively decided the fate of Greece— He said that Russia was
							endeavouring to obtain for the Greeks the most favourable terms
							possible; and he thought they would be relieved from the payment of
							Tribute— But that they must receive <persRef ref="leopold2">Prince
								Leopold of Saxe-Coburg</persRef> as their Sovereign— I asked what he
							would do with his Religion— He supposed he might be converted to the
							Greek Church— If not, that he would have trouble from that source— I
							asked him about the personal history of <persRef ref="diebitsch-ivan"
								>Generals Diebitch</persRef> and <persRef ref="paskevitch-ivan"
								>Paskevitch</persRef>— The first is a native of Silesia; born a
							Prussian Subject—entered the Russian Service at 18. in the time of the
								<persRef ref="paul-i">Emperor Paul</persRef>— Was a Lieutenant in
							the guards—and being low in stature; and not handsome, Paul one day
							fixed his eye upon him at the Parade— The next Morning an order of the
							day appeared, announcing that the name of Lieutenant Diebitch was struck
							from the rolls of the army, “pour son indigne figure.” Diebitch went
							home to Silesia; but after the accession of <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Alexander</persRef> was recalled or readmitted into the army. He
							then rose gradually until the campaign of 1813. when he was chief of the
							Staff of the Army which went to Paris, and discovered great ability in
							the combinations for providing the army with supplies: the plan of that
							campaign was entirely his— On the resignation of <persRef
								ref="wittgenstein-peter">Wittgenstein</persRef>, who was near 80
							years old, and worn out, Diebitch took upon himself the responsibility
							of the Campaign, in which he so handsomely succeeded. He is a man of
							lofty ambition, and of good principles, and of dauntless personal
							courage— Paskevitch is a Russian— Also a man of keen ambition— He spoke
							also of <persRef ref="chernyshyov-alexander">Czenicheff</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="arakcheyev-aleksey">Araktcheieff</persRef>, favourites
							of Alexander; but bad men; particularly the latter, whose project of
							military Colonies he thought excessively mischievous and dangerous—
								<persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef> was with me, when Baron Krudener came in—soon after
							went away, and came again in the Evening— He now told me what the
							difficulty was which he had mentioned to me last Saturday without
							explaining it— <persRef ref="hellen-thomas">Thomas J. Hellen</persRef>
							has lately come of age, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye, is to
							settle with him his accounts as his Guardian— <persRef
								ref="hellen-walter">Thomas’s father</persRef> died in 1816.
							requesting by his Will that I would act as Guardian to his children, and
							recommending them in the most earnest manner to my kindness. I could not
							act as their guardian, having been absent for years from the Country
							after their father’s death; but from the time of our return to this
							Country, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hellen’s <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">daughter</persRef> who was then a child of 11
							years old, was taken by <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef>; who has always been to her as a mother; and she is
							now the wife of my Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef>— The
							eldest Son <persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef>, lived
							with us for years, at my expense, without cost to himself—left us, while
							we were at the President’s house; without notice to me; without
							assignment of a reason; and without the slightest acknowledgment of
							kindness received from me— A few weeks after we removed to Meridian
							Hill, he married my wife’s chambermaid named <persRef ref="winnull-jane"
								>Jane Winnull</persRef>, a bold and cunning minx, who had wheedled
							and dastardized him into a fit husband for herself.— Not daring to come
							to the house, he used to come to the entrance of the gate, where she
							would meet and walk abroad with him— And when she went from the house to
							be married to him, he had prevailed upon his brother Thomas, then at the
							adjoining Columbian College, to meet her at our gate, and escort her to
							the tavern in the City, where they were married.— My wife then let
							Thomas Hellen <pb n="402" type="ms"/>know that she did not wish to see
							him any more— Johnson had long before ceased coming to the house— In all
							this I had taken no one step; and never had one word of conversation
							either with Johnson or with Thomas, or with the chambermaid, on the
							subject.— With the consent and approbation of <persRef ref="cook-thomas"
								>T. Cook</persRef>, the former Guardian of Thomas J. Hellen, I had
							sent him to the Academy at Exeter, New Hampshire to be fitted for the
							University at Cambridge— Then to Cambridge where he was admitted and was
							two years on the list of Students— I paid his bills at Exeter and
							afterwards at Cambridge in advance. While M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cook was living he repaid me from time to time— He died in 1826. The
							year that Thomas entered at Cambridge— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frye then became his Guardian— My Son <persRef key="adams-george"
								>George</persRef>, from my funds paid his Bills regularly for two
							years— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye made me two payments on
							account, without settlement— I had given Thomas the most anxious and
							earnest advice and exhortations to industry and frugality— At the end of
							two years I found he had been idle, dissolute and extravagant— He had
							been sent away from the College to a Clergyman in the Country for six
							Months— I advised M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye to take him away
							from Cambridge, and place him where there might be a chance of saving
							him from ruin— It was necessary that he should complete his term at the
							Clergyman’s and obtain readmission at Cambridge; to obtain such
							discharge there as would enable him to enter another College—all this
							was done—he came from Cambridge in Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							1828. my Son George settled and paid all his bills, and furnished him
							with money to come here. There was a balance of near one thousand
							dollars, due me for these payments of which last Spring I furnished the
							Account to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye, all supported by
							vouchers— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye wishing time to collect
							funds, I left the time of payment at his convenience— But now Thomas J.
							Hellen having become of age, and calling for Settlement with
							him—instigated by his brother Johnson asks M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Frye, not to pay the balance to me, but to leave it to him
							for further investigation— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye says that
							as long ago as last December, he spoke to Johnson of this balance due to
							me, who said, “let him get it as he can”— because Thomas had been
							shamefully treated at my house. Which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frye says he understood Johnson meant I should be cheated out of my
							money, because he thought I could not recover it at Law. Afterwards M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye exhibited the account and vouchers to
							Thomas, who acknowledged them to be correct and just; but said he would
							pay me himself— Johnson too changed his tone, from let him get it as he
							can; to saying that Thomas would pay it himself— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Frye enquired if I was willing to take Thomas himself for my
							debtor— I told him no— If Thomas wanted of me any explanation of any one
							item in the account; I was ready and willing to give it to himself. But
							my demand was against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye as guardian;
							and if driven to my action to recover it, I supposed it would be against
							him— He said if there was an action, and it should be brought to trial,
							the reputation of the two young men, and especially of Johnson would be
							utterly ruined— I said that was their own concern; they had both
							forfeited all claim to regard or tenderness from me— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye said he wished to <pb n="403"
								type="ms"/>think further of the matter; and perhaps to take legal
							advice what he should do. He believed he should pay me the money; make
							his charge; and take the consequences. He asked my advice, which I
							declined giving him, having a personal interest in the question. He said
							he would see me again next week. This Evening <persRef
								ref="spencer-ambrose">Judge Spencer</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="mallary-rollin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mallary</persRef> of the House of Representatives called on me, and
							we had conversation concerning the Letter which I wrote to Mallary in
							February 1821. relating to the expenses of the Commissions under the
							Treaty of Ghent— Judge Spencer said he would come and take my answers to
							the Interrogatories in the case of <persRef ref="porter-peter">General
								P. B. Porter</persRef> vs the United States, on Monday morning at
							ten O’Clock— <persRef ref="silsbee-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Silsbee</persRef>, with <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Devereux</persRef> of Salem, paid me
							an Evening visit. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Devereux enquired after
								<persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								T. B. Johnson</persRef>, and said he had been cotemporary with him
							at Harvard University— The day was thus absorbed.</p>

							declamation was eloquent: it requires not a long life of observation to
							see by experience that the fashion of this World passeth away:— After
							the Service <persRef ref="barber-noyes">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Neal</persRef>, from Mark 16.15 [“]And he said unto them, Go ye into

							shall be damned.” with which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Neal desired
							his hearers to compare Matthew 28.19.20. and Luke 24.47— This he said
							was the Commission of Christian Ministers— It was to go into all the
							world; and to preach the Gospel to every human being—and that this was
							not a temporary commission, granted only to the Apostles, but permanent
							for all ages, was expressly declared in Matthew 28.20. in which Christ
							says, “and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.” It
							was also a Charity Sermon to be followed by a Collection, for the
							Presbyterian foreign missionaries—but it was not taken at the Church—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Neal said he should call upon
							individuals for contribution at their houses— <persRef

								Adams</persRef> went with me to Church, morning and Evening. I

							have written five. 1. On the War between Russia and Persia. 2. Russia
							and Turkey—Negotiations immediately before the War. 3. Campaign of 1828.
							4. Campaign of 1829. 5. Greece— I have been obliged to write in great
							haste, and with a plentiful lack of materials.— The whole work makes 130
							pages, and has kept me overburdened with occupation from New-year’s day
							to this time. I have sent the Manuscript, four sheets at a time, to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Blunt, to be sent back to me with a copy,
							for a final and general revisal of the whole— To the last chapter I have
							allowed two additional pages— But as he was urged by his printer for
							publication, before I could finish, I have consented to send him the
							manuscript for the Press, with a very slight revisal, and altogether in
							an unfinished state— I sent this Evening to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Blunt, the fifth portion of manuscript prepared for the

						<p><persRef ref="spencer-ambrose">Judge Spencer</persRef> came at ten
							O’Clock this morning with a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Beekman</persRef> of New-York, and took my answers to
							the Interrogatories in the case of <persRef ref="porter-peter">Peter B.
								Porter</persRef> vs the United States in the District Court for the
							Northern District of New-York— Judge Spencer administered the Oath and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beekman took down my answers in
							writing. There was no person that appeared on the part of the United
							States— I enquired whether any Person had been notified— It appeared
							there had not been. The interrogatories were all specific except the
							last; which enquired if I knew any thing further on the subject which
							would be to the advantage of the Plaintiff; to which I answered that I
							had heard much, concerning the question, but could say nothing that I
							knew would be either to the advantage or disadvantage of the Plaintiff.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beekman said he would write the
							answers over again before he would call upon me to subscribe them— While
							the Judge was taking my answers he was continually digressing upon
							Politics— He said he was opposed to the Bill now before the House of
							Representatives for increasing the number of the Judges of the Supreme
							Court of the United States; and I said I was against it too—considering
							upon whom the appointments would probably fall. He asked me also my
							opinions upon the Indian question— I told him that as to a primitive
							abstract right of Soil, owned by the Indians when the European Settlers
							first came here; I did not believe in any such right; and thought it
							probable his opinion differed in that respect from mine— As I knew those
							of <persRef ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice Marshall</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="story-joseph">judge Story</persRef> did— But as to the
							Treaties and the Acts of Congress I supposed our opinion would concur—
							He said he should be glad to have further conversation with me on the
							subject, and I told him I should be happy to see him any Evening when he
							should be at leisure. <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Huntt</persRef> was here and I consulted him upon my
							obstinate and troublesome Catarrh; for which he gave me some advice—
								<persRef ref="niederstetter-ludwig">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Niederstetter</persRef>, Charge d’Affaires from Prussia visited me;
							recently from Philadelphia— He and <persRef ref="u">his wife</persRef>,
							a daughter of the <persRef ref="huygens-bangeman">Chevalier
								Huygens</persRef>, are both much out of health, and are going to
							Europe next Summer. <persRef ref="sparks-jared">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Sparkes</persRef> was here; lately arrived from Boston.
							He has yet published only three Volumes of the Diplomatic Correspondence
							in the Revolutionary War— There will be twelve Volumes in all and they
							will come only to the Peace of 1783—leaving then a Chasm till the
							adoption of the Constitution of the United States— But <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren</persRef> he says has no relish for these publications, and
							thinks none of them worth their cost. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Sparkes said he had settled with my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> the Letters from <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father’s</persRef> Letter books, which should be selected to be
							included in his publication— He made some enquiries about <persRef
								ref="dumas-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dumas</persRef>,
							concerning whom I gave him much information, and referred him to the
							first and second Volumes of <persRef ref="dennie-joseph"
								>Dennie’s</persRef> Port-Folio for much of his Correspondence. I
							told him that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dumas’s daughter after his
							death had given me three Folio Volumes, containing that Correspondence,
							which I lent to Dennie— He published <pb n="405" type="ms"/>almost all
							the Letters, but never returned me the manuscript Books. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Sparkes told me he had sold the
							North-American Review to <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H.
								Everett</persRef>. <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward
								Everett</persRef> was here this Evening, and told me that his
							brother had given 15000 dollars for three fourths of the Review; one
							fourth being the property of the publishers. He said his brother had
							written him to ask him, to write for the July Number of the Review, an
							Article on the debate still pending in the Senate upon <persRef
								ref="foot-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Foot’s</persRef>
							Resolution concerning the Public Lands— He said he wished I would
							undertake it— I told him I thought I could not, and one principal
							difficulty with me was about whether the Article that I should write,
							would suit the interest of the work— He spoke also of the debate which
							will soon take place on the Indian question, and of the unconstitutional
							acts of the Legislatures of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, assuming
							Jurisdiction over the Indians within their Limits. Upon which I said
							there was nothing left for the minority to do but to record the exposure
							of perfidy and tyranny of which the Indians are to be made the victims,
							and to leave the punishment of it to Heaven.</p>

								M’Vickar</persRef> is a Professor at the Columbia College in the
							City of New-York, and reminded me that he had seen me at the Cambridge
							Commencement the Summer before last— He is here on a visit and about
							returning to New-York— <persRef ref="lockwood-ransom">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lockwood</persRef> is of New Jersey;
							and has a contract with the Navy Department to furnish a supply of
							Live-Oak—but has got entangled with others so that he cannot fulfil his
							contract and now wants a modification of it which he cannot obtain.
							Though an entire Stranger to me, he came to ask my advice; told me his
							Story, and exhibited to me a number of papers relating to it— I advised
							him to endeavour to dispose of his Live-Oaks to Merchants in New-York or
							Philadelphia, who might want it for Ship-building— He thanked me for my
							advice, as a man, so much in need of it, as to snatch at any that is
							offered to him— I sent to <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph
								Blunt</persRef>, the sixth Quire of my Manuscript revised for the
							press, and received from him the copy of the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> with a half sheet of the first, printed, with many errors
							of the Press— The fourth Book of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero’s</persRef> Epistles consists of fifteen Letters—five to
								<persRef ref="sulpicius-servius">Servius Sulpicius</persRef>, and
							two from him—four to <persRef ref="marcellus-marcus">Marcus
								Marcellus</persRef> and one from him— One to <persRef
								ref="figulus-publius">Nigidius Figulus</persRef> and two to <persRef
								ref="plancius-cneius">Cneius Plancius</persRef>— All written while
								<persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef> was in possession of
							absolute Power— Servius Sulpicius had consented to serve by the
							appointment of Caesar, as Prefect in Achaia, which Cicero much approves;
							one of the Letters from <persRef ref="rufus-servius">Servius</persRef>,
							is the famous consolation to Cicero upon the death of <persRef
								ref="tullia">his daughter</persRef>. The other is the account of
							Marcus Marcellus’s being murdered at Athens by a man named <persRef
								ref="chilo-magius">Magius Chilo</persRef>, who immediately
							afterwards slew himself. The two Letters from Servius Sulpicius are
							extremely well written; and so is that from Marcellus. The first four
							Letters to Sulpicius are deeply interesting—confidential effusions from
							friend to friend—disclosures of the temper and feelings of both, in the
							prostration of public Liberty, by the victories of Caesar in the civil
							Wars— The fourth Letter especially in which Cicero declares his
							approbation of the acceptance by Sulpicius of the Office of Prefect in
							Achaia, and relates the proceedings in the Senate for the recall of
							Marcellus from exile, and his own Speech of thanks to Caesar at that
							time is admirable— The Letters to Marcellus are equally instructive and
							affecting— Throughout the whole of this correspondence, the Sentiment of
							Cicero is uniform, that if the Pompeian party had been victorious, it
							would have ended in a tyranny more cruel and oppressive than that of
							Caesar. He considers the first triumvirate of <persRef ref="pompey"
								>Pompey</persRef>, <persRef ref="crassus-marcus">Crassus</persRef>
							and Caesar the cause of all the subsequent errors and calamities; and
							although from a Sense of obligation to Pompey he followed his fortunes
							in the civil War, he always considered Pompeys desertion of him when
							persecuted by <persRef ref="clodius-publius">P. Clodius</persRef>, as
							the first deadly wound to the Republic, and he disapproved of the whole
							course of Pompey, in the civil War.</p>

							the former of whom has resided these ten years at Wilmington in
							Delaware— The latter has just arrived from England; a farmer from
							Bedfordshire. He comes with the design of purchasing a farm, and
							settling in this Country—somewhat alarmed at the prospect of troublous
							times in England— Especially at the Distress of which there is again
							great complaint— I advised him if he should come here to be careful and
							fix himself in a healthy spot— He spoke of Chester County, Pennsylvania,
							and of the Western part of the State of New-York; but without saying
							that he had been disappointed in the result of his enquiries here, he
							justified the conclusion that he was so. He complained of the continual
							increase of the Poor rates in England; but said he was a tenant both of
							the <persRef ref="russell-francis2">Marquis of Tavistock</persRef>, and
							of <persRef ref="whitbread-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitbread</persRef>, who were the greatest landholders in
							Bedfordshire— And that they both rented their Estates so favourably to
							their Tenants, that their farms were easily made profitable— He said
							that Lord Tavistock gave an annual premium of fifty guineas for the best
							cultivated farm in the County; and that last year he had received it— I
							took them, at least Inskip—to be Quakers— They said they came to see me,
							merely for curiosity.— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Neal</persRef> and <persRef ref="campbell-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell</persRef> came together— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Neal without directly soliciting a
							contribution, explained to me the object of the fund for which he
							preached last Sunday— It was for the education of indigent young men for
							the ministry— There were now he said about one hundred, who received aid
							to complete their education: but the demand was much greater than the
							supply; not more than 100 dollars a year was allowed to any one of their
							Students, and there were now in the Southern and Western States upwards
							of four hundred churches vacant for want of Ministers. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell, that I had heard he was going to
							Albany: he said it was uncertain— That he should prefer remaining
							here—but he could not live in fire— I said I believed the subject which
							had been so troublesome to him would subside, and that he would be
							suffered hereafter to live in Peace. He said he believed so himself, in
							consequence of the investigation now going on in the Senate— I asked
							him, if the questions relating to <persRef ref="timberlake-john"
								>Timberlake’s</persRef> accounts and to <persRef ref="eaton-john"
								>Eaton’s</persRef> connection with them, formed any part of the
							Subject in which he had been involved. He said only indirectly; as he
							had received information of the facts after his communications had
							become subjects of enquiry— I asked him who had been present at the
							Cabinet Meeting before which he had been summoned— He said all the
							members of the Administration, excepting M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Eaton himself— And <persRef ref="lewis-william3">Major Lewis</persRef>
							had been there in his behalf. He said that he had not been permitted
							there to justify himself— That the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President</persRef> had repeatedly with great violence refused to
							hear him— That he had asked only for the opportunity of producing the
							proofs of what he had asserted; and that <persRef ref="ingham-samuel"

								ref="branch-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Branch</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="berrien-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>Rainy and Stormy Night and Morning. With an obstinate and perhaps
							incurable Catarrh upon the lungs I took this morning my usual walk round
							the Centre of the Capitol Square before Sun-rise, with a cold rain
							beating over my head, nearly all the time— It afterwards held up and
							towards Night cleared up with a Northwestern gale. I received from
								<persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph Blunt</persRef> the original of
							my Manuscript p 97–112 upon the Russian and Turkish War, with two
							half-sheets of Letter Press— These I examined: wrote to him and enclosed
							his copy of the last part of my chapter on the campaign of 1829— My
							original Manuscript Chapter on Greece; which closes my work, and which
							he is to use without having a copy made, and sending him a list of the
							public documents which should be printed in the part of the Volume
							devoted to such papers. I have thus completed my part of this
							undertaking which has occupied nearly three Months of my time— It is my
							desire to employ the time yet indulged to me in this world well. In this
							case, I have written from two motives— First to perform a friendly
							Office to a young man, who has been a warm friend, and whom I have not
							been able in any other manner effectually to serve— Secondly to
							contribute informing correct opinions in this Country upon a subject of
							great political importance— Thirdly to operate if possible upon opinions
							in Europe, and especially upon the <persRef ref="nicholas-i">Emperor of
								Russia</persRef>— The Success on each of these points is now under
							other controul— The work may excite little or no public attention—in
							which event all my purposes will fail— It will be seed sown on the
							wayside, scattered to the winds and of no use to any one: and as this
							will in all probability be its fortune, I have prepared my mind for that
							result, and waiting for suggestion from abroad of some other topic for
							experiment. I now read the fifth Book of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero’s</persRef> Epistles ad Diversos—21. Letters to an from
							various persons— The first is from <persRef ref="metellusceler-quintus"
								>Metellus Celer</persRef> Proconsul in Gaul, to him; an angry and
							threatening Letter, complaining that Cicero had attacked his brother
								<persRef ref="metellusnepos-quintus">Metellus Nepos</persRef> in the
							Senate. Cicero’s answer is at once spirited and conciliatory. There is a
							subsequent friendly Letter from Metellus Nepos to Cicero, and one from
							Cicero to him— One from Cicero to <persRef ref="hybrida-gaius">Caius
								Antonius</persRef> who had been his Colleague as Consul— Two to
								<persRef ref="sextius-publius">Publius Sextius</persRef>—one to
								<persRef ref="pompeius-gnaeus">Cn Pompey</persRef>; one to <persRef
								ref="crassus-lucius">Licinius Crassus</persRef>— Two from <persRef
								ref="vatinius-publius">Publius Vatinius</persRef> to Cicero; and one
							from Cicero to him— Three to <persRef ref="lucceius-lucius"
								>Lucceius</persRef>, and one from him— These are excellent; and the
							first to Lucceius, intreating him to write a panegyrical History of
							Cicero’s Consulate, he himself in a Letter to <persRef
								ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef> 4.6 calls valde bellam— One to
								<persRef ref="titius">Titius</persRef>, consolotary for the loss of
							children; one to <persRef ref="gallus-titus">Fadius</persRef> and three
							to <persRef ref="rufus-l">Mescinius Rufus</persRef>— Of most of these
							persons I can find no information excepting what appears in these
							Letters to and from them— A single Letter from Cicero, has been to some
							of them, the passport to the memory of ages. The Letter to Lucceius is
							elaborately written—and has been abundantly ridiculed for the broad and
							unqualified request that in the historical narrative, he would praise
							Cicero, even at the expence of truth— It was however to no purpose— It
							does not appear that Lucceius ever wrote the history, and the only
							specimen of his writing now extant, is one Letter to Cicero in this
							Book— That is written in a style, rather studied than familiar; and more
							historical than epistolary.</p>

							the event which will restore him to private life— <persRef
								ref="bell-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef> the
							Senator from New Hampshire passed two hours with me— He was enquiring
							who had been the former Comptrollers of the Treasury— He entertains a
							feeble hope that some of the most profligate publishers of scurrilous
							newspapers now in nomination before the Senate for offices will be
							rejected: but he will be disappointed— He says he has a full conviction
							that from the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March 1789. to the
								4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March 1829. in forty years the
							whole number of base and worthless characters that obtained access to
							the public offices, did not equal that which has got into them within
							the course of the last year— He is apprehensive that the enquiry into
							the transactions of <persRef ref="timberlake-john">Timberlake</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="eaton-john">Eaton</persRef> will be suppressed. Upon a
							motion in the Committee this morning, to ask authority from the Senate
							to send for persons and papers, the votes were two and two—the fifth
							number <persRef ref="tazewell-littleton">Tazewell</persRef> being
							absent—purposely as he supposes— The movements upon these nominations
							pending in the Senate, are intimately connected with a controversy
							between the Telegraph, <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun’s</persRef>

								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> is or is not a Candidate for
							re-election as President—the Courier insisting that he is; and the

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren has got the Start of Calhoun in
							the merit of convincing General Jackson that the Salvation of the
							Country depends upon his re-election. This establishes the ascendency of
							Van-Buren in the Cabinet, and reduces Calhoun to the alternative of
							joining in the shout of hurra for Jackson’s re-election; or of being
							counted in opposition. Tun contra Caesaris nutum? the first consequence
							is the suppression of all opposition to the nominations in the

							Eaton and Timberlake— <persRef ref="willey-calvin">M<hi

						<p>Heard this morning <persRef ref="robertson-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Robinson</persRef>, a Missionary of the Episcopal Church
							at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s— His text was from 1.
							Corinthians 1.22. The Greeks seek after Wisdom— His discourse was a mere
							narrative of his own visit to Greece, as a Missionary from the board of
							Missions of the Episcopal Church in the United States upon which he
							embarked 31. Dec<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1828—and after visiting
							several of the Ionian Islands he passed over into the Morea, whence
							within a few weeks <pb n="410" type="ms"/>he returned to this Country;
							and is going out again the next Autumn as a permanent Missionary from
							the same association— His account of the desolation of the Country by
							the recent War was affecting— It would seem as if within the last seven
							years, one half the population had perished— The condition of the
							surviving inhabitants is wretched beyond description; and yet their
							passion to obtain Education, and to seek after wisdom is almost
							incredible— Numerous anecdotes which he told tended all to illustrate
							this anxious desire for knowledge— They have now Lancaster Schools in
							almost every City, and they long for Bibles, Testaments and Religious
							Tracts. He says the Americans are great favourites all over Greece: but
							when he was there it was not so with the natives of Great-Britain— This
							remark was not acceptable to <persRef ref="vaughan-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="bankhead-charles;bankhead-maria">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bankhead</persRef>, who were
							sitting in a pew almost under the preacher— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Robinson said it was not thought expedient to take up a

							whosoever was disposed to contribute was requested to send his bounty to
								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef>— After Church I had an hour’s visit from <persRef
								ref="taylor-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. W.
								Taylor</persRef>; who told me he had a long conversation with
								<persRef ref="mclean-john2">Judge M’lean</persRef>; who has
							certainly made up his mind neither to seek nor to decline the Office of
							President of the United States— He assured M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Taylor, with the most positive dogmatism, that <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> will not be a candidate for
							re-election; And that if he should be he cannot be re-elected— That
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> will be the nullification candidate; but that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lean has no intention of serving as Vice
							President under M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun. I told Taylor I
							had no confidence in any thing M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean
							says—and I gave him my reasons for this trust—which were a constant
							system of duplicity pursued by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean
							throughout the last Administration, and particularly in his employment,
							and persevering patronage of <persRef ref="lee-henry3">Henry
								Lee</persRef>— That Jackson will be a Candidate for re-election if
							when the time of election comes, he has a fair prospect of success I do
							not doubt— That his personal popularity founded solely upon the battle
							of New-Orleans, will carry him through the next election as it did
							through the last, is altogether probable— The Vices of his
							administration are not such as affect the popular feeling— He will lose
							none of his popularity unless he should do something to raise a blister
							upon public sentiment, and of that there is no present prospect— If he
							lives therefore; and nothing external should happen to rouse new
							parties, he may be re-elected not only once, but twice or thrice— And
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean will make no head against him—
							Taylor said he thought M’lean would be presented as the anti-masonic
							Candidate at the next Election—which may be—M’lean said that if Jackson
							should be a Candidate, any Man would be elected against him except
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>— <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel;frye-carolina">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Frye</persRef>, with their Son <persRef ref="frye-thomas"
								>Thomas</persRef> dined with us, and we heard in the Evening
								<persRef ref="campbell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Campbell</persRef> from Matthew 25–21–[“]His lord said unto him,
							Well done, thou good and faithful Servant: thou hast been faithful over
							a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into
							the joy of thy lord.” The parable of the Talents. Nothing very

							expected some leisure; but the day was wholly absorbed by company.

							to-morrow— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bronson</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Shaw</persRef> are two old Revolutionary Soldiers, now
							residing in the Western part of the State of New-York, one originally
							from Connecticut and the other from Massachusetts— They are now here in
							pursuit of Pensions, and told me they came to see me for what I had
							been, and that when they returned home they might tell their neighbours
							they had seen me— I rode on horseback, an hour before dinner, and was
							over wearied so as per force to cease from writing in the Evening. My
							catarrhal cough hangs upon me with ominous pertinacity, and the
							oppression upon the lungs, weighs heavily upon the Spirits— The 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> book of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero’s</persRef> Epistles is almost entirely composed of Letters
							to persons, who had been engaged in the civil War on the side of
								<persRef ref="pompey">Pompey</persRef> and were in banishment acting
							by their friends to obtain restitution, or permission to return to Rome.
							Among these are <persRef ref="torquatus-lucius">Torquatus</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="caecina-aulus">Caecina</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="trebianus">Trebianus</persRef>, <persRef ref="balbus-titus"
								>Ampius</persRef>, <persRef ref="ligarius-quintus"
								>Ligarius</persRef>, <persRef ref="lepta">Lepta</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="toranius">Toranius</persRef> and <persRef ref="domitius"
								>Domitius</persRef>— There are many observations upon the origin of
							the War and the characters of <persRef ref="caesar-julius"
								>Caesar</persRef> and Pompey— Cicero himself was always kindly
							treated by Caesar—and had very great influence over his principal
							partizans— There were no proscriptions—no robberies of private property—
							In these Letters Cicero speaks with deference and respect, of Caesar— It
							was only to more intimate friends that he opened his bosom, in the
							bitterness of his Soul— Caecina had published a book against Caesar, and
							that was the greatest obstacle to his re-instatement. There is a very
							well written Letter from Caecina, urging Cicero to exert his influence
							for him, and pleading his own cause. In one of Cicero’s Letters to him
							he says Pompey was the greatest enemy to his own cause for which he had
							more passion that preparation— And herein says he, I admire the
							generosity, the Justice, the wisdom of Caesar. He never speaks of
							Pompey, but in the most respectful terms—though he has treated his
							person very harshly— These are deeds of War and victory—not Caesar’s—
							How handsomely has he treated me— He has made <persRef ref="cassius"
								>Cassius</persRef> his Lieutenant— <persRef ref="brutus-decimus"
								>Brutus</persRef> prefect of Gaul— <persRef ref="sulpicius-servius"
									>Sulpicius</persRef> of Greece—and restored <persRef ref="marcellus-marcus">Marcellus</persRef>, though most
							incensed against him, in the most honourable manner. He concludes
							however some what ambiguously by saying that surely good men, good
							citizens, of unsullied reputation, cannot fail of being restored, while
							so many convicted of infamous crimes, had been permitted to return—
							Better satire than Logic.</p>

						<p><persRef ref="harrison-william">General Harrison</persRef> called upon me
							this morning to take leave; intending to depart to-morrow to return
							home— He sent me a second copy of a pamphlet that he has published here
							respecting some unpleasant incidents which occurred shortly before he
							left the Republic of Colombia— That Government appears to be in a
							convulsive state between Military Despotism, and a Republican
							Constitution— Their Revolution was popular, and formed upon principle
								<pb n="412" type="ms"/>adopted from the model of this Country. Their
							objects were Liberty, and Independence— But Independence could be
							secured only by War— War required Military Chieftains, and Victories,
							and then the most successful General became the Liberator— The Nation
							which houses its emancipation to a Liberator, must have him for their
							Governor; but there will be a great mass of opposition to his
							Government— Intrigues, Cabals, Conspiracies follow of course; and every
							one of these from which he escapes—or which he overcomes, hurries him on
							a step further to absolute Power— This is the State of the Republic of
							Colombia: liberated from Spanish tyranny, struggling for a Constitution;
							but ruled by a <persRef ref="bolivar-simon">military Dictator</persRef>,
							with an army at his heels— A Tyranny with the forms of freedom— Such a
							Government is jealous and suspicious: full of spies; eager to catch
							every incautious word of those whom it dreads; and turns every movement
							of a suspected person into Treason— Harrison arrived in that Country as
							Minister from the United States— He soon found himself an object of
							jealous observation. Inattentive to the admonitions of time and place he
							indulged himself in panegyrics upon the freedom of speech and action
							enjoyed in the United States. He was immediately marked as an enemy to
							the Government of Bolivar. From that moment every step he took was
							watched—every word he said was caught, scrutinized and perverted— He was
							made accountable for the loose talk of <persRef ref="harrison-carter"
								>his Son</persRef>, and of his <persRef ref="tayloe-edward-thornton"
								>Secretary of Legation</persRef>, and soon signalized as a
							conspirator against the Liberator— He visited the <persRef
								ref="porter-robert">British Consul</persRef> and they were both
							charged with plotting projects of Assassination— He dined with a friend,
							and that friend was cast into a dungeon— His own life was not safe, and
							he was at last fortunate in getting safe out of the Country— After he
							had taken leave of the Government there, and was no longer Minister of
							the United States, he wrote a Letter to Bolivar, to dissuade him from
							making himself a king or dictator; which he has now published in his
							pamphlet, and which must have nettled the Liberator beyond measure— He
							says that <persRef ref="vaughan-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Vaughan</persRef>, the British Minister here, has a copy of a Letter
							from Bolivar to <persRef ref="gordon-george">Lord Aberdeen</persRef>,
							complaining that the greatest obstacle to the settlement of Affairs in
							Colombia, is the accursed Government of the United States— But I doubt
							this— <persRef ref="todson-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Todsen</persRef> called, but I was not ready for him and requested
							him to call again to morrow. <persRef ref="robertson-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Robertson</persRef> the Missionary to
							Greece, and <persRef ref="gurley-r">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gurley</persRef> were here— I made, many enquiries respecting the
							condition of the People of Greece, which he answered— He said he was
							endeavouring to get a Meeting of persons who favoured the Cause of the
							Greeks and that <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Webster</persRef> had promised his Assistance. I told
							him that I attended no public meetings, and could not make an exception
							in this case, but that I wished well to the cause, and success to his
								<pb n="413" type="ms"/>exertions— The immediate object of the
							contributions which he solicits is the Establishment of a printing
							Press, to publish books of education— <persRef ref="frye-carolina">M<hi

								Todsen</persRef> came again for the certificate which I had
							promised, and which I now gave him— A person brought me a copy of the
							Abridgement of <persRef ref="webster-noah">Webster’s</persRef>
							Dictionary for which I had subscribed— Thunder, Lightning and Rain,
							great part of the day— Received a Letter from my Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> which I answered— Labouring
							under oppression upon the lungs, what can I write that should be
							remembered— The seventh Book of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero’s</persRef> familiar Epistles begins with Letters to
								<persRef ref="marius-marcus">Marcus Marius</persRef>—four, written
							at distant periods of time— The first giving an account of games,
							exhibited by <persRef ref="pompey">Pompey</persRef> in his second
							Consulate— A fashion of treating the Populace, which Cicero disapproves—
							The third written after <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar’s</persRef>
							African War, gives a full exposition of Cicero’s course of conduct
							during the civil War, and particularly for his withdrawing from the
							Pompeian party after the battle of Pharsalia. The 5<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> is a letter to Caesar while he was
							commanding in Gaul, recommending to him <persRef ref="testa-caius">Caius
								Trebatius Testa</persRef>, a lawyer—from 6 to 22 inclusive the
							Letters are to Trebatius himself written with great familiarity and full
							of jokes— I remember these Letters more than the others in general, from
							the impression of a former reading about 35 years since— Yet there is
							more of levity in them than in any of the others. Trebatius seems to
							have been a friend for whom Cicero had more kindness than Respect. He
							gives him advice in a tone of superiority and occasionally laughs at him
							freely. Yet at the most trying period of his life, at Rhegium when on
							his intended way to Athens after the Death of Caesar, he wrote his
							Topics; addressed to this same Trebatius, and sent them to him with the
								19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Letter of this Book— <persRef
								ref="ernesti-johann">Ernesti’s</persRef> Clavis says that Trebatius
							was a Tribune of the People in the year of the City 706. the year after
							the Battle of Pharsalia—and refers to <persRef ref="menage-gilles"
								>Menage</persRef> for some account of him— There are then 4 Letters
							to <persRef ref="gallus-marcus">Fabius Gallus</persRef>, and one to
							another <persRef ref="u">Gallus</persRef>—one of the former is about the
							purchase of some Statues, and another complaining that he had been made
							sick by a supper upon greens— Three Letters to <persRef ref="curius"
								>Curius</persRef>, and one from Curius to Cicero— The 30<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> is a burst of indignant derision at
							Caesar’s Consul <persRef ref="caninius-rebilus">Caninius</persRef>,
							appointed for a single day— The last two Letters of the Book are to
								<persRef ref="publius-volumnius">Volumnius</persRef>, one from
							Silicia—the other inviting him to come and take part with Cicero in
							exercises of declamation, to which he devotes his time, with <persRef
								ref="hirtius-aulus">Hirtius</persRef>, <persRef ref="cassius"
								>Cassius</persRef> and <persRef ref="dolabella-publius"
								>Dolabella</persRef>—and which he says he will continue, if it shall
							please Caesar—</p>
