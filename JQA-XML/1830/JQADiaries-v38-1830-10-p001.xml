						<p>The volume begins with Thanksgiving to almighty God, for all the
							blessings I enjoy, and in a special manner, for the prospect of recovery
							of my infant Granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
								>Mary-Louisa</persRef>, the eldest child of my Son <persRef
								key="adams-john2">John</persRef>— The alarming symptoms of her
							disease have abated; and <persRef ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Holbrook</persRef>, who was here this
							morning thought it would not be necessary for him to repeat again his
							visit to prescribe for her— I worked two hours in the garden Nursery;
							planting a row of Shellbark nuts from my tree in the garden, the nut of
							which I planted in October 1804— With them I now planted, alternate
							White and Chesnut Oak Acorns; and in another line, about half as deep,
							Peach Stones, Stranger berries, Ashpods, wild cherries, Pears whole
							seeds and Cores— My only plantation last year was a row of Apple-seeds,
							which had come up confusedly amidst the weeds when I arrived here early
							last June. I plucked up one of them by mistake for a weed and then put
							it into the ground again on the other side of the alley, on the side of
							a Cornhill. Some days after <persRef ref="farrar-salmon">S.
								Farrar</persRef> took up others of the trees which had come up in a
							cluster, and replaced them at distances of about 6. inches from each
							other— There were sixteen in all— I mark their growth in the Season— Of
							three remaining where the seed was planted, one is twelve, one ten, and
							one eight inches high. Of those transplanted none are more than three
							inches high some not more than two— Only two of the whole number have
							died—scorched by the Sun. I expect that none but perhaps the three
							tallest will survive the Winter; and I take the growth of the tallest,
							as the average growth of an apple-tree from the seed, it its first
							Summer, one foot— <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="whitney-peter">P. Whitney</persRef> this morning from
							John 16.14. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall

							farm—to shew him where I propose to set out my Orchard— <persRef
								ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> was gone to Boston. We

								ref="greenleaf-john;greenleaf-lucy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> John Greenleaf</persRef> called
							to see us in the Evening. Charles went to <persRef key="adams-thomas">my
								brother’s</persRef>. I wrote by a furnace fire, and went to bed
							chill’d with cold, and suffering with the Lumbago— Finished reading
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> de Officiis—perhaps
							the most excellent of his works. perhaps the last of the works of his
							old age, and that which exhibits him in the most venerable and affecting
							aspect— At the last stage of life, driven from the Senate and the Forum
							so long the Scenes of his glory; silenced by the Triumph of <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef> over the Liberties of his
							Country, and at the eve of perishing a martyr to the cause of those
							Liberties seemingly for a moment restored, he avails himself of the last
							hours allowed him, of existence to compose and address to <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus2">his Son</persRef>, just arriving at the age of
							manhood, and pursuing his studies at Athens a general Treatise of
							morals, teaching him all the duties of human life— This system of ethics
							is imperfect, because not illuminated with the light of the gospel— But
							it is the most perfect then known— It connects itself with the questions
							concerning the boundaries of good and evil—and supposes that the
							determination of human action depends upon the will— All the Greek
							Philosophers founded their principles of Morals, upon the assumption
							that the rule of human conduct was a subject of deliberation: That man
							was formed to seek his own happiness, and <pb n="3" type="ms"/>to adapt
							his actions to the attainment of the greatest possible good: and Since
							all their discussions what was the Supreme Good; and their diverse
							conclusions, one fixing it in pleasure; one in virtue; and a third in
							living according to Nature— There was no system emanating from a
							Superior Power, in the form of command— The Epicurean theory, which made
							pleasure the Supreme Good, and which though admitting Gods, pro forma,
							pronounced them indifferent to all human Affairs, had under this state
							of things an immense advantage over all others. It was irresistibly
							fascinating, and buried all morals in the grave of sensuality— In every
							part of his philosophical works Cicero treats it with uncompromising
							severity—but it was nevertheless the prevailing philosophy at Rome—
							Hence also the decisive superiority of the Christian morality, over
							those of the Greek Philosophers— The duties of the Christian are
							prescribed to him by his maker— He has no preliminary question to
							settle, what is the Supreme good. Obedience to God, and good will to his
							fellow creatures compose all his obligations. And as these are enjoined
							upon him as commands, they have the sanction of a special revelation
							from Heaven— The age of Cicero preceded by so short a time the birth of
							Christ, that a comparison of his work with the Gospels, is curious to
							shew how far unaided human reason could advance in the school of
							morals—and where and to what ends a Revelation was necessary.</p>

						<p>I was chilled last Evening, by the ride to Mount Wollaston farm, and had
							in consequence of it a painful Night— <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his

							I planted 8 Gay Pear-seeds in Book-Box N. 3. and a Row of Office

							corner of the Cornhill patch— After dinner I walked to the Druid plain,
							and gathered perhaps two quarts of white Oak, and chesnut Oak Acorns—
							The ripeness of the first is already decaying: the second are now
							falling and ready to fall from their eyes— I find no others. This
							Evening I read 15 Sections of the Cato Major, de Senectute—a Treatise
							which has been familiar to me from my youth; and which in 1788 I partly
							translated. Addressed to Athens— The main speaker is <persRef

									>r</hi> Curtis</persRef> the Treasurer of the Congregational
							Society paid me a year’s interest due the first of this Month, upon
							notes to me, and to the Executors of <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father’s</persRef> Will— He spoke with some circumlocution of the
							nominations of me in the newspapers, to represent the Plymouth-District
							in the next Congress, and asked me if I would— I said it was <pb n="4"
								type="ms"/>first to be seen, whether the People of the District
							would invite me to represent them— I should not ask for their votes; and
							know nothing of their dispositions, except from what had appeared in the
							Newspapers. I wished them to act their pleasure. Whether I could
							represent them if they should elect me, might depend upon Circumstances,
							but if I should find that I could not, I would give them notice in
							Season to enable them to fix their choice upon another man, before the
							Meeting of the Congress. I planted a row of Gay Pear seeds—with
							Shellbarks, White Oak Acorns, Horse Chesnuts, Peach Stones and scattered
							wild Cherries— The Ninth and last Cornhill row. Besides my general
							experimental attempts to raise trees from the seed, I wish to ascertain,
							what seed will vegetate, and how far the fruit will be the same as that
							of the planted seed— I have therefore now taken much pains to mark with
							stakes and upon Stones the particular Seeds in each of the rows, so as
							to distinguish the various kinds of Oaks, Walnuts, Apples and Pears—
							Also whether planting the whole fruit, or the naked seed will be most
							successful— After dinner I walked to the Mount Wollaston farm; through
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> D.
								Greenleaf’s</persRef> ground in search of Black Oak Acorns, of which
							I found none— On one tree with the leaf of the Black-Oak I found four
							acorns ripening; resembling those of the Pin Oak—on the Northwest side
							of Mount Wollaston, upon the bleakest aspect are the stumps of two very
							large trees— I planted two Cap white Oak Acorns there, and scattered
							with them several Wild Cherries— <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus
								Spear</persRef> walked round the beach with me to the division line
							against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf— I finished the
							Dialogue de Senectute, and read 7 Sections of the <persRef ref="laelius-gaius">Laelius</persRef>, de Amicitia—
							The Argument of <persRef ref="cato-marcus">Cato</persRef> in behalf of
							Old Age is eloquent; but upon reperusing it as an old man I find it less
							satisfactory than it was when I read it at the age of twenty-one— Cato
							enumerates four causes for wretchedness in old age— First that it
							disqualifies for active business; secondly that it brings infirmities
							upon the body thirdly that it impairs all the pleasure; and fourthly
							that it is so near to Death— He answers to each of those objections
							successively; but the difficulty is stronger to the Active energies of
							men than the Solution— In the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section
							he repeats the line from <persRef ref="statiuscaecilius">Cecilius</persRef> Serit arbores quae alteri Seculo
							prosint which he had already quoted in the Books de Finibus.</p>

							some of my business long deferred—and was disappointed— The reading was

							in retirement as when overwhelmed with the duties of public service;
							from breakfast time for the remnant of the day I have no command of
							time—no—not for a Quarter of an hour— My two hours of exercise were
							occupied in the Nursery where I continued the trench already commenced
							from the central Apple-tree towards the fence; and planted white Oak
							Acorns in the trench leading to that Tree; with several Horse-Chesnuts—
							Planted also one whole Dwarf Apple and the Seeds of another; both of
							which I staked, and surrounded with Stones. Measured by pacing the
							length of the Garden; near about 200 feet— I had scarcely returned to
							the House when <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef>
							called and spent an hour with me. He enquired respecting the papers to
							be prepared for the Probate Office in the Execution of the my father’s

							M’lean at least fifty-five; and was left by her former husband in great

							no property and abundance of debts. This project has been at least two
							years fermenting; for her family connections numerous and respectable
							are all greatly averse to the connection— About this time last year they
							succeeded in breaking it off, but it is now on the point of

						<p><persRef key="adams-thomas">My brother</persRef> was here this Morning;
							while digging in my Nursery, a man named <persRef ref="joseph-levi">Levi
								Joseph</persRef> came to borrow money upon a mortgage of real Estate
							but I had none to lend. Dug a Trench from the central old Apple tree, to
							a rock like Stone, which I leave for a boundary— I planted 7 Garden
							Shellbarks in the Drupe between the Thimble berry vine, and the central
							Apple-tree with white Oak Acorns, Horse Chesnuts, wild Cherries, office
							Apple seeds and 3. Pear Cores. There came in extreme agitation a man
							named <persRef ref="strale-f">F. A. Strale</persRef>, who implored of me
							aid to extricate him from ruin, caused as he said by his own guilt and
							folly— He is a native of Sweden; served Some time as a soldier in our
							army,—changed his profession, and commenced a Calvinist preacher.— He
							settled at Allentown in Pennsylvania, and has been travelling to collect
							subscriptions to build a Church there— He had collected accordingly a
							considerable sum; but being at New-York, was led into temptation by an
							opportunity to purchase Lottery tickets— He had a large bundle of them
							which he held up before me, and with a look of desperation uttered a
							hearty curse upon them— Blinded by the delusion of hope, to make his
							fortune by the chances of the wheel, he gave for Lottery Tickets the
							money that he had received for building the Church, and now—he had sowed
							the wind, and reaped the whirlwind— He had applied to <persRef
								ref="wisner-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Wisner</persRef>, the Minister at Boston, without success, and was
							going to a Clergymen in this neighbourhood, to solicit relief but found
							he was at the point of death, so that it was impossible to speak to him
							on this subject— As he was passing by my house the thought had occurred
							to him that from consideration of mere humanity, I might be willing to
							step forward and extricate him the jaws of Ruin— He had an excellent
							<persRef ref="u">wife</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u;u">two children</persRef> who must be involved in it with him— He had a
							small property, sufficient to cover his delinquency, but was in Sweden
							in the hand of <persRef ref="u">his brother</persRef>; and if this transaction should become known
							his utter ruin would be inevitable, as it would blast his character, and
							disqualify him even for his profession as a preacher of the <pb n="6"
								type="ms"/>Gospel— His appearance was sincere and candid, and his
							distress very affecting— I told him I regretted it was not in my power
							to relieve him; and advised him not to give way to discouragement— To
							restore by drawing his property from Sweden, the funds which he had
							indiscreetly applied to other purposes than those for which he had
							obtained them, and to redeem the weakness of the past by firmness and
							fortitude at present. He seemed to be soothed by these observations, and
							left me with thanks for my kindness, and with a request that I would not
							divulge his communication to one, which I readily promised— I rode after
							dinner with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C Adams</persRef> who we

						<p><date>10. IV:15. </date>Sunday.</p>
						<p>From my rising hour till after Sunrise I passed reading and writing in
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> Study— After
							breakfast we returned to Quincy but did not reach home till it was too
							late to attend the morning service at Meeting— I went in the afternoon
							and heard <persRef ref="lamson-alvan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lamson</persRef> of Dedham, from Matthew 7.13. Enter ye in at the
							strait gate— In the evening I answered a letter from <persRef
								ref="miner-charles">Charles Miner</persRef>, Editor of a Newspaper
							at West Chester, Pennsylvania, called the village Record, and during the
							four years of the last Administration a member of the House of
							Representatives in Congress— A single Night passed in Boston, especially
							following a dinner of Company, discomposes the arrangements of my time,
							and the order of my occupations. The reading of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> yesterday and this morning was
							wholly suspended. The fragments, excepting the Somnium Scipionis, and
							the Timaeus are all so short, and so separated from the discourses
							whence they are quoted that their chief effect is to sharpen regret at
							the large portion of Cicero’s works which are lost.— Of the two
							Treatises de Senectute, and de Amicitia, the latter is most practically
							useful though the former is perhaps the most philosophical. There are
							consolations and comforts in Old Age— But we cannot listen with
							conviction to arguments that its infirmities are not evils— As to
							Friendship there are few examples of it in antiquity to be compared with
							that of the second <persRef ref="scipioafricanusminor">Scipio
								Africanus</persRef> and <persRef ref="laelius-gaius"
								>Laelius</persRef>, who is the chief Speaker in the Dialogue of
							Cicero— It is supposed to have happened a few days after the death of
							Scipio, when the two Sons in Law of Laelius were with him. <persRef
								ref="scaevolaaugur">Quintus Mucius Scaevola</persRef> the Augur, and
								<persRef ref="fannius-gaius">Caius Fannius</persRef>. They take the
							occasion, after remarking the ardent friendship of Lelius for Scipio, to
							inquire how he was affected by his death, and then, his Sentiments upon
							Friendship in general, which he gives.— Cicero says that when he assumed
							the toga of manhood by the advice of his father, he very much frequented
							this Augur Mucius Scevola; and after his death the <persRef
								ref="scaevola">Pontiff Scaevola</persRef>— That Mucius very often
							entertained him with narratives of the sayings in former times of his
							father in Law Laelius and particularly that one day, sitting in his
							hemicycle, on the occasion of a rupture followed by the most inveterate
							hostility between <persRef ref="sulpicius-publius">Publius
								Sulpicius</persRef> and <persRef ref="rufus-quintus">Quintus
								Pompeius</persRef> who until then, had been in the closest intimacy
							of friendship with each other, he had given a very particular account of
							the discourse upon Friendship, held so long before by Laelius, to his
							two Sons in law— And this discourse now reduced to writing by Cicero is
							the Treatise de Amicitia. He reminds <persRef ref="atticus-titus"
								>Atticus</persRef> that he had often urged him to write upon
							Friendship, and mentions his own partiality for the theme—observes the
							peculiar propriety of selecting Laelius to lay down the Laws of
							Friendship, as <persRef ref="cato-marcus">Cato</persRef> had been the
							most appropriate person to comment upon old age. He closes the
							introductory Address with an elegant and affectionate reference to the
							friendship between Atticus and himself, and asks his friend to discard
							him for the time from his thoughts, and imagine himself listening to
							Laelius, and adds that as the whole subject of the Dialogue is
							Friendship he hopes that Atticus while reading will recognize himself.

						<p>I rose this morning as usual at four, after a good Night’s rest and much
							refreshed. I had finished yesterday the fragments of <persRef

							with the translation of <persRef ref="plato">Plato’s</persRef>
							unintelligible <persRef ref="timaeusoflocri">Timaeus</persRef>— This
							morning I began the books de Republica, recently recovered though in a
							very imperfect state by <persRef ref="mai-angelo">Angelo May</persRef>,
							and published at Rome in 1822— There is internal evidence of its
							authenticity and probably one fourth part of the work—enough at least to
							make the mouth water for the rest— It begins by stating that the first
							34 pages of the manuscript are missing— It opens in the midst of a
							discussion by Cicero, upon the Question whether a wise man ought to take
							part in the Administration of public Affairs—of which he maintains the
							affirmative. He then undertakes to set forth a discourse of the second
								<persRef ref="scipioafricanusminor">Scipio Africanus</persRef>,
							which he says was related to him, and to <persRef ref="brutus-marcus"
								>Brutus</persRef>, then a youth, by <persRef ref="rufus-publius"
								>Publius Rutilius Rufus</persRef> at Smyrna. The occasion is said to
							have been during the Feriae Latinae, <persRef ref="tuditanus-gaius"
								>Tuditanus</persRef> and <persRef ref="aquilius-manius"
								>Aquilius</persRef> being Consuls, (year of Rome 625.[)] about 80
							years before the composition of the work. Scipio passes the festival
							days at his Gardens where he is visited by his familiar friends— First
							appears his Sister’s Son, <persRef ref="tubero-quintus">Quintus
								Tubero</persRef>— Then <persRef ref="philus-lucius">Lucius Furius

								ref="scaevolaaugur">Quintus Scaevola</persRef>; and last of all
								<persRef ref="manilius-marcus">Marcus Manilius</persRef>— The
							conversation is commenced by Tubero who enquires of Scipio what he
							thinks of the phenomenon said to have been recently observed, of a
							double Sun— Scipio transfers the question to Philus, between whom and
							Laelius some desultory dialogue occurs— The other personages take part
							in it—till after much variety of observation, Laelius calls upon Scipio,
							to speak of higher topics, and instead of attempting to account for two
							Suns—to explain, how in one Republic there have come to be two Senates
							and two Peoples, as there seemed to be by the dissensions consequent
							upon the tribunate and death of <persRef
								ref="gracchus-tiberius-sempronius">Tiberius Gracchus</persRef>— The
							proper subject of the work is thus introduced, and at the request of
							Laelius, seconded by the other interlocutors, Scipio discourses upon
							Forms of Government and Republics. This introduction occupies more than
							half of the first Book; and more than half of it is yet unrecovered. It
							amused and entertained me till <persRef ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Humphrey</persRef> called to finish

								Richardson</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Lincoln</persRef> called upon me this morning and

							at Halifax— Two Conventions had been called in the Newspapers; both to
							meet at Halifax; to fix upon a Candidate to represent the District of
							Plymouth in the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Congress— One Call was
							to the Republicans, and the other was to the National Republicans— The
							first met yesterday, and the second is to meet this day.— The
							Republicans I suppose, are those who in the former party divisions
							declined acting with the federalists— Their meeting was first appointed
							for to-morrow, but the day was then altered to yesterday—probably for
							the purpose of preceding the Meeting of this day— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Richardson observed that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lincoln had been present at the Meeting
							and would inform me of their proceedings. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lincoln said, that eleven towns had been represented in the Convention—
							The usual practice had been for the Republicans in each town, to send to
							the Convention as many members as the Town was authorised to send the
							Legislature of the State— And the agreement was that all the members
							should support the person selected by the majority— But yesterday the
							number of volunteer intruders exceeded that of the regular delegations
							from the Towns.— These intruders were <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Jackson</persRef> men; officers of the Customs houses,
							Post-masters, and Jackson Office-hunters; of whom there were ten from
							Middleborough—Six from Plymouth; and stragglers wherever they could be
							found— They first gave notice that they would not be bound by the vote
							of the Majority; and then moved that the Convention should be dissolved,
							without making any nomination— To this the delegations from the Towns
							would not consent; but upon taking the vote for going into a Nomination
							the vote was 30 for and 32 against it. The Convention then was
							dissolved, and the delegates from the Towns met separately; chose the
							same Moderator <persRef ref="sprague-seth">Seth Sprague</persRef>—and
							another Secretary, and then unanimously voted to support John Quincy
							Adams, to represent the District in the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
							Congress— The other party had also a separate meeting; and nominated
								<persRef ref="turner-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Turner</persRef> of Scituate—not a Jackson man; but merely to divide
							the vote, and in the hope that the AntiMasons, who are to meet next week
							will vote also for Turner— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richardson,
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lincoln said they had thought proper
							to give me this information, to guard against any misrepresentation that
							might be made to me of the transaction. I thanked them for their kind
							attention and said that I should acquiesce entirely in the course which
							might be taken by the People of the District— And so I am launched again
							upon the faithless Wave of Politics— I continued planting in the
							Nursery— Finished the trench from the central Apple tree to the central
							Rock—deposited Garden Shellbarks in the drupe—Chesnut
							Acorns—Horse-Chesnuts and scattered wild Cherries— Dug a trench also on
							the West side of the Alley—from centre towards the Gate— Planted in two
							rows Trask Shellbarks in the drupe; Chesnut and White Oak Acorns.— Horse
							Chesnuts, Apple Seeds—Pear Cores, scattered wild Cherries and Ash pods—
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"

								Holbrook</persRef> was here this morning, to visit my son <persRef
								key="adams-john2">John’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">infant daughter</persRef>, whom he
							vaccinated last Monday. The arm has taken the virus. There was a warm
							rain the former part of this day— <persRef key="adams-thomas">My
								brother</persRef> dined with me, and his daughter <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef> came to stay with <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> till next Monday— I had two glass
							Quart Tumblers filled with Earth, and pressed down a circle of sprouting
							white Oak Acorns, round the sides of each of them; to see if the tap
							root will continue shooting, and if it will appear through the glass as
							happens with Orange-seeds. Almost every one of the white Oak Acorns,
							that I have gathered in sprouting in my chamber, and neither sand nor
							loose earth will save them— I fear I shall in spite of every precaution
							lose them all— In the Nursery I dug a cross Trench at the Stony-barren
							Centre; and planted a row of Trask white Walnuts in the drupe. With
							Chesnuts, white and Chesnut Oak Acorns, Apple-seeds, Stranger berries
							and scattered wild Cherries— Staked only the white Walnuts. The more
							time and toil I spend upon this Nursery, the more it takes possession of
							me— I am particularly desirous of planting separately the three kinds of
							the Hickory—The Shellbark—the white walnut and the pignut; to ascertain
							if each of them will invariably produce its kind. I propose making as
							far as possible the same <pb n="11" type="ms"/>experiment upon as many
							kinds of Oak as I can procure, and also upon the fruit trees. Had the
							circumstances of my life permitted me to commence these experiments
							forty years ago, and to have pursed them systematically, I should now
							have possessed a mass of useful information, for which I must grope in
							the dark, and this farm would have been covered with excellent fruit—
							But I really commenced my plantations in 1826. and in the narrow compass
							of my Summer garden cellar— At Washington I pursued it in 1827. and
							raised some Apple and Orange trees in seeds from Pots; which gave me
							some experience— The Apple trees were transplanted into the Garden of
							the President’s House— In September 1827. I fenced off my Nursery here;
							and began my plantations in it— Not one in twenty of them has succeeded;
							and I know but partially the causes of their failure— In 1828. I was
							suddenly called from hence very early in September; by the illness of
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>— I made a
							large and various collection of Acorns, at Washington, to be planted
							here, as some of them were; but most of them were lost— The Spring,
							Summer and Autumn of 1829. were times of trial, calamity and distress—
							The Nursery was almost entirely neglected— The passion all but
							extinguished— In the Summer and Autumn of this year it has revived— I
							have passed nearly two hours of every fair day in the Nursery— Have dug,
							and manured and planted with my own hands, in the hope of having the
							next Spring and Summer a thick and various crop of fruit and forest
							trees to observe and preserve so far as may be found practicable—
							Nineteen twentieths of them I have no doubt will again perish; but if I
							can save and raise even one in a hundred of them, my labour will not be
							lost— Confined to the house this afternoon by weather, I answered
							several Letters. </p>

							<persRef ref="hellen-mary">wife</persRef> this morning— In the Nursery;
							continued the Trench West of the Alley towards the gate— Planted 12 Nuts
							of the Juglans glabra vel porcina—the round thin shelled light pignut—
							Of this tree itself there are several varieties; the nuts of some of
							them being sweet—but those of which I have planted are bitter and
							astringent like most of our acorns— With them I planted in two Rows,
							Chesnuts, sprouted white Oak Acorns—2. Greenleaf Black Oak Acorns; one
							of them fronting my young red Oak. Stranger berries, Office Apple-seeds;
							Pear Cores and seeds.— Opened a 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> short
							cross Trench West of the Alley, at the Stony-barren—found a gravelly
							soil, and took out several large Stones— Planted one whole Sickel Pear
							in Book-box N. 2. with a Stake— I much distrust the success of planting
							whole Apples and Pears, but hope this year to ascertain its expediency.
							Consulting <persRef ref="miller-philip">Miller’s</persRef> Abridgment of
							the Gardener’s Dictionary, fifth Edition, London—1763. I find under the
							Article of Ploughing, in the midst of advice to plow deep, he says “but

							admit of this, for if the soil is shallow, and either gravel, chalk or
							stone lie beneath <hi rend="italic">it will be very imprudent to turn up
								either of </hi><hi rend="italic">those</hi>—therefore the depth of
							the furrows in such lands, must be determined by the staple of the land—
							By the word Staple must be understood all that depth of Soil next the
							Surface which is proper for the growth of vegetables[”]— Now this very
							imprudence is what I am this day committing— That is turning up the
							gravel in the Stony-barren part of my Nursery, and taking out Stones to
							the depth of perhaps a foot and a half from the Surface; and here I have
							planted and intend to plant Nuts, Acorns and Seeds, first filling the
							spaces vacated by the Stones and gravel, with black mould from the
							Garden— Whether six or eight inches deep of the staple, will give a hold
							for the root to penetrate deeper is the problem to be solved— I have
							warning enough that the plants have no root in stony ground; and that
							the Sun will burn them up. <pb n="12" type="ms"/>After dinner I rode

							the afternoon from Acts 11.35. But in every Nation, he that feareth God,
							and worketh righteousness is accepted with him— The subjects of both
							these Sermons were topics of plain morality, and the discourses were
							written in a fervid Spirit, becoming the youth of the preacher— Industry
							is not one of the Virtues peculiar to the Christian System— It belongs
							to every School of Morals; though perhaps it has been more emphatically
							recommended by <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef> than by any
							other Ethical writer— Industry is a virtue liable to excess; and Jesus
							in his rebuke to <persRef ref="martha">Martha</persRef>, and in his

							merit of moderation even in the exercise of good and active energies—

								type="ms"/>look over the ground. In the Nursery, I completed the
							Trench W. of the Alley, and planted Juglans Porcina Amara, Chesnuts,

							and his brother <persRef ref="spear-william">William</persRef> to visit

							at the Sturdy Oak beyond <persRef ref="baxter-catharine">M<hi

								Augustine</persRef> and others—and particularly the Somnium
							Scipionis from the sixth book. The part now discovered contains perhaps

							altogether equals any other part of the writings of Cicero— <persRef
								ref="scipioafricanusminor">Scipio</persRef> lays it down that
							neither of the three simple forms of Government is good: that a
							composition of the three is the best form of Government; but finally
							pronounces the Roman Republic itself the most perfect of Governments;
							illustrating his Sentiments by historical references to the most

							Government is the principal part assigned in the Dialogue to <persRef

							for the discovery of the parts still lost— It is apparent that the main

							call my aid <persRef ref="farrar-salmon">Salmon Farrar</persRef> and the
							Crow-bar— Filled the vacated spaces with mould from the garden, mingled

							Apple-seeds, Wild Cherries and Pear Cores— The ground of this range
							under that Western Wall, I apprehend is not sufficiently broken up—
							Planted sturdy Black Oak Acorns in Book-box N 1. and Trask Pear Seeds in

							He went with me, and shewed me where were the old boundaries of the

							<persRef ref="kirk-john">J. Kirke</persRef> brought me of Shagbarks,

							Then Chesnuts, mingled Juglans, Apple-Seeds, Pear Cores; Stranger

							a Treatise is certain, from notices of it in several other of his works—
								<persRef ref="middleton-conyers">Middleton</persRef> merely says
							this this has been long acknowledged by the learned to be spurious— The
							earliest edition of Cicero that I possess is in one Quarto Volume
							printed at Geneva 1632. with commentary and Notes of <persRef
								ref="lambin-denis">Lambinus</persRef> and of <persRef
								ref="godefroy-denis">Dionysius Gothofredus</persRef>. In this
							Edition the Consolatio is included as the work of Cicero; but in a
							marginal Note the editor declares it in his opinion to be spurious,
							because Cicero himself in the second Tusculan, and in the second book de
							divinatione declares that in his Consolatio, he had collected accounts
							of the disastrous deaths of the most illustrious Citizens of Rome;
							scarcely any of which are mentioned in this book.— In the <persRef
								ref="elzevir">Elzevir</persRef> Edition by <persRef
								ref="schrevelius-theodorus">Schrevelius</persRef> 1661. The
							Consolatio is printed as of Cicero, si Deo placet—if it please god—and
							it is precisely so, a century later in the Edition of Ernesti— In
								<persRef ref="olivet-pierre">D’Olivet’s</persRef> Edition, as I have
							it printed at Padua 1753. it is not all included; nor as I can perceive
							at all noticed— Though he gives two or three short fragments from the
							genuine book de Consolatione, and an extract from Sigonius, an Epitome
							of what he supposed the genuine Treatise to contain, agreeing very much
							with this apocryphal book. The reason assigned in the Edition of Denys
							Godefroy, for rejecting the Consolatio as it is, has not much weight,
								<pb n="16" type="ms"/>for there are chasms of lost passages in it;
							and there are statements of tragical deaths of distinguished Romans— The
							inferiority of the composition to that of the other works of Cicero is a
							better evidence of its illegitimacy, and yet it is very well written; by
							no mean imitator of the Master’s hand— The strongest market of the
							counterfeit is its coldness— There is none of the pungency of grief
							under which he says he wrote this Treatise— A feeble and bloodless
							eulogium upon Tullia, scarcely occupies half a page, and there is not a
							manifestation of acute feeling in the whole work— How I crept in among
							the writings of Cicero, it would absorb too much time at present to
							enquire.</p>

								<persRef key="adams-john2">John’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="hellen-mary">wife</persRef>, who is shortly to return to
							Washington— They were shipped on board of the Seceder, a Schooner,
								<persRef ref="u">Captain Churchill</persRef>— I spent the day, (with
							the exception of about an hour when I returned home, and dined,) upon
							Mount Wollaston, upon the Southeastern declivity of which I commenced my
							experiment upon a larger Scale of raising forest trees from the seed— I
							had laid out a lot nearly square from the road, and containing about
							five Acres, for an Apple Orchard—and as it was to be fenced in I
							resolved to raise this border of forest trees round the Orchard— One Rod
							wide of the ground, has accordingly been ploughed up in furrows and
							harrowed, all round the Square— Three sides of it were planted this day,
							in five rows to each side, with Acorns, Chesnuts, and Shagbarks— They
							were planted in hills about 3 feet apart; one row on the Northern edge
							of the lot, and where the fence is to stand with an acorn, a Shagbark
							and a Chesnut upon each hill. On all the rest, the two Nuts or an Acorn
							and a nut to each Hill.— The Acorns, are those which I have been able to
							gather within the last Month— Those which <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> brought from Weston, and those which Spear’s boys
							could pick up under the groves of the farm— The Shagbarks and Chesnuts
							were purchased at <persRef ref="brigham-josiah">Brigham’s</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="briesler-john">Briesler’s</persRef> and at Boston
							Market— There were about a peck of each, and on each side were planted,
							about 1800 nuts or acorns 1/3 of each “Quod felix faustumque sit.” Our
							farmer’s are so much the creatures of habit; and so totally unused to
							raise forest trees from the nut, or indeed from any kind of planting,
							that this attempt is almost universally considered as a wild and foolish
							expense and waste of Land— Briesler told me to day when I was purchasing
							Shagbarks, to plant, and rejecting all that floated upon water, that I
							was doing <hi rend="italic">one</hi> good thing at the old farm; in
							setting out an Orchard—leaving me to understand that he thought the
							other part of my Scheme, a vagary— So my forest, will only pass under
							the shelter of my Orchard; as <persRef ref="moliere">Moliere</persRef>
							to draw an Audience to his Misanthrope was obliged to couple it with
							Medecin Malgré lui— One of Spear’s men who was planting with us, said
							that it would be a Months work next Spring and Summer to hoe these
							hills— I ask no better than that it may be—for it implies that a large
							portion of the trees will come up. We finished the third side about five
							this afternoon—leaving the fourth, for another day— Returning home I
							called, and passed an hour at <persRef key="adams-thomas">my

								Gannett</persRef> of Cambridge port, in the morning from Psalm
							107.8. “Oh that men would praise the Lord for his Goodness, and for his
							wonderful works to the children of men!”—and in the afternoon, from
							Matthew 7.20. “Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.” M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gannett’s discourses are very well written
							and read with great propriety— They are elegant compositions, delivered
							with much solemnity of manner, and abound with good reason and good
							feeling— All this is common to the Sermons of many young men recently
							educated at Cambridge— Their great deficiency is of vivacity— This
							applies both to the writing and the delivery— There is excellent
							doctrine—choice language, and nothing to remember— I incline to make my
							Memory the standard of merit for Sermons. I admire in proportion as I
							remember them— <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef>
							dined with us— I read the fragments of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero’s</persRef> Poetry, and with them completed the perusal of
							everything written by him, now known to be extant— It has occupied an
							average of two hours a day for ten Months—and has left me with a desire
							to spend at least as much more time, in studying here more profoundly.—
							Whether this opportunity will be indulged me, is doubtful— I am now
							precisely at the age when the life of Cicero, was so tragically closed,
							and the time which can remain for me in this life should be otherwise
							spent than in Studies which should have been completed thirty years
							since— Lessons of wisdom can henceforth be of little avail for practical
							use to me. Lessons of Language, Rhetoric and Logic are still less
							susceptible of being turned to profitable account— But the taste for
							Classical Literature, formed in youth, adheres to one in age, when it
							can no longer be of much benefit— The principal Poetry of Cicero now
							extant, is a translation in Latin Hexameters of Greek Poem of <persRef
								ref="aratus-poet">Aratus</persRef> upon Astronomy, called phenomena—
							The Original of Aratus is also extant, and the work of Cicero being
							mutilated <persRef ref="grotius-hugo">Grotius</persRef> undertook to
							supply the deficient parts— I read this Morning in <persRef
								ref="ernesti-johann">Ernesti’s</persRef> Edition, containing only
							the verses of Cicero; about 400 lines. The versification is not to be
							compared with that of <persRef ref="virgil">Virgil</persRef> or of
								<persRef ref="ovid">Ovid</persRef>— Perhaps not even with that of
								<persRef ref="lucretiuscarus-titus">Lucretius</persRef>. There was a
							<unclear>sevret</unclear> of harmony in Latin versification, which Cicero, though a
							perfect master of all the possibilities of harmony in Latin prose, did
							not discover— The poem of Aratus is a description of the Celestial
							Constellations— Less lively and poetical than the Astronomics of
								<persRef ref="manilius-marcus">Manilius</persRef>. The translation
							by Cicero was a youthful exercise; but he gives an extract from it of
							near 100 lines in his Books de Natura Deorum— There are a few lines,
							upon his own Consulate; and the two so ridiculed by <persRef
								ref="quintilian-marcus">Quinctilian</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="juvenal">Juvenal</persRef>—One of them—Cedant Arma Togae,
							concedat Laurea Linguae, he acknowledges and defends—the other was
							probably never written by him— It does not appear to have been quoted
							against him by <persRef ref="antony-mark">Antony</persRef>, though far
							more open to his scoffing commentary— It is remarkable that in all the
							fragments preserved there is not one other censurable line.</p>

							upon Conversation with him I varied <pb n="18" type="ms"/>so much that I
							was obliged to write it over again. This mode of leasing that farm was
							attempted more than twenty years ago and failed— I expect it will fail
							again; but I must try all lawful expedients to dispose of it— The
							Executors Sale of the Woodlots is to be in the afternoon— Deacon Spear
							took with him the two plans of them, to be shewn at the Sale. A man
							named <persRef ref="jones-john6">John Jones</persRef> went by with the
							remnant of a Waggon load of Chesnuts from New-Hampshire, which I took;
							chiefly to plant— He sent for me into the Nursery for curiosity of
							seeing me—which he repeated he valued much more than the selling of his
							Chesnuts— He said he had lived with <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father</persRef> and worked upon this farm more than twenty years
							ago. He told me too that notwithstanding his plain dress he was not a
							poor man—he was worth five thousand dollars, and had influence; and had
							used it, in favour of me— <persRef ref="humphreys-lemuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphrey</persRef> the Surveyor
							brought me the plan of the Mount Wollaston farm; but I found he had not

							and 35 including the gate to the Westernmost fence.— Northward 85
							lengths to the Angle then 60 to opposite the cedar tree on the

							Cedar—and 86 lengths from the cedar to the Creek. I desired M<hi

							none—but brought home some Atherton Crab Apples for seed. They are sour
							almost as lemon juice but the seed are sound— In my theory seed from a
							rugged Stock, or from hard soil, or a bleak aspect removed to kinder
							soil and nurture will improve— I called at <persRef ref="capen-samuel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Capen’s</persRef> to enquire for

						<p>I sent <persRef ref="farrar-salmon">Salmon Farrar</persRef> this morning
							with the Chaise to Dedham, expecting that <persRef ref="kirk-john"
								>Kirke</persRef> and <persRef ref="kirk-elizabeth">his
								wife</persRef> would return from New-York, and come from Providence
							in the Stage—but they did not come, and Farrar returned this Evening
							alone. <persRef ref="capen-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Capen</persRef> was here, and told me that he had a number of
							grafted young Apple trees for sale; which I promised to come and see
							next Wednesday— He also mentioned the four Acres of fresh meadow which
							he had bidden off at the Sale of my Leases, and about which he appears
							to have understood that the adjoining pasture was to be included in the
							Lease— <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> called to
							see <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef>. In the Nursery, I planted 3. Shagbarks
							from <persRef ref="brooks-sidney">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brooks’s</persRef> trees at Medford, which <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">wife</persRef> sent me— Also 3 whole
							Office Apples—Chesnuts—Juglans Porcina Amara—Atherton Crab and other
							Apple-seeds—Acorns. 3. Plum stones—3. English walnuts; and scattered
							wild cherries. All in the broken furrows between the young trees West of
							the alley— Opened four Cross furrows East of the Alley— After dinner I
							walked over the hills to the Druid Plains, where I found a remnant of
							white Oak-Acorns under three trees— One of them where I had found none
							before— The tap-roots of almost all the Acorns that were alive had taken
							hold of the ground, where some of them had penetrated from three to four
							inches deep. The leaves of the Oaks have almost entirely fallen, and the
							trees are strip’d as in Mid winter— Among the walnuts there are three
							distinct varieties of the Pignut— One round without a regular
							appearance. thin shelled, and with a bitter kernel: of this class are
							the whole row on the Trask Hill— <pb n="21" type="ms"/>One
							smaller—round—thick and hard shelled, and upon cracking which the kernel
							falls to pieces—and one, which approaches to the Shagbark; with angular
							protuberances slightly marked, and a hard, flattened shell, and a
							kernel, sweet as the Shagbarks itself, but not cracking into halves— Of
							these two kinds are the rows in the square Druid Pasture— The trees
							which thus stand in rows, are self-planted, and producing all the same
							kind of Nut seem to prove that the tree follows the nature of the nut.
							Other varieties in the foliage or vegetation of the trees I have not
							remarked. The wood of the pignut appears to be harder than that of the
							Shagbark. This morning I finished reading the Prefaces to the two first
							Editions of <persRef ref="ernesti-johann">Ernesti’s</persRef> Clavis— In
							which he gives an exposition of his reasons, for reducing his commentary
							upon <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> to this form: and
							they are conclusive— The work consists of five Indexes. 1. of Laws. 2.
							Geographical— 3. Historical, chiefly an account of persons, mentioned by
							Cicero— 4. Of Latin words, including only such as are not found, or are
							ill explained in the Dictionaries. 5. Graeco-Latin—an explanation of the
							Greek words which abound in Cicero’s writings—particularly in the
							Letters to <persRef ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>— And as they
							are generally quotations from the Poets this Index gives notice whence
							they are taken, and as much of the passage cited as serves to shew how
							it is applicable in the quotation— In this Preface Ernesti recommends
							with warm approbation <persRef ref="burman-pieter">Burmann’s</persRef>
							preface to his Edition of <persRef ref="phaedrus">Phaedrus</persRef>,
							and he concurs in the advice of <persRef ref="lipsius-justus"
								>Lipsius</persRef> whom he mentions as observing that whoever would
							profitably study Cicero, must devote two years to reading and again
							reading him without the intermission of a day— In this opinion I fully
							concur— I received this morning a Letter from <persRef ref="lafayette"
								>General La Fayette</persRef>, of 8. September last, enclosing
							several printed documents relating to his share in the recent Revolution
							in France.</p>

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="deane-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dean</persRef> of Scituate in the morning from Mark 2:29. “And he
							said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the
							Sabbath[”]; and in the afternoon from Acts 3.19. “Be converted” both
							ingenious and eloquent Sermons. There is a peculiarity in M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dean’s mode of delivery, which most of the
							auditors here, dislike— It is inconceivable, how many modes there are of
							bad speaking, and how exceedingly rare it is to hear a good Speaker in
							the pulpit. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dean’s fault is not the cold
							inanimate manner so common among the preacher’s of this neighbourhood;
							but a form of vivacity which passes for affectation, and which is
							thought to partake of levity— In the morning Sermon he gave a historical
							account of the Institution of the Sabbath; of the reasons assigned for
							it in the old Testament— Of its adaptation to the new Covenant; as a
							commemoration of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ; and of the change by
							the Apostles of the day upon which it is solemnized, from the seventh to
							the first day of the week— At the close of the Discourse he animadverted
							with severity upon the attempts now making to divide the Parish and set
							up a new Religious Society of Universalists— This project has been
							several years fermenting, and will now undoubtedly succeed— Great
							numbers of the congregational Churches are breaking up by Sectarian
							Secessions— Some from and some to Calvinism—Baptistism—Methodism,
							Unitarianism, and Universalism— The Church at Quincy had been peculiarly
							fortunate in its harmony— As the population of the town increased the
							Meeting House became too small for the number of worshippers— It
							overflowed partly into the Episcopal Church where a <pb n="22" type="ms"
							/>respectable and very popular clergyman by the name of <persRef
								ref="cutler-benjamin2">Cutler</persRef> was settled; moderately
							Calvinistic and Trinitarian— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutler
							within the last two years has pulmonary complaints which obliged him to
							pass the last Winter in Georgia, and will make a Southern climate
							necessary to him for the next— He will probably never return to Quincy,
							where his place is now temporarily supplied by a <persRef
								ref="potter-alonzo">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Potter</persRef>—
							Last year a new Meeting House was built at the Railway in Milton but on
							the borders of Quincy; and has taken away some of <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitney’s</persRef> Parishioners— Meantime the Universalist
							Preachers have been making gradual approaches, and for some months past
							have held meetings on Sunday Evenings at the Town Hall— This day they
							have advanced a step further and had public worship, morning, afternoon
							and Evening— The wolf is thus in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney’s fold; and the Spirit of dissension is spreading over his
							flock, under the auspices of Universal Salvation— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dean pointed out the consequences, but
							reason against Sectarianism, is oil to a flame— His Sermon of the
							afternoon upon the text Be converted, was equally sound and rational
							Anti-Calvinism— But there is so little of that species of Bigotry in
							Quincy that there was no need of preaching against it. <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> dined with us— She is
							going to-morrow, for the Winter to Boston— <persRef ref="farrar-salmon"
								>S. Farrar</persRef> went to Dedham for <persRef ref="kirk-john"
								>John Kirke</persRef> and <persRef ref="kirk-elizabeth">his
								wife</persRef>; and returned without them; but they came soon after.
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and <persRef
