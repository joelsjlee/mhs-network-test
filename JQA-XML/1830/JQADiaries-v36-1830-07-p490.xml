						<p>I was awaked this Morning just at day light by the Meeting-House Bell;
							which rung for a house that was burning down— It belonged to <persRef
								ref="u">Captain Jenkins</persRef> at Bent’s Point a man much
							esteemed, and for whose loss there is great sympathy— He is himself now
							absent, and this misfortune leaves his family destitute— <persRef
								ref="u">Captain Smith</persRef> and <persRef ref="spear-daniel"
								>Deacon Spear</persRef> called here early in the day with a
							subscription paper—to which the contributions were already liberal— Rode
							this afternoon with the <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary">ladies</persRef> over
							Milton Hill— I visit my garden every day; but confine my observations to
							my young trees— My list in the Summer house-cellar is now Oaks 8. Elms
							2. Horse Chesnut 5. Peaches 10. Plums 3. Walnuts 4. Catalpa 1. Willow 1—
							This last has put out four vigorous shoots upon the stem which I left on
							cutting it down about the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June— The
							first shoot appeared within five days after.— I found this afternoon
							several small Slug worms on the leaves of my two years old Cherry tree—
								<persRef ref="sumner-william">General Sumner</persRef> says that the
							small green louse which crumples the peach leaves is an Aphis— <persRef
								ref="farrar-augustus">Farrar</persRef> sent me about two quarts of
							the black Mazzard Cherry from my tree, fully ripe, with part of which I
							filled a bottle of New England Rum— Of the rest I propose to plant the
							Stones— All of which sink in water— The white and black hearts from
							budded trees almost universally float— I finished this morning the
							Oration for <persRef ref="balbus-lucius">Lucius Cornelius
								Balbus</persRef>, and read two Sections of that de Provinciis
							consularibus. Balbus was a native of Cadix in Spain, to whom <persRef
								ref="pompey">Pompey</persRef> for important Services rendered had
							granted the right of Roman Citizenship— There was an express ordinance
							of the Senate authorising Pompey to grant this right; but after <unclear>Bal</unclear>bus
							had enjoyed it several years this accusation was raised against him on
							the ground that by the Treaty of federation between Rome and Cadix no
							Citizen of the Latter place could be naturalized as a Roman Citizen—
							This pretension is refuted by <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef>. Balbus was acquitted, and afterwards by the
							favour of <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>, rose to the Consular dignity— <persRef
								ref="balbus-lucius-minor">His nephew</persRef> of the same name
							obtained the honours of a triumph— This oration is curious for
							containing much upon the subject of naturalization or acquired
							citizenship— Also upon the federal Law, between the Roman Republic and
							her Allies. The terms fundus fieri as applied to cities, contain the
							knot of the cause, and something is wanting to make them perfectly
							intelligible. Balbus from being a Protegé of Pompey had become a great
							favourite of Caesar; and Cicero apologizes eloquently for undertaking
							his defense at all— His remarks upon the duty of sacrificing resentments
							for the benefit of the Republic are sound and pathetic. Balbus was
							afterwards a faithful friend to him—</p>

						<p><date>2. IV. </date>Friday.</p>
						<p>This was a sultry Summer day, and the effects of Summer heat was to
							produce mere debility without pain beyond any thing I had ever before
							experienced— It disabled me from writing totally <unclear>before</unclear> dinner, and
							thereby necessarily postponed my proposed occupations— I took a morning
							bath and swam from wharf to wharf— In the Evening I rode with the
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary">Ladies</persRef>
							to Milton Hill and called at <persRef ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Holbrook’s</persRef>; but he was not
							at home. <persRef ref="walker-hetty">Hetty Walker</persRef> left us,
							this Evening. I finished reading this morning the Oration de Provinciis
							Consularibus—to the Senate— There was a Law introduced by the <persRef
								ref="gracchus-tiberius-sempronius">father</persRef> of the
							Gracchi—when a tribune; requiring that the Government of certain
							Provinces should be assigned to Consuls and Praetors; before they
							entered upon their Offices, but their command to commence after the
							expiration of their official year at Rome— The Provinces of Macedonia
							and Syria, had been assigned to the Ex-Consuls <persRef
								ref="gabinius-aulus">Gabinius</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="piso-lucius">Piso</persRef>, by a Law of <persRef
								ref="clodius-publius">Clodius</persRef>, and as a part of his
							outrageous proceedings against <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef>— And the two Provinces of Gaul, citerior and
							ulterior had <pb n="491" type="ms"/>by a special act obtained by the
							Tribune <persRef ref="vatinius-publius">Vatinius</persRef>, but
							considered by Cicero, and the Senatorial party as illegal, had been
							assigned to <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef> for five
							years—nearly one year and a half of which were yet unexpired— The
							Consuls now put in question how these four Provinces were to be disposed
							of— Gabinius and Piso, had made themselves so odious in their Provinces,
							that the general opinion seems to have been that they should be
							recalled—but Caesar was pursuing a career of splendid victories in Gaul,
							and was rapidly reducing both its parts into Roman Provinces— To this
							end, he and his friends wished his command there to be continued for a
							second term of five years—which measure was vehemently opposed by his
							enemies and enviers, and generally by the Senatorial party, to which
							Caesar had always been obnoxious— At this time the Senators whose
							opinions had been called for, before Cicero, had all advised, that
							Caesar’s command should not be protracted at least in one of the two
							Provinces—except <persRef ref="publius">Publius Servilius</persRef> who
							had opined that his whole command should be continued— In this Cicero
							concurred, and his Oration is an ingenuous and powerful argument in
							support of that opinions— He urges the recall of Gabinius and Piso, upon
							public considerations and disclaiming the influence of all personal
							resentment against them. But he lashes them without mercy— He does not
							deny that he had been at enmity with Caesar, and that he had been
							ardently opposed to the Vatinian Law—but he alledges the splendid
							Services of Caesar, and the duty of sacrificing individual enmities to
							the cause of the Republic. He gives a very candid account of his
							relations with Caesar; and of his differences with him; and concludes
							that it is impossible for him not to be the friend of one who is the
							benefactor of his Country— I also read a number of the Letters of
								<persRef ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="deffand-marie">Madame du Deffand</persRef>, and part of his
							Tragedy of <persRef ref="irene">Irene</persRef>.</p>

						<p>Bath, and swam from wharf to wharf, with greater annoyance of gad-flies
							than ever. The Sea-bath itself is losing its charm— The exercise becomes
							fatiguing, and in fancy or in reality it is no longer so conducive to my
							health as heretofore. We concluded this morning to dismiss the black
							man, <persRef ref="taylor-william5">William Taylor</persRef>, who came
							with us from Washington— I paid him his wages in full: two Months to the
								18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and sent <persRef ref="kirk-john"
								>John Kirke</persRef> with him to set him down at Boston— It is
							scarcely possible to keep within any rule of order a family consisting
							partly of white and partly of coloured Servants. This fellow made a
							disturbance in the house at Washington, one night before we came away:
							and has done the same thing here— He denied the fact, and intreated me
							to keep him upon trial with a promise that I should never hear a
							complaint of him again— I <unclear>persevered</unclear> in discharging him. John Kirke
							did not return from Boston this day— My Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> came, before dinner, having
							passed this week at Medford— We resumed after dinner the making out of a
							Catalogue of my books, till I was fagged by the sultriness of the
							weather. I have had a piece of ground broken up in my nursery at the
							right hand of the gate, where I this evening planted a row of 24 mazzard
							whole cherries from my tree; and two rows of Stones stripped from the
							same cherries— Some of them I suppose will come up next Spring, and I
							wish to make the comparative experiment, between planting the whole
							cherry and the stone— I have fifteen Apple-trees up from the seeds which
							I carelessly put into the ground last Summer, but as they came up in
							clusters ten of them, are transplanted, and they live, but do not grow—
							The English Oaks put forth vigorous shoots, shrub like, without an
							ascending stalk.</p>

						<p><date>4. V:30. </date>Sunday.</p>
						<p><persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirke</persRef> returned this morning from
							Boston, with a white boy named <persRef ref="phillips-john4">John
								Phillips</persRef>, who is to take the place in the family of
								<persRef ref="taylor-william5">William</persRef> the reformed— Heard
								<persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitney</persRef> this morning from Psalm 48.9. “We have thought of
							thy loving kindness, O God, in the midst of thy Temple.[”] an occasional
							Sermon upon the day— The anniversary of Independence falling this year
							on the Sunday— The afternoon discourse was from Acts 10.34. “God is no
							respecter of Persons”— The doctrine which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney appeared chiefly anxious to enforce was that of future
							retribution in punishment for evil life— I supposed he had reference to
							the creed of the Universalists, who are increasing in numbers and
							burning with the zeal of seeking proselytes— Their chief Apostle in
							Boston is a <persRef ref="ballou-hosea">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ballou</persRef>, who holds that there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi>
							future State of Punishment— This is the tenet of one branch of the
							Universalists— The other admits a temporary purgatory— The unqualified
							Universalists have sent a teacher here, who has delivered several
							Lectures; and assembled numerous auditories. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Whitney apprehends that they will collect a church here, and
							draw off some of his parishioners— He quoted several texts, which are
							very explicit in the denunciation of future punishments— But the
							difficulty is to conceive where in the new Testament, any countenance is
							to be found for the opposite belief— We remembered the birth day, of our
							Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> this day 27. And I did not
							forget that of <persRef key="adams-john">my fathers</persRef> decease,
							this day four years— I read two Sermons of <persRef ref="barrow-isaac"
								>Barrow</persRef>, upon the love of our neighbour— Much more
							satisfactory than those of the last Sunday— He seems indeed greatly
							embarrassed with his text; “thou shalt love thy neighbour <hi
								rend="italic">as</hi> thyself[”]—for the love of our neighbour; he
							has no lack of argument— But he worries himself excessively to prove
							that this Love should equal in degree that which we entertain for
							ourselves— It is obvious that this text is to be received with some
							modification— Self-love is a law of physical nature, given by God as the
							means of self-preservation— The Love of our neighbour is enjoined by
							Christ as a duty, and in prescribing it he assigned Self-love as the
							object of comparison, the standard by which it was to be measured— It
							does not imply that it should be equal in degree to that with which it
							is compared— When Christ says be ye perfect, even as your father which
							is in heaven is perfect, he did not intend to require of his disciples a
							perfection equal to that of God— He pointed them to a model for
							imitation. And so it is of the Love of our neighbour compared with self
							Love— If Barrow had duly considered this, he would have saved himself
							much laborious argument to prove that possible, which is not possible— I
							walked this evening with Charles to <persRef ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Quincy’s</persRef> where we spent an
							hour.— <persRef ref="quincy-eliza">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

							this Evening to Cambridge. Anna, the youngest daughter remains with her

						<p>This was the day of the celebration of National Independence. I had been

							celebration at Boston, both of which I declined. It can never again be
							to me a day of mere festivity— As the birth day of <persRef
								key="adams-john2">one of my Sons</persRef>, and as the day of
								<persRef key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> decease, it combines
							every interest and feeling that has power over the heart and too much of
							solemnity for the noisy mirth of a public festival. <pb n="493"
								type="ms"/>I would henceforth pass it in the bosom of my family and
							in useful occupation— I was employed this day with <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>; continuing to make out the
							Catalogue of my books. I planted also at the lower end of my Nursery two
							rows of Cherries and Cherry Stones for Stocks— All from my own mazzard
							tree, and all stones sinking in water. <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Crosby</persRef> of New-York, with
								<persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef> paid me a visit— Son of <persRef
								ref="crosby-ebenezer">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crosby</persRef> whom I saw there in 1785. and who was brother to my
							uncle <persRef ref="adams-peter">Peter’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="adams-mary6">wife</persRef>— This Same M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crosby was the person who owned a large
							Estate in the Island of Jamaica, which was escheated or cheated away
							from him— He says he has given up all expectation of ever recovering any
							part of it— <persRef key="adams-thomas">My brother</persRef> was here
							this morning and <persRef ref="buchanan-robert">Robert
								Buchanan</persRef> who has just finished his course as a Cadet at
							West Point arrived— <persRef ref="richardson-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Richardson</persRef> of Hingham the

							celebration, at the Railway Meeting house and Hotel. <persRef
								ref="beale-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beale</persRef>
							was here in the Evening to remind me of the dinner of the Directors of
							the Neponset Bridge, to-morrow at Squantum— I began reading this morning
							the oration against <persRef ref="piso-lucius">Piso</persRef>, having
							yesterday finished that for <persRef ref="coelius-marcus"
								>Coelius</persRef>. This Coelius was one of the secondary men of the
							age, whose friendship for <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>
							and his intimacy with him has given him his best Passport to the Memory
							of Ages— The Letters from 8 to 16 of the familiar Epistles Book 2. are
							Letters from Cicero to him. The whole 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Book consists of Letters from Coelius to Cicero. He was a man of loose
							political and moral principles, and in the civil Wars of <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef> and <persRef ref="pompey"
								>Pompey</persRef>, changed sides once or twice— In the third Book of
							Caesar’s Commentaries on the Civil War, Section 20. is an account of his
							last Adventures and Death— In this Cause Coelius was accused of having
							borrowed money of <persRef ref="clodiapulchra">Clodia</persRef>, and
							also of having attempted to poison her. This Clodia, was the wife of
								<persRef ref="metellusceler-quintus">Metellus Caesar</persRef>, one
							of the infamous Sisters of the infamous <persRef ref="clodius-publius"
								>Clodius</persRef>— The most remarkable part of the Oration is the
							manner in which Cicero discredits her testimony and exposes her vices.
							She appears to have been present at the trial, for the Orator repeatedly
							addresses her by name. It may be advisable to compare the manner of
							chastising a female offender with that which the same Speaker uses with
							men.</p>

							who four days since absconded with 40000 dollars of bills; and with a

							for the remainder he is still deficient— It appears that there is no

							deliberation; but merely as the French Translator says, [“]pour savoir
							sî Pison est un scelerat.” By the Oration de Provinciis Consularibus,
							Cicero had obtained the recall of Piso from his Province; and upon his
							return Piso had pronounced an invective against Cicero in the Senate.
							This was Cicero’s Answer, and its furious personalities have made it a
							favourite with the modern translators— For <persRef ref="duncan-william"

								<persRef ref="calpurnia">Calpurnia</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Caesar’s</persRef> last wife, was Consul with
								<persRef ref="gabinius-aulus">Gabinius</persRef> at the time of

							This man had been quaestor in Macedonia at the time of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> exile; had received and
							entertained him with the most devoted friendship; when deserted by many
							others, and denied a refuge in the Island of Sicily; by the Praetor of
							that Province— Three years after Plancius was a Candidate for the Office
							of AEdile, and was successful— His disappointed competitor <persRef
								ref="laterensis-marcus">Laterensis</persRef>, prosecuted him, upon
							the Licinian Law de Sodalitiis, or bribery by treating— A Law enacted
							the year before, by which the Prosecutor was authorised to appoint the
							judges; while in other cases the judges were drawn by lot from lists
							nominated by each of the parties— In this case Cicero calls upon the
							prosecutor for specific testimony in support of his charge—denies that
							he has any to produce; and complains that he has misconstrued mere acts
							of kindness, and the ardent zeal of Plancius’s friends into corruption.
							He complains also of the selection of the judges by Laterensis; that he
							had not chosen them from the tribe, where the principal corruption was
							charged. He accounts for the success of Plancius in the elections from
							causes not mortifying to him, for Laterensis himself had been a friend
							to Cicero; who accordingly treats him with much delicacy and respect— He
							remarks upon the motives which prevail among the people in giving their
							votes—and tells very amusingly the story how his own self-complacency
							and vanity had been mortified, upon his return from Sicily, after his
							Service there as Quaestor— He relates with much detail the circumstances
							of his own exile; his exclusion from Sicily and the exceeding kindness
							of Plancius to him on that occasion— He expatiates on his obligation of
							gratitude to Plancius, and takes that opportunity to introduce a feeling
							panegyric upon the virtue of Gratitude itself. He glances also, at the
							charges of inconsistency, already brought against him, for his recent
							change of policy, and his compliances to the will of <persRef

						<p><date>11. IV:30. </date>Sunday— My age 63.</p>
						<p>My grand climacteric is turned, and I enter upon the sixty-fourth year of
							my age. In turning back to the notice of the last year’s anniversary,
							the thought presses upon me of how little has since been effected of
							that preparation which even then formed an essential part of my duty—
							The day, and the discourses that I heard should have solemnized my
							feelings beyond an ordinary pitch— <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter Whitney</persRef> preached both
							parts of the day from Job. 14.10. “But man dieth and wasteth away; yea,
							man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?” With the exception of the
							question at the end of this verse, the text contains only a saying of
							trivial morality.— The question, formed the subject of both the
							discourses— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney stated four distinct
							doctrines, concerning the future state of man— 1. Eternal Punishment to
							the wicked. 2. annihilation, also confined to the impenitent. 3. A
							future state of happiness, but not of punishment— 4. Temporary
							punishment, but final universal Salvation— He gave his own opinions in
							favour of this last system, which is not that of the sect called
							universalists. Their doctrine excludes all future punishment. Upon this
							Subject we know nothing but what is contained in the Scriptures, and as
							I read them they do denounce judgment, severe judgment, hereafter, for
							sins committed here— The term of punishment is threatened for ages of
							ages—indefinite time but not for eternity— There is one passage in which
							Christ bids his disciples fear him who is able to destroy both body and
							Soul, in Gehenna—and there is one passage of <persRef ref="paul">S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>, which seems to
							promise ultimate universal Salvation—but it is not decisive and the
							general tenor of the New Testament, gives no encouragement to the hope
							of any final remission of penalties— But the universalists still believe
							the Scriptures. I read also the two Sermons of <persRef
								ref="barrow-isaac">Barrow</persRef>, upon Charity— The second of
							them upon the motives, and arguments to Charity—aloud to my wife— And it
							is much the best of the Sermons of this writer that I have yet read— The
							arguments are somewhat overcharged; and the motives presented are
							perhaps too generally selfish— The Style is rough, and the language
							often obsolete— Many words then in common use have lost not their
							meaning, but their delicacy. There is a homeliness in the language of
							all the preachers of that age— Barrow is copious in thought—and his
							division of the Subject, first into the nature, properties and Acts of
							Charity, and then into the Motives and Arguments to it is good; but his
							subdivisions are too numerous, and running into one another cause
							numerous repetitions. In the discourse upon the motives and arguments to
							charity there is eloquence and pathos— I passed the Evening at home— No
							Company— <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> dined
							with us.</p>

							The day was rainy, with a cold North-east wind, which confined us to the
							house. The afternoon I spent with Charles in working upon the Catalogue;
							completing that of my books in the Library, and taking up those in the
							adjoining Entry.— I planted a few cherries and stones, in the intervals
							between my young apple-trees of this years growth. Every one of these
							that I transplanted lives; but none of them grow. The winter will be
							their trial— I find the Slug worm upon the leaves of my young plum
							trees, and the lice, aphides on the tenderest leaves of the two year old
							Apple trees. We have now an abundance of currants, and rasberries. I
							wrote to <persRef ref="bowditch-nathaniel">N. Bowditch</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="treadwell-daniel">Daniel Treadwell</persRef>,
							declining to deliver the <pb n="497" type="ms"/>introductory Lecture,
							next October, to the Mechanic Institution— Began reading the Oration for
								<persRef ref="milo-titus">Milo</persRef>—and have now none left that
							I had not heretofore read— Of the others I read yesterday the last—for
								<persRef ref="postumus-caius">Caius Rabirius Postumus</persRef>—a
							short one <persRef ref="gabinius-aulus">Gabinius</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> old Enemy, after <unclear>his</unclear> return
							from Syria, was prosecuted de Majestate and acquitted— Then de pecuniis
							repetundis and condemned— At the earnest solicitation of <persRef
								ref="pompey">Pompey</persRef>, sustained by <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>, Cicero defended Gabinius,
							though on the second Prosecution without success— The charge was that
							Gabinius had received ten thousand Talents from <persRef
								ref="ptolemy-xii">Ptolemy Auletes</persRef>, king of Egypt, to
							restore him to his kingdom, without authority from the Senate, and
							contrary to the Sibylline verses— The Sentence upon Gabinius condemned
							him therefore to the payment of a fine of 10000 Talents— His whole
							fortune being inadequate to this, Rabirius Postumus was prosecuted under
							the clause of the Law, by which in such cases, the money might be
							recovered from any person to whom it should come, and Postumus was
							charged with having received a part of it— The defense is put by Cicero
							upon two grounds—first that the provision of the Law was not applicable
							to Postumus, who was a Roman Knight—and secondly that Postumus far from
							having received the king’s money had ruined himself by lending money to
							the king— The Prosecutor had reproached Cicero for his reconciliation
							with Gabinius, and he replies to this charge that he will never be
							ashamed to make his enmities mortal and his friendships perpetual— He
							strenuously denies that he had undertaken the defence of Gabinius from
							fear of the displeasure of Pompey; but his apologetic Letter to <persRef
								ref="lentulus-publius">Lentulus Spinther</persRef> holds a different
							language. The true account is doubtless in the Letter.</p>

						<p><persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> was somewhat
							relieved, from the inflammation of the eye, but was still confined to
							her bed— I had barely an opportunity to visit my plants in the garden,
							but to do nothing. The rain was afterwards unintermitted the whole day,
							and I wasted my time— Part of the afternoon occupied on the Catalogue of
							the Library— Continue the Oration for <persRef ref="milo-titus"
								>Milo</persRef>, Read an Article in the English Quarterly Review
							upon the French and British Peerage; and two in the 68<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> number of the North American Review—one
							upon a recent publication of the Letters of <persRef ref="joseph-ii"
								>Joseph the second</persRef> of Austria; and one a reply to the
							Article in the 99<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> number of the Edinburgh
							Review upon American Literature. The Article in the Quarterly is
							apparently from the pen of <persRef ref="southey-robert"
								>Southey</persRef> or from his school— It is curious, as well for
							its doctrines, as for a historical Review of the principal aristocratic
							families of England. It is surprising how few of those families remain—
							The jealousies of the reigning families against them, and the tragical
							end of almost every distinguished man among them for a succession of
							ages, afford matter for profound speculation. The writer shews and
							complains that from the time of the fall of the Coalition Ministry, and
							the accession of <persRef ref="pitt-william2">William Pitt</persRef> as
							prime Minister, a new system with regard to the creation of Peers has
							been adopted— The house of Lords has been about doubled in
							numbers—consisting in 1768 of 199. peers, and now of 328 besides
							representative peers and bishops, in all about 400. By this
							multiplication of peers he argues that the character of the house of
							Lords and the practical constitution of Great-Britain has been changed—
							The additional numbers, and the admission of men merely for riches
							acquired in trade, have sunk the Aristocratic weight and power of the
							house; and the removal from the lower house of all the men of wealth and
							family, which were formerly its principal ornament <pb n="498" type="ms"
							/>have also impaired its consideration, and weakened its influence. The
							general tendency of the Article is to undermine the reputation of
							William Pitt as a Statesman, and to represent him as influenced by an
							involuntary and perhaps unconscious prejudice against the Aristocracy—
							This is doubtless true, and that prejudice was much stronger in <persRef
								ref="canning-george">George Canning</persRef> than in Pitt— They
							both partook of the Spirit of the age, which is irresistibly republican;
							and anti-hereditary; but nature will ultimately vindicate her rights—
							The pride of blood is now invidious and odious.— It hides and disguises
							itself; but it can never be extinguished for it is inseparable from the
							natural affections between Parent and Child— To suppress it would be to
							eradicate one of the principal virtues of human nature. The article upon
							Joseph the Second gives some additional insight into his character,
							which was that of an ordinary mind, flattered by the delusions of
							hereditary Supreme power, into a self-conceit of greatness— <persRef
								ref="frederick-ii">Frederick the second</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="catherinethegreat">Catherine</persRef> of were distinguished
							for their Talents—and flattered into prodigies, by the literary
							trumpeters whom <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis the 14<hi
									rend="superscript">th.</hi></persRef> had taught them to count—
							Joseph fancied himself equal to Frederic or Catherine—and as much of
							Frederics fame was built upon his religious infidelity, Joseph thought
							he too must be a philosopher and reformer. This was the principal cause
							of his misfortunes and disappointments. His mind was never steady, and
							it is half a century since I heard that he was subject to vertiginous
							wanderings in the dog days— The Letters cited in this review indicate
							eccentricity. Of the Article upon the tone of British Criticism I may
							speak hereafter.</p>

								ref="tufts-cotton;tufts-mercy2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
									M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Cotton Tufts</persRef>— We
							returned after Sunset. <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S.
								Adams</persRef> was here— Showers. I finished the Oration for
								<persRef ref="milo-titus">Milo</persRef>: and read also that which
							is styled for <persRef ref="marcellus-marcus">Marcellus</persRef>—but it
							is only a personal address to <persRef ref="caesar-julius"
								>Caesar</persRef>, thanking him for consenting to the return of
							Marcus Marcellus from exile— These are considered as among the best of
							his Orations, and are included both in the French and English Selections
							of the Translators.— The Oration for Milo is said not to have been
							delivered, but composed after his condemnation, and sent to him while in
							Exile at Marseilles. The death of <persRef ref="clodius-publius"
								>Clodius</persRef> was one of the most important Events of that
							period. He was in fact murdered by the order, and the Servants of Milo—
							Their meeting was accidental— The brawl between their Servants
							unpremeditated—but Clodius being wounded had taken refuge in a house
							where Milo caused him to be dragged and despatched— The whole defence of
							Cicero therefore, rests upon a false statement of facts; and Milo was
							justly condemned, though he rendered a real Service to the Republic, by
							putting an end to that mischievous demagogue Clodius. The argument of
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>, founded upon
							circumstances and probabilities is very ingenious and convincing: but he
							assumed his facts, and they were totally different from those proved by
							the testimony. There is something ridiculous in this cold blooded
							composition of our eloquent discourse, upon imaginative facts, after a
							trial and Sentence of condemnation upon the real facts— The Oration for
							Milo has therefore never been a favourite of mine, especially as the
							true history of the trial is so discreditable to the Spirit of Cicero.
							He was disconcerted and intimidated by the military guard of <persRef
								ref="pompey">Pompey</persRef> and the frantic clamours of the
							Clodian rabble. This was very natural and excusable, and if the Oration
							is considered <pb n="499" type="ms"/>as an expedient to redeem the loss
							of reputation incurred at the trial, it has been eminently successful—
							The Address of thanks to Caesar in behalf of Marcellus is of a very
							different character; and I cannot separate from it the Sentiment of
							humiliation at the thought that a man like Cicero should have been
							reduced to the necessity of addressing Caesar, more as a Slave to a
							Master, than as one Proconsular Roman Senator to another— One of the
							consequences of this Oration has been to conciliate the minds of men,
							favourably to the character of Caesar; the most strangely compounded
							personage that ever appeared in human form. Angel and Daemon shared him
							between them; and his transcendant virtues apologize for the flattery
							which Cicero administers to him in this and in two other Orations. Yet
							they are not those in which the Orator himself appears to the greatest
							Advantage.</p>

							Caesar’s feet, and <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> joined
							them in supplication to Caesar for his pardon. Caesar was disposed to
							grant it, but <persRef ref="tubero-quintus">Quintus AElius
								Tubero</persRef>, who had himself been in <persRef ref="pompey"
								>Pompey’s</persRef> army, and at the battle of Pharsalia, entered a
							formal complaint that Ligarius had made the African campaign. Caesar
							then transferred the trial from his own house to the forum— It was to be
							sure as Cicero says a crimen novum et inauditum. Caesar was sitting as a
							judge to try a man for having been against him in the civil War, at the
							prosecution of another who had been on the same side— But <persRef
								ref="plutarch">Plutarch</persRef> says he had predetermined to
							condemn Ligarius, and suffered Cicero, to plead for him, only for the
							pleasure of hearing an eloquent harangue. As the Orator proceeded
							however his discourse caused vehement emotions in the mind of his
							hearer, and repeated changes of colour in his face; till when Cicero
							came to the passage about the battle of Pharsalia, the Dictator was so
							much discomposed, that several papers fell from his hands, and he
							pardoned Ligarius. This is a story which favours of the marvellous, and
							was perhaps invented, after the death both of Caesar and Cicero— Caesar
							was merciful in his victory— More so than any other leader of the civil
							Wars—far more so than Pompey would have been had he succeeded— Caesar
							seems to have been a man prepared by Providence to break down the Roman
							Republic and turn it into a Monarchy. But the Oration for Ligarius is
							not one of those which the friends of Freedom can read with much
							satisfaction— There is in it too much suppression of the free Spirit of
							the Speaker; too much servility—too much adulation to Caesar— Its
							greatest merit, is in the art with which the Orator works upon the
							Passions of the Master— Upon his pride— Upon his generosity; upon his
							love of fame—upon his fears— There is a mingled sensation of pain at
							beholding the greatest and purest mind of Rome, stooping in supplication
							to an inferior, and of pleasure at observing the ascendancy which it
							maintains by its influence, subjecting military supremacy itself to the
							overruling dominion of intellect. This is the glory of the Oration for
							Ligarius, and of its author.</p>

								>Ligarius</persRef>— Addressed to <persRef ref="caesar-julius"
								>Caesar</persRef> in his own house; to save Dejortarus from the loss

								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> is said to have
							failed— Dejotarus lost his kingdom, but perhaps recovered it after the
							death of Caesar which happened a few months after the delivery of this
							Oration— An argument before a usurping Dictator, to dissuade him from
							dethroning a barbarian king, gives no occasion for sympathy or

						<p><persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston and
							returned to dine— This was the second of a succession of days of extreme
							Summer heat— I barely looked into the Garden but soon took refuge in the
							house; from the intense power of the Sun— Bathed with my son <persRef
								key="adams-john2">John</persRef> and <persRef ref="buchanan-robert"
								>Robert Buchanan</persRef>. Swam from wharf to wharf, wearing a
							white night cap which gives full protection to the head, from the heat
							of the Sun. My Son Charles’s <persRef ref="adams-abigail4"
								>wife</persRef> was confined to her chamber with a Sick head ache
							the whole day— About Sun-set I rode with my son John and his wife over
							Milton Hill, and was employed with Charles after dinner upon the
							Catalogue— The heat disqualifies me for writing— I this day first saw
							two shoots from the stems of the willow which about the tenth of June I
							cut off near the ground— Charles stuck it into the ground near the
							bottom of the Nursery. There are several shoots from the root which I
							left in the ground; one of which I this day found was 13 inches long—
							Those from the top-stem shew the time which it takes the severed twig,
							to get a new root— The transplanted young apples trees have taken about
							the same time to put forth new leaves— The young Oaks and Horse-Chesnuts
							have all ceased growing for the present year. The plums and two yearling
							apples are arrested or checked by small black-flies, Aphides and ants
							which lodge themselves in the germinating leaves and curl them up— Some
							of the peach twigs are mouldy. <pb n="501" type="ms"/>I read the first
							Philippic of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>. This Series
							of fourteen Orations, is principally remarkable, as containing the last
							accents of the expiring Liberty of Rome— They were composed, and, with
							the exception of the second, delivered in the years of Rome 709 and 710
							the 63 and last year of Cicero’s Life— They follow immediately after the
							three Orations addressed to <persRef ref="caesar-julius"
								>Caesar</persRef>, and in character are strongly contrasted with
							them— By his victories in the civil Wars, Caesar had made himself the
							master of the world— Orations addressed to him were supplications for
							life and pardon— After his death the struggle of Cicero was to restore
							the Republic, and <persRef ref="antony-mark">Antony</persRef>
							occasionally affected to have the same object— The first Philippic is
							eminently beautiful— And is historically important as presenting a full
							exposition of Cicero’s motives, for attempting to pass into Greece,
							there to await the ensuing year and a change of Consuls; and for
							afterwards changing that intention, returning to Rome, and taking his
							Seat in the Senate— His answer to the threats of Antony for his absence
							from the Senate the preceding day, is full of moderation and of dignity.
							His address to the other Consul, <persRef ref="dolabella-publius"
								>Dolabella</persRef>, who had been his Son in Law, and disciple is
							affectionate, and deeply affecting; and there is a thrilling solemnity,
							in the repeated intimations which he gives, that he sees and despises
							the imminent danger to his own life, with which he is surrounded.</p>

							my Lord.” And that of the afternoon from John 1.29. “Behold the lamb of
							God, which taketh away the sin of the world.”— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Capen is a Unitarian, and explained what he understood by
							this afternoon’s text. I could not write; but began this morning upon
							the second Philippic, and read two Sermons of <persRef
								ref="barrow-isaac">Barrow</persRef>, upon a Peaceable Temper and
							Carriage— In these discourses I perceive that which of late years has
							brought up Barrow again as a favourite of the Tory critics in England.
							In presenting his arguments for cultivating a peaceable temper, he
							forbids all political disquisitions and enquiries. Passive obedience and
							non-resistance figure in his reasoning as unequivocally as in the song
							of the <persRef ref="vicarofbray">Vicar of Bray</persRef>— He assumes
							that the people in general have neither knowledge nor capacity to judge
							of the operations of the Government— That it is their duty not to meddle
							with them at all, not even to resist or to complain of misgovernment—
							But if Providence gives them bad Rulers to submit in Silence, and await
							the retributive Justice of Providence. This is neither palatable nor
							rational doctrine; nor would it be tolerated in England at this day,
							from the sturdiest candidate for a Mitre— Barrow was a Mathematician,
							and his Sermons, have something of the appearce of demonstration of
							problems. He seldom touches the heart— He has some observations upon
							human life and manners, but they are seldom profound, and still more
							rarely original— He generally quotes from the new Testament in its
							original Greek words— He quotes much also from the fathers, also in
							their Greek Original— The french divines also frequently cite the
							fathers, but they are the barrenest of all human authorities— I do not
							recollect a single sentence quoted from an ancient father, which struck
							me as deserving to be remembered— This Evening <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary;adams-abigail4">my daughters</persRef> rode out
							with <persRef ref="buchanan-robert">Robert Buchanan</persRef>, and I
							went in a Chaise with <pb n="502" type="ms"/>my Son John to Braintree,
							stopped at <persRef ref="thayer-solomon">Solomon Thayer’s</persRef>, and
							saw his new grain; a patch of which he reaped yesterday— He has now been
							told that it is the Leghorn wheat; and that the straw is that of which
							the Leghorn hats are made— He has now ascertained that it is a fall
							grain and must be sown in September— He has now an acre of it growing;
							like mine sown this Spring; and which will therefore not ripen till next
							Summer. This small patch was an experiment which he made with a small
							parcel of his seed on a vacant spot of ground and it has now come to
							maturity— <persRef ref="cranch-edward">Edward Cranch</persRef> and

								>Robert Buchanan</persRef> I bathed at the Mount Wollaston Beach,

							Continued reading the second Philippic, in the effort of which I am
							drawn away by a multiplicity of translations, notes and Commentaries.
							The preface of <persRef ref="olivet-pierre">d’Olivet</persRef> to the

								<persRef ref="u">Du Ryer’s</persRef> translation, is rather a

							In the judicial Orations, Duncan translates the Addresses to the Judges.
							Judices, by the words My Lords which sound very aukwardly— I have read

							Mexican Pearl fishery, and that in the North-American upon the first
							Volume of <persRef ref="moore-thomas">Moore’s</persRef> Life of <persRef

							election as honorary Member of the French Society of Universal

								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>; called by <persRef
								ref="juvenal">Juvenal</persRef> the divine— <persRef
								ref="antony-mark">Antony</persRef> had composed an Oration in answer
							to the first philippic, full of violence and fury— He had pronounced it
							in the Senate; but Cicero had not been present to hear him— His friends
							had dissuaded him from attending the Meeting, <pb n="503" type="ms"
							/>under apprehensions that Antony would resort to personal violence to
							destroy him— But Antony must have published his Oration; for the second
							Philippic is a professed and formal reply to it— Cicero wrote it at one
							of his Country Seats, and published, but never delivered it. Throughout
							the whole of this fierce contention, Cicero and Antony never met face to
							face— The Oration nevertheless supposes the presence of Antony— The
							greater part of it is addressed directly to him, and twice at least, in
							the 13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 34<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Sections it speaks of Antony as if manifesting signs of
							perturbation, while the Speaker is probing him to the quick— Much of the

							is inimitably beautiful, and the peroration is sublime—and if considered
							as it should be in connection with the subsequent Events, the foul
							proscription and the brutal murder of the Orator it is inexpressibly
							pathetic— The exhortation to Antony, to restore at last the Liberty of
							his Country, is so admirable in itself, that the reader scarcely thinks
							to enquire why it should be wasted upon such a man as the discourse has
							proved Antony to be— The character of Caesar as contrasted with that of
							Antony, is drawn with wonderful vigour and accuracy. The first 17.
							Sections are only replies to charges against Cicero by Antony. The
							Attack upon him by the review of his whole life begins at the 18<hi

							Gaul, with a view by the means of his armed force, to have the City
							always under his controul— About the last of September he left Rome, and
							went to Brundisium, where four Legions joined him from Macedonia— But
							two of those Legions deserted him, and joined the standard of <persRef
								ref="augustuscaesar">Octavius</persRef> who was upon his own

								>Cicero</persRef> pledges himself, with so much solemnity to the
							virtue and patriotism of Octavius Caesar, in which he was so fatally
							disappointed— The pledge was indeed compulsive— The creatures of Antony,
							supported their motions, for treating with him, by their distrust of the
							sincerity and good faith of Octavius; and Cicero who had no hope, but in
							the extermination of Antony, was forced to accept as genuine the
							professions of Octavius, who was indispensable for carrying on the War

							Cicero at the request of the Tribune <persRef ref="apuleius-publius"
								>Apuleius</persRef>, addressed the People, to inform them of what

							disapprove the deputation to Antony, as he did;—but he adds that the
							deputation amounts to a declaration of War, if Antony should not submit
							to the authority of the Senate, which it was a perfect certainty that he
							would not— Cicero therefore advises the people to wait with patience
							till the return of the delegates, which would demonstrate beyond all
							controversy the necessity of pushing on vigorously the War— He closes
							the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Philippic by assuring the Quirites,
							that other people can endure Servitude, but that Liberty was the
							peculiar property of the Romans— He mistook his tense.</p>

						<p>The day and Evening were again excessively sultry, and I was

							able to raise currents, strawberries, or any of the small seeded fruits

							of <persRef ref="woodley-robert">Woodley</persRef> called upon me and
							solicited a subscription for building a Church at Pawtucket
							Rhode-Island— He said he had come here at the request of some Irish
							Catholics working at the Rail-road; to perform the service of the Church
							for them at 1/2 past ten O’Clock to-morrow Morning— I said I had several

							the belly, from which they occasionally issue; and to which they return
							Like every other work of nature; its examination is a perpetual source
							of wonder— I read the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and six Sections
							of the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Philippic. The 7<hi

							his disapprobation. The subjects put in deliberation by the Consul, and
							by a tribune of the People— <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef> after referring to them, immediately diverges to
							the War with Antony, and argues against those who were constantly urging
							for Peace— He undertakes to prove that Peace with Antony, would be
							disgraceful, dangerous and impracticable— After discussing briefly those
							three points, he concludes by saying that as to the questions in
							deliberation he assents to the opinion of <persRef ref="publius">Publius
								Servilius</persRef>. The first of the deputies to Antony, <persRef

								>Philippus</persRef> returned with insolent answers of defiance from
							Antony— The Senate therefore passed a severe decree against him; but
							hesitated whether to call it a War, or a tumult— And his partizans,
							still clamoured for Peace, and spoke of sending another deputation to
							Antony. This is ardently opposed by Cicero who in mild language severely
							censures <persRef ref="calenus-quintus">Calenus</persRef> for favouring Antony, and the two returned deputies,
							for receiving and reporting the answer of Antony— There is a passage in
							the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Section in almost the identical
							words of Christ— In the body says Cicero, we suffer to be cut off or
							cauterized any member that injures the rest of the body— That one
							member, may perish rather than the whole body— So in the body of the
							Republic, to save the whole, the pestiferous part must be amputated.</p>

						<p><date>26. IV:15. </date>Monday.</p>
						<p>A cold Northeast wind, with frequent showers has succeeded the excessive
							Summer heats of the last ten days and confined me almost entirely to the
							house. The Althaea trees before my windows, opened their first flowers
							of the Season this day. I planted a whole cherry, and a stone in each of
							the three remaining stands, where I propose to raise fruit trees from
							the seed. I leave the two stands where the squashes have come up— The
							seed of this plant comes up in a week and opens into two oval seed
							leaves which spread to be near two inches long and an inch and a third
							wide; between these comes out in another week a heart shaped leaf on one
							side, and a denticulated spade shaped leaf on the other—at right angles
							to the seed leaves. The upper surface of the second pair of squash
							leaves has whitish spots all over it— This is now the condition of the
							plants from the two Squash seeds which I sowed the 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month without expectation that
							they would come up— That in the Summer house cellar sown three days
							later is not so far advanced— My attention fixes itself easily upon
							plants which I put into the ground myself and upon no others— I also
							planted a row of crushed currents between my two cherry rows, near the
							raspberry vine at the lower part of my nursery. Read the remainder of
							the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and ten Sections of the 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> Philippic— The tenth was a debate upon
							Letters received from <persRef ref="brutus-marcus">Marcus

								>Cicero</persRef> was to obtain from the Senate their approbation of
							the military operations of Brutus, in Macedonia, Illyria, and Greece,
							and to give him a regular command as Proconsul in those Provinces. In
							the formal motion of Cicero, Brutus is called Quintus Caepio Brutus, <pb

							name on being adopted by <persRef ref="caepio-quintus">Quintus
								Caepio</persRef>
							<persRef ref="servilia">his mother’s</persRef> brother— It appears by
							this Oration that there was a strong prejudice against Brutus, and that
							the Senators were much influenced by the fear of giving offence to the
							veterans of <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Julius Caesar’s</persRef>
							armies— I read also to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my

							Currants, part of which I steeped in two bottles of New-England Rum, and
							reserved the rest, for the experiment of planting to ascertain if I can
							raise them from the seed.— Wrote a short note in answer to Charles, and
							sent him a short Power to sign for me a Petition for a Meeting of the

								<persRef ref="butler-joseph">Butler’s</persRef> Analogy— Read also
							the remainder of the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Philippic.— The 11<hi rend="superscript"

							received, of the treacherous murder of <persRef ref="trebonius-gaius"
								>Trebonius</persRef>, at Smyrna by <persRef ref="dolabella-publius"
								>Dolabella</persRef>— Trebonius was one of the Assassins of <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>; and the pretext of Dolabella
							was to avenge that act— The Senate declared Dolabella, a public Enemy:
							even the partizans of <persRef ref="antony-mark">Antony</persRef> were
							among the most violent against him, and <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef> particularly thanks <persRef ref="calenus-quintus"
								>Calenus</persRef> for the severity of his opinion upon this
							deliberation— But there was a question to whom the command of the War
							against Dolabella should be assigned— Cicero most earnestly recommends
								<persRef ref="cassius">Cassius</persRef>; but was opposed by the
								<persRef ref="pansa-gaius">Consul Pansa</persRef>. The province of
							Asia was therefore assigned to the Consuls; but both of them having soon
							after perished the command did finally devolve upon Cassius, by whom
							Dolabella was at last vanquished, and put to death. Dolabella had been
							the friend and Son in Law of Cicero, who alludes to and deplores the
							fact in this Oration. The 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Philippic is
							a sharp remonstrance against a decree adopted by the Senate upon a
							proposal of the same Consul Pansa, to send a second deputation to
							Antony: consisting of <persRef ref="publius">P. Servilius</persRef>, and
							of Cicero himself— It appears he had been prevailed upon to assent for a
							moment to this measure, upon some equivocal assurances from Antony’s
							partizans; by which he avows plainly that he had been deceived. He urges
							with irresistible force the absurdity of a new deputation; the
							impossibility that it should be successful; and the peculiar incongruity
							that he should be one of the deputies— Yet he finally concludes that if
							it should be desired, he would still go, if he could with a prospect of
							personal safety in performing the Service— I walked this Evening to
								<persRef key="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef>, but saw only
								<persRef ref="adams-ann">his wife</persRef> and part of his family.
								<persRef ref="parker-isaac">Isaac Parker</persRef> Chief Justice of

							delivered an elaborate charge to the Grand Jury. On Saturday they had
							returned bills of Indictment against three persons, for being concerned
							in the murder, and the trial was to commence this day. On Saturday Night
							the Chief Justice came to Boston to spend the Sunday at home; whence he
							was destined to go, not again to Salem, but to the house appointed for
							all the living. Isaac Parker, preceded me one year at Cambridge; and

									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Daniel
								Greenleaf</persRef>. On our return home we left Abby at <persRef
								key="adams-thomas">her father’s</persRef>. I read the 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Philippic, delivered on the occasion of
							Letters received from <persRef ref="lepidus-marcus">Lepidus</persRef>,
							urging Peace with <persRef ref="antony-mark">Antony</persRef>. Lepidus
							was still trimming between the Parties; for he had but a short time
							before obtained the restitution of <persRef ref="pompeius-sextus"
								>Sextus</persRef> the Son of <persRef ref="pompey">Pompey the
								Great</persRef>. In this Oration <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef> treats the character of Lepidus with great
							respect, but proves the utter impossibility of Peace with Antony. To
							complete the demonstration he reads an entire Letter from Antony to
								<persRef ref="hirtius-aulus">Hirtius</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="augustuscaesar">Octavius Caesar</persRef>, and comments upon
							it sentence by sentence with keen severity. The Letter itself must have
							been deeply impressive upon those to whom it was written; professing
							that all of his object was to punish the murderers of <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Julius Caesar</persRef>, and that the Senate and
							their forces were nothing more than relics of the vanquished party of
							Pompey— The Letter is not disrespectful to Hirtius and Octavius, but
							insolent, ferociously sarcastic upon the Pompeian party, and
							inexpressibly bitter upon Cicero— Hirtius and Octavius sent the Letter
							to Cicero himself, and the use he made of it, decided the Resolution of
							the Senate against the recommendation of Lepidus. He concludes by
							assenting to the proposition of <persRef ref="publius"
								>Servilius</persRef> with regard to that recommendation, and by
							moving in addition a decree of honour in favour of Sextus Pompeius, who
							had offered his Services against Antony, and who would have marched his
							force to the deliverance of <persRef ref="brutus-decimus">Decimus
								Brutus</persRef> in Mutina, but for the apprehension of giving
							umbrage to the veterans of Julius Caesar in the armies of Hirtius and
							Octavius. The fate of the Republic depended upon these Veterans, and it
							was ultimately decided by them— Neither of the Consuls, Hirtius or
								<persRef ref="pansa-gaius">Pansa</persRef>, was cordial to the cause
							in which they were engaged, and in which they lost their Lives. Lepidus
							never fully joined in it, and soon united himself with Antony— Octavius
							basely betrayed it— In several of the Philippics, the fear and jealousy
							of the Veterans, breaks out in the language of Cicero; and he is always
							under evident embarrassment in speaking of them.</p>

						<p>A cold Northeast Storm, confined us to the house, and allowed me only a
							few minutes for my visit to the garden; where a squirrel perched on the
							fence near my Shellbark tree gave notice of his purpose to establish his
							domicil upon it; to await the maturity of the nuts. Our peas in the
							garden are past—but we have string beans, green corn, Potatoes,
							Cabbages, Cucumbers, Carrots, Beets and Parsnips— Turneps and Radishes
							not successful— Summer Squash just ripening. Rhubarb full grown—
							Rasberries all consumed— Blackberries and whortleberries, come in from
							abroad. I have had the ground broken up along the Western Wall of my
							Nursery; and propose to have a hedge fence of bushes to border it— I
							read the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and last of the Philippics,
							delivered in the Senate, on the receipt of the intelligence of the
							battle at Modena, where <persRef ref="antony-mark">Antony</persRef> had
							been defeated, by the <persRef ref="pansa-gaius;hirtius-aulus">two
								Consuls</persRef>, and by <persRef ref="augustuscaesar">Octavius
								Caesar</persRef>. From the Oration it appears that the Consul Pansa
								<pb n="510" type="ms"/>had received two dangerous wounds, but
							Hirtius had then escaped uninjured—this action however was not decisive;
							and <persRef ref="brutus-decimus">Decimus Brutus</persRef> was still
							besieged— Another battle was fought a day or two after, in which Antony
							was totally defeated, and compelled to raise the Siege, but the Consul
							Hirtius was killed— Pansa had already died of his wounds. The last
							Philippic was pronounced in the interval between the two battles, when
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> supposed both the
							Consuls to be living. Its object is to propose honours and rewards to
							the two Consuls and to Octavius and to their troops— He moves that the
							title of Imperator should be conferred upon the three Commanders, and
							fifty days of Supplications— That promises of large gratuities and of
							lands should be renewed to the victorious Soldiers; and that they should
							be extended to the Parents, Children or brothers of those who had been
							slain. A funeral eulogy upon them is included in the Oration; which is
							the last of fifty-six models of Eloquence, left by the greatest Orator
							that ever lived, and which have survived though not entire the wreck of
							nineteen Centuries— The Philippics are unmutilated, and are as valuable
							in the light of historical documents, as in that of consummate monuments
							of the genius and patriotism of their author. I answered also this day
							the extraordinary Letter lately received from <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">W. H. Crawford</persRef>.</p>

						<p>The Northeast Storm continued, and confined us all to the house as in
							Midwinter— I crushed a few currants, thimbleberries, and whortleberries
							to keep them till October, and others till next April—and to plant them
							fall and Spring, for the experiment of raising from the Seed— One of the
							English Oaks in the midst of <persRef ref="thayer-solomon"
								>Thayer’s</persRef> Leghorn Wheat is now putting out new leaves— My
							Nursery red Oak was staked to straiten him— The Leghorn wheat weeded—
							Many Althaea’s are coming up from seed, self-sown under the trees— The
							grass chokes them— I cleared it away round one of them to give it a
							chance to grow— These seeds come out just when the Trees blossom. Is it
							a general Law?— The black hen, of the Norman breed has been setting upon
							19 eggs and this day hatched seven chickens— This is the best breed of
							domestic fowls in the world; but my efforts to introduce them here have
							as yet been disappointed— <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis</persRef> sent me yesterday a
							deed from the Executors of <persRef ref="boylston-ward">W. N.
								Boylston</persRef> to <persRef ref="snow-gideon">Gideon
								Snow</persRef>, of Lands in Granville, executed and acknowledged by
							him and <persRef ref="boylston-alicia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Boylston</persRef>, for my signature— I signed it this Evening, and
							went to <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thomas Greenleaf’s</persRef>; who took the acknowledgment of it. I
							answered a Letter from my niece <persRef ref="clark-susanna">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Susan B. Clark</persRef>— I read the
							fragments of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> Orations—
							These fragments consist of quotations by various antient authors from
							twenty Orations, which were extant for several centuries after the death
							of Cicero, but which have since been lost; and from the missing parts of
							four which have come down incomplete— They are for the most part very
							short Single sentences, not easily understood without the context to
							which they belong; or the comment of the writer by whom they are quoted.
							Three fourths of them are from <persRef ref="asconius-quintus">Asconius
								Pedianus</persRef>, almost cotemporary with Cicero himself; and who
							even in the age of <persRef ref="augustuscaesar">Augustus</persRef>
							wrote a voluminous commentary upon his Orations. It is fortunate for
							mankind that the Admiration of Cicero’s genius and writings continued
							from his own age, and was not less enthusiastic under the tyranny of the
								<persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar’s</persRef> than it had been
							while the Republic existed. <persRef ref="virgil">Virgil</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="horace">Horace</persRef> indeed chose to forget him,
							and in Virgil’s Orabunt Causas Melius, was the sneaking adulation of a
							Slave— But <persRef ref="nepos-cornelius">Cornelius
								Nepos</persRef>—<persRef ref="livius-titus">Livy</persRef>—<persRef
								ref="paterculus-velleius">Velleius Paterculus</persRef>, <persRef

								>Quinctilian</persRef>
							<pb n="511" type="ms"/>were not afraid to express the feelings of honest
							hearts; and the Power of Eloquence and Patriotism over the mind, never
							lost its charm— I have now been three Months in going through his
							Orations; and find ample motive for devoting three more to them, if I
							should ever have them to spare— The pleadings in private Causes are,
							fewer than I had supposed— Almost all are political— Almost all
							connected with the Events of the Orator’s Life.</p>

							there, and returned with his Sister <persRef ref="foster-mary"
								>Mary</persRef> to Boston— The day was clear, but the wind was still
							at North-east, and the atmosphere chill, and extremely damp. Immediately
							after Sunset, a thick exhalation rose from the low meadow before my

							portended a South wind tomorrow— I planted this Morning a row of crushed

							lot given by <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> to the
							Town—some of its seeds, which appear to be ripe. But to vary the
							experiment, and chances of success, I shall gather some of the seeds,
							every week for the next two months. I began to read <persRef

							for <persRef ref="roscius-sextus">Roscius of Ameria</persRef>, I had
							passed by when on the 28<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April, I
							commenced with the Orations; because I had repeatedly, and quite
							recently read them before— But wishing now to make complete work with
							Cicero, I intend to read these again; but to proceed with the
							philosophical works at the same time— I read also to my wife part of two
							Chapters of <persRef ref="butler-joseph">Butler’s</persRef> Analogy.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> I rise between four and five,

							Testament, and two or three pages, of the fragments illustrating the
							Scriptures, published as Supplements to the English Translation of
								<persRef ref="calmet-augustin">Calmet’s</persRef> Dictionary— I had
							hoped to derive some instruction and entertainment from these; but most

							Exodus from Egypt, is curious, and the dissertation upon the Locust is

							the course of tide—and sometimes an hour or two for an evening walk and
							visit. Many afternoons have been absorbed by taking the catalogue of my
							Library not yet finished— Several lost, by the disqualifying heat of the
							weather— But the worst symptom is a growing and unresisted repugnance to
