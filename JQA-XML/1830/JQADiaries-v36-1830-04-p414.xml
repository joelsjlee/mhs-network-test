						<p><persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Steinhofer</persRef> is
							a German Clergyman, who came to solicit contributions for a German
							Church at Baltimore— <persRef ref="norman-thomas">Captain
								Norman</persRef> an old acquaintance of S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Petersburg was also here. He resides at Baltimore, and came
							here he said to a sick <persRef ref="u">Son</persRef>— The Son was some
							time since summoned here as a witness upon questions now before the
							Senate—in relation to the Affairs of the late Purser <persRef
								ref="timberlake-john">Timberlake</persRef>— He was on board the
							ship; and an assistant or clerk to him. He now resides at New-York, and
							after attending here as summoned fell sick, and has been very
							dangerously ill but is recovering— <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson</persRef> was here
							complaining of a return of his ill health for which he thinks of
							embarking again for France— The 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Book of
							the familiar Epistles consists of 17 Letters from <persRef
								ref="rufus-marcus">Marcus Coelius Rufus</persRef>
							<hi rend="italic">to</hi>
							<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>. They seem to be strangely
							misplaced; for about half the second Book consists of Letters from
							Cicero to him. These Letters however are precious—they paint the
							character of the man and of the age— They are written in a very good
							Style; reporting from Rome to Cicero in Cilicia, the principal
							proceedings of the Senate, and marking distinctly the approaches to the
							civil War. In the first Letter speaking of <persRef ref="pompey"
								>Pompey</persRef> he says, “write me what he said to you, and what
							he wished, for he is used to say one thing and intend another; though he
							has no skill to conceal his wishes— In another Letter he says that
								<persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef> makes it his object to
							obtain at any cost the friendship of the lowest class of People, and
							that he holds <persRef ref="curio-gaius">Curio</persRef> in great
							contempt— Yet Curio was afterwards the most devoted of his Creatures—
							Coelius himself was a great time server.— He succeeded in an election as
							Edile against a competitor named <persRef ref="hirrus-c"
								>Hirrus</persRef>, who he says after his defeat played the good
							citizen and made speeches against Caesar— Coelius himself did much the
							same— In the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Letter he lays down the
							broad principle, that in domestic dissensions, as long as they are
							disputed by argument, a man should take the most virtuous Life, but when
							it comes to fighting, the strongest— This was his reason for siding with
							Caesar—yet in the last Letter of the book he casts off the party of
							Caesar and seems greatly inclined to adopt the other.</p>

								Maury</persRef> of the navy Department came and introduced <persRef
								ref="u">his Cousin</persRef> from the State of Tennessee— <persRef
								ref="saltonstall-f">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Saltonstall</persRef> brought me a Letter of Introduction from
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward
								Everett</persRef>, and one to him from <persRef ref="davis-charles2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Aug. Davis</persRef> of
							New-York— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Saltonstall has formed a
							Settlement in the Island of Cuba, and has obtained in the name of
							another person a Spanish subject, a Steamboat privilege upon one of the
							Rivers of the Island. But wishing to hold it in his own name, he is
							about returning to the Island with the intention <pb n="415" type="ms"
							/>of becoming a Spanish subject by taking out Letters of Naturalization.
							And he wished to obtain Letters of introduction from me to the <persRef
								ref="vives-don">Governor and Captain General Vives</persRef> who he
							was informed entertained great Respect for me— I declined giving such
							Letters— First, because M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Saltonstall is a
							total Stranger to me—recommended by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Everett only upon the recommendation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Davis— Secondly, because M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Saltonstall
							proposes to become a Spanish Subjects, and has concerns of private
							interest, for which he wishes to secure the favour of the Governor and
							Captain General— How this may be viewed by him, I do not know, and a
							recommendation of the man might involve me in some responsibility for
							his projects— The facility with which men of character and consideration
							in this Country give recommendations leads to pernicious consequences—
							When the nomination of <persRef ref="lee-henry3">Henry Lee</persRef>
							some days since was rejected unanimously by the Senate on account of the
							surpassing infamy of his character, the Telegraph put the disgrace of
							the appointment, upon the recommendation of <persRef ref="marshall-john"
								>Chief Justice Marshall</persRef> and <persRef ref="mclean-john2"
								>Judge M’lean</persRef>— Pudet haec opprobria non potuisse refelli.—
							Some of their friends were startled, and finally took distinctions,
							alledging that they gave not recommendations but merely certificates of
							Talents— Good nature, unwillingness to refuse, and the repute of a kind
							and condescending disposition, are motives of such strong prevailment,
							that men of high reputation sign recommendations for all sorts of
							persons and things—for aspirants to Office; for Epic Poems,
							Spelling-books, Quack Medicines, Razor Straps and perpetual motions. I
							told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Saltonstall that my acquaintance
							with General Vivés had been altogether official, and that I had never
							ventured to give any person an introduction to him, but in his Official
							character and as connected with public affairs—regretting that I could
							not depart from this principle though wishing him success in his
							undertaking. <persRef ref="fendall-philip">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Fendall</persRef> called and sat with me an hour— He
							mentioned the splendid Speech of <persRef ref="clayton-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clayton</persRef>, the New Senator
							from Delaware, some of the Doctrines of which I think not sound, but
							which taken altogether is one of the most powerful and eloquent Orations
							ever delivered in either of the Hall’s of Congress— I received from
								<persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Jos. Blunt</persRef>, three half sheets
							of my chapters upon Russia, Turkey and Greece, which I revised, and
							answered him with a list of errata—</p>

							preferred a complaint to the House of Representatives against the Judge
							of the District Court of the United States, in that State <persRef

							House, have reported, Lawless says unanimously, that the judge should be
							impeached. The judge himself is here, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lawless supposes, that the impeachment will be tried at this Session of

								Torlade</persRef> the Chargé d’Affaires of <persRef ref="miguel-i"
								>Don Miguel</persRef>, king de facto of Portugal, was here—and told
							me he had received la triste nouvelle, of the death of the <persRef
								ref="carlota-joaquina">Queen Mother</persRef>. This woman is a
							Sister of <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">Ferdinand</persRef> of Spain and
							had the reputation of a fury— She conspired to dethrone the king her
							husband; and is understood to have been the heart and Soul of the
							Counter-revolution, and the instigatress of Miguel in all his
							abominations. I had thought the account of her death by no <pb n="416"
								type="ms"/>means a triste nouvelle. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Torlade said she was a woman of very energetic character, extremely
							attached to her friends—mais aussi, very vehement in her hatred— He then
							spoke of the National Sentiment of the Portuguese, and considered it as
							settling the title of Don Miguel to the Crown—for, said he, speculate as
							we may upon this subject we always must return to that eternal and
							inextinguishable principle the Sovereignty of the People. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Torlade said much also of his controversy
							with <persRef ref="pereira-joaquin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barroso Pereira</persRef>, for the Archives of the Portuguese
							Legation— The State Court in Philadelphia decided that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barroso having once enjoyed the immunities
							of a foreign Minister the tribunals of this Country could not deprive
							him of them; nor coerce him to surrender the Archives— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Torlade is sorely afflicted with this
							decision, and intends to have the question retried by the Supreme Court
							of the United States. It is among the whimsical results in the
							application of anomalous principles, that here is a foreign Minister who
							cannot obtain possession of the Archives of his Legation precisely
							because he is not amenable to the jurisdiction of the Country. The
							diplomatic privilege is arrayed against itself, and while it shelters
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barroso, leaves Torlade, helpless and
							impotent— As Barroso was of the Constitutional party and Torlade is the
							Representative of Miguel, our Judges, I have no doubt were the readier
							to avail themselves of the Jus Gentium in favour of the liberal party,
							and against the detested Rule of Don Miguel. <persRef

								Campbell</persRef>, this morning from Matthew 13.17 “If ye know
							these things, happy are ye if ye do them” and in the Evening from
							Matthew 13.3–8. “And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying,
							Behold, a sower went forth to sow,[”] &amp;c—the parable of the Sower—
							The doctrine drawn from this parable by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Campbell, was rather harsh— It is the general character of Presbyterian
							preaching to terrify rather than to allure— This does not altogether
							suit my temper. Believing in the goodness and Mercy of the Creator, I
							disbelieve those who represent him as existing only to hurl thunder—
							Nothing but Thunder. Nor do I think the moral character improved by
							tempering the mind to action under the perpetual terror of the
							scourge—incredulus Odi— The system is much easier for a preacher than
							that of operating either by argument or persuasion, and its tendency is
							to stiffen the influence of the preacher into Authority. The Negro Slave
							dreads the Overseer who holds the whip, more than the Master in whose
							name it is brandished— I listen with pleasure to expositions of the
							goodness and mercy of God, and delight in the 136<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> Psalm— Exhortations to righteousness and truth, brotherly
							kindness and charity have more prevailment over me, than unceasing
							denunciations of vengeance and punishment— There are however
							denominations of Christians who hold different opinions, and insist upon
							being doomed weekly, by their Pastors to the infernal Regions, and such
							are perhaps the Major part of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell’s
							Auditors. After the morning Service, <persRef ref="hodges-james">M<hi

								Wright</persRef> who is employed on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal;
								<persRef ref="degraff-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> De

							I read part of an Article in the Quarterly Review, for July 1828. upon
							Psalmody; and some pages of <persRef ref="sale-george">Sale’s</persRef>
							Preliminary Discourse, before his Translation of the Koran— I find this
							Book exceedingly difficult to read—chiefly on account of its
							tediousness— Sale himself both in the Preliminary Discourse and in the
							Notes on the Koran, shews himself profoundly learned in Arabic Religious
							Literature and History; and also versed in Jewish and Christian
							Theology— But he is manifestly partial to the impostor, and had read so
							much Arabic reverential and panegyrical Commentary upon the spurious
								<persRef ref="mahomet">Apostle</persRef>, and his Book that he was
							infected by the constant handling of the matter— The book itself is such
							a chaotic jumble of balderdash that its success presents the most
							astonishing monument of human imbecility, recorded in the history of the
							species.</p>

								Whittlesey</persRef> introduced <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef>,
							a young man who is about to commence business, and is going to New-York
							to purchase a Stock of goods— <persRef ref="spencer-ambrose">Judge

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gregory</persRef> of Albany, as an old
							revolutionary Officer and a neighbour of <persRef ref="sanford-nathan"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanford</persRef> the Senator,
							of whose politics and family they spoke freely— Sanford married for his
							third wife <persRef ref="buchanan-mary">Mary Buchanan</persRef>, who
							they say is very much respected in Albany— Sanford was a friend of the
							late Administration; and personally friendly to me, till he found it
							prudent to desert me; and then he silently ratted— His neighbours
							understand his character well; and I told them he would never be a
							martyr for any thing. At present his vote in the Senate counts one for
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren</persRef>, and a
							cypher for every thing else. The 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Book
							of the familiar Epistles contains 8 Letters to <persRef
								ref="varro-marcus">Marcus Tenentius Varro</persRef>, 5 to <persRef
								ref="dolabella-publius">Dolabella</persRef>, and 1 from him to
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>, and 12 to <persRef
								ref="paetus-papirius">Lucius Papirius Paetus</persRef>— The Letters
							to Varro are all expositions of the reasons for the course of Life which
							Cicero pursued, during the civil Wars, after the Battle of Pharsalia— It
							was that of submission to the power of <persRef ref="caesar-julius"
								>Caesar</persRef>—retirement into the Country; and devotion of all
							his time to Literature and philosophy— The 6<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> Letter is the most particular and impressive— It is one
							thing says Cicero, to endure what we cannot help, and another to approve
							what should be blamed— The extremest of all evils is the victory of a
							civil War— We live in a convulsed Republic—who can deny it? but let
							those look to that who have no resources provided for every condition of
							life— But if our Country cannot or will not command our services, who
							shall deny us the privilege of resorting to that course of life which
							many learned men, perhaps not correctly, but yet many have thought
							preferable even to the public service— In the next Letter he says he
							makes it a frequent practice to sup with the persons most in power— And
							with the next he sends to Varro his four Books of Academic Questions—
							The Letter from Dolabella is an earnest intreaty to Cicero, either to
							take the part of Caesar in the civil War; or else to take no part in it,
							and to withdraw to Athens, or some <pb n="418" type="ms"/>other place of
							retirement, till the War is over— The Letters to Dolabella are written
							at some distance of time from each other— One immediately after the
							death of <persRef ref="tullia">Tullia</persRef>—the last, after the
							Death of Caesar— Dolabella being Consul—whom he extols to the skies for
							destroying an Altar, erected to Caesar— The Letters to Paetus are
							remarkable for a vein of pleasantry running through them all— Paetus was
							himself a joker— And Cicero says that the old Romans had more Attic Salt
							than the Athenians themselves. And as for himself Ego autem mirifice
							capior facetiis— In the same Letter replying to one in which Paetus had
							urged him to resume his share in the transaction of public affairs, he
							says—you talk of <persRef ref="catulus-quintus">Catulus</persRef> and
							those times—but how different! Then, I was seated upon deck, and held
							the helm—now there is scarcely room in the hold. Do you think there
							would be one Senatus consultum the less, if I were at Naples? Even when
							I am at Rome, and walk the forum, the decrees of the Senate are all
							written at the house of my friend your admirer— And when it comes in to
							his head, my name is used for writing them: and I hear of a Senatus
							consultum, proclaimed in Armenia or Syria, said to have passed upon my
							Motion, when I had never heard a word of it before— Do not think I am
							joking. But be assured I have received Letters from remote kings,
							thanking me for their royal titles confirmed upon them at my
							proposition, when so far from calling them kings: I knew not so much as
							their existence— There were distributions of Lands made to the Soldiers
							of Caesar— Paetus was fearful that his Lands would be taken for that
							purpose, and wrote to enquire of Cicero, if there was danger— The answer
							is not positive— He refers Paetus to his friend <persRef
								ref="balbus-titus">Balbus</persRef>, much better acquainted with
							Caesar’s intentions than he, and who he says, drunk or sober, will tell
							him— Arms will always give the Law— And if Caesar himself wished a
							Republic as it ought to be, he could not make it, entangled as he is
							with so many associates.— Therefore my friend apply your heart to
							wisdom; pray for the best—expect the worst and be prepared for whatever
							may happen.— In the next Letter he tells Paetus that like <persRef
								ref="dionysius-ii">Dionysius of Syracuse</persRef> he has opened a
							school at <unclear>. . .</unclear> to which he invites him—and adds that
							he sups upon Peacocks— In the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> he gives
							an account of his daily course of life— In the 21<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> observations upon the epistolary Style— In the 22<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> a dissertation upon decency of language—
							In the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> written after the death of
							Caesar, he says he devotes his Nights and days to the service and
							Salvation of the Republic. The 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and
								26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Letters appear to be of an earlier

								ref="galba-servius">Galba</persRef> to Cicero. 3. from <persRef
								ref="pollio-gaius">Asinius Pollio</persRef>. 1 from Lepidus to
							Cicero, and 1. from Lepidus to the Senate and People— These Letters were
							all written in the last year of Cicero’s Life—while the War was waging
							with <persRef ref="antony-mark">Antony</persRef>. Plancus had been one
							of the favourites of <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Julius
								Caesar</persRef>, who had bestowed a large sum of money upon him.
							After the Death of Caesar, he was Praetor in Transalpine Gaul, where he
							commanded a large army. He was designated Consul with <persRef
								ref="brutus-decimus">Decimus Brutus</persRef>, the year after
								<persRef ref="hirtius-aulus">Hirtius</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="pansa-gaius">Pansa</persRef>. He was one of the Generals upon
							whom they relied to put down the rebellion of Antony, and in this
							Correspondence, he pledges himself in his Letters to the Senate and to
							Cicero that he will inflexibly maintain the cause of the Country—
							Notwithstanding all which he was treacherous— He first united his troops
							with those of Lepidus, who acted the same double dealing part; and they
							both joined Antony, after he had been beaten <pb n="420" type="ms"/>at
							Mutina. Lepidus first and Plancus afterwards— There is a long Letter
							from Plancus to the Senate, full of Apologies and professions of
							patriotism—several to Cicero, charging Lepidus with perfidy, and calling
							for reinforcements; and one in which he throws all the blame of Antony’s
							escape, after the battle at Mutina, upon <persRef ref="augustuscaesar"
								>Octavius Caesar</persRef>— He says—that Antony now lives, that
							Lepidus is with him, that they have no despicable armies—their
							hopes—their daring, are all attributable to young Caesar— And he
							concludes by saying that if Caesar yet will do his duty or if the
							African Legions will speedily come, the Republic will be safe in that
							quarter. It was but a few days after that the second Triumvirate was
							formed, and Plancus betrayed his Country like the rest— The Letter to
							Trebonius, relates to him the Meeting of the Senate on the 19<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of December, when he delivered the third
							Philippic— It was written however sometime afterwards for it mentions
							the death of <persRef ref="sulpicius-servius">Servius
								Sulpicius</persRef>, Trebonius himself was shortly afterwards
							treacherously murdered at Smyrna by <persRef ref="dolabella-publius"
								>Dolabella</persRef>. Pollio was a Prefect in Spain, by the
							appointment of Julius Caesar. But he declares his devotion to the
							Country, and that from his experience of the miseries of absolute power,
							he never would consent to such a state of things again— His third Letter
							gives an account of the Battles at Mutina, where the Consuls Hirtius and
							Pansa were both killed. The Letter from Lepidus to Cicero, promises
							stoutly to defend the Republic against Antony, and then comes the Letter
							to the Senate, protesting by all the Gods that he had been compelled by
							a mutiny of his own army to join with Antony</p>

						<p>Returning this morning from my walk, I was joined by <persRef

							an old acquaintance who was here five or six years since, very earnest
							in search of a place, which I believe he did not then succeed in

							or me. I believed he must bear that palm— He said he had then been
							two-hours up— I said I had been up little more than one hour. I asked
							him how long he proposed to stay here— He did not know, two or three
							months at least— He was in hopes of getting a place. He had not meddled
							much with Politics, but he was personally acquainted with <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>; and <persRef
								ref="barry-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Barry</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> R.
								M. Johnson</persRef> were his friends— He asked me whether the
							Consuls to the Barbary Powers had Salaries—to what amount—and how many
							of them there were— My answer to this question he took a paper and
							pencil from his pocket, and marked down, and intimated that I had
							omitted Syracuse from the list. He then enquired about the Consulate at
							London, but I told him that Office was filled— He asked if I thought the
							Bill for establishing two additional Deputy Postmasters General, now
							before Congress would pass— I thought not— He said others thought so
							too— And he told me of his visit to General Jackson, and of his taking
							tea with him; and other particulars equally interesting; and also of the
							settlement of some Estate at Leesburg, in which he has a concern— He is
							one of the Samples of a candid Office-hunter, and would have been more
							communicative, if I had manifested proportionable curiosity— He left me
							at the end of the Avenue. <pb n="421" type="ms"/>I rode on horseback an
							hour before dinner, but my horse was so skittish that I was in constant
							danger of being thrown; and that would have cost me at least a broken
							limb— There is no other exercise half so good for my health; but of
							eight horses that I have mounted within these two years, not one has
							been safe. I was this day very well fatigued; the consequence of which
							was that the Evening was nearly lost both for reading and writing— I am
							still endeavouring to make out something from the Koran, all the good
							parts of which seem to me like the ravings of a religious Maniac; crazed
							by overstrained study of the Bible— The sublime ideas of the Godhead,
							are borrowed from the old Testament, but greatly impaired— The day of
							Judgment and future Retribution from the gospels; but the punishments of
							the next life are rendered ludicrous by the manner of announcing them;
							and the rewards are corrupting by their gross sensuality— One of the
							remarkable features of the New-Testament is the extreme purity of
							thought, enjoined by Christ, and observed in all the writings of the
							Apostles, in every thing relating to the female sex— The reverse is one
							of the disgusting features of the Koran.</p>

								Condict</persRef>, a member of the House of Representatives from

								<persRef ref="u">Thomas</persRef>. <persRef ref="elliot-jonathan"
								>Jonathan Elliott</persRef> is publishing a collection of Debates in
							the State Conventions upon the Constitution of the United States; and he
							now proposes to publish a supplementary Volume containing a view or
							history of practical constructions of the Constitution by Congress. He
							came to-day, ostensibly to enquire of me where he could find Reports of
							the Debates in Congress from 1790 to 1795. I referred him to the Gazette
							of the United States; Andrew Brown’s Federal Gazette, and the Aurora
							Newspapers, and mentioned to him the principal topics of discussion
							which were agitated during that period— I also mentioned to him the
							fifth Volume of <persRef ref="marshall-john">Marshall’s</persRef> Life
							of <persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>, and to
								<persRef ref="pitkin-timothy">Pitkin’s</persRef> History of the
							United States for more particular information on those points, and lent
							him the fifth Volume of Marshall, that he might look over it more at
							leisure. He proposes to include in his collection the republication of
							the Journal of the Federal Convention of 1787.— The minutes of <persRef
								ref="yates-robert">Judge Yates</persRef> of New-York, who seceded
							from the Convention; and the pamphlet of <persRef ref="martin-luther"
								>Luther Martin</persRef>— And I recommended to him also to look up
							the newspaper lucubrations of <persRef ref="randolph-edmund">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Edmund Randolph</persRef> on both
							sides of the Question—he having changed sides at least four times in the
							course of the formation and adoption of the Constitution. Elliott said
							he had written to <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Madison</persRef>, requesting his book for publication;
							but he had answered that he had particular reasons for declining the
							publication at present— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elliott appeared
							to be satisfied with the information that I have him on the subject of
							his enquiries, and made some remarks indicating though not avowing a
							disposition to commence the publication of another Newspaper at this
							place. <pb n="422" type="ms"/>He said the members of the present
							Administration were all personally unpopular here; but that there was no
							spirited newspaper to express the sentiments of the People— The
							Intelligencer and the Journal were both altogether inefficient, and a
							paper of very different character would be required. I gave no
							countenance to those overtures if they were intended as such; and no
							encouragement to continue the conversation in that channel— He told me
							that <persRef ref="meehan-john">Meehan</persRef> had been the nominal
							purchaser of the Washington City Gazette in 1825. but that <persRef
								ref="eaton-john">John H. Eaton</persRef> had written a Letter to him

								Van Ness</persRef> endorsed the Notes— But that the paper had been
							purchased by a subscription to which several persons had contributed,
							and he had been obliged to sue the Notes. I heard him without pressing
							any enquiries upon him; and doubt whether he would incline to tell the
							whole truth relating to this Transaction— I received from <persRef
								ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph Blunt</persRef> a Letter, and three
							half-sheets of Letter-press, being the last of my chapters upon Russia,
							Turkey and Greece for the American Annual Register— I revised them and
							answered Blunt’s Letter— There are three ridiculous errors of the Press
							on the last page, which I asked to have corrected—</p>

						<p>Returned from my daily walk before the Sun rose. The rain began soon
							after and continued the whole day— The Sale of <persRef
								ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener’s</persRef> furniture was at last
							made. Since finishing the six chapters for the American Annual Register
							I am wasting time again; chiefly in miscellaneous reading. The 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Book of the familiar Epistles chiefly
							consists of the correspondence between <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef> and <persRef ref="brutus-decimus">Decimus
								Brutus</persRef> during the period of the last struggle with
								<persRef ref="antony-mark">Antony</persRef>. The alternation of
							hopes and fears, the exultation of victory and the anguish of
							disappointment; the agonies of expiring Liberty, are exhibited in this
							Book, with a power upon the imagination and heart which I cannot
							describe— The first Letter is from Decimus Brutus to <persRef
								ref="brutus-marcus">Marcus Brutus</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="cassius">Cassius</persRef>—written soon after the death of
								<persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>; when Antony was
							intending to use the veterans and the rabble to destroy the conspirators
							against Caesar— The second and third Letters are from Marcus Brutus and
							Cassius, who were Praetors, to Antony, the former demanding pledges of
							Antony, as Consul, for their safety in the City; the latter a spirited
							reply to an insolent answer from him, which is not given— There are then
							23. Letters between Cicero and Decimus Brutus, designated Consul, and
							Imperator in Cisalpine Gaul. Then a Letter from Cicero to <persRef
								ref="matius-gaius">Matius</persRef> with his answer, and finally one
							to <persRef ref="pulcher-appius">Appius</persRef> written at the time
							when Cicero was proposing to go into Greece— In the correspondence with
							Decimus Brutus, Cicero gently reproaches him with losing the opportunity
							of instantly pursuing and crushing Antony after his defeat— Brutus
							replies and shews that it was perhaps impossible. A fatality deemed to
							follow every attempt to save the Republic— The Death of both the
							Consuls, <persRef ref="hirtius-aulus">Hirtius</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="pansa-gaius">Pansa</persRef>, one killed, the other mortally
							wounded at the battle of Mutina, was so portentous an Event that it was
							attributed to treachery— <persRef ref="tacitus">Tacitus</persRef>
							intimates that <persRef ref="augustuscaesar">Augustus</persRef> was
							accused of having Pansa despatched by poison in dressing his wounds: and
								<persRef ref="paterculus-velleius">Velleius Paterculus</persRef>
							says that <pb n="423" type="ms"/>after the troops of <persRef
								ref="lepidus-marcus">Lepidus</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="plancus-lucius">Plancus</persRef> went over to Antony, Decimus
							Brutus was gradually deserted by his own army; finally fled for refuge
							to the house of a noble friend of his named <persRef ref="camelus"
								>Camelus</persRef>, and was there murdered by Ruffians employed by
							Antony, for the purpose— There is much excellent writing in the
							Correspondence with Brutus, the Laconism of whose style is more than
							once noticed by Cicero who tells him he will imitate it— One of his
							examples is “Quam multa, quam paucis!” The Letters are all short— In the
								20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Letter Brutus warns Cicero that
								<persRef ref="segulius-labeo">Labeo Segulius</persRef>, a man just
							like himself sibi simillimus, had told him that he had been with
							Octavius Caesar, and had much conversation with him about Cicero— That
							Octavius made no complaint against Cicero, except that Cicero had
							said—[“]laudandum, adolescentem, ornandum, <hi rend="italic"
								>tollandum</hi>.” and that Octavius added he would take care not to
							expose himself “ut <hi rend="italic">tolli</hi> possit.” Decimus says
							that he believes Octavius said no such thing; but that Labeo said it to
							him, or fabricated the whole story—and Labeo further said the Veterans
							were extremely violent in their discourse and threats against Cicero—and
							were highly indignant that neither Octavius nor Decimus were of the
							Decemvirs; but that Cicero engrossed the whole distribution of favours
							to himself— Cicero answers with a bitter execration of the Tale-bearer
							Labeo—wonders that either Octavius or Decimus should suffer him to talk
							with them alone—and that he had told the same story to every one who
							would hear him— He does not deny having used the words; but says that he
							regrets very much that he is himself one of the Decemvirs; and that he
							had warmly urged that every one of the commanding Generals should be;
							but had been defeated by the same persons who opposed every thing— This
							incident perhaps accounts for the cold blooded treachery with which
							Octavius consented to the proscription of Cicero.</p>

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="upham-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Upham</persRef> of Salem, Morning and Evening—first from 2. Timothy
							2.19. “Let every one that nameth the name of Christ, depart from
							iniquity.” The doctrine of which discourse was that the test of
							Christianity is good works— This doctrine I hold for sound, at least in
							the form in which it is announced by the text, as preceptive to the
							believer. Christianity is a system of Morals, and to depart from
							iniquity is the first of its duties. This indeed strictly considered is
							only negative and partial virtue— It is to abstain from wrong—and has
							bearing only upon our relations with others— The duty of the Christian
							is more comprehensive— It calls for active virtue—for self denial—for
							beneficence—for piety—for faith—all this will easily follow, with him
							who departs from iniquity. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Upham’s Sermon
							rather considered departure from iniquity as including all positive
							virtue, and without direct allusion to the calvinistic creed of
							Salvation by faith, and the atonement, reasoned against it by presenting
							the departure from iniquity as the whole sum of Christianity. The
							Evening Sermon was from 2. Corinthians 6.2. “Behold, now is the accepted
							time,” and it presented with great power of argument and persuasion, a
							truth which no one can question; which all acknowledge; but which few
							turn to practical account— The Sentiment in the text was addressed
							specially to the Corinthians, urging them to separate themselves from
							unbelievers, and not to receive the Grace of God in vain— But M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Upham’s commentary gave it a general
							application, of reference to the discharge of all social duties. It was
								<pb n="424" type="ms"/>against procrastination; and <persRef
								ref="horace">Horace’s</persRef> Carpe diem, would have been a theme
							as well adapted to the Discourse, as the text itself— The argument was
							well pressed home, and perhaps not one of the auditory felt more deeply
							than myself its force, its truth, its importance— Would that it could
							have its full effect upon my conduct! M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Upham did not very empathetically dwell upon the infinite consequence of
							his doctrine with reference to Salvation or preparation for death; but
							he left each of his hearers to make this application for himself— He
							said truly that whoever would accurately observe the character and
							conduct of his personal acquaintance, would invariably find that their
							usefulness and success in the world depended almost entirely upon the
							relative practical effect which they gave to this axiom—now is the
							excepted time— He said that now, was in truth all that Man could call
							Time— The past was gone—it was part of Eternity— The future was beyond
							the controul of Man—to multitudes it never came now was therefore the
							only moment of his existence of which man would dispose— And as a vivid
							illustration of the utter importance of man, to controul the future, he
							adverted to the phenomenon of the circulation of the blood— That
							perpetual miracle, the suspension of which for a single instant puts an
							end to human life— May I hope that this Lesson may be of some service to
							me, even for a few days? I heard it by accident, finding that there was
							no evening service at <persRef ref="campbell-john">M<hi

							particularly against me, in the whole Country. But he published and

							Cicero sends him with Letter 17. his preface de optimo genere dicendi,

							that if he were at Rome, he would see many things which would not
							delight him—things which delight not Caesar himself, he adds. Such is

							the victor, but also in compliance to those by whose aid the victory was

						<p>I have been persuaded to alter my time of taking my daily exercise; from
							the morning before breakfast to the middle of the day. One motive for

							has hung upon me nearly these four Months— <persRef

								Whittlesey</persRef>, Member of the House of Representatives from
							Ohio, introduced two young men; one of whom named <persRef
								ref="allen-john3">Allen</persRef> was the Son of a <persRef
								ref="allen-john4">member</persRef> of the House from Connecticut in
							1798 and 1799— I called as I had some time since promised at the chamber
							of <persRef ref="cranch-john">John Cranch</persRef>, where I met his
							brother <persRef ref="cranch-edward">Edward</persRef>. He had no Canvas
							ready, and asked me to call again to-morrow. <persRef
								ref="johnson-thomas-baker">T. B. Johnson</persRef> dined with us and
							spent the Evening here— I began a Letter to <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">A. H. Everett</persRef>, and it led me to
							three Articles written by him, in as many recent numbers of the
							North-American Review— The last upon the Tariff—one upon <persRef
								ref="malthus-thomas">Malthus’s</persRef> Definitions in Political
							Economy, and one upon <persRef ref="cousin-victor">professor
								Cousin’s</persRef> new System of Philosopy, which is mystifying the
							French Nation. I fell yesterday upon his Review in 1825 of <persRef
								ref="byron-george">Lord Byron’s</persRef> Works; which contains much
							sound criticism; with an estimate perhaps on the whole too severe of his
							Poetry— A century and a half ago, <persRef ref="derabutin-marie">Madame
								de Sevigné</persRef> predicted that the taste for <persRef
								ref="racine-jean">Racine</persRef>, and for Coffee, would soon pass
							away; and surely she did not imagine that her own fondling Letters to
								<persRef ref="desevigne-francoise">her daughter</persRef> would be
							read after a hundred and fifty years, to prove how weak her own judgment
							was in matters of taste— It is vain presumption for mortals to foretell
							what taste will be lasting, and what is destined to perish— Byron has
							been extolled, as the sublimest of Poets— There are passages in all his
							Poems, which I have thought charming—but mixed with so much that was
							disgusting, that I never believed his popularity would be lasting— His
							versification is so destitute of sustained harmony—many of his thoughts
							are so strained; his sentiments so unamiable, his misanthropy so gloomy,
							his images so grossly indelicate, his libertinism so shameless, his
							merriment such grinning of a ghastly smile; that I have always believed
							his verses would soon rank with forgotten <pb n="426" type="ms"/>things.
							But Byron was one of those writers whose lives are interwoven in all
							their works— The author keeps his reader forever in sight of himself—
							Such writers must always be vicious and miserable— For the world will
							suffer no man to entertain them long with his good deeds, or his
							happiness—</p>
						<lg>
							<l> It is a witness still of excellence</l>
							<l>To put a strange face on its own perfection.</l>
						</lg>
						<p>but the bad son—the faithless husband—the unfeeling father, by keeping
							the world in mind of their vices, seem to command sympathy by the mere
							faculty of painting their own wretchedness— The last Scenes of his life
							gave him a new and even a virtuous claim to commiseration; and his
							associates who survived him, have kept his memory alive; by making books
							to sell, out of the loose adventures, and characteristic anecdotes of
							his life— <persRef ref="moore-thomas">Moore</persRef> is now making the
							final, and largest speculation of this kind; and it may somewhat
							lengthen out his immortality. I shall not hazard a prophecy against
							him.— Morning visit from <persRef ref="menou-charles">Count de

								>Cicero’s</persRef> familiar Epistles consists of 79 Letters: to a

								<persRef ref="brutus-marcus">Marcus Brutus</persRef>, commanding
							there by appointment from <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>—
							After highly commending Varro, he says—I make no promises for him of
							qualities, concerning which you yourself will judge— But yet in all new
							connections, the first access, and the commendation by which the doors
							of Friendship are opened is important, and this is what I wished to do
							in this Letter: the same thing must be effected by the necessary duties
							of the quaestor’s Office— It will however suffer no diminution, by this

							recommendation of a young man named <persRef ref="praecilius"

							opposition to Caesar in the Civil Wars; for which he says the father of

							apologetical—written in an assumed tone of pleasantry; and concludes by
							observing that he had used a new style of Letter-writing to shew him
							that he intended no vulgar recommendation— There is more uniformity and
							less of interest in the other Letters of this book than in any of the

						<p>As I was walking out, I met <persRef ref="sparks-jared">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparks</persRef> who was coming to see
							me; and walked with him round the Capitol Hill— He said he had just
							returned from a visit to Pittsburg, where he had been to inspect the
							spot of <persRef ref="braddock-edward">Braddock’s</persRef> defeat in
							1755. which he had done much to his satisfaction— There was no person
							left there, who had any recollection of the Event, but there were many
							traditions, from which he had collected valuable information. I asked
							him when he expected to publish his Correspondence of <persRef
								ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>— He thought there would
							be a Volume out before the end of this year— I asked him how many
							volumes he supposed would complete the work—he said ten or twelve— I
							observed that the English Quarterly Review advised him to retrench the
							publication, and give but little—advice quite natural for Englishmen,
							who the less they heard about Washington, and the American Revolution
							the better pleased they were. He said that he had difficulties with the
							proprietors of the papers— That he could never obtain them from the late
								<persRef ref="washington-bushrod">Judge Washington</persRef>, till
							he held out to him the prospect of money, to be made by the publication,
							and his wish was to make the most money from it that he could— The
							present proprietor, <persRef ref="washington-george2">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Washington</persRef>, now a member of
							Congress had the same disposition— It was probable that a collection of
							four Volumes, would raise more money than ten or twelve, but he thought
							that the publication of all those, which would be useful as historical
							documents would be better for the public. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Sparks made some enquiries about <persRef ref="johnson-thomas3">Thomas
								Johnson</persRef>, who he said appeared from Washington’s papers to
							have been one of his intimate and confidential friends and asked if I
							knew who was in possession of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson’s
							papers— I gave him an account of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson
							and his family, and said I supposed his papers were in possession of
								<persRef ref="grahame-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Graham</persRef> of Frederick—but it was not probable they would be
							of much importance. He said he would write to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Graham— We conversed upon other subjects relating to the
							American Revolution— Upon <persRef ref="hutchinson-thomas"
								>Hutchinson’s</persRef> History— <persRef ref="murray-william">Lord
								Mansfield</persRef>, <persRef ref="burke-edmund">Burke</persRef>,
							and the author of Junius. He spoke also of <persRef ref="grahame-james"
								>Graham’s</persRef> History of the American Colonies; which he said
							had not succeeded in England— This is very natural; but is the very
							reason why it ought to succeed here— <persRef

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell</persRef>
							with me— Connell’s goes to-morrow Morning—returning to Philadelphia—
							Bailey spoke of the party movements here— A Party public dinner was got
							up on Tuesday, professedly in honour of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
								>Jefferson’s</persRef> birth day— Announced pompously in the
							Newspapers—with the names of 3 Committees of Members of Congress—a
							Committee of Arrangements—a Committee of invitations, and a Committee of
							Toasts— The Account of it has not yet been published; but Bailey says
							several of the Pennsylvania members withdrew, on discovering that the
							Toasts were anti-Tariff. Yesterday the Buffalo and New-Orleans road bill
							was rejected at the third reading, upon which <persRef
								ref="barbour-philip">Philip P. Barbour</persRef>, moved to adjourn;
							saying that the House had done enough for one day of glory. Some of the
							Tariff men took this in dudgeon, and <pb n="428" type="ms"/>this day the
							vote of rejection was reconsidered, and the Bill was laid on the Table
							to be taken up again at the next Session. An attempt was also made in
							the Senate on Tuesday, to reconsider the vote rejecting the nomination
							of <persRef ref="hill-isaac">Isaac Hill</persRef> as second Comptroller,
							but could not be carried; an so at the dinner Hill being present was
							toasted, with an insult upon the Senate— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bailey mentioned to me that it was his intention to decline a
							re-election to the next Congress, and expressed a wish to go into the
							Senate of the State.</p>

						<p>Sat to <persRef ref="cranch-john">J. Cranch</persRef>, who upon my asking
							him if the Portrait was finished requested one short sitting more, which
							I promised him on Monday or Tuesday— My occupation now again consists
							almost wholly of reading; and in the North American Review I have read
							the Article by <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H.
								Everett</persRef> on the Politics of Europe, and that of <persRef
								ref="sparks-jared">Jared Sparks</persRef> on the Early Diplomatic
							History of the United States— That of Everett is written with his
							Talent, and general knowledge of European Affairs— It is almost entirely
							upon the recent War between Russia and Turkey— He considers it
							altogether in a political point of view, and with reference to its
							probable effect on the balance of Power in Europe— His opinions with
							regard to the bearing of this subject on the policy of the United States
							are sound, but of the religious interests involved in it, there is not
							the slightest notice— All the European speculations that I have seen on
							this topic are equally silent, on that which I regard as a consideration
							for transcending all the others. To me it appears that the dissolution
							of the Turkish Empire must necessarily be followed by the extinction of
							the Mahometan Imposture— My design has been broadly to present that idea
							and hope, to the Christian World—but if noticed at all, it will be
							deemed extravagant and fanatical— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Sparks’s Article is upon the Life of <persRef ref="lee-arthur">Arthur
								Lee</persRef>; written in the Spirit that I had expected, but
							without much power. The fourteenth Book of the Epistles at diversos,
							consisting of 24 Letters is exclusively familiar, that is of family
							Letters, addressed, chiefly to his wife <persRef ref="terentia"
								>Terentia</persRef>; but some of them to her and their <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus2">Son</persRef> and <persRef ref="tullia"
								>daughter</persRef>; and some jointly with his Son to his wife and
							daughter. The four first of the Letters were written while he was in
							exile, and are too querulous. Others before and others after the battle
							of Pharsalia— Most of them very short, and all affectionate. <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">He</persRef> was afterwards divorced from
							Terentia, <persRef ref="plutarch">Plutarch</persRef> says he was
							reproached for this by <persRef ref="antony-mark">Antony</persRef> in
							his answer to the Philippics— That he soon after the divorce married a
								<persRef ref="publilias">young girl</persRef>, whose Guardian he
							was; for her Fortune—and then put her away because she was not
							sufficiently afflicted at the Death of his daughter Tullia. There is
							only one Letter in which he alludes to his second marriage, after his
							divorce from Terentia— The 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Book— In answer to congratulations from
								<persRef ref="plancius-cneius">Cneius Plancius</persRef>—he says— As
							to your good wishes upon what I have done, I am very sure that they are
							sincere; but in such a wretched a time, I should have sought no new
							condition of life, had I not, upon my return, found my domestic affairs
							in no better state than those of the Republic—but when by the baseness
							of those to whom in return for immortal benefits received from me, my
							welfare and fortunes ought to have been above all things dear, I found
							within my own walls, nothing safe, nothing but snares, I thought it
							indispensable to fortify myself by the faithfulness of new connections,
							against the perfidy of the old— This is a melancholy picture—how many
							heart-aches it reveals!</p>

						<p>Heard at the Unitarian Church <persRef ref="upham-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Upham</persRef>, in the morning from
							Romans 1:16. [“]For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is
							the power of God, unto salvation to every one that believeth:”—and after
							observing that these words were <persRef ref="paul">saint
								Paul’s</persRef>, and explaining the reasons which gave propriety to
							the expression of them; the discourse made an application of them to the
							present times; recommending that every individual to examine himself, to
							ascertain whether he is not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ— The
							influences which might occasion the sentiment, in the days of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul, it was observed, were different
							from those which might produce the same effect now— Then, the humble
							condition, and apparently lowly birth of Jesus, the persecutions he
							endured, his seemingly ignominious death—the subsequent dispersion of
							his followers; their obscurity, their sufferings, the powers of the
							world exercised against them had all a tendency to make even the
							disciples of Jesus, ashamed of his Gospel—and although these causes no
							longer exist, there are others which operate with equal force upon
							Christians of the present time— There <pb n="430" type="ms"/>were three
							tests by which a Christian might prove himself at this day not ashamed
							of the Gospel of Christ— 1 by his Life. 2 by his influence— 3. by his
							personal devotion to the cause— In the evening, after ascertaining that
							there was no service at <persRef ref="campbell-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell’s</persRef> I heard again
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Upham, from 1. Corinthians 2.9. “Eye
							hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of
							man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him”— In the
							Sermon it was observed that these words have no intimation of the nature
							of the enjoyments of a future State—the promise had reference only to
							the degree— In all ages, and in every Nation, among whom future
							retribution was an Article of Faith or hope, the pictures of happiness
							to be enjoyed, were of the most exquisite kind. There was an
							accumulation of all that constituted the most exquisite enjoyment upon
							Earth— Of all the senses the sight was that which ministered most to
							human enjoyment—and there was much eloquent description of the pleasures
							naturally derived from what the eye hath seen— A similar analysis was
							made of the enjoyments of hearing—and then it was remarked, how prolific
							the imagination of man had been in painting to itself the felicitations
							of the future Elysium—and then returning to the text we were encouraged
							to the certain hope that the real enjoyments of Heaven will transcend
							all this. The fascination of the discourse, which was listened to with
							the deepest attention, consisted in the multitude of details— It was a
							continual climax furnished by the text itself; and the conclusion
							naturally drawn from it was that this promise of transcendent bliss in a
							future life, was the most efficacious motive to embrace Christianity—
							There was an argument suggested though not much pressed, against the
							gloomy doctrines of those who address themselves only to the fears of
							men: with a remembrance that the first proclamation of the gospel; was
							as of glad tidings of great joy! I was much entertained and edified by
							this discourse— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Upham’s elocution is good
							notwithstanding a slight impediment in his speech, by the occasional
							inability of giving its true sound to the <hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—

								ref="smyth-alexander">Alexander Smyth</persRef>, one of the members
							of the House from Virginia— He died the day before yesterday, after a
							short illness. I took a short walk about midday, and another at the dusk
							of Evening. The 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> book of the Epistles
							ad diversos contains 21. Letters. The first and second are public
							despatches from the Government of Cilicia, addressed to the Consuls,
							Praetors, Tribunes of the People and Senate, and contain the narrative
							of his military operations against the Parthians. They are succeeded by
								<pb n="431" type="ms"/>two Letters to <persRef ref="cato-marcus"
								>Marcus Cato</persRef>, the latter relating much more in detail his
							warlike atchievements, and intreating Cato most earnestly to favour in
							the Senate his claim for a decree of Supplications, equivalent to a
							modern Te Deum. This was one of the usual accompaniments, or
							preliminaries to a Triumph— Cato did not comply with this request; but
							the Senate did decree the Supplications— Cato in his answer says that he
							is glad the Senate did pass the decree though he could not vote for its
							adoption— His reason for which, he tells him is, that he ascribes to
							Cicero himself all the glory of his great actions; while the
							Supplications would give a great part of the credit to the Gods— There
							is more of complaisance than of ingenuousness in this apology, which in
							our time would scarcely be deemed consistent with sentiments of true
							piety— <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> replies by thanking
							him for his good opinion, and for his rejoicing at that which he could
							approve— Adding that he proposes to demand the honours of a Triumph—on
							which occasion he again prays Cato to favour him, or at least to rejoice
							again if he should succeed— The breaking out of the Civil War
							immediately after his return from Cilicia prevented him from obtaining
							the Triumph— The Letters to Cato are followed by several to Marcus and
								<persRef ref="marcellus-caius">Caius Marcellus</persRef>, then by
							two to <persRef ref="paulus-lucius">Lucius Paulus</persRef>, acting and
							designated Consul’s; then by six to <persRef ref="cassius">Caius
								Cassius</persRef>, and finally two to <persRef ref="trebonius-gaius"
								>Trebonius</persRef>— There is a Letter to Trebonius in the 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> book, and several to Cassius in the
								12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> The separation from each other of
							Letters to the same person shews the careless arrangement of them; and
							the Chronological order is much disregarded— Cassius was an Epicurian,
							and Cicero occasionally rallies him upon his philosophy. In the 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Letter, written in the midst of <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Caesar’s</persRef> Spanish War he says after
							apologizing for the shortness of his Letter— [“]It would be longer if I
							had any gossiping news, for to touch upon any thing serious would be
							dangerous— You will say, we can laugh— Faith not easily—but we have no
							other consolation— Where then say you is Philosophy?— Your’s is in the
							kitchen— Mine is troublesome; for I am ashamed of servitude. So to avoid
							hearing the rebuke of <persRef ref="plato">Plato</persRef>, I task
							myself to something else.”— I have no better lesson but Christian
							resignation.</p>

						<p>Between three and four this morning I was awakened by a distant Serenade,
							and finding no prospect of further sleep, arose soon after four and
							trudged my walk round the Capitol Square, returning near home I met
								<persRef ref="spencer-ambrose">judge Spencer</persRef>— The <persRef
								ref="torlade-jacob">Chevalier Torlade d’Azambuja</persRef> the
							Minister of the king of Portugal de facto <persRef ref="miguel-i">Don
								Miguel</persRef>, called upon me, and shewed me a Letter that he had
							written to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>, making enquiries concerning the official standing of
								<persRef ref="pereira-joaquin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barroso Pereira</persRef>— Tis a very complicated case of diplomacy.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barroso first appeared here as a
							Consul of the old and now deceased <persRef ref="pedro-iv">king of
								Portugal</persRef>; after his return to Europe from Brazil; and
							under the Constitutional Government. Then came the partition between him
							and his eldest Son the present Emperor of Brazil; and his own assumption
							of the title of Emperor— Upon some notification of this by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barrozo, being <unclear>at</unclear> that
							time Secretary of State, I answered his Note, without giving the king
							the title of Emperor, but naming him according to the old diplomatic
							style, His most faithful Majesty. This did not satisfy M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Barroso who returned my Note declining to
							receive it unless with a formal acknowledgment of the Imperial title of
							his Master— No further notice was taken of him until some Months
							afterwards the old king died, and settled all questions respecting his
							title— At his death he left <persRef ref="maria-ii">one of his
								daughters</persRef> Regent, till his Son <pb n="432" type="ms"/>the
							Emperor of Brazil should take the Government into his hands. Don Miguel
							was then an Exile at Vienna— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barroso
							exercised his functions as Consul during the Regency, and until Miguel
							assumed the Crown.— On this last Event, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Barroso wrote a formal Note to the Secretary of State declaring that he
							was no longer the Representative of the Portuguese government, and
							pronouncing Don Miguel an Usurper. This was in July 1828— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay acknowledged the receipt of his Note,
							and informed him it would remain of Record in the Department. A Month
							afterwards M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torlade arrived with
							credentials, from the Portuguese Regency, but claiming to be received as
							accredited by Miguel as King of Portugal— Without entering into the
							question of Don Miguel’s legitimacy, I declined receiving M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Torlade, on the principle that as by his
							own shewing, the authority by which he had been accredited was extinct,
							he could not be received upon those credentials—and the Government of
							the United States could not decide in advance upon any other credentials
							which he might afterwards receive— And thus the matter rested at the
							close of the last Administration— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torlade
							received his new Credentials a few days before that time—but I left to
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">my Successor</persRef> the decision of
							the question whether Don Miguel should be recognized as king of
							Portugal, or not: as the responsibility of the recognition must
							necessarily fall upon the present Administration, and Miguel was then
							acknowledged by no other European Government. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Torlade was soon after received; and has ever since been
							ineffectually claiming from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barroso the
							Archives of the Portuguese Legation. He first applied to the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Secretary of State</persRef> for compulsive
							means in aid of his demand. The opinion of the <persRef
								ref="berrien-john">Attorney-General</persRef> was taken, and he was
							refered to the judicial tribunals— The Court in Pennsylvania decided
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barroso having once been received as
							a diplomatic Agent, was entitled to the privileges of the Laws of
							Nations, and not amenable to compulsive process here— The question is to
							be brought before the Supreme Court of the United States, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Torlade hinted that he might have occasion
							for my testimony before the Court— His object now was only to write to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, to make some enquiries of him
							respecting M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barroso’s self-divestment of
							the diplomatic character in July 1828. He said he proposed to send this
							Letter to the Secretary of State, with a request that it may be
							transmitted to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay; but he had thought
							as it related to transactions under my administration, that he ought
							before sending it to communicate it to me. I told him I saw no objection
							to his sending it as he proposed, and had no doubt he would receive from
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay a candid answer—</p>

								Whittlesey</persRef> introduced a <persRef ref="u">M<hi

							Ohio. He had also an account rendered by three Commissioners appointed
							by me in March 1825 to mark and lay out a road from S<hi

							Republic of Mexico— There was an appropriation of thirty thousand

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whittlesey enquired if I had any

							is dated in November 1827: but I had a general recollection of the
							appointment and proceedings of the Commissioners. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whittlesey <pb n="433" type="ms"/>said he
							applied to me, because the Secretary of War refused to give any
							information to individual Senators or Members of the House, and even to
							Committees, yielding it only to formal Resolutions of either house—
								<persRef ref="elliot-jonathan">Jonathan Elliott</persRef> called on
							me again, concerning the third Volume which he is about to publish, on

							and asked me if I could give him any additional suggestion connected
							with the subject— I mentioned to him several persons who had delivered
							opinions upon questions of Constitutional Construction, and recommended
							to him to add to his list of heads, the acquisition of Louisiana, as the
							most important of them all; which he said he would. <persRef

								Fendall</persRef> called, to enquire if I had finished the

							waiting for it— We had a long conversation upon the aspect of political
							affairs at the present time, and the movements of the present
							Administration— The nominations are yet labouring in the Senate, and he
							says that there is a Report of a Committee of the Senate, bearing so
							heavily upon J. H. Eaton in his connection with <persRef

						<p>Rising at the dawn of day, I walk to avoid the necessity of reading or

								Hodgson</persRef> came to inform me that the act of Congress by
							which a small Clerkship with a Salary of 1000 dollars a year is added to
							the Department of State, and to which he has the promise of being
							appointed received yesterday the Signature of the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>— This is something—but
							Hodgson would render more essential Service to the Country in Greece, or
							at Constantinople— He said he believed that a <persRef
								ref="rhind-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rind</persRef>,
							of New-York, who has been appointed Consul of the United States at
							Odessa, and who embarked for his Post last November, had instructions to
							make some stay at Constantinople; and that <persRef ref="biddle-james"
								>Commodore Biddle</persRef> had also Instructions upon the subject—
							I asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hodgson if among the Manuscripts
							he has brought home there was a copy of the Koran; and of the Sonna— He
							said there was of the Koran—and he believed of the Sonna— The sixteenth
							Book of Epistles ad Diversos, consists of 27. Letters, all addressed to
								<persRef ref="tiro-marcus">Tiro</persRef> the freedman of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>; written some by him—some by
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus2">his Son</persRef>— Some by his brother
								<persRef ref="cicero-quintus">Quintus</persRef>, and some by two, or
							all of them— The Letters of Cicero, are in a Style different from those
							in the other books— They are full of kindness and affection, mingled
							with a spice of authority marking the relations between the parties— It
							appears from them, that Cicero, on his return from his Proconsular
							Government of Cilicia, was obliged to leave Tiro behind him at Patrae,
							he having fallen sick of a fever, so that he could not proceed— He was
							detained there a considerable time; for there are several Letters in
							which Cicero specially enjoins upon him, not to <pb n="434" type="ms"
							/>come on until so surely convalescent as to incur no danger of a
							relapse—and he gives him credits to pay the physician handsomely— In one
							Letter he says— Your good offices to me are numberless—at home—in the
							forum—in the City—in the Province— In private—in public—in my studies—in
							my literary pursuits. You will surpass them all, if I can see you, and I
							hope, in health. All the rest are in the same tone— Only two or three of
							them mention politics and those barely in general terms— The Letters
							from the Son affect pleasantry—the last two are from Quintus— in the
								26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> he jokingly reproves Tiro, for
							having neglected an opportunity of writing to him— You must engage
							Marcus, says he, to prove by a deeply studied, and much commented
							Oration, that you have not been to blame. And I must plainly insist that
							you should do, as I remember <persRef ref="cicero-helvia">my
								mother</persRef> used to do, of old. She sealed up empty bottles, so
							that others might not be found empty, by surprize: so you, if you have
							nothing to write; must still write to shew it is not by a furtive
							omission— In the last Letter he inveighs indignantly against both the
							Consuls <persRef ref="hirtius-aulus">Hirtius</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="pansa-gaius">Pansa</persRef>. Both of them soon after lost
							their lives in the cause of the Country, although the Sincerity of their

							brought me the book and pamphlets that I had requested—and he shewed me
							a Note from the French Chargé d’Affaires, <persRef ref="menou-charles"
								>Count Menou</persRef>, complaining that a discriminating duty had
							been expected of 10 per Cent on the Cargo of a French vessel entered at
							Pensacola, in contravention as he represents to the Convention of 28.
							June 1822 between the United States and France— By the Florida-cession
							Treaty it was stipulated that for twelve years to commence three Months
							after the exchange of the Ratification, the vessels of Spain and their
							Cargoes, should pay no other or higher duties in the Ports of the
							Province than those of the United States; and that during that time
							these privileges should be enjoyed by no other Nation. This privilege
							commenced in June 1821. and will continue till June 1833. By the first
							and second Articles of the Convention with France; a scale of
							discriminating duties upon Cargoes, not to be exceeded is prescribed;
							and by the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article a discriminating
							duty of Tonnage is also fixed— The Convention itself was to continue for
							two years—and further, each party having after that time the power to
							put an end to it, by giving six Months notice to the other— And the
							discriminating duties of the first and second Articles were to be
							diminished, one fourth part every year—so that in June 1826 they ceased
							altogether. There is of course since June 1826 no discriminating duties
							upon the Cargoes of French Vessels—being of French produce, to be levied
							in the Ports of the United States— The Collector of Pensacola did
							however levy the ten per Cent additional duty on the Cargo of the French
							ship Pactole; upon which Count Menou claims the benefit of the
							Convention— The Collector of the Port in 1828 had written for
							instructions, to the <persRef key="rush-richard">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef>, and upon reference of his Letter to the first
							Comptroller, <persRef ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Anderson</persRef> answered it, as if the question had
							been applicable only to the Tonnage—upon which the discriminating duty
							is unquestionably to be paid— But the Count de Menou’s claim of
							exemption is <pb n="435" type="ms"/>only for the Cargo, and I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent I thought it was valid—and not
							incompatible with the engagement to Spain in the Florida cession Treaty—
							French vessels being still subject to the discriminating duty on
							Tonnage, and therefore not entitled to the privileges of Vessels of the
							United States— I said it was however a question upon the construction of
							the Treaties, on which it would be well to take the opinion of the
								<persRef ref="berrien-john">Attorney General</persRef>; which he
							said he would do— Visit from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, who
							has been twice absent—several weeks; in Pennsylvania; and who proposes
							to remove thither with his family: but has not yet determined to what
							part of the State he will go— I told him I thought he was right in the
							intention to remove; and hoped he would be instrumental in saving the
							Union—which I believed depended entirely upon Pennsylvania; and upon the
							accomplishment of a great change in her political partialities. This is
							the forlorn hope of the Union.— I took an hour’s ride with my Son
								<persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> after dinner— Finished

								Naudain</persRef> a Senator from Delaware came and introduced
								<persRef ref="johns-kensey2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kinsey
								Johns</persRef> Chief Justice of that State, and father of the
								<persRef ref="johns-kensey">Representative</persRef> in Congress
							from the District— Took half an hour’s ride with <persRef
								key="adams-john2">John</persRef> after dinner— The change of weather
							has made me sluggish in writing— I read this morning <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> Oration for <persRef
								ref="gallus-quintus">Roscius</persRef> the Comedian—a fragment.
							There are three books of Epistles to <persRef ref="cicero-quintus"
								>Quintus</persRef>, but there is no apparent reason why they should
							be so divided— The first of the first book was written when Quintus was
							Propraetor in the Province of Asia— He had according to the usage drawn
							this command by lot—had held it two years; and it was now continued to
							him for a third— It is a long Letter of advice; and full of admirable
							precepts to guard him against the common vices of the provincial
							Governors—many of whom plundered and oppressed without mercy or
							controul, the People of their Provinces— Cicero disclaims all intention
							of advising his brother against this, well knowing that it was not in
							his Nature to be guilty of such atrocious offences— But he warns him to
							avoid all partialities or favoritism in his relations with the
							inhabitants. To hold a severe controul over all his subordinate
							Officers— To suffer none of his Slaves or freedmen to exercise influence
							over him in any matter of business—and above all to rule his own Spirit,
							and refrain from Anger—to which he was not a little addicted. It is an
							admirable Letter—fit at this day to serve as a manual of morals to every
							man in authority, and even to every father of a family. The next Letter
							shews however that it was not altogether efficacious upon Quintus— It
							reproves him severely for the ascendancy which a freedman named Statius
							had acquired over him, and for certain rude and insulting expressions,
							which Quintus was charged with having used, as well in his conversations
							as in Letters— It is apparent that Quintus was a rash, hot-headed, and
							harsh tempered man— From other Letters, particularly to <persRef
								ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>, it is clear that he lived
							upon very bad terms with <persRef ref="pomponia">his wife</persRef>—and
							with <persRef ref="cicero-quintus2">his Son</persRef>, who was much
							worse than himself— Quintus seems to have been an honest man, and a
							Patriot— Sincerely devoted to his brother, whose attachment to him, like
							all his domestic affections, was ardent and faithful— In the first book

						<p>Heard at the Unitarian Church <persRef ref="upham-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Upham</persRef>, in the morning from
							Matthew 11.15. [“]He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.” There is a
							very clear and strong connection between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Upham’s texts and his Sermons, though it is not always immediately
							perceived. In this case he considered the emphatic call of Jesus upon
							his disciples, to <hi rend="italic">hear</hi>, as a distinct and
							forcible appeal to their Reason, to judge of his doctrines, by the
							dictates of their own understandings— The discourse was an argument
							urged with great earnestness and ingenuity in behalf of the exercise of
							the Reason upon the doctrines of Christianity— He contended that the
							doctrine which requires Faith, independent of the exercise of Reason, is
							precisely the same as the doctrine of the Infidel— It admits that
							Revelation can not be maintained by Reason— The Infidel affirms the same
							thing. He rejects Revelation, because he says it will not abide the test
							of Reason— The other resorts to Faith, precisely upon the same ground.
							He also pointed out the distinction between things above comprehension
							and things contrary to reason. Said it was impossible to believe that
							which the mind could not comprehend— Instance; the grass grows—the tide
							rises— These are facts perfectly comprehensible— The causes of these
							phenomena, reason cannot indeed comprehend—nor are they subjects of
							belief. This is a difficult and delicate topic— Perhaps we must believe
							some things which our reason cannot comprehend— The conclusions of human
							reason differ, in different individuals— There are many things upon
							which it can come to no conclusion— Belief must then be founded upon
							confidence; or upon authority; and must depend upon the Will— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> went with me in the Evening— The text was from
							Matthew 7:13. “Enter ye in at the strait gate.”— This text seems to
							suggest doctrines rather of the <persRef ref="calvin-john"
								>Calvinistic</persRef> than of the Unitarian denomination. He
							explained the text as importing in the original that the gate is narrow
							as well as strait, and the difficulties and obstructions in the way of
							life are so great and multiplied, that only few are successful in
							pursuing it— He then entered into the enquiry what were the causes of
							these difficulties and obstructions, which he found to be two—Erroneous
							opinions; and irresolution. Erroneous opinions were of two kinds— For
							example The belief in the tri personality of the Deity was a serious and
							very injurious error, because it confused our ideas of the Divine
							Nature, and obscured the simple and sublime idea of the Unity of God—
							But it was not a fatal error, because it had no unfavourable effect upon
							the moral conduct. But if the Creator, the Preserver, and the Governor
							of all worlds, should be taken; not in that endearing, and affectionate
							character of a father, in which we are commanded by our Lord to consider
							him, but as a cruel tyrant delighting in the wretchedness of his
							Creatures, this has so direct a tendency to deprave and corrupt the
							conduct of the believer that <pb n="437" type="ms"/>we might safely
							pronounce it a fatal error— The second Cause of obstructions to the
							passage of the narrow gate was irresolution—want of firmness to do that
							which we know and feel to be right— Upon which he appealed to the
							consciousness of his hearers, and made some sensible but not novel
							remarks— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Upham has an uncommon faculty of
							rivetting the attention of his hearers. There was an Anthem sung at the
							close of each of the Services.</p>

						<p>After heavy rain great part of the Night, and for an hour after I rose
							this morning it held up and I walked my round before Breakfast. It
							cleared up towards night and the Sun Set in a Chrystal Sky— <persRef
								ref="bell-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef>,
							Senator from New Hampshire paid me a Morning visit. He mentioned that
							many of the nominations are yet pending in the Senate; and said it was
							generally rumoured that <persRef ref="hill-isaac">Isaac Hill</persRef>
							would be renominated to the Senate for the Office of second Comptroller:
							and he thought in that event the nomination would pass by the casting
							vote of the <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Vice-President</persRef>. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell says that the action of the Senate
							now depends upon <persRef ref="tazewell-littleton">Tazewell</persRef>;
							who is discontented, and disapproves of almost every thing that is done;
							but votes for all that he disapproves— Tazewell as to the question of
							the succession to the Presidency is for Calhoun in preference to
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef>— The Collection
							of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero’s</persRef> Epistles concludes
							with a Book of 18 Letters to <persRef ref="brutus-marcus"
								>Brutus</persRef>; followed by 5 others, said to have been
							discovered more than a century since in Germany. All the Letters to
							Brutus are of dates subsequent to the Death of <persRef
								ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>— In this correspondence, there
							is much diversity, and even opposition of opinion between the parties—
							The disposition of Brutus was inclined more to clemency towards the
							connections of the adverse party than that of Cicero. Brutus was for
							sparing the <persRef ref="antonius-lucius;antonius-gaius"
								>brothers</persRef> of <persRef ref="antony-mark">Mark
								Antony</persRef>—and he had a sharp controversy with Cicero for the
								<persRef ref="lepidus-the-younger">Sons</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="lepidus-marcus">Lepidus</persRef>, whose <persRef
								ref="junia-secunda">wife</persRef> was Sister to Brutus. On this
							point Cicero reluctantly gave way. But the great dissension between them
							was on account of the honours which Cicero concurred in showering upon
								<persRef ref="augustuscaesar">Octavius Caesar</persRef>; and
							especially upon a passage of a Letter from Cicero to Octavius, in which
							he intreated him to save the lives of the <persRef
								ref="cassius;brutus-decimus">Assassins</persRef> of Julius Caesar.
							There is a Letter of bitter reproach from Brutus to Cicero, and another
							to <persRef ref="atticus-titus">Atticus</persRef>, on this subject— To
							these there is no direct replies from Cicero; but there are Letters of
							deep though subdued sensibility, assigning the reasons for his opinions
							and proposals of measures honorary to Octavius; and most anxiously
							urging Brutus to come with his own army into Italy, to relieve them from
							the dependence under which they were upon the legions of Octavius. But
							Brutus never came, and Cicero was sacrificed by the treachery of
							Octavius to the brutal revenge of Antony, and Brutus himself fell by his
							own hand at the fatal field of the Philippi. <persRef ref="plutarch"
								>Plutarch</persRef> very briefly refers to the compliances of Cicero
							towards Octavius, by whom he thinks Cicero was deceived; and to these
							hard complaints of Brutus— I think Cicero was not deceived by Octavius—
							His policy towards him was compulsory—he considered him, as he was, the
							forlorn hope of the Republican cause— Octavius was to Cicero, like the
							bough of the old tree, issuing from the summit of the Rock, in <persRef
								ref="girodet-anne">Girard’s</persRef> Scene of the Deluge— The wife
							and children hang to the skirts of the husband and father who has swum
							to the edge of the rock the top of <hi rend="strikethrough">ye</hi>
							which is yet above the encroaching wave— He has seized with convulsive
							grasp the overhanging bough—the tree is in decay; the bough breaks from
							the stem out of which it grew, and the family are remanded to the
							unsparing deep. Cicero was the father of this family, and Octavius was
							the rotten bough. The last of the Epistles is from <persRef
								ref="cicero-quintus">Quintus</persRef> to his brother, written when
							he was a Candidate for the Office of Consul—very elaborate, and curious
							as picturing the manner of the times, and the customary arts of
							canvassing for the chief magistracy of Rome.</p>

								Whittlesey</persRef> of Ohio introduced three of their friends from

							>Corbin</persRef>, came to see me to gratify his curiosity— He said he
							was a native of Chenango County New-York, but has been keeping school
							the last six Months at Allentown in Pennsylvania; and is now going to
							seek his fortune in the Western Country— The day being clear, and the
							Sun shining bright, I went between 2. and 3. afternoon, to see a Solar
							microscope exhibited in the Pennsylvania Avenue— Met there <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Post</persRef> the
							Pennsylvania Clergyman. The exhibitor did not well understand his
							business— The process of crystallization was imperfectly shewn—living
							animals in a drop of cyder vinegar: and in the dust of cheese. Then legs
							and wings of flies, bees and wasps— The sting of a wasp—a louse, a flea
							a moschito and various kinds of wood— The animals have thus magnified a
							formidable appearance; and the sting of the wasp swollen to the size of
							a crow bar terminated in a point much sharper than that of a fine
							cambrick Needle.— I am now reading so many things at once that it
							produces a painful confusion of mind; and my writing is neglected— I
							have begun upon the Orations of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef>— Still labouring upon <persRef ref="sale-george"
								>Sale’s</persRef> Koran—upon <persRef ref="malthus-thomas"
								>Malthus’s</persRef> Political Economy; Reviews— Speeches in
							Congress and Reports of Committees— As illustrative of Cicero’s Epistles

							in <persRef ref="plutarch">Plutarch</persRef>; and now <persRef
								ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear’s</persRef> Antony and <persRef

								>Johnson</persRef> and <persRef ref="steevens-george"
								>Steevens’s</persRef> Edition, which until lately I never possessed.
							The notes raise more difficulties than they explain— I never thought
							Shakespear hard to understand, but I now find him far more
							unintelligible than Cicero. Many of his thoughts are far-fetched; and
							many quite unnatural— The character of Cleopatra— The composition of
							levity of coquetry, of vanity, of female envy and jealousy; of
							magnificence and ostentation, of cowardice, of affection for Antony and
							for <persRef
								ref="cleopatra-selene-ii;alexanderhelios;ptolemy-philadelphus">her
								children</persRef>; of cowardice at Actium, and of heroic suicide,
							rather than be exhibited in the triumph of <persRef
								ref="augustuscaesar">Octavius Caesar</persRef>, forms altogether a
							Portrait, painted first by Plutarch, but which has the glow of Life in
							Shakespear. The characters of Antony, of Octavius, of <persRef
								ref="ahenobarbus-lucius">Enobarbus</persRef>, are also well drawn
							and all from Plutarch— The causes of Peace and War between Octavius and
							Antony are not very clearly set forth— The time occupied by the Drama,
							is about ten years—from the death of <persRef ref="fulvia"
								>Fulvia</persRef>, Antony’s first wife, till that of Cleopatra— The
							subordinate characters of Enobarbus, of <persRef ref="iras"
								>Iras</persRef> and <persRef ref="charmian">Charmian</persRef>—of
							Soothsayer and even of the Clown who brings the Asps, are true to
							Nature, and of original humour— The sententious part is not of
							Shakespear’s best.</p>

							disencumber my book-shelves of a superfluous and useless load: to make
							if possible a Selection from to bind up and render useful—an undertaking
							which will consume more time than it is worth— It abridged this day much
							of my reading. <pb n="439" type="ms"/>After finishing the Epistles of
								<persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>, I have taken up his
							Orations— Passing over those for <persRef ref="cicero-quintus"
								>Quintus</persRef> and for <persRef ref="roscius-sextus"
								>Roscius</persRef> of Ameria, which I had read several times, I
							began with that for <persRef ref="gallus-quintus">Quintus
								Roscius</persRef> the Comedian— It is a fragment, broken of at both
							ends; what remains, leaves it very doubtful whether the justice of the
							Cause; but it is so spirited and lively, and eloquent that it sharpens
							the appetite for the remaindor. <persRef ref="chaerea-fannius">Fannius
								Chaerea</persRef> had a slave named <persRef ref="panurgus"
								>Panurgus</persRef> to whom Roscius undertook to teach the
							histrionic art—for which the property of the man was to be in common
							between them— Some time after Panurgus was killed by a certain <persRef
								ref="flavius-of-tarquinium">Flavius of Tarquinium</persRef>— Roscius
							sued Flavius for damages, and received from him by compromise a farm—
							Fannius claims of Roscius half the Value of the same— <persRef
								ref="piso-calpurnius">Calpurnius Piso</persRef>, as arbitrator
							advises Roscius to give Fannius ten thousand Sesterces; on condition
							that Fannius should if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> recovered afterwards
							any thing from Flavius share it equally with Roscius— Afterwards Fannius
							sues Roscius at Law, for half the value of his farm, having in the mean
							time recovered of Flavius a hundred thousand Sesterces of which he had
							given no part to Roscius— This fact however appears to be denied by
							Fannius, and there was no record of the judgment— Cicero has the
							testimony of <persRef ref="cluvius">Cluvius</persRef>, himself the
							judge, and that of two Senators who had heard Cluvius speak of the
							judgment—and yet the fact is argued earnestly by Cicero upon this
							testimony. In this as in many others of the Orations, the direct address
							of the Speaker to the adverse party has a rousing and startling effect—
							He established a dialogue, both parts of which are performed by
							himself—an alternation of keen enquiry and assumed answers, which carry
							the hearer along with him as to irresistible conclusions. He is
							extremely severe upon Fannius, and taunts him even upon his personal
							appearance— There is much account of money, in this Oration, and I
							wanted in reading it a Treatise de renummaria— There are several fine
							moral maxims; and though altogether a private cause, if we had it
							entire, I think it would be equal to any one of the collection except
							that for Archias.</p>

							their ascendancy in the State of Maryland— That they had a few days
							since had a Meeting and chosen a Committee of forty members who were to

							lost last Fall, and knew how to recover it now: and that he had spoken
							yesterday for several thousand copies of <persRef ref="holmes-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes’s</persRef> speech which he
							made yesterday in the Senate upon the removing power— This Speech was
							not answered; but silently voted down— And thus the War of pamphlets and
							hand bills, and newspapers is about to recommence— I received this
							Morning, I know not from whom two Copies of a pamphlet just printed at
							Richmond; being a republication of papers under the signature of
								<persRef ref="leigh-benjamin">Algernon Sidney</persRef>, and some
							others printed in the Richmond Enquirer, at the Time of Seminole War
							Controversy in 1818 and 1819. Two of the Letters are addressed to me,
							and are violent attacks upon me for defending General Jackson’s
							proceedings on that occasion— There are also some Comments of the
								<persRef ref="ritchie-thomas">Editor</persRef> of the Enquirer, in
							the same tone— They are now reprinted, as a three edged sword against
							General Jackson, <pb n="440" type="ms"/>against me, and against the
							Editor of the Richmond Enquirer, then the bitterest reviler, and now the
							most obsequious took of Jackson— The writer of Algernon Sidney is
							Benjamin Watkins Leigh, a Lawyer of Note living at Richmond— He treats
							the whole subject like a lawyer, and a mere lawyer— That is upon a
							contracted scale— The Letters contain a strong Lawyer’s argument, upon
							transactions of which Indian Savages and Spanish perfidies, and British
							Incendiaries were the Elements— Scruples of Law and Constitution with
							such enemies, are like the scruples of the Jews, butchered by their
							enemies, rather than violate the Sabbath by self-defence— I read the
							Divination of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> against
								<persRef ref="metellusceler-quintus">Caecilius</persRef>— The
							Question was which of the two should be appointed by the Judges
							Prosecutor of <persRef ref="verres-gaius">Verres</persRef>—Caecilius had
							been Quaestor in Sicily under Verres as Praetor, and pretended to have
							been wronged by him— Cicero treats him very roughly both on the score of
							Talent and of Integrity— He argues that Caecilius is in collusion with
							Verres—and that the relations between the Quaestor and Praetor were too
							confidential— There is also much threatening of the Judges, and
							unequivocal intimations that if they preferred Caecilius, they should be
							prosecuted for bribery. <persRef ref="hortalus-quintus"
								>Hortensius</persRef> defended Verres; and as he was designated
							Consul for the next year: Cicero was more afraid of his official power
							than of his eloquence— He hardly treats him with respect</p>
