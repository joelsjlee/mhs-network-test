							journalizing, which I adopted perhaps for the fiftieth time more than
							twelve months since, was like all my other resolutions of any
							consequence productive only of a few pages of writing, and by looking at
							the last page it will be seen that more than eleven months have elapsed
							since I put pen to this paper.— And why should I?— Events perfectly
							trivial, or if rising in the smallest degree beyond the level of
							insipidity, always unsuccessfull; a continued series of painful
							occurrences, and mortifying reflections, why should I give them a
							stability and duration which happily they cannot naturally have, by
							recording them. The last year of my life has not been without its
							instruction. But the difficulties, and perplexities under which I
							laboured twelve months since still continue; and are increased by the
							consideration that I have now gone through another annual revolution in
							my progress to the grave, without advancing a step in my career, as it
							relates to this world.— However it is of no purpose to complain, and
							whine &amp; fret, and murmur at the moral government of the world.— I
							will say as little of myself as I can and henceforth, endeavour to be
							more philosophical, than I have been able to be hitherto. Improvement is
							my object;—the occasion is great;—the room for it unlimited, the
							capacity—(me miserum!) deplorably narrow—the benefits to be derived from
							all my exertions, (if I judge of my future from my past
							success)—nothing. But it is at all Events labouring to answer the
							purpose for which I was created, <pb n="14" type="ms"/>and I hope
							therefore that I shall not be discouraged in the pursuit. If I should
							never reap the reward of my application, at least it will never injure
							me; the occupation is innocent: it can never be productive of evil
							either to myself, or to those around me.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Saturday April 14th: 1792.</hi></date> For
							several years past, I have endeavoured to vary my studies so that I
							might avoid in some degree the tediousness of a long continued
							application to one subject, and that my different studies might succeed
							one another so as to afford a sort of relaxation the one to the other. I
							have devoted the forenoon to those studies which are more immediately
							connected with my profession, and reserved the latter part of the day
							for mental amusement, for the investigation of those parts of Science,
							which have no other relation to the Law, than the universal chain, the
							commune vinculum, which links together every part of the moral world.—
							This day however I have read no Law. The morning, was principally
							employed in business.— In the afternoon pursuant to a resolution long
							since adopted, I read an Oration of Cicero. Fully perswaded, that the
							clearest and most copious streams of Science, flow only from the
							fountains of Antiquity, I have often determined, to make myself a
							complete master at least of all the Latin classics: but my imperfect
							acquaintance even with that language, and the perpetual avocations which
							interrupt my pursuit combining together, prevent the Execution of a
							design from which I believe I should derive some advantages. I did hope
							that by the attention which I had determined to bestow, I should improve
							my knowledge of the Latin so as to render it perfectly familiar to me:
							but in vain. I can read but very slowly and therefore I cannot read with
							pleasure. In the course of the last winter I went through the Annals
							&amp; <pb n="15" type="ms"/>the History of Tacitus, and derived much
							satisfaction from the perusal. I have since then, again taken up the
							Orations of Cicero, and intend if possible to understand them thoroughly
							in the original. This afternoon. I began upon the Philippics, against
								<hi rend="italic">Antony</hi>. Read the first; and part of the
							second. The progress of his resentment is strongly marked in the
							different style of the two Orations: in the first he speaks with
							moderation; calls himself the friend of Antony; pays him several
							handsome compliments; and only complains with great decency, and without
							any of the opprobrious epithets contained in the second, of the threats
							which Antony had uttered against him the day before: that he would send
							workmen to pull down his House for absenting himself from the Senate.
							Complains of the frauds practiced by Antony under the pretence of
							establishing the acts of Caesar; and recommends to him &amp; his
							colleague Dolabella, then consul, to pursue the true interest of the
							republic and their own glory; but in the second he attacks with great
							vehemence the life &amp; manners of Antony, with whom from that period
							he did not keep any measures at all. After justifying himself from the
							censures which Antony had cast upon him in a previous Speech, he
							examines the whole public &amp; private life of his adversary, and
							charges him with almost every crime that can disgrace human Nature. This
							Oration was among the ancients considered as the master-piece of Cicero,
							and was the occasion of his Death, by making Antony, altogether
							implacable.</p>

							attended public worship yesterday, and heard <persRef
								ref="lathrop-john2">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lathrop</persRef> in the
							morning, &amp; <persRef ref="clarke-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Clarke</persRef> in the afternoon. Nothing however very peculiar was
							suggested to me by either of their discourses. After meeting I took a
							solitary walk to Roxbury, and returned home to tea. The Eve<hi
								rend="superscript">g:</hi> I spent at <persRef ref="smith-william3">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith’s</persRef>. In the way of reading I
							finished <persRef ref="home-henry">Lord Kaims’s</persRef> Elements of
							Criticism; which I borrowed sometime since of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Clarke, and with which I am much pleased— His System appears to me to be
							rather too metaphysical; rather too abstracted, and his principles in
							some instances rather fanciful: neither does he constantly attend to his
							own principles—but the idea of deriving all critical regulations from
							the dispositions inherent in human Nature, is just and ingenious; his
							applications are sometimes happy, but they are sometimes too refined,
							and if I may venture to oppose my own sentiments to those which he
							dictates, sometimes unjust. The book is however, certainly worth a
							second reading, which I shall bestow upon it if I should ever have the
							necessary leisure.</p>
						<p>This forenoon I was principally employed upon business, &amp; read no
							Law. A couple of writs which I had sent into the County of Hampshire,
							were returned to me by the Sheriff not served, as received them too late
							for the purpose. I altered them accordingly to July term, &amp; sent
							them away again. filled two other writs—and had some conversation with
								<persRef ref="jennison-timothy">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Jennison</persRef>, who applied to me upon business, and who will
							call on me again next Monday.— In the afternoon I finished the second
							Philippic of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>. The
							particular attention which I have paid for sometime past to this writer,
							has been because he is generally viewed, as one of the first Orators of
							Antiquity, and because his Orations are <pb n="17" type="ms"
							/>recommended as models for all young men, engaged in a profession of
							which public speaking forms an essential part. Yet the style of Oratory
							for which he is so highly celebrated seems to be widely different from
							that which would ensure success at the Bar in our time.— There could not
							indeed under the present state of Society be any occasion upon which
							such discourses as the Philippics would be proper or even tolerable— A
							personal invective of one public man against another in a deliberative
							assembly would be ill received at this day. Such however, and nothing
							more is this boasted divine Philippic— In which the Orator begins by
							answering the charges of a similar oration previously delivered by
								<persRef ref="antony-mark">Antony</persRef> against himself: and
							after justifying his own conduct, he attacks Antony in his private as
							well as in his public character; reproaches him for the licentiousness
							of his youth; for his convivial indiscretions, for his amorous
							indulgences, and for his extravagant expences, no less than for his
							violations of the Constitution, and his fraud, rapine and violence in
							the public offices of State. The whole force of his Eloquence is
							directed against the man, and the affairs of the State, are no otherwise
							the subject of his discourse, than as they are connected with the
							Actions of the man whom he so severely censures. From the tenor of the
							whole composition one would imagine that the Question upon which the
							Speech was delivered, was Whether Antony was a villain.</p>

							the <persRef ref="mackay-e">Miss Mackay’s</persRef>; a numerous company
							of young people. Some conversation, some music, and some cards.</p>
						<p>This afternoon was partly employed in the melancholy office of performing
							the last duties to the remains of <persRef ref="amory-william">William
								Amory</persRef> a young man, with whom I have spent many happy
							hours. He was born with a disposition to communicate enjoyment, and with
							a faculty of dispensing it to the highest degree. With a heart too
							susceptible of the blandishments of pleasure, and an understanding
							capable of the most exuberant cultivation, had he possessed resolution
							to improve his talents. But early habits of Dissipation and a series of
							imprudencies, imputable in the eye of impartial reason, only to a
							predominating <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
							<pb n="19" type="ms"/>uncontroulable love of pleasure, have embittered
							the last years of his life, and connected with his own misery, the
							wretchedness of others: at the age of 27, which was completed on the day
							of his Death, after a lingering consumption of more than two years
							duration, he has fallen, the victim of those Passions, which had they
							taken a happier direction, might have led him to honour, &amp; opulence;
							to a venerable age, and to important utility in the world. He has left a
								<persRef ref="fletcher-lucy">widow</persRef> under 21 to deplore an
							irreparable loss, and an infant <persRef ref="amory-lucy"
								>daughter</persRef>, as yet incapable of estimating the value of the
							treasure which she must never possess, in the tender and anxious
							sollicitude of paternal affection.— The instance is common of youth
							brought to an untimely end, by the vices to which that period of life is
							so peculiarly exposed, but perhaps the sacrifice at the shrine of
							Intemperate Enjoyment, was never an object more adorned with every
							amiable virtue, and Every pleasing accomplishment, than it was in the
							person of this unfortunate young man. Such amid all his infirmities, was
							the goodness of his Heart, and such the integrity of his Soul, that we
							may humbly hope, at the bar of eternal Heaven, Justice will soften into
							Mercy, and his errors will be forgiven in the favour of his virtues.</p>
						<p>The subject is awful; to me it will be instructive; but it leads me into
							a train of Contemplation, in which the pen cannot follow my ideas—and
							besides the impressions upon my mind though deep enough upon the present
							occasion, yet upon paper would have very much the appearance of common
							place— It is late too, and I must therefore postpone further
							observations to another opportunity.— I have read not a little this day;
							but without any connection Law, Poetry Oratory, History, Latin, French,
							English, heaped up in chaotic confusion in my mind, leave no room for
							Reflection, and suggest nothing for Observation.</p>
