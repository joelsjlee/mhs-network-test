						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Thursday May 3. 1792.</hi></date> The evenings
							grow very short; and from a variety of circumstances, which upon
							different circumstances call me away I spend very few of them at my
							office, and of course have seldom an opportunity to amuse myself with
							this scribbling. In looking back upon the time elapsed since the date of
							the last pages I cannot pride my self upon a very diligent improvement
							of my time. A session of the Court of Common pleas has been held during
							the interval which required my attention, though it furnished me but
							little employment. My legal reading has been principally confined to
								<persRef ref="espinasse-isaac">Espinasse</persRef>, as I have not
							had occasion to examine any particular Question. This day however
								<persRef ref="jennison-timothy">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Jennison</persRef> called on me, and had some conversation with me,
							which induces me to enquire into the detail of the laws respecting
							Executors &amp; Administrators; upon which subject, I intend to commence
							to-morrow morning. The professional studies are tedious: they require
							some certain object, some focus upon which to collect the rays of
							application— I have at length gone through all the philippics, which I
							finished yesterday. They afford some insight into the manners and
							habits, as well as into the History of those times, and contain many
							Sentiments which must be equally applicable in every period of the
							world.— They exhibit also a very striking figure of an unnatural state
							of parties and an unaccountable mixture of opposite characters connected
							together by a very peculiar juncture of affairs. The Coalition between
							the Caesarean party headed by <persRef ref="augustuscaesar"
								>Octavius</persRef> and the Consuls <persRef ref="hirtius-aulus"
								>Hirtius</persRef> and <persRef ref="pansa-gaius">Pansa</persRef>,
							with the republicans, their support of the <persRef
								ref="brutus-decimus;brutus-marcus">two Brutus’s</persRef> &amp;
								<persRef ref="cassius">Cassius</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> himself, against the followers
							of <persRef ref="antony-mark">Antony</persRef> who likewise professed
							himself the avenger of <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar’s</persRef>
							murder, is very easily accounted for upon the principles of political
							ambition; but Cicero surely could never imagine that parties so
							discordant in their nature could remain united till the accomplishment
							of the great object, which he seems to have had in view, the
							re-establishment of the republic. The death of the two Consuls at and
							immediately after the battle at Modena was at the time considered as so
							extremely favourable to the view of Augustus, that it was attributed to
							his contrivance, and was supposed <pb n="21" type="ms"/>to have been
							produced by treachery. But had they lived, the Event could not have been
							other than it was. They had been the creatures of Caesar, and their
							reconciliation with those who began upon their plan of reform by
							murdering him, could not be for any other purpose than to suppress the
							attempt of Antony, to engross to himself the unlimited Dominion, which
							he had so infamously offered to Caesar. The truth is, the republic was
							gone; the public mind, was enslaved, the Genius of Roman Liberty had
							expired, and all the efforts of human eloquence, and more than human
							virtue, were incompetent to the task of breathing anew in his nostrils
							the breath of life. There appears to me to be even in these philippics
							abundant evidence, that the evil was incurable. The temporizing
							expedients of the partisans apparently the warmest for the public good,
							the Embassy upon embassy, sent or proposed to be sent to Antony; the
							manifest restraint and alarm under which the Orator appears to labour
							from the supposed sentiments among the veteran troops even of his own
							party; the extravagant and unprecedented honours and dignities, which he
							is continually advising to heap upon Brutus, upon Cassius, upon the
							Consuls and particularly upon Octavius Caesar, all conspire to show
							clearly that all was rotten in the Commonwealth. The “venal city” had
							found her purchaser; and after submitting to the prostitution of
							Caesar’s dominion, it was in vain to think of reclaiming her to the
							virgin chastity of republican freedom. The historical information to be
							collected from these Orations is small, as they were all delivered in
							the course of a few months. The state of parties must be collected
							rather from what the orator does not express, than from what he says;
							rather from what appears dimly through the disguise in which his hopes
							and fears, endeavour to veil every thing about him, than from the
							statements which the policy of the time, made it proper for him to
							exhibit: But in no one particular, would it be more fallacious, than to
							apply to these discourses, or indeed to any others of Cicero, for the
							characters of the men who were then the principal actors upon the
							theatre of Life. It is not in the darkness of a passionate invective,
							nor in the splendor of a pompous panegyric, that we are to seek for the
							soft and delicate tints which distinguish and diversify the Qualities of
							his Enemies or of his friends. He is <pb n="22" type="ms"/>never at a
							loss for virtues to decorate the followers of his own party, nor for
							shameful vices with which to load his opposers. But on the one hand, his
							animosity and partial prejudices, and on the other the simulation which
							circumstances might justify, but which, justifiable or not, is very
							evident, must detract exceedingly from the credit which we might give to
							his descriptions of Characters. The reader who would form a proper
							estimate of the real value <hi rend="strikethrough">to be</hi> of his
							sentiments on this head, should compare, what he says in these Orations
							respecting Caesar, with the Orations for <persRef ref="ligarius-quintus"
								>Ligarius</persRef>, for <persRef ref="marcellus-marcus"
								>Marcellus</persRef>, for <persRef ref="deiotarus"
								>Dejotarus</persRef>, what he here says of <persRef
								ref="piso-lucius">L. Piso</persRef>, with the Oration against him
							delivered nearly twenty years before, beginning—jamne vides bellua
							&amp;c—what he says in short of all the personages introduced with his
							opinions relative to the same persons contained in the familiar
							Epistles, and after making the comparison, whatever his opinion may be
							of the speakers eloquence, he will not consider these compositions as
							the most favourable specimens of his Sincerity.— Many reflections have
							occurred to me during the persual of these books, but ideas like all
							else pertaining to this world, and perhaps even beyond the common
							proportion are fleeting and irretrievable— They must past unrecorded,
							tho’ perhaps the most valuable.— But let them go.— The world will lose
							but little.</p>

						<pb n="23" type="ms"/><p><date><hi rend="italic">Wednesday May 16</hi><hi
									rend="superscript italic">th:</hi><hi rend="italic"> 1792.</hi></date> I
							am not satisfied with the manner in which I employ my time. It is
							calculated to keep me forever fixed in that state of useless and
							disgraceful insignificancy which has been my lot for some years past. At
							an age bearing close upon 25, when many of the characters who were born
							for the benefit of their fellow creatures have rendered themselves
							conspicuous among their cotemporaries, and founded a reputation upon
							which their memory remains and will continue to the latest posterity, at
							that period I still find myself as obscure as unknown to the world, as
							the most indolent, or the most stupid of human beings. In the walks of
							active life, I have done nothing. Fortune indeed, who claims to herself
							a large proportion of the merit which exhibits to public view the
							talents of professional men at an early period of their Lives, has not
							hitherto been peculiarly indulgent to me. But If to my own mind I
							enquire whether I should at this time be qualified to receive and derive
							any benefit from an opportunity which it may be in her power to procure
							to me, my own mind would shrink from the investigation— My heart is not
							conscious of an unworthy ambition; nor of a desire to establish either
							fame honour or fortune upon any other foundation, than that of desert.—
							But it is conscious, and the consideration is equally painful and
							humiliating, it is conscious that the ambition is constant, and
							unceasing, while the exertions to acquire the talents which ought alone
							to secure the reward, of Ambition, are feeble, indolent, frequently
							interrupted, and never pursued with an ardor equivalent to its purposes.
							My future Fortunes in Life, are therefore the objects of my present
							Speculation, and it may be proper for me to reflect further upon the
							same subject, and if possible to adopt some Resolutions, and prescribe
							to myself some regulations which may enable me as <persRef
								ref="uncletoby">uncle Toby Shandy</persRef> said of his miniature
							sieges, <hi rend="italic">to answer the great ends of my
							existence</hi>.</p>
						<p>First then, I begin, with establishing as a fundamental principle upon
							which all my subsequent pursuits and regulations are to be established,
							that the acquisition, at least of a respectable reputation is (subject
							to the overruling power and wisdom of Providence) within my own power.
							And that on my part nothing is wanting, but a constant, and persevering
							determination to tread in the steps which naturally lead to <pb n="24"
								type="ms"/>honour. And at the same time, I am equally convinced,
							that I never shall attain that credit in the world, which my Nature
							directs me to wish, without such a steady, patient and persevering
							pursuit of the means adapted to the end I have in view, as has often
							been the subject of my speculation, but never of my practice.</p>
						<lg>
							<l>“Labour and Toil, stand stern before the throne,</l>
						<l>And guard, so Jove commands, the sacred place.”</l>
						</lg>
						<p>The mode of Life, adopted almost universally by my cotemporaries and
							equals, is by no means calculated to secure the objects of my ambition.
							My Emulation is seldom stimulated, by observing the Industry and
							application of those whom my situation in Life gives me for companions.
							The pernicious and childish opinion, that extraordinary Genius, cannot
							brook the slavery of plodding over the rubbish of antiquity (a cant so
							common among the heedless votaries of indolence) dulls the edge of all
							industry, and is one of the most powerful ingredients in the Circean
							potion, which transforms many of the most promising young men into the
							beastly forms, which in sluggish idleness feed upon the labours of
							others.— The degenerate Sentiment I hope will never obtain admission in
							my mind, and if my Time should be loitered away in stupid laziness, it
							will be under the full conviction of my conscience, that I am basely
							bartering the greatest benefits with which human beings can be indulged;
							for the miserable gratifications which are hardly worthy of contributing
							to the enjoyments of the brute creation.</p>
						<p>And as I have grounded myself upon the principle, that my character is
							(under the smiles of Heaven) to be the work of my own hands, it becomes
							necessary for me to determine, upon what part of active or of
							speculative life, I mean to rest my pretensions to eminence— My own
							Situation and that of my Country equally prohibit me from seeking to
							derive any present expectations from a public career.— My disposition is
							not military; and happily the warlike talents are not those which open
							the most pleasing or the most reputable avenue to fame.— I have had some
							transient thoughts of undertaking some useful litterary performance, but
							the pursuit would militate at present too much, with that of the
							profession upon which I am to <pb n="25" type="ms"/>to depend, not only
							for my reputation, but for my subsistence. I have therefore concluded,
							that the most proper object of my present attention, is <hi
								rend="italic">that profession itself</hi>. And in acquiring the
							faculty to discharge the duties of it, in a manner suitable to my own
							wishes and to the expectations of my friends, I find ample room for
							close and attentive application; for frequent and considerate
							observation, and for such benefits of practical experience as occasional
							opportunities may throw in my way.</p>
						<p>The abilities requisite to constitute the character of a great lawyer,
							may be traced in the labours which in the course of his profession, he
							is called upon to perform. These may be divided with us into two
							classes. The business of his office, and the business he transacts in
							Court. A long, painful, and incessant attention to the prescriptions of
								<hi rend="italic">positive</hi> Law (by which I mean in general the
							municipal Laws) is absolutely necessary, to qualify him for giving
							proper advice, for doing thorough justice to his clients, as a
							counsellor, and for preparing the causes which are to be litigated in
							the Courts.</p>
