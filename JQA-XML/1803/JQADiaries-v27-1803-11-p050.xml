						<p><date>1. </date>In Senate— The subject debated was upon the second
							reading of one of the bills creating the Stock, for the payments
							required by the Louisiana Treaty.— A proviso at the close of the first
							Section appeared to me to sanction a departure from the terms of the
							Convention, and to remove the possibility of any such imputation in
							future, I moved to insert the words “with the assent of the French
							Government.”— <persRef ref="taylor-john2">M<hi rend="superscript"

							the same proviso— They lay over for consideration to-morrow— But
								<persRef ref="wright-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Wright</persRef> was against every amendment that could possibly be
							proposed to the bill; because it was drawn up by the <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, who could
							better legislate for us on this subject than we can do congressionally.—
							What will become of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Taylor’s amendment I
							know not— Mine will certainly not pass— And indeed I have already seen
							enough to ascertain that no amendments of my proposing will obtain in
							the Senate as now filled— Nor was this State of things, at all
							unexpected to me— The qualities of mind most peculiarly called for under
							it, are firmness, perseverance, patience, coolness and forbearance— The
							prospect is not promising.— Yet the part to act may be as honourably
							performed, as if success could attend it— We adjourned soon after
							two.</p>

							wished to know the reasons why that excessive haste had now given place
							to the indifference, and studied delay of the present time— He meant
							therefore to call it up every day; and demand the yeas and nays, every
							time he should call it up, untill some reason should be given for the
							neglect it now meets with— He was only answered, that every Gentleman
							had his own reasons, for voting as he pleased, and was not obliged to
							give them— A large majority determined against taking it up.— The reason
							is that they could not carry the vote by the Constitutional majority
							now; and wait for the arrival of the <persRef ref="smith-john10">member
