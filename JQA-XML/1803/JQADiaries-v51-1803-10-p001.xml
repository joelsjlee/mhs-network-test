                            Resolution to amend the Constitution by altering the mode of electing
                            the President and Vice-President of the United States, so that the
                            electors shall designate the person, to fill each of those respective
                            Offices— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clinton press’d for a decision
                            upon the Resolution, this day, or at farthest on Monday next, because he
                            was anxious to obtain the amendment in time to make it bear upon the
                            next Presidential Election; and as the legislatures of Vermont and
                            Tennessee are now in Session, if the opportunity should be lost of
                            sending the resolution to them, they would not be able to act upon it in
                            due season, without being called together expressly for the purpose—
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy contended that the Resolution
                            could not be finally acted upon in Senate, either this day or Monday—
                            For it being a Resolution which required the concurrence of the House of
                            Representatives, it must be read three times on different days like a
                            bill— Such having been the rule heretofore adopted and declared by the
                            Vice-President.— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clinton questioned the
                            rule, and as a point of order it was referred to the decision of the
                            President, who said <hi rend="italic">he knew of no such rule</hi>; of
                            course it was determined that the Resolution required but one reading—
                            Notwithstanding this decision, there is such a rule, and its infraction
                            at this time was only for the purpose of getting through M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clinton’s Resolution by a <hi
                                rend="italic">coup-de-main</hi>— But when this obstacle was
                            surmounted, others arose from M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clinton’s
                            own side of the House, which he found it impracticable to overcome— He
                            had worded the Resolution with such precipitation, that it contained a
                            manifest absurdity; a provision for a case which it was impossible
                            should happen— This was first removed— By altering the mode of election
                            in the case of the President, it made some alteration in that of the
                            Vice-President, obviously proper— Under the present mode a plurality of
                            votes only, is required for the Vice-President, and M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton’s Resolution, left that unaltered—
                            An amendment was proposed by M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bradley,
                            making a majority of votes necessary for the Vice-President, under the
                            proposed mode of election— After some discussion of this, M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r:</hi> Butler proposed another Amendment,
                            declaring that no person shall be eligible as President, more than twice
                            in succession, and that any person having been President, shall be
                            eligible after an interval of four years, only for one more term of four
                            years— By this time the subject had become so complicated, that a
                            postponement of further consideration, was called for untill Monday, and
                            denied, 16 to 15.— But after carrying this vote, the Resolution, which
                            required the concurrence of two thirds of the House, could still not be
                            carried through— The subject was therefore at last by a bare majority,
                            referred to a Committee of five to report on Monday.</p>

                        <p><date>24. October 1803.</date> The Committee appointed to consider and
                            report upon the proposed Resolution of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
                            Clinton, and the amendments moved to it, made a report ready printed,
                            adopting M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bradley’s Amendment into the
                            body of the Resolution, and M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Butler’s
                            into a separate Resolution; when the subject was taken up for
                            consideration, M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Dayton, moved to strike
                            out all the part of the report that bore reference to the election of a
                            Vice-President, with a view to abolish the Office itself, which in his
                            view would become altogether useless under the alteration of the
                            Constitution now contemplated— This motion opened a new and wide field
                            for debate— The members of the majority being most of them pledged by
                            opinions formerly express’d in favour of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
                            Dayton’s object, yet apprehensive that they would hazard the fate of
                            their intended amendment by complicating it with other questions, were
                            apparently disconcerted— To ward off Dayton’s amendment they were
                            compelled to plead want of time to consider it, and yet to carry through
                            Clinton’s Resolution, to resist every call for more time from the other
                            side— The reason for this excessive hurry was repeatedly alledged to be
                            the necessity of obtaining the adoption of Tennessee and Vermont, during
                            the present Session of their legislatures— The true reason will appear
                            hereafter— A question for postponement of the subject untill Wednesday
                            was taken and lost— Upon which M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> White of
                            Delaware, declared that he could not be driven and forced on in such
                            manner, and if the question must now be taken he should ask to be
                            excused from voting on it, at-all— The majority would have been very
                            glad to take him at his word, but still they could not carry their
                            majority of two thirds, and were finally compelled to postpone the
                            subject untill to-morrow. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clinton was so
                            much vexed at the delay which he saw must be occasioned by M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r:</hi> Dayton’s proposition, that he quite lost
                            his temper, and indulged himself in such personalities that Dayton
                            declared he should take the proper notice of them elsewhere.</p>

                                >r:</hi> Clinton was recently appointed mayor, of the City of
                            New-York, and being obliged to enter on the functions of that Office, at
                            the commencement of the ensuing month, had made his arrangements for
                            leaving this City, very early this morning, which he accordingly did—
                            His friend M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wright read in his place, a
                            written apology, for the expressions he used yesterday, which gave
                            offence to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Dayton— After which M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wright moved that the further
                            consideration of the proposed amendment to the Constitution should be
                            postponed untill to-morrow— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clinton, he
                            said, had made his arrangements for quitting the City this morning, and
                            had been anxious to get the resolution through, so that he might carry
                            it home with him to his Constituents— This was the reason why the
                            subject had been so much urged yesterday— But as M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r:</hi> Clinton was now gone, and several points of material
                            importance were involved in the question, the further time which
                            Gentlemen had appeared desirous to obtain, might be indulged.— Postponed
                            accordingly.</p>
                        <p>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Breckinridge some days since brought in a

                            govern the Country, untill Congress shall further provide— It was
                            debated this day at the second reading; and pass’d to the third.</p>
                        <p>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wright, on Saturday last laid on the

                            not to take up the consideration of it now, 16 and 15.</p>

                            come to a choice of a Secretary and other Officers— The grounds of the
                            motion, <hi rend="italic">alledged</hi>, are that there never has been a
                            choice that of the first Congress under the Constitution— That the
                            Senate, is no longer the same— That the House of Representatives choose
                            their clerk at every new Congress, and that the Senate ought to do the
                            same; or at least to choose once in six years— M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r:</hi> Jackson only spoke against the motion— He considered the
                            Senate as a permanent body—differing therefore from the House of
                            Representatives, and not under the same necessity of renewing the choice
                            of their Clerk at every new Election— He thought it better to have our
                            officers at all times under our own controul, and if any ground of
                            complaint should appear against them at <hi rend="italic">any time</hi>—
                            He objected also upon the ground of the measure’s opening a door to
                            perpetual teazing sollicitations for the Offices at every Session of
                            Congress— And moved to postpone the further consideration of the subject
                            untill the first Monday in October next.— The Virginia Senators, and
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Breckinridge replied, and appeared
                            the most earnest for a change.— They said that to complain of the
                            misconduct of the Officers, would be an invidious task, and lead to
                            improper discussions— That it was much better to prepare the way for any
                            necessary removal, by periodical elections— M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r:</hi> Taylor insisted that the Senate is <hi rend="italic"

                            that it is chosen for Six years— But the Constitution says no such
                            thing— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jackson’s motion for postponement
                            to a day beyond the Session, prevailed—17 to 13.</p>

                            Section— I proposed an Amendment to one of those Amendments, which
                            however was rejected— So were the Amendments themselves; but the House
                            insisted upon them. A Committee of Conference was appointed, who made
                            report of a <hi rend="italic">mezzo termine</hi> between the House and
                            Senate; but in the mean time the House adjourned untill Monday— The
                            Senate then became so impatient to complete the bill, that they rejected
                            the report of the Committee of Conference, and adopted both the
                            Amendments proposed by the House; so that the bill might be completed
                            this day; which after all it cannot be.— As a rule of prudence, one
                            house should not resist amendments from the other, unless it means to
                            persevere eventually in that resistance— To begin by rejecting, and
                            finish by adopting, is neither very considerate nor very dignified.</p>

                                >r:</hi> Breckinridge moved a Resolution that the Senate would wear
                            crape one month, for the three illustrious patriots, Samuel Adams,
                            Edmond Pendleton, and Stephens Thompson Mason— I called for the
                            authority of the Senate to make such an injunction— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r:</hi> Breckinridge referred to the manual, and
                            acknowledged that it must be altogether optional for every member to
                            comply with the Resolution or not— I then objected against it, as
                            tending to improper discussions of character, and to produce unnecessary
                            heats and animosities— The Resolution was finally severed into two— One
                            for M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Mason, as for a member of the
                            Senate— This pass’d unanimously, as a mere customary formality— The
                            other after a long debate, pass’d by yeas and nays 21 and 10.</p>
                        <p>A Message from the President, with four Indian Treaties was read— The
                            reading of the Treaties themselves was dispensed with, untill they shall
                            be printed.</p>

                        <p>The Treaty of limits with Great-Britain was again taken up— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r:</hi> Butler moved an Amendment in the 5<hi
                                rend="superscript">th:</hi> Article, requiring that Commissioners
                            should immediately be appointed, to run the line from the Lake of the
                            Woods to the Mississippi— General Smith moved a postponement to consider
                            whether the Article itself would not cut us off from claims acquired by
                            the cession of Louisiana— It was accordingly postponed.</p>
