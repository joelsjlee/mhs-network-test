								ref="shaw-william">W. Shaw</persRef>, with information that the
							house of <persRef ref="birdsavagebird">Bird Savage and Bird</persRef> in

								ref="williams-js">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> J. S.
								Williams</persRef> who was on foot, walking home to Roxbury. Took
							him into the Chaise with me and left him at his lodgings— On arriving in

							House of Bird, Savage and Bird dated 7. Feb<hi rend="superscript"
								>y:</hi> giving notice of their suspension of payments—with the
							addition, that they would endeavour to get some house to take up my
							bills upon them—on which however I place not the least dependence. The
							property they have in their hands is <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father’s</persRef>; but I must provide for taking the bills up,
							which I had drawn— For this purpose I have no other means than to sell
							my own property— I call’d upon <persRef ref="smith-william3">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith</persRef> to ask him if he
							wish’d to purchase again the house I bought of him, and in which I now
							live, but he said it would not be convenient— I have never before met so
