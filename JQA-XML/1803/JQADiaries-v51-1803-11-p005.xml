                            creating six per Cent Stock, eleven millions and a quarter, conformably
                            to the Convention with France, was debated at the second reading.— At
                            the close of the first Section there was a proviso, authorizing the
                            Secretary of the Treasury, with the approbation of the President, to
                            alter the terms of the contract, with the assent of the proprietors of
                            the Stock— As this had some colour of departing from the compact with
                            France, I moved to insert the words, “and with the assent of the French
                            Government”— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Taylor moved another
                            amendment, limiting the power of varying the terms, to that of
                            shortening the periods of payment. The debate on these proposed
                            amendments after lasting untill the usual hour of adjournment, was left
                            undecided.</p>

                            was resumed, and after various modifications of the amendments offered
                            yesterday, M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy finally proposed one
                            comprizing the principle of both; which was at length adopted— When the
                            question for a third reading was taken, M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
                            White of Delaware, moved a postponement of the subject, untill the 2<hi

                            the bill passes, whether peaceable possession of New Orleans will be
                            given— The 3<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi> reading was decided by a
                            considerable majority.</p>

                            pass’d— There seem’d the same reason for objecting against its passage,
                            as in the other case; but no division was called for.</p>

                            with Great-Britain was under consideration— M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r:</hi> Butler had moved an Amendment to the 5<hi
                                rend="superscript">th:</hi> Article, to require that Commissioners
                            should <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi> be appointed by the two
                            Governments to draw the line from the North West Corner of the Lake of
                            the Woods to the nearest source of the Mississippi— But finding many
                            objections against it, he now withdrew his motion— The difficulty which
                            had occurred to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> S. Smith, was however
                            now in his absence strongly urged by his Colleague M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wright; who moved a postponement untill
                            next Monday week, for him to come in— This was rejected; but an
                            adjournment untill Monday next was finally agreed to.— The objection is,
                            that the Convention stipulates the boundary line of the United States to
                            be a line from the Lake of the Woods, to the nearest source of the
                            Mississippi— But by the Treaty of 30. April, with France Louisiana is
                            ceded to us, as it was formerly possessed by France, that is without any
                            fixed boundaries to the Northward— The Convention with Great-Britain was
                            signed, only twelve days after the Treaty with France, and certainly
                            without any reference to it, or to any claims the United States acquire
                            under it; but being subsequent both in point of date and of
                            ratification, it is said unless care be taken to guard against it, we
                            may preclude ourselves from the right of asserting a claim under that
                            Treaty, by our Assent to a line drawn to define our boundaries before it
                            was concluded.</p>

                        <p>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Butler then called up the Resolution for
                            altering the mode of choosing the President and Vice-President. But M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r:</hi> S. Smith being absent— The member from
                            New-York, who is to supply the place of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
                            Clinton, and General Sumpter of South Carolina, not being arrived, the
                            majority are not sure of carrying the Resolution, by the necessary
                            proportion, of two thirds of the members present— Without entering into
                            any discussion therefore, the moment it was mentioned, they called for
                            the question— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Butler asked for their
                            reasons; but was only answered that every Gentleman had his own reasons—
                            He then adverted to the extreme precipitation with which this subject
                            had been driven at the Commencement of the Session, and to the
                            extraordinary delays it met with now, and declared that he would call it
                            up, every day, and take the yeas and nays upon it every time he should
                            call it up, untill some reason should be given for the mode of
                            proceeding pursued respecting it.— The motion was rejected, and the
                            Senate adjourned till Monday.</p>
                        <p>After the adjournment yesterday, M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Baldwin
                            of Georgia, came to me, in my seat, and told me he thought I had taken
                            up the subject, on its true ground: adding that the practice under the
                            old Confederation, was a strong argument in confirmation of the opinion
                            I had expressed— This day, S. H. Smith, the Editor of the National
                            Intelligencer came and requested, I would furnish him with the substance
                            of what I said yesterday, as the other speakers on both sides had agreed
                            to do, it being his intention to publish the debate</p>
                        <p>It is the practice of the Senate at the second reading of all bills, to
                            refer them to a select Committee of three or five; to report them with
                            or without amendments, for discussion in Quasi-Committee of the whole—
                            These Committees are all chosen by ballot, by a plurality of votes— I
                            was this day put upon one of these Committees, with M<hi

                        <p><date><hi rend="italic">5. Saturday.</hi></date> The Senate having
                            adjourned over to next week, I employed the principal part of this day,
                            in reading the Correspondence and papers sent by the President to the
                            Senate with the Louisiana Treaty.— These papers are as follows.</p>
                        <p>1. The instructions to Robert R. Livingston and James Monroe, given by
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Madison, Secretary of State, on the
                            appointment of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Monroe, for the
                            Negotiation— They are dated March 2. 1803. and the object is
                            sufficiently developed in the first paragraph which runs thus.</p>
                        <p>“Gentlemen.</p>
                        <p>You will herewith receive a Commission and letters of Credence, one of
                            you as Minister Plenipotentiary, the other as Minister Extraordinary and
                            Plenipotentiary, to treat with the Government of the french Republic on
                            the subject of the Mississippi and the Territories <hi rend="italic"
                                >Eastward</hi> thereof, and without the limits of the United States.
                            The object in view is to procure by just and satisfactory arrangements a
                            Cession to the United States of New-Orleans, and of West and
                            East-Florida, or as much thereof as the actual proprietor can be
                            prevailed on to part with.”</p>
                        <p>It would seem from one part of these Instructions, that the idea of this
                            negotiation originally came from the French Government itself.— “It is
                            to be added, that the overtures committed to you, coincide in great
                            measure with the ideas of the person, through whom the letter from the
                            President of April 30<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> 1802. was conveyed
                            to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Livingston, and who is presumed to
                            have gained some insight into the present sentiments of the French
                            Cabinet.”</p>
                        <pb n="7" type="ms"/>
                        <p>The instructions are accompanied with the project of a Treaty— The
                            seventh Article of which stands thus.</p>
                        <p>“To incorporate the Inhabitants of the hereby ceded territory with the
                            Citizens of the United States on an equal footing, being a provision
                            which cannot now be made, it is to be expected, from the Character and
                            policy of the United States, that such incorporation will take place
                            without unnecessary delay. In the mean time, they shall be secure in
                            their persons and property, and in the free enjoyment of their
                            religion.”</p>
                        <p>The third Article of this project, contains the stipulations which it was
                            contemplated to acquiesce in, for allowing French vessels free Commerce
                            with the ceded territory, while those of other nations should remain
                            excluded— But it is recommended to the Ministers, to try for a
                            stipulation that each party might without the consent of the other admit
                            whomsoever to navigate the river generally— This attempt is said to be
                            proper not only as a friendly proof of regard to Great Britain, but as
                            “a just attention to the interests of our Western fellow-Citizens, whose
                            commerce will not otherwise be on an equal footing with that of the
                            Atlantic States.”</p>
                        <p>On the contingency of a partial cession, the Florida’s together are
                            estimated at 1/4 the value of the whole Island of New-Orleans, and
                            East-Florida at 1/2 that of West-Florida. For the whole, the Ministers
                            were authorised to go as far as 50 millions of livres.</p>
                        <p>2. The second paper is a letter from the Secretary of State to the
                            Ministers, dated 18. April 1803. It is written under the apparent
                            impression that the negotiation will fail, and the strong apprehension
                            of an inevitable War with France— It contains accordingly instructions
                            for negotiating an alliance with England, to make a common Cause in the
                            War— There is a striking difference between the tenor of these
                            Instructions, and those for negotiating with France, which contained
                            powers much more liberal: the alliance with England was, evidently, a
                            measure of extreme reluctance— And in the following extract there
                            appears no small degree of preparation for sacrificing even the right of
                            deposit, rather than go to War.— “If France should avow or evince a
                            determination to deny to the United States the free navigation of the
                            Mississippi, your consultations with Great-Britain may be held on the
                            ground that War is inevitable. Should the navigation not be disputed,
                            and the deposit alone be denied, it will be prudent to adapt your
                            Consultations to the possibility that Congress may distinguish between
                            the two cases, and make a question how far the latter right may call for
                            an instant resort to arms, or how far a procrastination of that remedy
                            may be suggested and justified by the prospect of a more favourable
                            conjuncture.”</p>
                        <p>The letter contains information of the state of affairs at New-Orleans,
                            as they then stood— The latest information was of 25. February— The
                            second letter from the Spanish Minister to the Intendant, had been
                            without effect— His interposition of 10. March, is mentioned as “meant
                            to be absolutely effectual.” The co-operating measures of the french
                            chargé des Affaires are likewise noticed— The failure of the
                            representations to restore the right of deposit is anticipated in the
                            body of the letter— But in an addition to it, dated 20. April, the
                            letter from the Spanish Minister of that date, announcing the
                            restoration of the right of deposit, is communicated— By a passage in
                            this postscript, the writer seems aware that Spain considered her
                            cession of Louisiana to France as yet unaccomplished. <pb n="8"
                                type="ms"/>The words are—“From the allusion in this Communication
                            from the Spanish Minister, to a future agreement between the two
                            Governments on the subject of an equivalent deposit, it would seem that
                            the Spanish Government regards the cession to France as either no longer
                            in force or not soon to be carried into execution.”</p>
                        <p>3. With these instructions of 18. April 1803. There is a separate letter
                            to the Ministers, generally authorising them, in case their negotiation
                            with France should fail, “to open a Confidential Communication with <hi
                                rend="italic">Ministers</hi> of the British Government, for a closer
                            connection with Great-Britain[”]— This letter was meant to have the
                            operation, without the formality of a Commission— But it seems much more
                            explicit than I conceive was necessary or prudent, under the
                            circumstances.</p>
                        <p>4. A letter from the Secretary of State to the Ministers, dated 28. May
                            1803.— Written under the expectation of an immediate War between France
                            and Great-Britain— It urges on the Ministers the necessity of improving
                            this state of things, for the advancement of their Negotiation— The
                            following paragraph, is remarkable. “The solicitude of England with
                            respect to Louisiana is sufficiently evinced, by her controuling the
                            French expedition from Holland to that Country. But her views have been
                            particularly unfolded to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> King by M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r:</hi> Addington, who frankly told him that in
                            case a war should happen, it would perhaps be one of their first steps
                            to occupy New-Orleans; adding that it would not be to keep it, for that
                            England would not accept the Country, were all agreed to give it to her,
                            but to prevent another power from obtaining it, which in his opinion
                            would be best effected by its belonging to the <unclear>Unit</unclear>ed
                            States; and concluding with assurances that nothing should be done
                            injurious to their interests. I<unclear>f th</unclear>e Councils of
                            France should be guided by half the wisdom which is here displayed on
                            the part of her rival, your negotiations will be made very easy, and the
                            result of them very satisfactory.”</p>
                        <p>5. Extract of a letter from the Secretary of State to the Ministers,
                            dated 29. July 1803. Acknowledging the receipt on the 14<hi
                                rend="superscript">th:</hi> of that month, of the Treaty and
                            Conventions— Declaring the President’s approbation of their purchase of
                            all Louisiana, and apologizing for not having ever thought of giving
                            them powers to make it.</p>
                        <p>6. A letter from the Ministers to the Secretary of State, dated 13. May
                            1803— Giving an Account of their Negotiation, and transmitting the
                            Treaties.— The letter is long, and expatiates much on the advantages of
                            the bargain they had made— To guard against an underrated estimate of
                            these, they not only tell the Secretary what <hi rend="italic">was</hi>
                            demanded of them; but what the first Consul <hi rend="italic"
                                >intended</hi> to have demanded, and did not. The purchase of the
                                <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> territory; and the <hi rend="italic"
                                >price</hi>, paid for it, were dictated to them, and no alternative
                            or modification allowed— But the arrangements for the mode and times of
                            payment, and a limitation of the exclusive commercial privileges to
                            France and Spain, to the term of twelve years, all this was obtained by
                                <hi rend="italic">negotiation</hi>; and are deemed by the Ministers
                            objects of such moment, that they compliment very much the french
                            Plenipotentiary, and his Government for their candour, and accommodating
                            Spirit in granting so much.</p>
                        <p>7. A letter from the Ministers to the Secretary of State dated 16. May
                            1803. inclosing the Account of claims of American Citizens on the French
                            Government, provided for by the Convention. The Consul had then agreed
                            to ratify immediately.</p>
                        <p>8. A Letter from the Ministers to the Secretary of State dated 7. June
                            1803: forwarding the Ratification of the first Consul.— It gives an
                            Account of his dissatisfaction with his own bargain; and of sundry
                            expedients <hi rend="italic">by</hi>
                            <pb n="9" type="ms"/>by which he manifested a determination to extricate
                            himself from it.— One of these is contained in a letter from the french
                            Plenipotentiary to them, declaring that if any extraordinary delay
                            should take place on the part of the United States, in the payment of
                            the money, the parties will be placed in the same situation as if they
                            had never treated— Their Answer to this letter is wary, but admits the
                            principle— The Consul however seems to have been afterwards ashamed of
                            this step, for the two letters were mutually restored. The Minister for
                            foreign affairs (Talleyrand) probably dissatisfied with the whole of
                            this Negotiation, and the inspirer of the Consuls scruples, had hit upon
                            another idea, worthy of himself— It was, that the Ratification, even
                            after signature, was altogether in the breast of the Consul, who might
                            modify it or make it conditional as he pleased— And his condition would
                            be that on failure of performance in any one point by the United States,
                            the Treaty should be considered as entirely at an end.</p>
                        <p>These Circumstances induce the Ministers to urge in the strongest terms,
                            more than performance on our part, and they recommend the payment of the
                            money, <hi rend="italic">even before possession of the Posts shall be
                                given.</hi>— They mention the contract by which the French
                            Government had sold their stock in advance to the houses of Baring and
                            Hope.</p>
                        <p>They express it as their undoubting opinion that West Florida is
                            comprized in the cession, and advise the Government to act in all their
                            measures relative to Louisiana, on the ground of this construction.—
                            They give notice that they have appointed the board of Commissioners,
                            for which they were authorized by the Convention.</p>
                        <p>9. The translation of the letter from the Minister of the Public Treasury

                            July 1802. by M. de S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Cyr Ambassador of
                            the French Republic at Madrid to the Spanish Secretary of State— As
                            follows— “His Catholic Majesty has appeared to wish that France should
                            engage not to sell nor alienate in any manner the property and the
                            enjoyment of Louisiana. Its wish in this respect is perfectly
                            conformable with the intentions of the Spanish Government; and its sole
                            motive for entering therein was because it respected a possession which
                            had constituted a part of the French Territory. I am authorized to
                            declare to you in the name of the First Consul, that France will never
                            alienate it.”</p>
                        <p>On this foundation the Marquis is ordered to deny the right of France to
                            make the cession.</p>

                            the Secretary of State; dated Vicinity of Philadelphia 27. Sept<hi

                        <p>In consequence of a renewed command from the king of Spain, he alledges
                            the above-quoted declaration as a<hi rend="strikethrough">n</hi>
                            positive engagement that France would never alienate Louisiana, and
                            demands that the Government of the United States “should suspend the
                            ratification and effect a treaty which rests on such a basis.”— But this
                            note denies the right of France to make the cession, upon another
                            ground—towit that the cession by Spain to France was on condition that
                            France should procure the king of Tuscany to be acknowledged by “the
                            powers of Europe”—yet never has obtained this acknowledgment either from
                            the Court of London, or that of S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>

                        <p>The conclusion of the Minister’s instructions apparently quoted in his
                            note, is in strong terms—“Under such circumstances it is evident that
                            the Treaty of sale entered into between France and the United States,
                            does not give to the latter any right to acquire and claim Louisiana,
                            and that the principles of Justice as well as <pb n="11" type="ms"
                            />sound policy ought to recommend it to their Government not to meddle
                            with engagements as contrary in reality to her interest as they would be
                            to good faith, and to their good correspondence with Spain.”</p>

                        <p>It directs a postponement of the negotiation with Spain for the
                            Florida’s— Expresses much surprize at the opposition and conduct of
                            Spain on this Occasion— Refers to his answer given to the Spanish
                            Ministers notes, for the refutation of Spain’s question as to the <hi

                            urges many ingenious arguments to be suggested to the Spanish
                            Government, to convince them that the cession is conformable to their
                            own interest.</p>
                        <p>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pinckney is instructed to convey the
                            justification of our right, to the Spanish Government, “either by a
                            note, or in conversation as he should deem most expedient; and in a form
                            and style best writing the advantage of making that Government sensible
                            of the absolute determination of the United States to maintain their
                            right, with the propriety of avoiding undignified menace and unnecessary
                            irritation.”</p>
                        <p>In the following paragraph, a suspicion is rather suggested, than avowed,
                            of which there was very little probability— “If her object be to extort
                            Louisiana from France, as well as to prevent its transfer to the United
                            States, it would seem that she must be emboldened by an understanding
                            with some other very powerful quarter of Europe.”</p>

                            Chargé des Affaires, of France, to the Secretary of State, dated 21.

                            1803.—replying to the objections stated in the two notes from the
                            Marquis de Casa Yrujo.</p>
                        <p>In answer to the allegation that France had <hi rend="italic"
                                >promised</hi> not to alienate Louisiana, he observes that no such
                            stipulation was contained in the Treaty of S<hi rend="superscript"
                                >t:</hi> Ildephonso— That a promise made 15 months after, must have
                            been predicated upon a consideration not arising from the Treaty— A
                            consideration which perhaps has failed, and annulled the promise itself,
                            and therefore cannot possibly affect the right of France to cede or of
                            the United States to acquire the Country.</p>
                        <p>To the second objection, that France had not procured the acknowledgment
                            of the King of Etruria; he says that Spain had long since considered
                            that Article as sufficiently and substantially fulfilled; for that in
                            the Treaty of Amiens 27. March 1802. Great-Britain had not acknowledged
                            the King of Etruria— Yet in October following, the King of Spain had
                            issued a royal Cedula, for the delivery of Louisiana to France, which
                            Cedula, M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pichon had received, exhibited
                            to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Madison, and sent to the Captain
                            General of Louisiana, who sent the Marquis of Casa Calvo to New-Orleans,
                            to superintend its Execution.</p>
                        <p>In addition to this, he remarks that Spain must have been informed last
                            February of the <hi rend="italic">object</hi>
                            <pb n="12" type="ms"/>objectof M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Monroe’s
                            mission, and why did she not then object; while it was yet time?— He
                            concludes with remarking that he has received orders to exchange the
                            ratifications, and to “effect the taking of possession of Louisiana by
                            France, and its transfer to the United States.” He hopes Spain will make
                            no opposition but “In any event, as soon as the ratifications are
                            exchanged, he will proceed without delay, in concert with the Commissary
                            appointed for that purpose by the First Consul, to the delivery of the
                            Colony to the persons whom the President of the United States shall
                            appoint to take possession of it.”</p>
                        <p>Such is the analysis of the papers communicated by the President to the
                            Senate with the Louisiana cession Treaty, and conventions. I have made
                            it at such length, considering the transaction<hi rend="strikethrough"
