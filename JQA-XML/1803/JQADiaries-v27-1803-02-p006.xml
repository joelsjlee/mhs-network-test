							leave to sell our stocks, and rejected it— The Committee on the banks
							were to meet this Evening, at six o’clock: but upon going to the State
							house, we found the doors shut— Postponed the meeting therefore untill
							to-morrow— Dined at <persRef ref="bussey-benjamin">M<hi

								<persRef ref="ames-fisher">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

							Bussey’s— As we were leaving the house together I told him that I had
							heard that both his name and mine were upon the nomination list, <pb
								n="7" type="ms"/>now in the house of Representatives, for the choice
							of a Senator in Congress— I asked him whether he would accept the
							Office, if chosen, and assured him, that if he would, my name should not
							stand in competition with his— That I would take care to have it
							removed; and should be highly gratified to contribute all in my power
							towards securing his election— He said <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was
							entirely out of the question— That he could not go at any rate, and that
							if his name was upon the nomination list, it was altogether without his
							knowledge or consent— He said the federalists were driving on just like
							a militia, without concert or order, and that some measures ought to be
							taken to produce Union among them— That there would be two Senators to
							be chosen this Session, as <persRef ref="foster-dwight">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Foster</persRef> would certainly
							resign; and <persRef ref="mason-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Mason</persRef> declines a re-election— That there were
								<hi rend="italic">two men to be provided for</hi>, and that measures
							should be pursued to prevent the excitement of ambition, and of course
							to produce the leaven of disappointment in a multitude of good men, who
							could have no reasonable pretensions, and whose feelings ought not to be
							tampered— I told him that concurring entirely with him in the sentiment,
							that something should be done to obtain united action and exertion, this
							was an occasion upon which I could do no more than say that I would
							cordially assist on my part in supporting or promoting the election of
							any one or two men other than myself, upon whom they would agree— Here
							this matter rested— The House of Representatives, last Saturday assigned
							to-morrow 12 o’clock, to make choice of the Senator for six years,
							instead of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Mason whose time expires on
							the 4<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of March.— The Centinel and
							Palladium, published that the time assigned was next <hi rend="italic"
								>Saturday</hi>. <persRef ref="russell-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Russell</persRef> of Boston moved
							this day in the house to postpone the choice untill next Tuesday—
								<persRef ref="otis-harrison">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Otis</persRef> argued in favour of the postponement— The vote
							pass’d, but was afterwards re-considered, and the original time again
							assigned, for to-morrow 12 o’clock— This hurrying on is occasioned by a
							coalition of the Jacobin party (so called) with the <hi rend="italic"
								>Junto</hi>, who expect to carry <persRef ref="pickering-timothy"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pickering</persRef> for the six

						<p><date>3. </date>The business in Senate this forenoon was of little
							importance— No bills of general interest being before them— About 1.
							o’clock <persRef ref="otis-harrison">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Otis</persRef> came up from the house with a message— That the house
							had proceeded to the choice of a Senator in the Congress of the United
							States, in the room of <persRef ref="mason-jonathan">Jonathan
								Mason</persRef>, whose time of service expires on the fourth of
							March next— And that on the ballots being taken it appeared that John
							Quincy Adams had a majority of the whole number.— The Senate assigned
							next Tuesday 12 o’clock to act upon this choice, and a nomination list
							in the mean time to be put up— <persRef ref="pickman-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pickman</persRef> immediately put my
							name upon the nomination list, and the name of <persRef
								ref="pickering-timothy">Timothy Pickering</persRef> was immediately
							after inserted— I know not by whom.— In the afternoon the Committee upon
							the applications for Banks met at the Land-Office and sat untill almost
							eight o’clock. We had the petitions from Newbury-Port, Boston, Salem,
							North Hampton and New-Bedford before us and heard the petitioners. We
							finally agreed to give leave to bring in bills, to all excepting at
							Boston, which was deferred for another hearing to-morrow— We had a
							severe thunder shower this evening.— At home the latter part of it— And
							play’d Back-gammon with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams</persRef>.</p>
						<p>Before the choice made in the house of Representatives, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pickman told me that as there would
							certainly be two vacancies in the Senate of the United States, he wished
							that M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pickering and myself <pb n="8"
								type="ms"/>might be chosen to fill them— But one of the places being
							for the whole six years, and the other only a remnant he thought M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pickering’s age, and the cruel
							persecutions of calumny which he had suffered gave him the right to the
							first choice— He thought him an honest and an able man, though of an
							unaccommodating and too assuming temper— His volunteering an answer to
							an Address from Princess Ann County, instead of laying the address
							before the President had always struck him as a very improper thing— He
							ask’d me whether the difference between M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Pickering and <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> would have
							such influence on me, as to make me unwilling to sit in the same house
							with him.— I told him I had no personal resentment against M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pickering whatever; and far from wishing
							to exclude him I would cordially give my vote for him, and for any other
							man upon whom the federalists would agree.— He then said that he had
							made up his mind, not to be active at all in the election; but to vote
							for the person whom the house should send up, provided he should think
							him a suitable person— And he added that he most sincerely wished M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pickering had not suffered his name to be
							put up.</p>

						<p>The reason of the election’s taking such an extraordinary turn, I am told
							was this— A caucus of about twenty members was held last evening at
								<persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Russell’s</persRef> house. They could not agree together upon
							supporting either M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pickering or me— Each
							being proposed and urged by several persons. At length it was agreed by
							way of compromise, that M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pickering should
							have the first chance, of two trials. And if his election could not then
							be carried they would unite for me— This agreement was but very
							imperfectly complied with at the third trial— At the two first and the
							fourth it was executed as faithfully as such things ever can be— At the
							Caucus <persRef ref="lowell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								<hi rend="italic">Lowell</hi></persRef> and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">Otis</hi> were warm partizans for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">Pickering</hi>— Of Lowell I could expect no less— Nor
							indeed of Otis— For he has of his own accord told me several times that
							as M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Mason would certainly decline a
							re-election, he the said <hi rend="italic">Otis</hi>, meant to use all
							his endeavours to get <hi rend="small-caps">me</hi> chosen in his stead—
							How could I possibly imagine then that Otis would propose or support any
							man but Pickering.</p>

						<p><date>4. </date>At 9 this morning, I attended the Committee on
							applications for new trials, in behalf of <persRef ref="boylston-ward"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Boylston</persRef>— They agreed
							upon an order of notice to <persRef ref="gill-moses2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Gill</persRef>— The business
							transacted in the Senate was not very important.— After we adjourned
								<persRef ref="otis-harrison">Otis</persRef> took me into one of the
							lobbies, to talk with me upon the subject of the application for a new
							bank in the town of Boston— He <pb n="9" type="ms"/>said I had no
							conception of the interest and agitation which this affair had excited—
							That the application embraced a great multitude of the most respectable
							persons in this town, and almost the whole commercial interest— That it
							appeared to be an opinion among them, that it depended entirely upon me,
							and he had heard I had objections against the plan, which he wished to
							remove if possible— He understood the Committee had required the
							Subscription paper to ascertain the names of the persons concerned and
							the amount of their subscriptions— He made no hesitation to avow that he
							was interested in it— He had never concealed it, and never wished to
							conceal it; but at the same time he did not wish to have his name appear
							to be animadverted upon by every member of the legislature and by the
							public abroad.— That he would tell me exactly how the plan was formed—
							The establishment of a new bank in this town had been talk’d of these
							two or three years; but lately about twenty Gentlemen, met together, and
							projecting to unite all the great and respectable interests in the town,
							had chosen a Committee from among themselves to offer the subscription
							round to every gentleman of respectable character, and to <hi
								rend="italic">apportion</hi> the amount which each person should be
							allowed to subscribe. That no individual subscriber was to take more
							than fifty shares, <hi rend="italic">excepting the original</hi>
							projectors themselves— That the two Insurance-Offices were to have two
							thousand shares each; but were to give up five hundred shares a’piece,
								<hi rend="italic">if such shares should be found necessary</hi> for
							any unforeseen demand— And that one thousand shares should be <hi
								rend="italic">reserved</hi>, to be taken by the twenty original
							projectors, among themselves, for their extraordinary trouble and
							attention— The fact was that if the plan should be defeated, it would be
							solely owing to the <hi rend="italic">liberality</hi> with which it was
							undertaken— If it should be defeated, the Jacobins would undertake and
							carry through a bank of their own, of which they had even matured a
							project— That had subsided only in consequence of the bank now proposed,
							for when <persRef ref="jarvis-charles">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Jarvis</persRef> was applied to subscribe this application he
							refused, alledging that he had already signed another application—
							Finally his principal object in thus talking with me was to say that
							there could be no necessity for having a subscription paper containing
							the names of the parties interested bandied about in public— I told him
							I was sensible how deep how large and how powerful an interest was
							combined in the pursuit of this project— That so far from contending
							against such a respectable weight of influence, it would be my strongest
							wish to comply with and promote every thing they should desire, so far
							as might be consistent with my duty— That the Committee on which I sat
							were equally divided; two being for giving leave to bring in a bill
							without limitation, and two absolutely against it— That so far the
							question depended upon me.— But it had been rumoured abroad that in
							forming the capital of this Bank a certain number of shares was <hi
								rend="italic">reserved</hi>, to be distributed among the members of
							the legislature; and this was a species of influence so dishonourable to
							the legislature itself, that I considered it indispensable to remove as
							far as could be the possibility of such a suspicion— That in consequence
							of this I had suggested, and the Committee had adopted the idea of
							calling for the subscription paper— But I presumed there would be no
							necessity for making it public.</p>
						<p>At 1/2 past three in the afternoon the Committee met again; but <persRef
								ref="treadwell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Treadwell</persRef> the chairman was not present— <persRef
								ref="higginson-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Higginson</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Lyman</persRef>, and <persRef ref="lloyd-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lloyd</persRef> again came, and urged
							further arguments to recommend their plan, and to remove objections—
							They produced their subscription paper; but as the Committee <pb n="10"
								type="ms"/>thought no <hi rend="italic">reservation</hi> ought to
							remain unappropriated, they took back the paper to have it fill’d up—
							The Committee agreed to give them leave to bring in a bill— But with
							condition that some clause should be introduced to indemnify the
							Commonwealth for the loss it will sustain upon its Union Bank Shares.
							And that the specie for the vaults of the New-Bank, shall not be drawn
							from any Bank incorporated by the Commonwealth.</p>
						<p>The Committee rose between 6 and 7.— I then pass’d an hour at my Office,
							where <persRef ref="gardner-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Gardner</persRef> call’d— The remainder of the Evening, I attended
