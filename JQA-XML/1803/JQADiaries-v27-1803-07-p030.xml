							it— But this diverted me so much at the first reading that it has never

									M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Lear</persRef>, but found none

								>Truculentus</persRef> and the fragments of <persRef
								ref="plautus-titus">Plautus</persRef>, and have thus gone through
							this author. I likewise read in the 22<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi>
							Volume of <persRef ref="lessing-gotthold">Lessing</persRef>, his life of
							Plautus. The Truculentus is a struggle <pb n="33" type="ms"/>between
							three lovers, for a Courtezan who values them exactly in proportion to
							their respective liberality; this play is among the incomplete pieces,
							much of which is lost. But is mentioned with approbation, by <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>, together with the Pseudolus.—
							The general character of these plays is that they bear too close a
							resemblance together— Their greatest value arises from the
							representation of domestic manners they exhibit, and even in this
							respect I know not how much dependence can be placed upon them— The
							manners of the theatre differ in all Countries, most essentially from
							the manners of real life; and in this case most of the plays of Plautus
							are translated from the greeks— The characters are not much
							discriminated— An old <hi rend="italic">dupe</hi>, a young <hi
								rend="italic">spendthrift</hi>, a vixen <hi rend="italic">wife</hi>,
							a tippling <hi rend="italic">bawd</hi>, a scoundrel <hi rend="italic"
								>pimp</hi>, a swindling <hi rend="italic">slave</hi>, a famish’d <hi
								rend="italic">parasite</hi>, a hired <hi rend="italic"
							>impostor</hi>, and a braggart <hi rend="italic">soldier</hi>, and a
							courtezan these <hi rend="strikethrough">ten</hi> personages constitute
							the whole of Plautus’s dramatis personae— His twenty plays now extant,
							as well as the six of <persRef ref="terence">Terence</persRef>, are only
							varieties in the adventures natural to such persons. The incidents, the
							wit and the humour all turn upon the situations and relations of such
							beings. The range of human life is therefore extremely partial and
							confined. The wit is sometimes excellent, often vulgar— The moral
							occasionally good, and generally very bad— They are a <hi rend="italic"
								>mine</hi> of dramatic treasure, but the metal is buried in a heap
							of alloy.</p>
