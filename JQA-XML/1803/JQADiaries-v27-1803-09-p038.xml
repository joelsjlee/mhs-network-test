							enough for any general statement in this particular. I have now closed
							my residence in Boston; probably for several years— Perhaps forever— It
							has like every other period of my life had its pleasures and its pains—
							The transition from the station and the means of expence I had
							previously possessed, could not be agreeable; yet I found it less
							mortifying than might be expected, and easily reconciled my mind to it—
							I have practiced all the economy I thought practicable, but have needed
							still more— My accounts I have kept very regularly and have ascertained
							the expence at which I could live in Boston as I have lived.— I fix it
							at $2400 a year, besides house-rent, which may be valued at $600 more.
							My business has given me about $1000; but by some successful
							dispositions of property, and with the income, I have derived from the
							Estate I had, my capital has remained unimpaired: it has however
							remained equally unimproved, and as to the amount of my possessions, I
							am just where I was two years ago—</p>
