						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> Differs only from that of the

						<p>The year now closing, has been remarkable as a part of my life, by one
							very unfortunate occurrence, and by several events which call for
							gratitude to an overruling Providence— The failure of a commercial house
							in London, with whom I had deposited a considerable part of <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> property, brought upon him a
							loss which is more distressing to me than to himself— It put me to great
							inconvenience to make the provisions to supply the chasm created by this
							circumstance, but its effects in diminishing the comforts of my father’s
							age, have been among the most painful things that ever happened to me. I
							have in some degree shared in the loss, and have done all in my power to
							alleviate its evils to him— But it has been and remains a continual
							source of uneasiness to me; nor have I any prospect that it will ever be
							removed.— In the disposal of my property however to meet the necessities
							which arose from the protest and return of the bills I had drawn on the
							house, I met with several facilities, and advantages which I had no
							right to expect— The calamity has fallen the lighter for this, and my
							own property has remained nearly in its former state— In my family I
							have been highly favoured, by the birth of a <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>second Son</persRef>, and the unusual degree of health which we
							have all enjoyed— The restoration of <persRef ref="adams-abigail">my
								mother</persRef> too from the gates of death, and from a confinement
							of five months, has filled my heart with the purest of enjoyments— My
							election as a Senator of the United States for six years, has been the
							only important incident of my political career. It has opened to me a
							scene in some sort, though not altogether new, and will probably affect
							very materially my future situation in life— I have already had occasion
							to experience, what I had before the fullest reason to expect, the <hi
								rend="italic">danger</hi> of adhering to my own principles— The
							Country is so totally given up to the Spirit of party, that not to
							follow blind-fold the one or the other is an inexpiable offence— The
							worst of these parties has the popular torrent in its favour, and uses
							its triumph with all the unprincipled fury of a faction; while the other
							gnashes its teeth, and its waiting with all the impatience of revenge,
							for the time when its turn may come to oppress and punish by the
							people’s favour. Between both, I see the impossibility of pursuing the
							dictates of my own conscience, without sacrificing every prospect not
							merely of advancement, but even of retaining that character and
							reputation I have enjoyed— Yet my choice is made, and if I cannot hope
							to give satisfaction to my Country, I am at least determined to have the
							approbation of my own reflections.</p>
