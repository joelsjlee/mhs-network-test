						<p><date>1. V. </date>Monday</p>
						<p>The new year began with one of the most beautiful days that the course of
							the Seasons ever brought round— A clear-sky—a bright Sun—a calm
							atmosphere, and all physical Nature moving in harmony, and Peace— The
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President’s</persRef> House was open
							as usual from 11 in the morning to 3 in the afternoon; and was crowded
							with visitors innumerable— I was not among them.— I have found it
							necessary to assume a position in public towards him, and his
							administration which forbids me from any public exhibition of personal
							courtesy, which would import a friendly feeling. <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> whose
							public position, not precisely the same as mine differs little from it
							went and escorted <persRef ref="bell-jane">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Bell</persRef> of Tennessee, wife of the late <persRef
								ref="bell-john">Speaker of the House</persRef>, who was also there—
							They afterwards came here, as did afterwards about 300 ladies and
							gentlemen of those who had been at the Presidents House— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay told me that he had twice during his
							visit spoken to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren; and the second
							time congratulated him upon his happiness in being surrounded by <hi
								rend="italic">so</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">many</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">of</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">his</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">friends</hi>—to which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Van Buren answered; the weather is very fine— No insignificant
							answer—for it implied his conscious assent to the satirical reflection,
							implied in Clay’s remark—Fair weather friends—</p>
						<lg>
							<l>Donec eris felix, multos numerabis amicos</l>
							<l>Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris.</l>
						</lg>
						<p>I snatched a quarter of an hour before noon to call on <persRef
								ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Madison</persRef> who also received many visitors, just before
							reaching her house, I met <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis
								Williams</persRef> and <persRef ref="graham-james4">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="williams-joseph2">Joseph L. Williams</persRef> of Tennessee,
							and thought they were going to my house; but from a feeling of
							awkwardness at asking them the question, and the fear of losing my
							chance to visit M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Madison, I passed by
							them with a slight salutation, when I believe I ought to have stopped,
							and enquired if they were going to my house, turned back with them, and
							waited for another chance to visit M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Madison— Upon what slight shades of difference depends propriety of
							conduct in social intercourse— These three men intended me a civility—
							There are no three men more entitled to a kind and courteous return— Yet
							they must have felt themselves slighted, and I might have returned their
							kindness in a manner which would have gratified them— Am I too old to
							learn?— Among our visitors whom I did not expect, were <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>,
							Secretary of State, with <persRef ref="forsyth-clara">his
							wife</persRef>, and <persRef ref="forsyth-clara2;forsyth-julia">two
								daughters</persRef>, and <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Poinsett</persRef>, Secretary of War,
							alone— I have never had any personal misunderstanding with either of
							them— They are both under great political obligations to me, in return
							for which no two men have been more active or effective political
							adversaries to me. Politically they have returned me unmixed,
							unqualified evil for good.— So has their chief—Martin Van Buren; though
							his obligations to me personally, are incomparably less than theirs— The
							Predecessor <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson’s</persRef>
							obligations to me, were incomparably greater; and were returned by still
							fouler and baser ingratitude— Forsyth and Poinsett first as partizans of
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, deadly enemies to
							each other, <hi rend="italic">afterwards</hi>
							<pb n="436" type="ms"/>afterwards as partizans of Jackson, my competitor
							did every thing in their power to ruin me in fortune and reputation; but
							always bore to me a smooth face, and gave me fair words— This is the
							hypocrisy of Politics, to which I am obliged to submit as to the fashion
							of the world—but which I cannot and never could practise— I cannot
							enumerate the visitors of the day, many of whom were not even personally
							known to me: but among them was <persRef ref="lincoln-heman">Heman
								Lincoln</persRef>, and <persRef ref="hallett-benjamin">B. F.
								Hallett</persRef> of Boston, and <persRef ref="jarvis-leonard"
								>Leonard Jarvis</persRef> of Roxbury—<persRef
								ref="johnson-catherine2">Catherine Johnson</persRef>, a daughter of
								<persRef ref="buchanan-andrew">Andrew Buchanan’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="johnson-susanna">Sister</persRef>, and who is now on a
							visit to <persRef key="frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Frye</persRef>, stayed and dined with us— <persRef
								key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>
							came again in the Evening, and it was observed by the <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary">Ladies</persRef> that he
							appeared to be out of Spirits—a state of temper which women observe much
							more keenly the men and which I had not remarked— I answered a Letter of
							invitation from a Committee of the American Philosophical Society at
							Philadelphia, to their annual supper on the 29<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> ult<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi> I had suffered the day
							to pass without answering the invitation.</p>

						<p><date>2. V. </date>Tuesday</p>
						<p>On rising this morning, I found on my table a Letter from <persRef
								key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>
							which he had left here last Night, and which announced to me the death
							of my brother <persRef key="adams-thomas">Thomas’s</persRef> eldest Son,
								<persRef ref="adams-thomas2">Lieutenant Thomas Boylston
								Adams</persRef>, of the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Regiment of
							Artillery of the Army of the United States.— He died at Fort Dade in
							East Florida, on the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last month of
							a Typhoid fever—an event totally unexpected to me and to all his
							relatives— He was born on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August
							1809. and was now in his 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> year—
							Educated at West Point, where he was graduated in 1828. he had been ever
							since that time in the army and was one of the most promising officers
							in the Service.— He contributed largely to the support of <persRef
								ref="adams-ann">his widowed mother</persRef>, and was the stay and
							hope of his Sister <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef>,
							now with us— He had been to me almost as a Son, and one upon whom my
							chief reliance was placed, for all his family. My first duty was to
							communicate this dreadful affliction to his mother, who is now on a
							visit to <persRef ref="coombs-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Philip Coombs</persRef> at Bangor, Maine; and I wrote to <persRef
								ref="angier-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Angier</persRef> the husband of his eldest Sister <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S.</persRef>
							<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My dear wife</persRef> gave the
							bitter potion to Elizabeth, who was in agonizing affliction from it the
							whole day— Before going to the Capitol I went to the Offices of <persRef
								ref="macomb-alexander">General Macomb</persRef>, and of the <persRef
								ref="jones-roger">Adjutant General Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Roger Jones</persRef>, who shewed me the Letter, from <persRef
								ref="crane-ichabod">Major Crane</persRef> at Fort Heileman
							announcing the death of Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Adams—
							General Macomb who told me that he was one of the most promising young
							men in the army; and that he had already presented his name to the
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> for promotion, to
							the new regiment of dragoons— General Macomb gave me a map of the seat
							of War in Florida, shewing the course of the rivers and the location of
							the forts— At the House I took scarcely any part in the business of the
							day— I found them in Session, having begun receiving <hi rend="italic"
								>Petitions</hi>
							<pb n="437" type="ms"/>Petitions from the Territory of Wisconsin—
								<persRef ref="owens-george">Owens</persRef> of Georgia offered a
							Resolution calling upon the <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of
								War</persRef> to inform the House, why a call of the last winter
							Session concerning Indian frauds, had not been answered— When the call
							itself was read it appeared that it related to frauds upon the Indians;
							and at my suggestion Owens altered the phraseology of his Resolution
							accordingly— A long debate arose upon it in which I took no part and
							which concluded with the adoption of the Resolution after rejecting I
							think an Amendment proposed by <persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace
								Everett</persRef>— When the State of Virginia was called <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> moved for the appointment of a
							select Committee, with Instructions to enquire into the expediency of
							proposing an amendment to the Constitution prohibiting the appointment
							of members of Congress to any Executive Office, during their term of
							service and for two years after. This gave rise to another debate which
							continued till past 3. when the House adjourned— I walked to and from
							the Capitol and as I passed in returning by <persRef
								ref="clevenger-shobal">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clevenger’s</persRef> room, I found him at his door apparently
							waiting for me. I had promised to call on him this morning but was
							disappointed by the distressing intelligence received— I found Elizabeth
							at home still bewailing with lamentations the loss of her brother.— I
							received this Evening, two Letters, one from <persRef ref="morgan-james"
									>1<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> Lieutenant J. M.
								Morgan</persRef> of the 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Regiment of
							Artillery, at Fort Brooke Tampa Bay, dated the 17<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> ult<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi> communicating the
							intelligence of Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> T. B. Adams’s
							death—and one from <persRef ref="stokes-james">Lieut<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> James H Stokes</persRef> of the 4<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Regiment of Artillery, enclosing a Copy
							of Resolutions adopted at a meeting of the Officers, stationed at
							Tampa-Bay—honorary to the memory of the deceased— They are signed by
								<persRef ref="armistead-walker">General Armistead</persRef>, and by
							all the Officers at the Station— His loss, is to his mother, his two
							sisters, especially Elizabeth and <persRef
								ref="adams-isaac;adams-joseph;adams-john3">his three
								brothers</persRef> inexpressible—and next to <persRef
								ref="adams-george;adams-john2;adams-charles2">my own Sons</persRef>
							he was dear to me. Ever trusting even in the most calamitous events to
							the wisdom and goodness of Providence, I humble myself in the dust and
							pray that this event may be sanctified for good to all those whom it has
							afflicted.</p>

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="lincoln-heman">M<hi rend="superscript"

							great sensibility for my kindness to <persRef ref="fletcher-richard"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher</persRef>, his

							Church, for supporting him against the base conspiracy of six members of
							the Committee of Ways and Means, against him— He also thanked me with
							strong expressions of confidence and gratitude for the struggle yet
							fruitless in behalf of the right of Petition, and the Freedom of Speech
							and of the Press— I receive so many of these testimonials of warm and
							consciencious attachment, that I am in great danger of mistaking them
							for evidences of public opinion— The votes of the House upon every
							proposition that I offer, and the increasing contempt manifested for <hi
								rend="italic">the</hi>
							<pb n="438" type="ms"/>the right of Petition, should be a continual
							warning to me that “he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but
							whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.”—Proverbs 28–26. H.R.U.S.
								<persRef ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> moved to go into
							Committee of the whole on the Union, upon the Message, but without
							success— <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> offered a Resolution of
							Instruction to the Committee of Elections, concerning their report of
							facts on the Mississippi election— <persRef ref="cushman-samuel"
								>Cushman</persRef> objected. Bell moved to suspend the Rules and
							succeeded— But after nearly two hours of discussion Bell’s Resolution,
							together with an amendment proposed by <persRef ref="cilley-jonathan"
								>Cilley</persRef> of Maine, at the motion of <persRef
								ref="parker-amasa">Amasa J. Parker</persRef> of New-York, was laid
							on the table by yeas and nays 96 to 92— This vote settles the definitive
							decision of the House on this election—a blindfold majority of 4 or
							5—will keep the usurpers <persRef ref="gholson-samuel">Gholson</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="claiborne-john">Claiborne</persRef> in their Seats,
							and turn off the members elected by the People of Mississippi, <persRef
								ref="prentiss-seargent">Prentiss</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="word-thomas">Word</persRef>— <persRef ref="reed-john"
								>Reed</persRef> moved a suspension of the Rules to take up the call
							for Petitions where it was yesterday suspended—the <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> having previously decided that
							the 30 days from the commencement of the Session expired yesterday, and
							that henceforth Petitions will be called for only on Mondays— Reed’s
							motion was carried, and the States were called through from South to
							North, beginning with Virginia and ending with Maine. <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> called up the Resolutions of
							the Legislature of Massachusetts, which he had presented at the special
							Session, moved their reference to a select Committee, and declared his
							wish to address the House concerning them another day— After sundry
							stifling motions by the Slave-holders, the Speaker decided that the
							Resolutions came under the operation of the gag and must be laid on the
							table— I presented about 100 Petitions, memorials and remonstrances,—all
							laid on the table— But with them were the two petitions in a small
							manuscript book, one signed by 84 women praying that Congress would
							accept the proposal of the Mexican Congress, to refer in the event of
							our not being able to settle the differences between the two Governments
							by Negotiation, their adjustment to the arbitration of a third power;
							and the other with 56 female Signatures praying that Congress would
							propose the institution of a Congress of Nations for the settlement of
							international disputes— I moved the references of both these petitions
							to the Committee of foreign relations, and that both should be
							printed—which was ordered. It is fortunate for me that the Committee of
							foreign Relations snatched at this class of Petitions; because it leaves
							me free to press them for an argumentative and elaborate report.—
							Between 3 and 4 O’Clock the House adjourned— I answered the Letters of
								<persRef ref="morgan-james">Lieutenants Morgan</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="stokes-james">Stokes</persRef>, and enclosed them with
							the proceedings of the Officers at Tampa Bay on the decease of <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas2">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> T. B.
								Adams</persRef>, to <persRef ref="adams-ann">his mother</persRef> at

							and of the mulberry tree.— There was a desultory conversation upon the
							expediency of giving any national encouragement to this promotion of
							agriculture and manufactures—but without Coming to any definite result—
							The whole subject is new to every member of the Committee, and certainly
							nothing will be done, unless the Chairman takes the labouring
							oars—suggests all the principles, and prepares a Report for discussion,
							in the Committee and in the House—for all which I am heinously

							was no corresponding disposition among the members— I must heavily task
							my time for this enquiry, or nothing will be done—and if I do, still
							nothing will be done— H.R.U.S. great part of the day was consumed in
							calling for and receiving Reports of Committees— Among them was one, by

							a hint that Howard would move this call— It was by the rule to lay over
							one day— Howard asked for its immediate consideration, but at my request
							waved that demand, on a suggestion that I wished to offer an amendment
							to the call— The House went into Committee of the whole on the State of

								ref="fulton-william">Fulton</persRef> of 10. Dec<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1830—and Fillmore moved his Resolution as
							an amendment to mine— Howard and <persRef ref="hamer-thomas"
								>Hamer</persRef> opposed them both feebly and maladroitly— Howard
							made a flourish of generosity about the North-eastern boundary, the
							right of which he said he had thoroughly examined, and it was
							unquestionably on our side; but it was a very old question; as old as
							the Peace of 1783 and it would be ungenerous to press the British
							Government upon it; while they were in trouble with their Canadian
							Provinces— This started <persRef ref="cilley-jonathan">Cilley</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="smith-francis">Smith</persRef> of Maine, who answered
							him sharply— Smith said that while the British were using the territory
							as their own, under an engagement to maintain the statu-quo; they were
							keeping in close prison a Citizen of Maine for performing acts of
							official duty. He thought this was quite as offensive an act, as that of
							a foreign Minister, about to leave the Country, publishing a pamphlet in
							a foreign language, upon which <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
							<pb n="441" type="ms"/>the Secretary of State had so largely descanted—
							Hamer said that we did not know the facts— That the aggression was
							probably from our own side; and that in such cases, an invasion of our
							territory might be justifiable; and was what was we had done ourselves—
							This brought up <persRef ref="bronson-isaac">Bronson</persRef> of
							New-York who read from the Jeffersonian a Newspaper published in his
							district, an extract from a Canadian paper of the other border
							threatening to send into the States a British army to emancipate two
							Millions of our Slaves— I asked if this system of party discipline was
							to be pursued in the coming crisis, and if calls for information were to
							be resisted merely because they came from members not of the majority
							party— Howard and Hamer were aground—high and dry— <persRef
								ref="patton-john">Patton</persRef> at last came out with an
							expedient to turn Fillmore’s amendment and mine into separate
							resolutions, and call for separate answers to each of them—to this we
							assented; and the three Resolutions passed without a division of the
							House— At the last moment <persRef ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> of
							South-Carolina, made two motions at once— That when the House adjourned,
							it should be till Monday—and to adjourn— It was perfectly ludicrous; it
							shewed however the bottom of this Justice Shallow— It failed. <persRef
								ref="corwin-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Corwin</persRef>

						<p>The state of mind in which I live, between deep anxieties for the fate
							and prospects of my country, and the pressure of private calamity, and
							forebodings which I cannot discard, affects continually the regularity
							of my Sleep— This morning I rose before three O’Clock, and did not
							return to bed— I answered at some length a Letter from <persRef
								ref="bacheler-origen">Origen Bacheler</persRef>, upon the petition
							of the Peace Society— Morning visit from <persRef
								ref="tillinghast-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tillinghast</persRef> of Rhode Island. I gave a sitting of an hour
							to the young Sculptor <persRef ref="clevenger-shobal"
								>Clevenger</persRef> who is taking my bust—but from having risen so
							early was slumbering almost all the time he was at work— In going to his
							room, I overtook and walked with <persRef ref="kemble-gouverneur">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Kemble</persRef> who spoke to me, of
							the Message of <persRef ref="marcy-william">Governor Marcy</persRef> to
							the Legislature of New-York which he promised to send me, and did so.—
							The paper contained not only the general message, but a special message
							concerning the capture and destruction of the Steamboat Caroline— I
							found also in the same paper, a Message or Speech of <persRef
								ref="head-francis2">Sir Francis Head</persRef> Governor of Upper
							Canada to the Legislature of that Province complaining much of the
							interference of the Americans in their troubles— Returning home I met
								<persRef ref="reed-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Reed</persRef>, who thought the Southern members were much
							disconcerted by this Canadian ebullition— Its operation hitherto is
							unfavourable to their projects of Mexican War, but I fear it will

						<p>At the Presbyterian Church— Heard <persRef ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler</persRef>, from 1. Chronicles
							29.29. [“]Now the acts of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef> the king,
							first and last, behold, they are written in the book of <persRef
								ref="samuel">Samuel</persRef> the Seer, and in the book of <persRef
								ref="nathan">Nathan</persRef> the prophet, and in the Book of
								<persRef ref="gad">Gad</persRef> the seer. 30. With all his reign,
							and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and
							over all the kingdoms of the Countries.”— But the discourse had little
							or no reference to David It was a review of the transactions of the past
							year—occasional for the first Sunday of the present— There were
							allusions to the suppression of the Freedom of Speech and of the Press,
							which I thought bolder than most of his auditory would relish; for in
							this community there is now no freedom even of thought upon any topic
							tainted with Slavery. I have thought from the little conversation I have
							had with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler, that he used freedom of
							Speech, though very guarded, yet not suited to his own success in this
							meridian— I thought his Sermon this day imprudent, for alluding at all
							to the rights of human Nature— He bewailed in pathetic terms the deep
							dissensions of the Presbyterian Church, which flow from the same cause,
							Slavery, though he did not mention it, and which in the course of the
							last year has terminated in a schism— But in other respects, he affirmed
							that the cause of religion and morality had made cheering progress in
							the course of the year— Not indeed in his own Church; for he complained
							that there had been an accession to it only of four members; and that
							they had lost two—so that their positive gain in the year had only been
							of two— After the morning I had morning visits from <persRef
								ref="gratiot-charles">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Gratiot</persRef> and a <persRef ref="nicollet-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicolet</persRef> a French Gentleman,
							who told me that he had visited me five years ago, which I did not
							remember, and that he had been ever since travelling, upon scientific
							researches throughout the United States with the exception of
							New-England— His pursuits have been astronomical, geographical,
							geodesical and mineralogical— <persRef key="frye-carolina">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frye</persRef> was here, and <persRef
								ref="johnson-catherine2">Catherine Johnson</persRef> dined with
								<persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary">us</persRef>—
							After dinner I attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s
							Church— <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read prayers for the first Sunday after the
							Epiphany, and a stranger preached a sensible Sermon from Hebrews 2.3.
							“How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation”—omitting the
							remainder of the verse. I received a Letter from <persRef

								<persRef ref="adams-thomas2">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> T.

							Catherine Johnson to <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi

								Pettrich</persRef> the Sculptor here this morning, and told me that
							he had a set of miniature casts in clay of the <persRef
								ref="bruce-thomas">Elgin</persRef> Marbles, which he wished to shew
							me, and he brought them accordingly this evening.— I had seen the
							originals in the British Museum in 1817— They are considered by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pettrich, as they were by <persRef
								ref="west-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> West</persRef>,
							who accompanied me in that visit to the Museum, as the most perfect
							specimens of that art, extant—and are said to be the work of <persRef
								ref="phidias">Phidias</persRef>— I am not enough of a connoisseur to
							perceive their transcendent beauties— There is too much uniformity of
							face and form in the human figures, while their attitudes are varied
							almost to infinity— There is much more beauty, grace, and variety in the
							Arabesques of <persRef ref="sanzio-raffaello">Raphaël</persRef> to my
							eye, than in these master-pieces of Grecian sculpture— But for all these
							arts of Painting Sculpture, Music, Poetry and Oratory, my judgment is
							imperfect, by relying too much upon their impression on my own mind, and
							not giving implicit assent to mere authority. An old man by the name of
								<persRef ref="u">Lyon</persRef>, came for my subscription to a book
							of Travels of <persRef ref="fisk-willbur">Wilbur Fisk</persRef>,
							President of a Methodist College at Middletown Conn<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> He was disposed to be loquacious but I
							had little time to hear him— I sat half an hour to <persRef
								ref="clevenger-shobal">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clevenger</persRef> for my Bust. H.R.US. Four Messages were received
							from the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef>— One
							relating to the capture and destruction of the Steamboat Caroline at
							Schlosser, and the three others with documents in answer to the calls of
							last Friday, moved by <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef>,
							myself and <persRef ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef>— In the
							first Message an Appropriation was demanded, and there was a motion to
							refer it to the Committee of Ways and Means— The appropriation was
							finally referred to them, and the rest of the Message and the three
							others to the Committee of Foreign Affairs— There was a debate in which
							Fillmore, <persRef ref="bronson-isaac">Bronson</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef>, <persRef ref="thompson-waddy"
								>Thompson</persRef>, <persRef ref="menefee-richard"
								>Menefee</persRef> and <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef>,
							took part— Rhett, vehemently against the Canadians, Thompson for them—
							Menefee denounced bitterly the conduct of the Administration against
							Mexico, which Thompson defended, and Wise gently censured— Petitions,
							beginning with Maine— Among those presented by me was one from <persRef
								ref="seely-horatio">Horatio S. Seely</persRef>, of Butternuts,
							Otsego County, New-York, praying the House to rescind the Resolution of
							21. Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>><hi rend="superscript">.</hi> The
								<persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> decided after much
							hesitation that it did not come within the Resolution, upon which a
							motion was immediately made to lay it upon the table which was done. I
							then presented a Petition from <persRef ref="day-jeremiah">Jeremiah
								Day</persRef> President of Yale College and 25 Citizens of
							New-Haven, praying for the repeal of certain Laws enacted before our
							Revolution, within the District of Columbia, the effect of which is to
							separate Parents from their children and husbands from their wives— The
							Speaker without much hesitation decided that this must go on the table
							under the Resolution of 21. December, though I told him that the
							Petitioners did not so understand it— I presented also<space/>Abolition and
							Anti-Texas Petitions, which were all laid on the table, the former by
							the general order, and the latter by special motion— The Call for
							Petitions had only reached Virginia when the <hi rend="italic"
								>House</hi>
							<pb n="444" type="ms"/>House adjourned.— <persRef ref="cilley-jonathan"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cilley</persRef> of
							New-Hampshire came to my Seat, and had a conversation with me concerning
							our North-eastern Boundary. He thought the Bill for requiring the survey
							should be engrafted as an amendment to the Bill which will be reported
							for the protection of the Niagara frontier, and he appeared not
							altogether satisfied that the North-eastern boundary-bill should be
							brought forward by <persRef ref="evans-george2">George
							Evans</persRef>—and he wished me to take charge of it. I told him that
							for two years past, I had not been upon terms with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Evans—and I could not with propriety
							consent to take anything, undertaken by him in this House, for a common
							cause out of his hands—particularly as I estimated highly his talents—
								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cushing</persRef> spoke to me of a joint communication to the
							Legislature of Massachusetts, informing them of the treatment which the
							Resolutions of the last Legislature, presented by him at the special
							Session of Congress, have received in this House.</p>
