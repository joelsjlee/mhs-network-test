						<p><date>1. I. and V:15.</date> Sunday— I was up at one O’Clock this
							Morning, and again rose for the day at a quarter past 5. racked with the
							hemorrhoidal Catarrh— At the Presbyterian Church, heard <persRef
								ref="fowler-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fowler</persRef> from Matthew 23.23 [“]Woe unto you, scribes and
							Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise, and cummin,
							and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and
							faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone”—a
							discourse upon hypocrisy— The distinction is between the performance of
							positive precepts and the neglect of moral obligations and humanity—
							Afternoon at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church— <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read the service for the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday in
							Lent, and preached from Isaiah 46.12. [“]Hearken unto me, ye
							stout-hearted that are far from righteousness: 13. I bring near my
							righteousness: it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not
							tarry; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.” I spent
							this Evening in conversation with <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker"
