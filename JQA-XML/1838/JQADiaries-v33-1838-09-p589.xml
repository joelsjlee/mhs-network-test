						<p>Visited my Garden, Nursery and Seminary, morning and afternoon— Dwarf
							Apples ripe— Horse-plums almost—headed down three Apple-trees from
							Medford, transplanted October 1830, and girdled in the winter of 1835–36
							by field-mice.— They have all put out numerous shoots below the girdle,
							all which <persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirk</persRef> now reduced to one,
							and sawed off the stock of the old tree at the point where the new shoot
							issued from the stump, covering the top surface of the remainder stock,
							with the wax composition—and practiced the same process on the stump of
							a peach-tree, winter killed—the same winter of 1835–36. to the ground,
							but from which a new shoot issued the next Summer— This day was almost
							wholly consumed in revising the pamphlet fragment Speech making with the
							preface and supplement 130 pages, and in despatching copies—one to each
							town in the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congressional District—
							This afternoon <persRef ref="harrington-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"

								Dillaway</persRef>, a Classmate of Harvard of my Son <persRef

							Roxbury Lyceum, to request me to deliver a Lecture before them— I
							excused myself as well as I could with the same reasons which I have
							given to others— The repetition of this same plea so continually is very
							mortifying— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef>,

							by <persRef ref="woodward-ebenezer">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Woodward</persRef>— <persRef ref="u">Miss French</persRef> brought
							me this afternoon a printed billet, signed the Ladies of Quincy,
							soliciting the company of my wife and me, at four O’Clock in the
							afternoon to a Pic Nic party, at the Hancock lot— This is a sequel to
							the Hingham party at Tranquility grove; intended to do me honour, and
							for which I ought to be warmly grateful; but for which I am so ill
							suited, that it greatly distresses me— I had a Letter too from <persRef
								ref="morton-ichabod">Ichabod Morton</persRef> of Plymouth urging me
							to attend the Convention at Hanover next Monday, which I finally
							concluded to do— We spent the Evening at Charles’s.</p>

								Lunt</persRef> this day— His morning text was from 2. Peter 3.5.
							“(For this they willingly are ignorant of, that) by the word of God, the

							water: 6. Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water,
							perished: 7. But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same
							word are kept in store, reserved unto fire, against the day of judgment,
							and perdition of ungodly men— 13. Nevertheless, we, according to his
							promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
							righteousness.”— A Dissertation, ingenious and not less devout upon the
								<hi rend="italic">place</hi> where heaven is located—and an argument
							upon the purification of matter in the future world— A subject awfully
							perplexing, how matter can be refined into unchangeable existence, and

							<hi rend="italic">the</hi>
							<pb n="590" type="ms"/>of the difficulties— He dined with us, and

						<p><date>3. IV:30. </date>Monday</p>
						<p>Visit to Hanover, Plymouth County, and return to Quincy. </p>
						<p>At 5. O’Clock this morning, I was at <persRef ref="u">French’s</persRef>
							tavern, when the Stage from Boston to Plymouth drove up and took the
							mail; and delivered one— There was not a single passenger, and I entered
							the Stage alone. At Hingham, one other person joined me, and at Scituate
							one more—both of whom remained Strangers to me— The passenger from
							Hingham, like myself was going to Hanover four Corners, to attend the
							Convention of the Plymouth County Association for the improvement of
							Common Schools. The distance from Quincy by this road is 18 miles 6. to
							Hingham 6. to Scituate and 6. to Hanover— We reached the tavern here
							about half past 7. and I had time to breakfast before any other of the
							visitors to attend the Convention arrived— They came in shortly
							afterwards— The meeting was held in the Episcopal Church, and was opened
							at ten O’Clock, by a prayer for the <persRef ref="robbins-thomas">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> Thomas Robbins</persRef>, a
							Trinitarian congregational clergyman of Mattapoisett, part of Rochester—
							Then <persRef ref="davis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nathaniel M. Davis</persRef> of Plymouth, President of the Plymouth
							County Association for the improvement of common Schools, standing in
							the chancel announced the objects of the meeting; which were to choose
							Officers of the Association for the ensuing year— To hear an Address
							from <persRef ref="mann-horace">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Horace
								Mann</persRef>, the Secretary of the board of Education, and to
							consider certain proposals of the board with reference to the
							establishment of a normal School, or School for the Education of
							Teachers of common Schools—a Committee was appointed to report a list of
							Officers; they reported the re-election of those of the last year with
							the exception of the <persRef ref="brooks-charles">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> Charles Brooks</persRef> of Hingham,
							as Secretary, he having requested to be excused from serving longer in
							that capacity. The report of the Committee was unanimously accepted, and
							then M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mann delivered his Address; which
							occupied nearly two hours.— It gave a rapid sketch of the recent
							proceedings of the Legislature, relating to Education— The formation of
							the board of Education, and the annual returns through them to the
							Legislature of all the Common Schools in the State— He referred to the
							antient institutions for Education from the earliest Settlement of the
							Colony, and pointed out many of the deficiencies both of the teachers
							and mode of teaching of the present time— It was about half after 12
							when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mann finished— A motion was
							immediately made by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ryder</persRef> to adjourn for an hour which was carried— The Stage
							from Plymouth to Boston stop’d on its way at Hanover just after one, and
							I was about to take my passage in it, when the <persRef
								ref="putnam-george">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> George
								Putnam</persRef>, a minister of Roxbury, and a member of the board
							of Education, offered me a Seat in his Chaise in which he would be
							alone— As he was to pass directly by my house I accepted the offer, and
							after dining at the hotel, attended the afternoon meeting at the Church—
							Extemporaneous Addresses were there made <hi rend="italic">by</hi>
							<pb n="591" type="ms"/>by <persRef ref="morton-ichabod">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ichabod Morton</persRef> of Plymouth,
								<persRef ref="rantoul-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert
								Rantoul jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> and the Rev<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> George Putnam, the two latter being
							members of the board of Education; after which I was requested to
							address the auditory— I made such excuses as I could to decline, but
							after much importunity consented—utterly destitute of the talent of
							extemporaneous public speaking on subjects with which I am not
							familiarly acquainted, and conscious that my information upon the
							subject under discussion was exceedingly imperfect, I spoke with shame
							and mortification—for about ten minutes— I apologised for my ignorance,
							and talked at random, referring unconnectedly to such observations of
							the preceding Speakers as occurred to me while speaking— In
							extemporising heretofore, I had found the principal difficulty to
							consist in having a closing remark always at hand and adaptable to any
							part of the address, to take off the awkwardness of an abrupt
							termination or of making periods in the midst of sentences—while I was
							sitting in the pew, thinking how if I should be obliged to speak, I
							could conclude, the idea occurred to me of the Spartan festival
							mentioned by <persRef ref="plutarch">Plutarch</persRef> in his Life of
								<persRef ref="lycurgus">Lycurgus</persRef>, at which the three
							Choirs of Old men, middle aged, and children, boasted of their prowess,
							each in a couplet, and not recollecting how they were translated by
								<persRef ref="langhorne-john;langhorne-william">Langhorne</persRef>,
							and the other English translator, I put the ideas into three short
							English couplets of my own, and wrote them with a pencil, on a Letter
							cover, and from that moment had no more concern about my Speech— When
							pressed to speak, so that I could no longer decline, I took the stand in
							the chancel, and rambled about between apology and desultory remark,
							without method or point, till I began to be tedious; and then finished
							by telling the story of the Spartan festival and the three Choirs of Old
							men, middle aged, and boys— I said the Choirister of the old man was I
							supposed of about my age, as I was if not the oldest man present very
							nearly so— And that he speaking for all the old men of the Country said
							as might be rendered in our language</p>
						<lg>
							<l><hi rend="italic">We</hi>, have been in days of old</l>
							<l>Wise and generous, brave and bold</l>
						</lg>
						<p>Whereupon the representative of the men in the prime of life, about the
							age of the gentleman who was about the age of the Gentleman who was to
							succeed me, (<persRef ref="webster-daniel">D. Webster</persRef>)
							said</p>
						<lg>
							<l>That, which in days of yore, ye were</l>
							<l><hi rend="italic">We</hi>, at the present moment are.</l>
						</lg>
						<p>And then a blooming boy, such as I had no doubt more than one could be
							found in the present assembly rose and said </p>
						<lg>
							<l>Hereafter, at our Country’s call,</l>
							<l><hi rend="italic">We</hi> promise to surpass you all.</l>
						</lg>
						<p>A shout of Laughter, and a thundering clap of hands followed, and I
							returned to the pew where I had been sitting at the side of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster, who said—well you have turned
							Plutarch to good account— It was something like a coincidence that while
							I had been hitching together these couplets he had asked me if I
							remembered a certain remark in Langhorne’s preface to his Plutarch which
							I did not— But I said I had read and admired Langhorne’s pre—in which he
							concurred— He was suffering with a very severe Catarrhal cold— When
							pressed to speak, he declined quite as earnestly as I had done. But he
							too was constrained, and addressed the auditory for about a quarter of
							an hour— He was for a reform in the teaching of the Common Schools, and
							said that the fault of the instructions was in teaching words <hi
								rend="italic">instead</hi>
							<pb n="592" type="ms"/>instead of things— He said also that all the
							elementary instruction that he had ever received before he entered
							college was at the Common Schools. He spoke with energy, and power, and
							as an occasional inhabitant of Marshfield in the County of Plymouth, was
							in favour of the establishment of the Normal School; and would
							cheerfully pay his proportion for it— This expense is the only
							difficulty to be gotten over; for it finally appeared that of all the
							towns to which the specific proposal had been made to provide for the
							expence, by a proportional contribution of a loan at a nominal interest;
							only two had accepted— One had positively rejected it, and from the rest
							no answer had been received. The meeting adjourned between five and six,
							and I came home with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Putnam; who stop’d
							and took tea at our house. We came home through Weymouth which abridges
							the distance about two miles— We found <persRef
								key="smith-catherine-johnson">my wife</persRef> and <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> at tea—but <persRef
								key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Smith</persRef>—<persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and <persRef

							Charles and <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> E Price Greenleaf</persRef>. Walked home with him— The
							day was fine; but the morning and evening so cold, that with my thick
							Winter Cloak I was barely comfortable— Besides the persons already named
							I met at Hanover <persRef ref="thomas-william">William Thomas</persRef>
							of Plymouth—<persRef ref="may-samuel">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>

								Angier</persRef> stop’d here this morning. She was returning home to
							Medford— The dissipation of yesterday encroached upon the time of this
							day, and threw me again into arrears— It was not until this time that I
							could complete the revisal of the fragment pamphlet; to send back one
							revised copy to <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gales</persRef> and one to <persRef ref="tappan-lewis"
								>Lewis Tappan</persRef> of New-York, which I did— The Pic Nic and
							Ball given by the Ladies of Quincy was on this day, with great
							formality, and with the intention of shewing respect to me and to
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>— The hour
							fixed in the printed invitation was four in the afternoon. The place was
							a lot of Land given by <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> to
							the Town of Quincy, and called the Hancock lot, because the cellar still
							remains upon it of the House in which <persRef ref="hancock-john">John

								ref="bartlett-ibrahim">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ibrahim
								Bartlett</persRef>, and <persRef ref="horton-lloyd">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lloyd G. Horton</persRef> came as a
							deputation from the company to enquire at what time it would suit me to
							join them— I said immediately— My wife with <persRef

								Smith</persRef>, <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C.
								Smith</persRef> and <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> had
							already gone— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bartlett and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Horton returned to the company, and then
							came back and escorted me to the entrance of the lot where I was
							received by six young unmarried Ladies between whom I was conducted to
							the large Lime-tree in the centre of the lot—there received by two
							married Ladies who presented me to <persRef ref="baxter-catharine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Baxter</persRef> the Lady hostess of
							the party—who conducted me and my wife to a couple of chairs under an
							Arch of Evergreens overshaded by the wide spreading branches of the Lime
							tree— There was an inscription over the arch, which I did not see— The
								<persRef ref="whitney-peter">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
								<hi rend="italic">M</hi><hi rend="superscript italic">r</hi>
								<pb n="593" type="ms"/>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter
								Whitney</persRef> stood near; and all around was a circle of women
							young and old to the number of about two hundred, with very few
							exceptions all inhabitants of Quincy— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney in the name of the Ladies addressed me by name, and said they
							had invited me to that party, in token of their respect for my long and
							eminent public services— Much to my relief he said no more—for more
							according to the custom which has lately crept in among us from England
							of beplastering a man with flattery to his face, more would necessarily
							have been fulsome and unmeaning adulation in the shape of praise— I then
							addressed the Ladies for about five minutes; thanking them for their
							kindness, and alluding to the testimonials of approbation and confidence
							which I had received last Summer from the men of this Congressional
							District, after the fiery trial of the preceding winter— I said, that
							this had made a deep and abiding impression upon my heart; but that at
							the two Sessions of the present Congress new trials of a different
							character, in which the rights and the reputation of the women of my
							Country, and particularly of the district, were involved— I stated the
							number of Petitions which I had received from the several towns in the
							district from women; the violent outrage by the Chairman of the
							Committee of foreign Affairs <persRef ref="howard-benjamin"
								>Howard</persRef>, upon the Petitioners, and the insult upon the
							sex, which I had felt myself called upon to repel, and the defence of
							the rights and fair fame of women which ensued— It was to this, I
							presumed, that I was indebted for the present kind notice of
							approbation, from the Ladies of Quincy, and to another of a similar
							nature, in another town of the District— I then made some remarks on the
							right of Women, to Petition, and on the propriety of their taking a part
							in public affairs— This was a point to be left to their own discretion,
							and there was not the least danger of their obtruding their wishes upon
							any of the ordinary subjects of Legislation—Banks, Currency, Exchange,
							Sub-treasuries, internal improvement, tariffs, manufactures; public
							Lands, Revenues and Expenditures, all which so profoundly agitate the
							men of the Country; the women so far from intermeddling with them, could
							scarcely be prevailed upon to bestow a thought upon them; and knowing
							that it was scarcely consistent with civility, so much as to name them
							in their presence— I now alluded to them only to discard them But for
							objects of kindness, of benevolence, of compassion, women so far from
							being debarred by any rule of delicacy from exercising the right of
							petition or remonstrance, are by the Law of their nature fitted above
							all others for that exercise.— I said I hoped their right would never
							again be questioned— I was sure if the Gentleman who I believed in an
							unguarded and inconsiderate moment had indulged himself by casting the
							reflection which I so earnestly reprobated, could be present to witness
							the Scene now before me, he would never again be tempted to express so
							ungentle a sentiment— I hoped no member of the House of Representatives
							of the United States would ever again be found to treat with disrespect
							the sex of his mother, but would feel for every woman the sentiment
							which I would now tender, in thanks to every female present whether
							Mother, daughter wife or sister, as expressed in the beautiful lines of
							an <persRef ref="sheridan-richard">English Orator and Poet</persRef></p>
						<lg>
							<l>“Had I a heart for falsehood fram’d— I neer could injure you;</l>
							<l>For though your tongue no promise claim’d— Your charms would keep me
								true.</l>
							<l>To <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, no Soul can bear deceit,<space/>No
								Stranger, offer wrong,</l>
							<l>But Friends in all the aged you’ll meet— And Lovers in the
								young.”</l>
						</lg>
						<p><pb n="594" type="ms"/>Thus I closed, and then the collation followed.—
							With many of the women I was acquainted and they introduced me to
							others— As the Sun went down there was a dance upon the green— The
							morning had been cold— The Sun had warmed the atmosphere and it was very
							comfortably warm— Immediately after Sunset however it became again
							chilly, and the party adjourned to the Ball-room at <persRef ref="u"
								>French’s</persRef> Hotel, now called the Hancock House— Invitations
							to the Ball were given us on the ground— I came home and between 7 and 8
							accompanied the Ladies to the Ball— The Hall was crowded to excess, and
							fifty couples were dancing at one country dance— The dancing was
							universally good, and far more animated than I had seen at private Balls
							for many years We remained about half an hour after the Evening Ball;
							and then though much urged to stay to the Supper, came home— The dances
							were Cotillions, Country dances and fancy dances. No Waltzing— The Ball
							was continued till between one and two of the morning.— <persRef
								ref="sampson-rachel">Miss Sampson</persRef> came here to work for

						<p>I rose this morning with a dull head-ache which continued nearly through
							the whole day, and disabled me for industrious occupation— I
							consequently indulged myself in idle visitation of my seedling trees in
							my garden, Nursery and Seminary—observing them though to no profitable
							purpose— The observer of Nature should not only discern defects but
							devise remedies— When I see a tree perish, I should search the cause of
							its failure and learn to save another of the same kind. But almost all
							my observation is lost upon me— As an experiment I sawed off a
							horizontal limb from a button wood tree, grown since August 1834. when I
							took a horizontal twig from a button wood stake, near the North end of

						<p>A sultry Summer day.— I am endeavouring to keep alive, the Pear trees
							which sprung up on the border between my Eastern door and the gate last
							year but which <persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirk</persRef> has cropped with
							his Scythe; together with about half a dozen in the same line of which I
							dropped the seeds last Summer, and which have come up— I spaded the
							ground and gave it a dressing this morning—and Kirk took up the weeds
							from the Summer house cellar.— Horse Plums gathered— Small, but well
							flavoured. While I am waiting for a further supply from <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and <persRef ref="seaton-william"
								>Seaton</persRef> of my pamphlet speech, it occurred to me to send a
							copy of it to the first petitioner of all the petitions and
							remonstrances against the annexation of Texas to this Union, which were
							committed to my charge, at the two Sessions of the present Congress— For
							this purpose it becomes necessary to make out an Alphabetical list of
							all the Petitioners, at the head of the Petitions; a work upon which I
							began, with the Petitions presented at the Special Session; of which
							there were about 400—of which ninety against the annexation of Texas,
							and the rest, for the abolition of Slavery.— It is slow work and will
							take me two hours a day for nearly three weeks to complete the Lists for
							both Sessions— It occupies time too which ought perhaps to be devoted to
							more intellectual occupations.— But there appears to be a duty of
							obligation to give <hi rend="italic">to</hi>
							<pb n="596" type="ms"/>to the Petitioners who entrusted their Petitions
							to me, some information of what disposal was made of them—and I propose
							to send one copy of my pamphlet to the first petitioner, of every
							petition that I presented against the annexation of Texas— Towards
							evening, I strolled again in my garden, and <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Price
								Greenleaf</persRef> came in while I was there. He says that forest
							trees should not be trimmed, but I have experience enough to know that
							it improves their shape, and hastens their growth— My first morning hour
							this day was somewhat discomposed— <persRef ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Holbrook</persRef> had prescribed for
							my habitual catarrh, a daily draught of five drops of sulphuric acid in
							a tumbler of water, and I had taken them daily for the last fortnight—
							To keep the viol of vitriol out of the reach of the children it was hung
							up on a brass hook just over my wash stand—but the cork of the viol was
							eaten away, by its contact with the fluid Half drops remaining on the
							lip of the glass, worked their way to the red tape, and the twine round
							its neck, by which it was suspended; and decomposed them both It fell in
							the night; struck on the lower shelf of the stand, broke off at the neck
							and spilled nearly all the burning fluid over the stand; running over by
							one of the legs on the carpet turning a circular spot round it of the
							size of a small saucer black as a coal— I had foreseen this Catastrophe
							without guarding against it.</p>

							preached an admirable Sermon— Morning and afternoon from the same text.
							Luke 17.21— “For behold, the kingdom of God is within you.”— There is a
							new controversy fermenting in the minds of the younger Unitarian
							Clergymen in this State, which threatens a further schism in the
							Christian Church—or rather a renewal of the old problems about matter
							and Spirit in a new form— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt’s argument
							is that the Christian dispensation is a spiritual regeneration—a system
							of ideas in the Soul, by the direct agency of almighty power— He rejects
							therefore the doctrine of <persRef ref="locke-john">Locke</persRef> that
							there is no other source of ideas but sensation and reflection— And this
							system he supposes to have a threefold influence; upon the intellect,
							upon the sentiments, and upon the conduct of men— The part of the
							discourse delivered in the morning I thought unexceptionable, eloquent
							and deeply impressive—the remnant of this afternoon, the application to
							the points in controversy gave me pause— It seemed to me as if it was
							bordering on the mystical— The question has often occurred to me what is
							Faith, and why in the Christian dispensation it is held to be the
							essential condition of Salvation— The word Faith has several distinct
							senses even in the Scriptures— It sometimes means only belief— Belief in
							the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Truth of his gospel— But belief is not
							always voluntary— Belief is not at the command of the will— But belief
							alone is a mere condition of the mind—importing no action; it is an
							attribute of man’s immortality—no other being upon earth has the
							capacity to believe— <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Paul</persRef> defines Faith to be the <hi rend="italic"
								>substance</hi>
							<pb n="598" type="ms"/>substance of things hoped for—the Evidence of
							things not seen— It is therefore not founded upon the testimony of the
							senses.— It is trust— But Faith in a more enlarged sense is truth to an
							obligation of duty— And that is its worldly sense. It is the principle
							of sanctity to the performance of a promise, and this is the sense in
							which <persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef> was the father of the
							faithful— This is the universal duty of obligation from man to man, and
							between man and woman— It belongs to the immortal part of their nature,
							and is the foundation of all Justice, and all morality— Is not the sense
							also in which Faith is essential to Salvation?— Incorrupta Fides, is
							much more than mere belief. But I cannot now enlarge— I read the fifth
							Sermon in the 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, and intended to have read the
								6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> to make up the loss of the last

								ref="moore-calebe">Caleb Moore</persRef> the son of one of his

							He walked up with me to <persRef key="adams-charles2"

						<p>The gathering of clouds all day yesterday, and last Evening terminated by
							a storm of rain, which commenced in the night and continued through the
							whole of this day and evening with scarcely any intermission— I should
							have employed the time busily upon engagements of duty, but the sore
							throat, mouth and tongue, which annoyed me yesterday were far more
							troublesome this day and attended with a symptom which I had never
							before experienced— The tip of the tongue was excoriated—the mouth and
							throat sore, with a coppery taste as of Arsenic, and an almost total
							extinction of taste in every thing that I ate or drank— The cause of all
							this remaining a mystery, with a strong suspicion that it was in some
							way connected with the drops of sulphuric acid which I have taken by
								<persRef ref="holbrook-amos">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Holbrook’s</persRef> direction in tumblers of water— Another
							suspicion was that I had drawn all this upon myself by exposing myself
							bareheaded in my garden, nursery and seminary, morning after morning, in
							the twilight before sunrise. <hi rend="italic">The</hi>
							<pb n="600" type="ms"/>The consequence was that I could think to no
							purpose, but could only drudge— I answered the Letter from <persRef
								ref="tremain-er">E. R. Tremain</persRef> Chairman of the Lecture
							Committee of the New-York Mercantile Library Association; and despatched
							it with that to the <persRef ref="clark-aaron">Mayor of
								New-York</persRef>; both declining the invitation to deliver the
							introductory Lecture before them— Finished the Alphabetical List of
							Petitioners, first signers to Petitions presented by me to the House of
							Representatives U.S. at the First Session of the 25<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress, and re-examined and assorted
							my files of Letters received in 1837 and 38. in which process I found
							the Pension Certificate of <persRef ref="adlington-john">John
								Adlington</persRef> which he had left with me in September last, and
							in the search for which I had already wasted so much time.— I
							immediately enclosed and sent it to <persRef ref="loud-jacob">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jacob H. Loud</persRef> of Plymouth,
							who had twice written to me to ask for its return— Without this
							Certificate the poor man could not receive his pension, and it stung me
							to the quick that my carelessness in mislaying the document was
							depriving him of his daily bread— The discovery gave me proportional
							relief. <persRef ref="sampson-rachel">Miss Sampson</persRef>

						<p>The storm continued, increasing in violence, till about half past two
							O’Clock this morning, when the rain beating against my windows waked me,
							and I could sleep no more— My mouth, tongue and throat were sorer than
							ever and I knew I could not lie awake and think till day-light with any
							tranquility of mind.— I arose, lighted my lamp—drew up my table close to
							my bedside, and sitting up in bed read for about an hour and a half in
							the life of <persRef ref="scott-walter">Sir Walter Scott</persRef>— Then
							dressed and sat down to answer two Letters from <persRef
								ref="ladd-william">William Ladd</persRef>, President of the American
							Peace Society— They are to hold a meeting next Tuesday at Boston; and I
							wish to furnish him in Season with copies which he has requested of
								<persRef ref="legare-hugh">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Legarés
							</persRef>Report to the House of Representatives U.S. on the Peace

								<persRef ref="tallmadge-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tallmadge’s</persRef> Speech to the Senate on the Sub-treasury, of
							which I have received about 20 from an unknown hand, for circulation;
							and with them I have enclosed copies of my Oration of 4 July 1837. at
							Newbury Port— Several hundreds of these were received here last
							September after I left home for Washington; and are now here an
							incumbrance— The morning slipped away— The tempest of wind subsided by
							the Sun’s rising— The rain continued an hour or two longer to stream and
							then held up—before Noon the clouds broke away, and at 8 minutes past 6.
							I saw the last gleam of the sinking Sun, from my Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> porch a little South of due
							West— Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> dined
							and spent the Evening with us— Before dinner I took to the Post-Office
							the Packets that I had made up— Visited my garden and Nursery— Found
							much unripe fruit strewn on the ground wind-fallen; among which a
							considerable number of the Acorns of the English white Oaks, six of
							which I planted in the row of seedling beds of <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna;adams-louisa3;adams-john17;adams-charles7;adams-henry4"
								>my six grand children</persRef> in the Seminary— I had the old dead

								<persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirk</persRef>, between the two new stocks
							near the surface of the ground, which sprouted out in the Spring of
							1837. from the old Stock, which had been winter killed the Season

							<pb n="601" type="ms"/>table by a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Leeds</persRef> of New-York with
								<persRef ref="u">his brother</persRef>— About two years since he was
							here speculating upon granite quarries, and in treaty with me, for the
							purchase of some of my lands— He has since been in Florida, and
							discovered near S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Augustine a lot of land,
							I think he said about 8 acres, belonging to the United States, the use
							of which he wished to obtain gratuitously for the cultivation of the
							Morus Multicaulis, and the raising of silk-worms— He asked if there was
							power in the Government of the United States, to grant him this
							privilege; and if there was, to whom he must apply to obtain it— I said
							I could not tell whether the Government had the power to grant a
							gratuitous use of the land without an Act of Congress— That a Bill had
							been reported at the late Session authorising the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> so to dispose of lots of
							public lands, for the cultivation of silk worms and the sugar beets but
							had not passed both Houses and become a Law—and I recommended to him to

						<p>The weight of years presses me down with constantly growing aggravation,
							and trifling causes of excitement multiply upon me, which in the prime
							of life I should not even have felt— Worn out with fatigue by two
							successive almost sleepless Nights, I took to my bed last Evening before
							the stroke of the Curfew bell— There was then a feeble radiation of
							Northern light— About midnight I awoke and looking out at the Eastern
							window in front of my bed saw a light surpassing that of a full moon,
							and which I took first for the morning dawn within a quarter of an hour
							of the Sun’s rising— But I slept again till a quarter past three, when
							Sirius, was half an hour risen— I brought out <persRef ref="bode-johann"
								>Bode’s</persRef> Uranographia from my closet, laid him on my bed
							and found the position of Procyon which I had forgotten— Renewed also my
							acquaintance with Betelgeuse, Bellatrix and Rigel, the three brightest
							stars of Orion— Then dressed—visited my plantations; finished my Letter
							to <persRef ref="ladd-william">William Ladd</persRef>, and made up some
							documents for the Post-Office— <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> went to Boston, and returned home to dine— His
							house in Boston was broken open, and rifled on Tuesday Night, as that of
								<persRef ref="miller-edward">Edward Miller</persRef> had been a few
							Nights before— The same treatment has been experienced by about twenty
							houses within the last Month and the City authorities slumber over it as
							quietly as if no such thing had happened— Soon after dinner I had visits
							from <persRef ref="jackson-francis2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Francis Jackson</persRef> and <persRef ref="loring-ellis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellis Gray Loring</persRef>, whose
							special object was to have a Portrait of me taken, for a company of
							Gentlemen in Boston—and they requested me to sit for that purpose, to a
							young promising Portrait Painter from New-York named <persRef
								ref="page-william">Page</persRef>; to which I consented— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring is to give me notice of the time
							and place, which is proposed to be next week at some house in Boston—
							They were succeeded by <persRef ref="bancroft-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bancroft</persRef> the Collector of
							the Customs at Boston, with <persRef ref="u;u">two young men by the name
								of Smith</persRef>, who came to take me by storm for a Lecture to
							the Lyceum.— Bancroft always an egregious flatterer so beplastered me
							with praise, and the intense desire there was to see and hear me in
							Boston, that I scarcely knew how either to keep my temper, or to resist
							his importunities. I finally made a sort of conditional promise to
							attend a meeting of the Lyceum, some day in October— I understand this
							anxious desire to see and hear me, is something like the Passion of a
							crowd, to see an Execution— There is no good will to me in any party at
							Boston— <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
							<pb n="602" type="ms"/>I am obnoxious to them all; and to the last gasp
							of my life am doomed to hold my course in opposition to them all— These

								Smith</persRef> was unwell, and kept her chamber the whole day— An
							insane young man, who said he was called by the name of <persRef
								ref="day-james">James Day</persRef> came on horseback to the house,
							and said he had come from New-York, for the sole purpose of engaging my
							services as a lawyer, for two purposes—first to obtain satisfaction for
							excessive ill-treatment which he had received from certain members of
							the Legislature of the State of Illinois at Vandalia—and secondly to
							obtain possession of a bequest of ten Millions which had been left him
							by his real father in a foreign country— The injury done him at
							Vandalia, was in administering to him medicines, to deprive him of his
							reason and induce him to commit suicide, and thereby to rob him of his
							rights— He had actually been reduced to that state and had made the
							attempt, but his life had been saved, and he had become convinced that
							it was better for him to live. As to those who had injured him in
							Illinois, he might have challenged them to meet him in the field; but he
							did not approve the practise of dueling— He thought it better to take
							the course of the Law, and had come to engage my services which he hoped
							I would give without requiring a retaining fee— I told him I was not and
							had not been for more than thirty years in the practice of the Law; but
							asked if he had no relatives, connections of the persons who had passed
							for his Parents— He said there were such relatives but they could be of
							no use to him— His supposed Parents whose name he bore were dead— I
							enquired of his age—he said it was thirty— That he had been some years
							in business as a merchant in the City of New-York; very successful; and
							in which he had amassed an handsome property; but that in the troubles
							which came on two years ago, he had been unfortunate—had lost all he
							had, and become unable to meet his engagements— He had therefore gone to
							seek his fortune at Vandalia, and there had met with this injurious
							treatment— I enquired who it was that he believed to be his father, and
							to have left him the bequest— He said “an individual of the Bonaparte
							family”— I said then it must be <persRef ref="bonaparte-jerome"
								>Jerome</persRef>; the only individual of the family who had been in
							this Country more than thirty years ago— No; it was not Jerome—who then?
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef>— But he was
							never in this Country— Nor do I believe I was born in this Country, but
							was brought here in childhood— It is known that Napoleon had several
							children, and made provision for them by his Will— I want my right, and
							nothing but my right— If I am the son of Napoleon I am entitled to the
							Crown of France, and if I am entitled to it, I want it— I saw <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> yesterday, and he advised me to apply to some
							lawyer in the State of Illinois— That was the <hi rend="italic"
								>best</hi>
							<pb n="603" type="ms"/>best advice that he could give you, and I give
							the same— But in the whole State of Illinois there is not a single
							lawyer in whom I can have a particle of confidence— This was the
							substance of his conversation— I repeated that not being in the practice
							of the Law, it was not in my power to assist him.— He thanked me
							courteously for my advice; mounted his horse and went off— <persRef
								ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>Returned last Night to my bed chamber, and rose this morning at four—

							Eloquence, and the Pastoral care at the theological Institution at

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>— His morning text
							was from Proverbs 4.23. “Keep thy heart with all diligence: for out of

							“For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world and lose

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ware jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> is
							the eldest Son, of <persRef ref="ware-henry">my old chum</persRef> of
							1786. the Hollis Professor of Divinity at Harvard University, and like
							him one of the salt of the Earth— His discourses were both excellent,
							and presented a striking and impressive parallel between the Spirit and
							the flesh— The body and the Soul— The perishable and the immortal part
							of man’s nature— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Waterhouse dined with
							us— I invited, and very earnestly pressed D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Ware, but he declined; labouring under a severe sick head-ache, which he
							said disabled him from all other exertion, and all possibility of
							partaking in conversation or the pleasures of Society— He went to M<hi

							after the afternoon service; and they barely stop’d at our gate on their
							return towards Cambridge, to take D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Waterhouse’s Cloak— The Doctor at table this day told <persRef

								ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Franklin</persRef>, wearing a light blue coat with read facings, and
							that <persRef ref="johonnot-samuel">Samuel Cooper Johonnot</persRef> was
							also there— This had altogether escaped my memory; and the circumstances
							fix the time between January and July 1780. The light blue and red
							uniform was that of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pechigni’s</persRef> school— The first recollection that I have of
							the Doctor was some months later in the same year about the beginning of
							December at Amsterdam, when the Doctor was a medical student at Leyden,
							and persuaded <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> to send me
							and my brother <persRef ref="adams-charles">Charles</persRef> there with
								<persRef ref="thaxter-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Thaxter</persRef>— The Doctor is now tottering into his grave; but
							the chances are at least equal that I shall precede him in the

								<persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef> chiefly on the words

							That he had retained the possession of them during his life, and that

							better profit, I would readily give my consent and execute the necessary
							deeds. I thought M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Souther who wants to

						<p>On rising this morning I saw Venus, about a quarter of an hour risen,

							would rise 5 minutes after six this morning—but it rose 20 minutes

							And of this I have no doubt; that if they shall by the blessing of God

								>r</hi> Lunt preached from Hebrews 12.14. “Follow peace with all
							men: and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:”— The
							discourse was confined to an exposition of the better part of the
							text—and it was admirable— By holiness, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt understands sincere and habitual piety— The first part of the verse
							prescribes the duty of man to man, and sums it all up in the injunction
							to follow Peace with all—but holiness is the purity of the heart, whence
							all virtuous action proceeds, and by seeing the Lord is that exquisite
							enjoyment which is exclusively reserved to the immortal Soul— <persRef

							and Charles dined with us; as did <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand</persRef> who came out from
							Boston, and spent the day here. We rode to and from Meeting this
							afternoon in the midst of an heavy rain. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt’s Sermon was from Mark 7:11. [“]But ye say, if a man shall say to
							his father or mother, it is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by
							whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me: <hi rend="italic">he</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">shall</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">be</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">free</hi>.” These last words are added in the English
							translation— There is something of obscurity in the text; of which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt gave an explanation— The discourse
							was against hypocrisy as exemplified by the Pharisees— Late in the
							Evening a cold Northwestern sky-scraper, cleared up the atmosphere— I
							read the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sermon of the 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef>— A continuance of the series upon the Passion of
							Christ. The text is from the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> to the
								12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> verse of the 23<hi
								rend="superscript">d</hi> chapter of Luke; but the main stress of
							the discourse is upon the words [“]il emeut le Peuple,” he stirreth up
							the People; and the argument is upon the false imputation of exciting
							sedition cast upon Jesus Christ, and always applied to great reformers—
							The preacher compares and conciliates the passages in which Jesus
							himself declares that he came not to bring peace but the sword; and to
							set the members of the same family at variance with one another with
							those in which he gives the precepts of universal benevolence— And he
							acutely discriminates between the disorders imputable to the
							doctrine—and those resulting from the passions of those to whom the
							doctrine is addressed— This is one of the remarkable Sermons of the
							collection—containing much matter applicable to the present times.</p>

							the Painter, of <persRef ref="loring-louisa">M<hi rend="superscript"

							treatment that he had received in England from <persRef
								ref="oconnell-daniel">Daniel O’Connell</persRef> which he thought
							very rude— Upon his introduction to the Irish Orator, he enquired from

							indemnity to the sufferers— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman told

							Call at the Post-Office, and found that the 1000 copies of my fragment

							three months sight for payment— He enquired if the pamphlet was
							stereotyped— I said no, but I believed the Press was kept standing— He
							said he thought he should soon dispose of these copies and want more— I
							said there was no copy-right, and I had given a conditional permission
							to the Executive Committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society at
							New-York, to publish an edition of it, if they <hi rend="italic"
								>should</hi>
							<pb n="610" type="ms"/>should wish; on condition that they should not
							countermand the orders they had given to Gales and Seaton for 1000
							copies— After calling at two or three shops to enquire for long cotton
							stockings which one of the shopmen told me, had gone so much into disuse
							that they would not pay for the expense of keeping them for sale, I
							returned to Charles’s Office, and waited for him a half an hour, till
							near two O’Clock— The tenant of the Southernmost of my two houses corner
							of Boylston Street, came to call upon Charles for repairs.— After
							waiting sometime longer I went to the Stable— Charles after waiting for
							me sometime, had just gone— I went back again, found he was not at the
							Office— Just then the Plymouth stage went by, in which I took a seat,
							and at 20 minutes past 3 was landed in front of <persRef

						<p>I awoke in the middle of the Night, and no stars being visible knew not

							the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, it started so many enquiries that
							after consuming about two hours upon them, I was obliged to give them
							all up and desist— My father was a member of that Convention and of the
							Committee that drew up the Declaration of Rights and the Constitution of
							Government— But he sailed for Europe before they were debated in the

							morning Sermon was from Matthew 28.19. [“]Go ye, therefore, and teach

								ref="adams-henry4">Henry Brooks</persRef>, last Sunday. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt gave in it an exposition of his
							understanding of the meaning of the text— He disclaimed all belief in
							the doctrine of the Trinity, without however discussing it. His
							explanation of the text was satisfactory to me, though not to the
							trinitarians, who are quite as inaccessible as the believers in the
							kindred doctrine of transubstantiation— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Lunt’s opinions upon the nature and duties of Christian baptism, and
							particularly of those who hold up their children for baptism, were
							cogent and impressive— His afternoon discourse was from 2. Peter 1.7.
							“And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness
							charity.”— The leading idea of which was that the principle of Christian
							morality was the accumulation of all the social virtues— Returning from
							Meeting this afternoon I stopped at Charles’s house to see his son
								<persRef ref="adams-john17">John</persRef> who has been some days
							unwell— <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">His mother</persRef> was about to
