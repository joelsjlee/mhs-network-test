						<p>Second Session of the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress closed—
							The House of Representations adjourned yesterday morning to meet this
							morning a 9— <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">B. Howard</persRef> enquired
							of the <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> whether I was to
							continue my Speech this Morning. The Speaker said the last day of the
							Session, all the ordinary rules of the House were superseded— <persRef
								ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> made some remarks upon a vote
							yesterday at the call of the House to excuse him for absence on payment
							of fees— This led to a discussion of two hours and sundry propositions;
							to revoke all the censorial votes upon absentees yesterday Morning at
							the call— I moved an amendment to Bell’s Resolution, one to rescind all
							resolutions of censure, and all orders for payment of fees by members
							for absence on the call of the House on the morning. The members who had
							passed these resolutions took this as casting a reflection upon them—
								<persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> moved a reconsideration of
							the <pb n="873" type="ms"/>Resolutions of censure which had been moved
							by him; whereupon Bell withdrew his resolution whereby mine, moved as an
							amendment to his fell of course. Wise called for the previous question
							upon the reconsideration of his first resolution of censure which was
							carried and on reconsideration the resolution was rescinded— He then
							moved a reconsideration of his second Resolution, which required that
							sixteen Members whom the <persRef ref="dorsey-roderick">Sergeant at
								arms</persRef> had found at the Railway Cars starting for Baltimore,
							and who in defiance of his summons still went their way, should be
							called to answer for their contumacy at the reassembling of the House,
							and he moved the Previous Question at the same time— A question of order
							was made whether two Questions could be moved by a member, at once— The
							Speaker mirum dictu, decided that they could; and the House on appeal
							sustained the decision— The reconsideration prevailed, but the House
							refused to revoke the resolution against the contumacious members— I
							then moved my resolution to rescind all resolutions of censure and all
							orders for payment of fees for absence at the call of the House on the
							Sabbath, and moved the previous Question, which occasioned a shout of
							laughter in the House— It was carried and my Resolution was rejected by
							yeas and nays 43 to 90.— Afterwards I appealed to the good nature of the
							House to pass a Resolution remitting the payment of fees, which had been
							ordered— <persRef ref="mckennan-thomas">M’Kennan</persRef> offered the
							Resolution and it was adopted— The 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and

						<p>Campbell Archibald</p>
						<p>At the Presbyterian Church this morning heard a young man named <persRef
								ref="u">Stevenson</persRef> from Acts 17.11. [“]These were more
							noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with
							all readiness of mind, <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">searched</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">the</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">Scriptures</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">daily</hi>, whether those things were so.”— The words
							underscored were the text, and the Discourse was an earnest and vehement
							exhortation to search the Scriptures daily— Having been for about fifty
							years deeply impressed with the sense of that duty, the excessive zeal
							of the preacher to inculcate it upon his <pb n="877" type="ms"/>hearers
							was rather irksome to me— After dinner, at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s Church the service was performed by <persRef
								ref="meade-richard2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meade</persRef>,
							a son of <persRef ref="meade-william">Bishop Meade</persRef> of
							Virginia, who had preached there this morning— The prayers were for the
								5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity, and the
							Sermon, from Hebrews 6:1. “Therefore leaving the principles of the
							doctrine of Christ, <hi rend="italic">let</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">us</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">go</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">on</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">unto</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">perfection</hi>”: the words underscored—the remainder
							of the verse is—“not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead
							works, and of faith toward God.” This is a remarkable text, and deserves
							well to be treated in connection with the preceding and subsequent
							Chapters—to the tenth inclusive— The whole being an argument addressed
							specially to the Jews, to prove the superiority of the new to the old
							Testament, and that the Mosaic dispensation was entirely superseded by
							that of Christianity. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meade, considered
							the text rather in its separate sense, as a general precept of the
							gospel to all Christians to go on unto perfection—The Sermon was well
							written; but its doctrine was severe gloomy and atrabilious— And the
							preacher had a sickly, pain-cankered countenance— There was nothing
							lovely either in his matter or manner— <persRef ref="campbell-archibald"
								>Campbell</persRef> was here towards Evening— At dusk I called at
								<persRef ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								<persRef ref="u">Captain Child</persRef> lying at the same Slip,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hudson took leave of me— I walked

							empty chair, and found myself between <persRef ref="u">M<hi

						<p>I was roused by my indisposition about Midnight in the Steamer, and for
							the remnant of the Night had no sleep— There was a squall in the Night:
							but otherwise the weather was fine; and the passage, the shortest I ever
							made— At four this morning, 11 hours after our departure from New-York,
							sundry of our Passengers were landed at Newport, and others were taken
							in— At six, we landed at Providence, where the Passengers who came by
							the Stonington rail-road had but just arrived, and were waiting for us
							in the Cars— We came on immediately, and at nine of the morning, just
							sixteen hours from New-York I alighted at the Rail-way Depot, below the
							bottom of the Common— I had my two Trunks laden upon a Hack with the
							name of the Marlborough Hotel upon it, and deposited at that House,
							where I breakfasted— A great revolution has occurred in that
							establishment, since I dined there in 1835 with poor <persRef
								ref="townsend-alexander">Alexander Townsend</persRef>, then its
							proprietor, and whose melancholy death so soon afterwards ensued— It is
							now a religious and temperance House, and I found the Gentleman’s
							Parlour, with a central table covered with Bibles, Prayer-books and
							Psalm-books— Upon the ground adjoining the House where formerly stood
							the Stable, there now stands a Chapel—the officiating Minister at which
							is <persRef ref="fitch-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fitch</persRef>— After breakfast I went to <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> Office in Court-Street; and
							found a notice on his door that he is in Town on Tuesday’s and Fridays
							till 1. P.M. Then I went to Elm Street and engaged a passage in the
							Quincy Stage this afternoon, with directions to <persRef
								ref="gillet-simon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gillett</persRef>
							to take me up at the Marlborough Hotel— I next went to my Son’s House N

								Frothingham’s</persRef>, and was engaged by him and <persRef
								ref="frothingham-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								>Governor Everett’s</persRef> but found a notice on the door “out of

								ref="foster-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								ref="foster-elizabeth2;foster-louisa;foster-mary">their three

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham— At 4. returned to the
							Marlborough Hotel, where Gillett soon took me up and landed me before 6.
							at my house in Quincy— Here, I found <persRef

							day by the illness of <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary’s</persRef>

						<p>Another suffocating Night— I went to bed last Night with a head ache, and
							awoke with one this Morning before 3. O’Clock. I rose at 4. walked over
							the hill, and saw the sun rise clear from <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> House— Then came home, and prepared a Letter
							for <persRef ref="seaton-william">W. W. Seaton</persRef> with the
							preface, and sundry slips of the Intelligencer for my pamphlet. <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>
							preached this morning from Hebrews 13.2 “Be not forgetful to entertain
							strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels, unawares.” upon the
							duties of hospitality, and some original fanciful explanations of the
							prospect of entertaining angels— His afternoon Sermon was from
							Colossians 2.14. “And above all these things put on charity, which is
							the bond of perfectness.” He gave notice that the communion would be
							administered next Sunday— While we were at dinner there was a very heavy
							thunder shower, the cloud being immediately over our heads— From the
							sound of one of the claps of thunder, the lightening must have fallen
							very near us.— But it cleared off immediately after, and the atmosphere
							was as heated as before— Charles and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
								wife</persRef>
							<pb n="889" type="ms"/>spent the Evening here— I read the 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and last Sermon of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef> of the 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume; on the Wisdom of <persRef

								>st.</hi> book of Kings, from the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							to the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> verse, tells the whole Story of
							the vision of Solomon at Gibeon, and descants upon it largely.— As is
							very common with this writer he perplexes himself with difficulties,
							without very well knowing how to solve them— He enquires how it happened
							that with this preternatural gift of wisdom from above, he could in his
							old age so wretchedly fall off, with 700. Princess wives and 300
							concubines into Idolatry? And after putting this question he does not
							very satisfactorily answer it— I changed my bedchamber this Evening for
							my Library—to breathe fresh air.</p>

						<p>There is an oppression upon my Spirits which with the unusual intenseness
							of the Summer heat almost deprives me of sleep— Last night however with
							the benefit of open windows I awoke not until the morning dawn, and
							barely rose before the Sun— I had to answer a Letter from <persRef
								ref="thaxter-anna">Miss Anna Quincy Thaxter</persRef> Sat down to
							write it in five lines, and wrote it in four pages, occupying all the
							morning till dinner— It led me to a partial examination of the copies of
								<persRef key="adams-abigail">my mother’s</persRef> Letters in her
							own hand writing; and that to meditation upon the severe, Oh! how severe
							trials, with which she was afflicted, in her earthly career, and with
							what bleeding sensibility, and with what Spartan Fortitude, and with
							what Saint like Resignation she endured them! What a Lesson to her
							children was her whole Life! and how imperfectly, and ineffectually have
							I profited by it!— This afternoon <persRef ref="u;u">two M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith’s</persRef> came out from
							Boston, to urge me to deliver the introductory Lecture to the course of
							the Boston Lyceum to commence some time next October— Of these
							applications I believe I have on hand nearly twenty; most of which I
							have declined; and to comply with some of which I have made conditional
							promises.— I could not give an absolute negative now; and promised to
							deliver the Lecture, if I should find myself able to do it, with another
							engagement, if I should finally decline, to give them notice, in season
							to supply the place, by another Lecturer— <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
								wife</persRef> spent the Evening <pb n="890" type="ms"/>with us— The
							Sun was so scorching the whole day that I did not venture out of the
							House; but in the Evening the atmosphere cooled with the Northwestern
							breeze nearly to a chill— Received a letter from <persRef
								ref="mease-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mease</persRef> of
							Philadelphia with copies of the papers relating to the Patriotic
							exertions of the Ladies of Philadelphia in 1780. which he had promised
							me— The Letter from <persRef ref="washington-george">General
								Washington</persRef> to the Ladies which he had read to me is in
								<persRef ref="sparks-jared">Sparks’s</persRef> collection of his
							writings Vol. 7. p. 408—and two other Letters from Washington, on the
							same subject—one p. 89. to <persRef ref="reed-joseph2">President
								Reed</persRef>, and one p 376. to <persRef ref="bache-sarah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Sarah Bache</persRef>. Besides one to
								<persRef ref="lee-mary2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Mary
								Lee</persRef> p. 243. relating to the contributions of the women of
							Baltimore— I had thoughts of referring to all this in an Appendix to the
							pamphlet Speech; but think best on reflection to reserve it for a reply
							to <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> who will make a very
							elaborate effort to answer me at the next Session of Congress.</p>

						<p>Walk to <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house and

								>W. W. Seaton</persRef>. <persRef ref="spear-william">Deacon William

							but not that of the Town and County tax— The Assessors fleece me without
							mercy; but whoever is or has been prosperous in the world must submit to
							much injustice and oppression especially from tax gatherers—with whom
							it’s always odious to have any disagreement. The Deacon informed me that
							the County Commissioners have staked out another road to pass through my
							lot which I purchased of <persRef ref="baxter-james">James
								Baxter</persRef>— <persRef ref="loud-david">David Loud</persRef> was

							of Attorney which he sent me to recover a quarter of Section of
							Soldier’s Land due for his Son <persRef ref="loud-warren">Warren
								Loud</persRef>, in the State of Arkansas, for military service in
							the late War— I found on my file of last Winter a Letter from this David
							Loud, unanswered, referring to the former Letter and power, but these I
							did not find, and have a very indistinct recollection of what I did with
							or about them.— I was obliged to ask him to come again some time next

								<persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> came and <pb

							came again about the pension for <persRef ref="thayer-lydia">his mother

							from the <persRef ref="edwards-james">Commissioner of

								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Thayer— From the Answer it would

							and repeated the information of the road laid out by the County
