						<p>The morning was splendid and the canopy of heaven bespangled with its
							numberless gems in the clearest sky of the Western Hemisphere— I sought
							for the Planet Mercury, announced in <persRef ref="dick-thomas2"
								>Dick’s</persRef> celestial scenery to be visible as morning Star
							about this time, and thought I had found him; but it was one of the
							minor stars of Leo, that I mistook for him— I saw the Sun rise from the
							South East corner of <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							House, and marked the progress of his Southern declination— I received a
							Letter from <persRef ref="lay-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lay</persRef>, a member of the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> and
								24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress from the State of

							intention to pay us a visit with <persRef ref="lay-olive">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lay</persRef>, this day— About half
							an hour afterwards they came, having extended their excursion thus far
							from Batavia their home, which they left to place <persRef
								ref="lay-john;lay-george2">two Sons</persRef> at Yale College in
							New-Haven— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lay is one of the most amiable
							men, with whom I ever served in public life, and invariably friendly to
							me while in Congress.— He had a curiosity to see <persRef
								key="adams-john">my fathers</persRef> Library and my own, which I
							accordingly shewed him— And he went with me to my Son’s house,—I
							introduced them to each other— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lay, are to leave Boston to return home,
							to morrow— <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef>, with
								<persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

							interval, <persRef ref="lunt-ellen">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Lunt</persRef>, and her Sister <persRef ref="u">Miss
							Hedge</persRef>, of Plymouth, visited here— A Quaker by the name of
								<persRef ref="hartshorn-timothy">Hartshorn</persRef>, came and
							repaired our Clock— He hesitated, whether to receive any pay for the
							work, saying that he was an Abolitionist, and felt under obligations to
							me for my service in Congress, especially at the last Session— He
							consented however to take a dollar— Towards Evening Charles took me to
							ride with him the round of Milton, and Dorchester. <persRef

						<p>Boston— Page and Portrait— Quincy. </p>
						<p>The morning was again exquisitely fine, and the day, warm as Summer
							without its languor— I saw most distinctly and unequivocally the Planet
							Mercury at 5 O’Clock, in a perpendicular direction about ten degrees
							immediately <hi rend="italic">under</hi>
							<pb n="614" type="ms"/>Venus— She was then about 20 minutes risen, and
							Mercury not more than ten— There was already a bright dawn, and within
							20 minutes after and as much before Sunrise, Mercury had vanished though
							Venus was yet visible— The imperial Astronomer <persRef
								ref="schubert-friedrich">Schubert</persRef> at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg, told me that he believed
							Mercury was never visible with the naked eye, and this I have no doubt
							is true in that nebulous Northern Latitude I have seen him now with
							certainty both as evening and morning Star— I went with <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> to Boston and gave the fourth
							sitting of three hours to <persRef ref="page-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Page</persRef> for my Portrait—
							Charles came in while he was at work, but did not like it— He thinks it
							fails not in the likeness of the features, but in the expression.
								<persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Parkman</persRef> was also there and thought well of it— I left the
							Painter’s Room at one, and went to the Office of the Life and Trust
							insurance Company where <persRef ref="tilden-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph Tilden</persRef> has taken the
							place of the late <persRef ref="bowditch-nathaniel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bowditch</persRef> as Actuary— I gave
							notice as the Trustees for <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Abby S. Angier</persRef>, my Niece,
							that she wished the annual interest of her annuity at that Institution
							to accumulate, until further order. She had requested this in a Letter
							received from her yesterday, and I saw the entry made upon the book— She
							states that she had made the same request of me last year, but it had
							escaped my recollection, and <persRef ref="angier-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Angier</persRef> had received the
							interest of the last year this morning— I had met him with the tenant of
							my Southernmost of the two Houses at the bottom of the Mall, at
							Charles’s Office— On coming out from the Life insurance Office I met
								<persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Degrand</persRef> who took me into <persRef
								ref="topliff-samuel;topliff-benjamin">Topliff’s</persRef> reading

								ref="foster-isaac">Foster’s</persRef> stable, where Charles keeps
							his horse, I met a somewhat intimate acquaintance of the last century
								<persRef ref="amory-francis">Francis Amory</persRef>, whom I

							had met was at his Sister <persRef ref="mclean-ann">M<hi

								<persRef ref="lee-william">William Lee</persRef>— Seven years have
							passed since that day, during which M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lee
							herself, and other numerous assemblage of family relations have passed
							from this world to that of Spirits.— Frank said that he was now the only
							survivor of <persRef
								ref="amory-rufus;amory-thomas2;amory-john3;amory-william;amory-jonathan4"
								>six brothers</persRef> with all of whom I was well acquainted— Of

							house in Milton— We got home to dine at half past 2—and spent the

						<p>The sky was partially beclouded so that although I caught a glimpse at

							beclouded, with a shower about noon, and a bright Moonlight evening. I

								<persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							and mind— He resigned more than a year since his Office as judge of

							occasionally visited the late <persRef ref="parsons-theophilus"
								>chief-justice Parsons</persRef> after he had resigned his seat upon
							the bench; and always found him reading Novels— And he himself had been
							lately reading <persRef ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef>

						<p>As the Clock struck five this morning I saw the Planets Venus and
							Mercury, in conjunction; Mercury being about two thirds of a Sun’s disk
							below and Northward of Venus— Three quarters of an hour later Mercury
							was barely perceptible and five minutes after could not be traced by my
							naked eye— Venus being for ten minutes longer visible— I ascertained
							therefore that in the clear sky of this Latitude, Mercury at his
							greatest elongation from the Sun, may be seen by a very imperfect naked
							eye, in the morning twilight for the space of one hour.— He never ranges
							beyond twilight bounds.— I observed also the rapidity of his movements
							by the diminished distance between him and Venus since the day before
							yesterday— <persRef ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet Welsh</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="dewindt-julia">Julia De Wint</persRef> called here
							this morning and took the Stage for Boston; with <persRef

								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Wade</persRef> of Roxbury,

							with us; and after dinner I rode with him to Hough’s Neck— On our
							return, I went and saw the Sun set from his porch at 5:50— They were
							blasting rocks in the adjoining lot— They spent the Evening here, and we
							had a whist party— I wrote to <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel"

						<p>I saw Venus and Mercury this morning; in closer affinity than yesterday,

							between them; but there was a gathering cloud came and passed over them,
							which intercepted the continuance of observation— <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston, and returned
							to dine— I wasted the morning in little more than packing documents.— At
							Noon I went to the Stone temple where the Bell-ringer brought the key,
							and I copied the Inscriptions on the Monument, of <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father</persRef> and <persRef
								key="adams-abigail">mother</persRef>— After dinner I visited my
							garden, with the intention of planting seeds, stones and acorns, but was
							twice called away—first to <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> James H. Foster</persRef> and his
							daughter <persRef ref="foster-mary">Mary</persRef> who paid us an
							afternoon visit; and then to <persRef ref="bigelow-tyler">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Tyler Bigelow</persRef>, the
							Secretary of the Boston Lyceum, who came to urge me again to deliver the
							introductory Lecture to their course—charged as he said by the Directors
							of that Institution to state the embarrassment of the circumstances in
							which they stand; having upon what they conceived encouragement from me,
							given to <persRef ref="bancroft-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								George Bancroft</persRef>, given public notice that the Lecture
							would be delivered by me, and sold 800 tickets on the strength of that
							notice: and it being now so late that they would find it difficult to
							supply my place— I assured him that I deeply regretted the necessity I
							had been under of declining to perform this service. And still more that
							I was obliged to say, that the public notice in the <hi rend="italic"
								>newspapers</hi>
							<pb n="617" type="ms"/>newspapers that I should deliver this Lecture,
							had not only preceded the visit of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bancroft with the <persRef ref="u;u">two M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith’s</persRef>, but was given without my consent or previous
							knowledge; and when I had actually declined to deliver the Lecture— That
							since M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bancroft was here I had experienced
							a new failure of my voice, and should be utterly unable this very
							evening to deliver a long discourse before a numerous assembly; as he
							might himself perceive by the sound of my voice in a private room— I
							added that I had received more than 20. applications of the same kind;
							several of them in consequence, of the public notice that I should
							deliver the Lecture at the Lyceum, and had been obliged to give the same
							answer to them all. After which if I should now undertake to speak in
							one place; all the other applicants would have the right to consider
							themselves slighted by me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bigelow said
							he would report my answer to the Directors, who he had no doubt would be
							sensible of its reasonableness and would trouble me with no further
							application— He said the notification in the newspapers had not been
							given by the Directors, or with their knowledge— The Printer’s boy was
							here with the proof in the Quincy Patriot of half the list of
							Anti-Slavery and Anti-Texas Petitioners at the special Session of
							Congress, which I corrected and returned to him— <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E Price

						<p>I was belated after a restless and almost sleepless night, and found
							Venus and Mercury cheek by jowl, the apparent distance between them not
							more than an inch, about half an hour risen, with a brightening dawn—
							The Sun rose 18 minutes past 6. I had lost sight of Venus a quarter of
							an hour, and of Mercury half an hour before— From 45 to 50 minutes then
							before Sunrise, I suppose to be then, the longest time during which at
							his greatest elongation from the Sun, Mercury can be visible to my naked
							eye in the morning.— To a keener vision I suppose he may be visible a
							full hour— I doubt if to any one more.— I read this morning <persRef
								ref="emerson-ralph">Ralph Waldo Emersons</persRef> Address to the
							Senior Class of the Students at the Divinity School at Cambridge— He
							seems ambitious of becoming the founder of a sect, and thinks there is
							an urgent necessity for a new revelation— I read also in the Newspapers
							two letters from <persRef ref="hamilton-james3">James Hamilton</persRef>
							of South-Carolina, concerning an extraordinary correspondence between
								<persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Andrew Stevenson</persRef>, Minister
							Plenipotentiary of the United States at London, and <persRef
								ref="oconnell-daniel">Daniel O’Connell</persRef>, the Irish Orator
							and Patriot— O’Connell at a Public Meeting at Birmingham, to celebrate
							the emancipation of Slaves in the British West India Colonies, in a
							violent attack upon the People of the United States, for Slave holding,
							said he had reason to believe that the Minister of this Country in
							England, was himself a breeder of Slaves for sale— And said it was
							infamous— Stevenson wrote to O’Connell, enquiring whether the Report of

								>Ritchie</persRef> the Editor of the Richmond Enquirer, full of the

							<pb n="618" type="ms"/>most scurrilous abuse of O’Connell, with a pledge
							that he will fix the lie upon his brass for denying that the report of
							his speech was correct— Since this, Hamilton has returned to this

							second Letter, apologetical of the first— He still promises to prove

						<p>Heavy rain this morning intercepted my view of the two planets now in

							morning Sermon from Revelation 2.10— [“]Be thou faithful unto death, and
							I will give thee a crown of life.”— A dissertation upon the unspeakable

							testament, which speak of them as unutterable, and even beyond the reach
							of human conception— The Style in which they are always spoken of in the
							Scriptures— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney specified

							not his— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney and <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>
							administered jointly the communion, of which I partook, praying
							forgiveness to my enemies, and for peace with all mankind: After dinner
								<persRef ref="angier-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph
								Angier</persRef> preached from Luke 10.42—“but one thing is
							needful”—namely religion— A Discourse very well written, and well
							argued; but it was observed that this was an easy text to descant upon.
							The superficial arguments for the necessity of religion to the happiness
							of men, are abundant— The deeper seated ones, are not scanty— But what
							is religion? Belief in the existence of a God? of the immortality of the
							Soul? of responsibility to an offended creator? Of the History of Jesus
							Christ and his Apostles? and finally of the doctrines and precepts of
							his gospel. All this must be included in the idea of Religion to
							constitute the happiness of man. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney
							gave notice, that from this time forward the bell for the morning
							service would be rung at half past 10, and that of the afternoon at a
							quarter before two— I read the tenth Sermon of the 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef>; upon the prayer of Jesus Christ for his
							executioners; [“]father forgive them, for they know not what they do”—
							Forgiveness of injuries; an inexhaustible theme for a Christian
							preacher— Saurin starts a question whether prayer was proper for beings
							so wicked as those; and leaves it not very satisfactorily <hi
								rend="italic">solved</hi>
							<pb n="619" type="ms"/>solved: especially as he quoted the text which
							says there is a sin for which the apostle says he does not enjoyn upon

						<p>About a quarter before 5. I went over to <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> house, with a view to see the rising of the two
							planets, but before reaching the House, I found them already nearly a
							quarter of an hour risen: but I could very imperfectly observe them,
							owing to a succession of black clouds continually intercepting them from
							my view— The Sun rose 21 minutes after 6— The morning was so cold that I
							had much difficulty in reading or writing in my chamber; but I finished
							a Letter begun yesterday in answer to one from the Secretary of State,
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>, on the disposal of
							the proceeds of the Smithsonian bequest— My time for planting is come,
							but is so much abridged by more pressing concerns that I cannot pursue
							the object with persevering system. I filled Pot<space/>with fresh earth
							and planted in it a bergamot Pear Core—with sundry Office Apple-seeds,
							and one, English white Oak-Acorn— Charles went to Boston, and returned
							home to dine— Just before dinner I went up to the Quincy Stone Bank and
							cashed a check— After dinner, the weather though clear was so cold that
							I shrunk from the intended task of planting to which I had devoted it.—
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> E.

							conversation— I am a nuisance in company, to others, and in solitude to
							myself. </p>

						<p>Boston— Sixth sitting to Page— Quincy. </p>
						<p>The sky crystal clear— I went to <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’</persRef> House, and saw the rising of the two planets.—
							Venus at 4:52, and Mercury two minutes after: both with the proverbial
							brightness of Morning Stars— As they rose I continued to observe them,
							till as nearly as I was able to note the disappearance of Mercury in the
							broadness of the dawn, it was exactly one hour from his rising; or at
							5.54. Venus was still visible 20 minutes later; and the Sun rose at
							6:23.— This continued observation absorbed the hours and I could only
							commence a second Letter to the <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Secretary of
								State</persRef>— My benumbed fingers and shivering sides left my
							diary to run in arrear. I went to Boston with Charles— Called upon
								<persRef ref="bancroft-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Bancroft</persRef> now the Collector of the Customs at Boston, and
							stated to him the cause of my finally declining to deliver the
							introductory Lecture before the Boston Lyceum. I also mentioned to him
							the Letters that I am now writing to the Secretary of State concerning
							the disposal of the Smithsonian bequest, and particularly, my urgent
							recommendation of the erection and permanent establishment of an
							Astronomical Observatory.— He promised me not only to write to the
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> in favour of this
							project, but to go to Washington, and urge it upon him in person— He
							sent for <persRef ref="bancroft-elizabeth">his wife</persRef> and
							introduced her to me, and repeated a request heretofore made, for the
							perusal of <persRef key="adams-abigail">my mother’s</persRef>
							correspondence, of which he wishes to avail himself in the History of
							the United States, upon which he is engaged, and two volumes of which
							have <hi rend="italic">already</hi>
							<pb n="620" type="ms"/>already been published—eminently successful— I
							next called on <persRef ref="stott-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Stott</persRef> the Seal-engraver who engraved my acorn-seal, and
							left it with him, to sink a little deeper the Letters of the motto
							ALTERI SECULO, which are so slightly done, that the impression upon the

							Letter to the Secretary of State; and this made it half past ten before
							I got to the Room of <persRef ref="page-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Page</persRef> the Painter— Gave him a sitting of two
							hours—the Sixth— This was the number for which I had engaged, but he now
							says he wants two more. I agreed therefore to give them on Friday and
							Saturday next— While I was there <persRef ref="davis-isaac">Isaac P.
								Davis</persRef> and <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman</persRef> came in; and
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi><space/>Chapman</persRef>, who brought, and delivered to me
							a Letter from <persRef ref="child-lydia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

							with an Address from the Anti-Slavey Convention of American women, held
							at Philadelphia in May last to the Senators and Representatives of the
							Free States, in the Congress of the Free States— At 1. O’Clock I went to
							Charles’s Office, and found there <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathaniel Curtis</persRef>, who gave
							me a Letter from <persRef ref="watson-jacob">Jacob W. Watson</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="harrington-benjamin">Benjamin Harrington</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="brook-john">John Brook</persRef> a Committee of the

							the Will of <persRef ref="boylston-ward">Ward Nicholas
								Boylston</persRef>, proposing a bill in equity to ascertain and
							determine the property of certain Lands in Princeton, of which he made a
							donation to its inhabitants— As his Executors and Trustees we make no
							claim or pretension to the Lands, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Curtis thinks we ought not to be charged with any part of thr expense of
							ascertaining to whom the lands belong, and he requested me to prepare an
							answer to that effect— I promised to meet him again at Charles’s office
							at 1. P.M next Saturday. Call at <persRef ref="frobisher-benjamin"
								>Frobisher’s</persRef> shop where the Spoons were ready, but the box
							was not to my taste— We came home to dinner—another chilling ride, with
							a clear sky— After dinner I planted promiscuously in my Grandson
								<persRef ref="adams-charles7">Charles Francis jun<hi

							Office and Trowbridge Appleseeds, Pear Cores, Shagbark Walnuts and
							English white Oak Acorns, and in Pot<space/>filled with fresh Earth the
							Core of a brown bury Pear, given me by Isaac P. Davis and sundry

								<persRef ref="lunt-william">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi

						<p>Cloudy morning. No observation of the Planets I have delayed having a

								>Alpheus Spear</persRef>, who came and paid his quarters Rent, and

								ref="spear-john">John Murray</persRef>; from the founder of the
							Universalist sect, to which Alpheus has joined himself.— He was the
							principal mover to the building of the Universalist Meeting house in
							this town—one of five new Churches erected in this immediate
							neighbourhood; chiefly by defections from the first Congregational
							Church— The first was the Stone Railway Church in Milton; just beyond
							the borders of Quincy.— Next, this universalist church— Then the
							orthodox, or Calvinistic church, of which <persRef ref="cornell-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornell</persRef> is the Pastor;
							and within the last year, two—One, Methodist, at Bent’s point; and one
							Baptist, in Dorchester, at the Neponset village, just beyond the bridge—
							The Episcopal church has also been rebuilt, within the same time.— None
							of these churches have ministers permanently settled, or who remain so—
							They have preaching with tolerable regularity at them all— Before
							dinner, I went and made a deposit at the Stone-bank; and at 7. in the
							Evening went to the Town-Hall, expecting to hear the introductory
							Lecture to the course of the Quincy Lyceum, by <persRef

							<pb n="622" type="ms"/>of the Battle of Bunker’s Hill, and the burning
							of Charlestown on the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June
							1775—contained in a printed Oration which he delivered last year at
							Charlestown, and which he now repeated from Memory. This faculty he and
							his brother <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward</persRef> possess in a
							most enviable degree— But like others, they are proportionally deficient
							in judgment— Alexander, much more so than Edward—who is by no means
							deficient in address— The incidents in Warren’s life, related in this
							Lecture were new to me, and formed part of another Lecture which Everett
							delivered last winter before the historical Society last Winter in
							Boston— The delivery of the whole occupied about two hours, during the
							whole of which the attention of the crowded auditory was constant and
							intense— The President of the Lyceum George Newcomb then requested the
							Secretary <persRef ref="french-jonathan">Jonathan French</persRef>, my
							last year’s gardener, to read the minutes of the proceedings of the last
							Meeting— This was done— Two debateable questions about Phrenology, and
							the Florida War, laid on the table at the last Meeting, were by vote
							continued there now— The meeting was regularly dissolved, and the
							President Newcomb asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett what was
							to pay— The answer I did not hear, but they went apart, and settled it
							together— At least half the auditory were women— This practice of paying
							for Lyceum Lectures, and selling tickets of admission to them is
							becoming common—and the Newspapers state that one of these Institutions
							in Boston have engaged to give 2500 dollars to the English traveller
								<persRef ref="buckingham-james">J. S. Buckingham</persRef>, to
							deliver before them his course of Lectures on Egypt and Palestine which
							we heard him deliver last Spring at Washington— M<hi rend="superscript"

							Quincy—before dinner— After dinner filled Pot<space/>with fresh earth
							and planted 1 fresh horse-plum-stone; one English white Oak Acorn—the

							in the Seminary seedling bed of Charles’s infant son <persRef

							in the drupe. Two others and two English Oak Acorns in a diamond square

								<persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirk</persRef> has uprooted my red and

						<p>I went to <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house to

							eastern border of the horizon illuminated by the moon, was to the eye
							apparently as clear as the Zenith— But I waited a quarter of an hour
							after the time of Venus’s rising; and she was not to be seen— I returned
							home; and a quarter of an hour after, saw her emerging from a greasy
							cloud, which as the dawn brightened darkened over the South-eastern
							horizon— Thickening, transient nebulous vapours, continually flitted
							over her face, and she appeared like the revolving light at the entrance
							of Boston Harbour beneath her— I saw not Mercury at all—but Charles who
							at 4. O’Clock had gone upon the wharf to fish for Smelts did see him— I

						<p>Cloud— Fog— Steady rain— No observation of the Stars or Sun.</p>

							Newspapers— Finished the reading of the Bible with my two

								<persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Georgiana Frances</persRef>— Begun
							17. February 1837. It is the second reading with Mary-Louisa— The rule
							of reading is 4 chapters a day, and in the Psalms 5. but by means of
							interruptions, by my separation from them—the sickness or indisposition
							of either of them, and other occasional failures, the average has been
								<hi rend="italic">about</hi>
							<pb n="626" type="ms"/>about 2 1/4 chapters a day, or 606/1361 I read
							alternately with them 3 verses each in turn, with the view to teach them
							how to read intelligibly— I read all, suppressing nothing, passing over
							nothing, having no fears that their delicacy will suffer by any thing
							they read in that book— I think it an exceedingly mistaken roman
							Catholic prejudice, that any part of the Bible should be withheld from
							the reading of any human being who can read— The first reading of
							children, is like the reading of an adult, in a language which he does
							not understand. For intelligent reading is a double operation—the
							mechanical articulation of words performed by the united co operation of
							the organs of sight and of speech and the conveyance to the mind of the
							ideas signified by the words. The art of reading loud consists in
							performing simultaneously the three processes—the recognition of the
							printed or written words, the articulation of them by Speech, and the
							reception and conveyance to the mind and memory of the thoughts
							signified by the words— The ordinary teaching of children to read, is
							only the recognition and articulation of the words; the active operation
							of the mind is scarcely performed by children at all, and very
							imperfectly by the common mass of mankind through life.— The extreme
							imperfection of its performance by myself, is one of the infirmities of
							which I am deeply conscious, and which I never cease to lament— I
							answered a Letter of enquiries from <persRef ref="kirkland-charles">M<hi

							desirous of having one from me— He wanted it immediately, but I was
							engaged to attend the visitation by the School Committee, of the central
							school, at the Town Hall— He took me there. The School is kept by
								<persRef ref="french-jonathan">Jonathan French</persRef>, who last

							young woman named <hi rend="strikethrough">Wade</hi>
							<persRef ref="u">Te<unclear>yrld</unclear></persRef>, who appeared to be

							in reading, spelling, a defining recitation—geography, drawing,
							map-making and composition— Their writing books were also there; but
							were not examined; nor their cyphering— Several of them however read
							their own written compositions— What M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							French called their defining composition were pieces taken from their
							reading books, but written down in their own language varying the

							Braintree my native town as much as Quincy; and would most cheerfully
							read them a Lecture if it were in my power— But that I had declined at
							least twenty, such invitations, and among the rest one from the United
							Quincy and Milton Lyceum, at the Railway House— This alone compelled me
							to decline all similar invitations now, and all I can do now, is to make
							a conditional engagement for next year— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Thayer urged me very much, and finally disclosed the wish that I should
							address the Braintree Lyceum on the present state of politics, and in
							favour of the whighs— He is greatly concerned for the issue of the
							approaching election—the vibration of the popular pendulum being at this
							moment in full swing to the administration side— He is under great and
							well founded alarm for the whig candidates in this County; and their
							supremacy is in imminent danger throughout the Commonwealth— I see no
							reason however for interfering in this Election, the turn of which
							depends almost entirely upon, a License Law enacted last Winter,
							prohibiting the sale of spirituous liquors in quantities less than 15
							Gallons—a well intended, but indiscreet Law which has thrown the whole
							Commonwealth into a Convulsion— <persRef ref="lawrence-jane">M<hi

							drawling or cant, but without emphasis, monotonous, and with little

						<p>I have been watching several days to observe the rising of Arcturus
							having perceived by the direction of the Stars Benetnach, Mizar and
							Alioth, in the tail of the great where it must be— This morning I saw

							disappeared, and that the brilliant Planet which I saw this morning was
							Venus, rapidly approaching to the Sun— <persRef ref="muzzy-artemas">M<hi

							<pb n="631" type="ms"/>preacher this day in the place of <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>—
							His morning Sermon was from Matthew 24.35. [“]Heaven and Earth shall
							pass away, but my words shall not pass away.” A strong argument for the
							perpetual existence of Christianity— In the afternoon his text was Mark
							9.23. [“]Jesus saith unto him, if thou canst believe, all things are
							possible for him that believeth.”—on the omnipotence of Faith— I have an
							earnest desire to write a discourse or Lecture upon that subject; but
							fear I shall never find the time— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Muzzy’s
							argument, forcible and earnest, considered Faith, as synonymous with <hi
								rend="italic">belief</hi>—and such is the definition of <persRef
								ref="paul">Saint Paul</persRef>, when he says it is the substance of
							things hoped for—the Evidence of things not seen— The passage in the
							text makes all things possible to <hi rend="italic">belief</hi>—but
							Faith in what? belief in what? Belief in God, and his moral attributes—
							Belief in the immortality of the Soul, and the responsibility of a
							future State— Belief in the Lord Jesus Christ, and in his doctrines—
							This is the <hi rend="italic">belief</hi> or Faith which is to ensure
							Salvation— But mere <hi rend="italic">belief</hi> is a passive condition
							of the mind—not altogether voluntary— A man cannot always believe what
							he wishes— Even the belief in the existence of God, he cannot command—
							Further, Faith while merely identical with belief, is barren, and
							produces no fruits— Faith in numberless passages of Scripture is an
							active principle— It is fidelity— It is the invariable principle of
							fulfilment of promise— It is in this sense that God is said to be
							faithful— He promises and performs— Now the performance of promise
							essentially belongs to immortality— No other being upon earth, but man,
							can make a promise, or in other words can pledge his faith— No other
							animal can receive or trust in a promise— And this capacity to promise
							and to believe is the foundation of all human Society The matrimonial
							union is entirely founded on a mutual pledge of faith— The aggregation
							of men in a community, has no other foundation than a mutual pledge of
							faith— And faith can be preserved only by mutual fidelity— The breach of
							faith on one side dissolves the bond of Union, and henceforth no Social
							ties can remain between the parties— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Muzzy dined with us, as did <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi

						<p>The first clear morning sky for many days. When I came in to my Chamber I
							found Venus risen about a quarter of an hour.— About a quarter of an
							hour after I saw Arcturus just risen, and a quarter of an hour later
							Mercury blazed with dazzling brightness, and surpassing in size the most
							brilliant effulgence of Venus— He remained visible 20 minutes after the
							disappearance of Venus and Arcturus, and within 20 minutes of the rising
							of the Sun at 6.42— I have read in <persRef ref="pearson-william"
								>Pearson’s</persRef> introduction to Practical Astronomy §. 11. The
							construction and use of the Dynameter—an instrument for measuring the
							magnifying power of different Telescopes, said to be important, to be

							the most expensive on, ever constructed—made in 1825. by <persRef
								ref="fraunhofer-joseph">Fraunhofer</persRef> of Munich, for the use
							of the observatory of the imperial University of Dorpat— Sold by
								<persRef ref="utzschneider-joseph">Utzschneider</persRef> for 10500
							florins about 4750 dollars— See and remember the Memoirs of the
							Astronomical Society of London— §. 12. On reflecting Telescopes— I
							endeavour to read one section every morning; but see I can effect
							nothing without much more time than it is possible for me to bestow upon
							this subject.— <persRef ref="thayer-minot">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Minott Thayer</persRef> with three other persons came as
							a Committee from the Caucus Meeting at Braintree, to invite me to
							address the inhabitants of Braintree on the political Aspects of the
							Country— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Hollingsworth</persRef> explained what had been left somewhat
							indefinite by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer. He said the first
							proposition made had been to invite me to deliver a Lyceum Lecture,
							which had been changed, to that of calling on me to speak to a political
							meeting on political subjects—this was a contrivance of Minott Thayer,
							to coax me into an electioneering whig Speech— I told them that as to
							the Lyceum Lecture, I <hi rend="italic">considered</hi>
							<pb n="633" type="ms"/>considered Braintree as much my native town as
							Quincy— I had declined every invitation to deliver Lyceum Lectures this
							Season, with the single exception of Quincy, of whose Lyceum I am myself
							a member, and to which I made a conditional engagement to that effect
							last year— I would make the same engagement for the Lyceum of Braintree
							for the next year, if my health should permit— But, as to addressing the
							People of Braintree upon the political Aspects of the Country, there
							were other difficulties, which I ought in candour to state to them— The
							subjects of political dissensions were changing in this Country.— Texas,
							the War with Mexico, were no longer to be dreaded; nor I hope debated—
							The right of petition may again be outraged; but I could say no more on
							that subject at this time— The Sub-Treasury had been swelled up by both
							parties from a Molehill into a Mountain— I did not believe it would
							again be pressed at the next Session; but if it should, and should be
							carried it would infallibly demolish the Administration of <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren</persRef>— But the question of Slavery would come up in a
							great variety of forms and upon that subject I was not sure that my
							opinions would concur with those of the whigs of Braintree— I enlarged
							upon this for more than I can now record. But I said the division of
							parties now turned upon the act of the Legislature of the Commonwealth,
							passed at their last Session commonly called the License Law, upon which
							I had not made up my own mind— They asked if I thought it
							unconstitutional— I said so far as I had seen and considered it, I
							thought not, but, I must say, I regretted that it had been passed—
							Thayer said there were such a multitude of petitioners, and no
							opposition, that the General Court could have done no otherwise than as
							they did— Finally I said to them that as to addressing the Inhabitants
							of the Town of Braintree, on the political aspects of the Country; it
							was to be considered whether by setting the example of doing it in one
							town, I should virtually pledge myself to do the same if desired to
							every town in the District— It would immediately change the mode of
							elections here, to the stump eloquence of the Southern and Western
							States, which would be a very pernicious alteration for this part of the
							Country.— They appeared to think this reasonable—thanked me for this
							interview, and retired— <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">Abby</persRef> were going to Weymouth,
							and I rode with them to the School at Quincy-Point, kept by <persRef
								ref="newcomb-george2">George Newcome</persRef>— I arrived late and
							much of the examination was already passed. The examination in Geography
							in Arithmetic in Grammar and composition was continued and concluded—
							They answered all the questions of the Teacher, in the words of the
							book, by heart; but they had no equal dexterity to answer questions very
							apposite to the examination, but not in the books— The compositions were
							few and not equal to those of the central school; but there was here
							what I have not seen at any of the other school a printed return of the
							number of scholars attending at the school, which is 66—average number
							57. There were this day 59.—boys 33. girls 26. <persRef
								ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>
							addressed them after the close of the examination and I followed him—
							The carriage <hi rend="italic">with</hi>
							<pb n="634" type="ms"/>with the Ladies, returned from Weymouth was
							waiting for me, at the door, and I rode with them home— <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston, and returned
							to dine— He and his wife dined and spent the Evening with us.— After
							dinner, <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Smith</persRef>, with Mary and Abby rode to Milton, and
							took me with them to the western or railway school, the sixth and last
							town school at the examination of which I have attended—kept by a young
							man named <persRef ref="u">Babcock</persRef>— I was again late— But the
							examination was a very bad one— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt
							declined to address the Scholars— <persRef ref="whitney-john2">Captain
								John Whitney</persRef> Chairman of the School Committee did address
							them, and told them that the examination had not been satisfactory— That
							their reading was bad—their writing not good, and that they seemed
							unable even to repeat, and still more to understand their lessons— I
							followed him and said I had been a very unwilling witness of the
							correctness of his remark— I hoped and believed they would all feel
							themselves spurred to overtake the children of the other Schools— I said
							there was one exception to the bad examination— It was a girl of about
							16. who promptly answered almost every question— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Marsh</persRef> a member of the
							Committee succeeded me, and said there was an excuse for their
							deficiency at this time as they had not enjoyed the same advantages as
							the Children at the other Schools; but warned them, as they did now
							enjoy the same advantages, it would be expected that they would exhibit
							corresponding improvement, at the next quarterly examination— The number
							of scholars attending at this school is about 80.—but there were present
							only 54 boys 29. girls 25. I walked home, with M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>Rain morning, noon and evening, and consequent confinement, to the
							House.— Having at the request of the School-committee of the town of
							Quincy attended the examinations of the Scholars at the six public
							town-schools, many reflections have occurred to me in desultory and
							confused order which I have not time to digest— By the Laws of the
							Commonwealth, School returns are since 1833, made yearly from every town
							in the State— Those from Quincy for 1834. of children from 4 to 16 years
							of age attending School were 312 male 295 female = 607. average
							attendance 452. Male and female teachers each 6.— Amount raised by tax
							for the support of Schools 2000 dollars— For 1835— Attendance of
							Children 336 Males 330 females— Average attendance 500. Male teachers 6.
							female 7. Tax raised 2000 dollars— Scholars at private schools 90.— For
							1836. The children between 4 and 16 years of age belonging to the town
							are returned 704.—all, that is 356 males and 348. females attending the
							Schools— Average attendance 463— Teachers 6. Males and 7 females.—
							Amount raised by taxation 2000 dollars—private school pupils 110.—paid
							for their schooling 750 dollars.— The return for 1837. Is in different
							form, and with columns of statement somewhat different— Population of
							the town 3049. Valuation 528.891.25. Children between 4. and 16, 724.
							Attending School 345 in Winter 450 in Summer. <hi rend="italic"
								>Teachers</hi>
							<pb n="635" type="ms"/>Teachers in Summer 3 Males 6 females, in Winter
							6. Males no females— Tax raised 2275 dollars—private Scholars 75—
							Tuition paid for them 900 dollars— It is evident that these returns have
							been made by different persons, and with different principles of
							computation— At this examination of all the Schools, I found the whole
							number said to be attending at all the Schools was 451—present at the
							examinations 344—not one half of 724— Male teachers 4. female 3. falling
							short of all the recorded returns.— The modes of instruction of the
							different teachers are not uniform, and the female teachers struck me as
							superior to the males. There is a great multiplicity of books—different
							at different Schools— The discipline was well observed on the whole, but
							not equally in all the Schools— The returns for the present year,
								<persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt</persRef> informs me are not to be made till next Spring— Would
							it were in my power to do good in this matter.— Read in <persRef
								ref="pearson-william">Pearson</persRef> §. 14. Stands for reflecting
							Telescopes, and 15. The Herschellian forty-feet Telescope; with a list
							of <persRef ref="herschel-william">Herschel’s</persRef> papers in the

							Herschelian Telescope, as constructed by <persRef ref="ramage-john"
								>Ramage</persRef>— The want of the Instruments to compare with the
							descriptions leaves three fourths of what I read unintelligible; and the
							Algebra takes off half of the remainder— The weather was so bad that
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> could not come this Evening—
							I read a couple of Chapters in <persRef ref="dick-thomas2"

						<p>The morning was crystal clear— I Saw Venus rise at half past 4— Arcturus

								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lloyd is one of my cotemporaries— I

							70— She has lived her whole life in affluence, and is now very wealthy;

							the United States, repeatedly resigned without apparent adequate motive
							these offices, and finally removed to Philadelphia, for change, and

							thousand dollars to be scattered among collaterals, without a dollar of
							bequest, in charity, or to any public use— Fortune, and Ambition
							showered their favours upon him, in unremitting profusion— Thrifty,
							prosperous, opulent, popular, he was always restless and
							discontented—died unlamented, and is forgotten— The key to all which is
							that he was of a Tory breed; lived an old bachelor till he married to a
							barren bed, and was therefore denied the blessing of a child; and was by
							nature of a fretful, peevish temper. He was a very intelligent merchant,
							but carried too much of the counting house into the Legislative Hall, to

						<p>The Morning was clear— On coming into my library I found Venus, less than

								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house to see
							Mercury rise at 5:48. and the Sun rose as nearly as I could observe in
							my chamber at 6:49. The Thermometer in the open air was at the freezing
							point, and Mercury was dis-tinctly visible 45 minutes— Of course till
							within 15 minutes of Sunrise.— <persRef ref="briggs-george2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Briggs</persRef>, settled since the
								2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> day of last January at Plymouth as
							Colleague to <persRef ref="kendall-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kendall</persRef> preached here this morning from Matthew 9:6.—“Our
							father, which art in Heaven.”— The whole discourse was an amplification
							of one idea, that the peculiar exellence of the Christian religion
							consists in the character attributed by Jesus Christ, to God—as the
							father of all mankind— A good sermon, well delivered, with some
							unacceptable peculiarities of pronunciation— There is no doubt something
							exceedingly attractive in the paternal relation which Jesus always
							considers as existing between God and man— Yet as a religious doctrine,
							it must be understood as a mere figure of Speech— The relation of God to
							man, is that of a Creator and Creature— That of father and Son is
							physical, terresterial—mortal— It is full of tenderness and affection;
							but perishable, and implies in its literal sense a Mother— An
							implication which in the History of Christianity has produced enormous
							mischief both of practice and opinion— The word father in the figurative
							and spiritual Sense is altogether indefinite— Jesus Christ himself is
							often termed the only begotten son of God, and in one of the Psalms,
							quoted and applied to Jesus by <persRef ref="paul">Saint Paul</persRef>,
							God says this day have I begotten thee— The paternity of God to man is
							therefore different from the paternity of God to Christ; nor does it
							constitute the essence of Christianity. It is remarkable that the Pagans
							of antiquity attributed this character of Father to <persRef ref="jupiter">Jupiter</persRef>, the most
							powerful, and to <persRef ref="bacchus">Bacchus</persRef> the most sensual of their Gods— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Briggs, who told me he was born at Little
							Compton, Rhode-Island, dined with us, and preached after dinner from
							Matthew 15.6. “Thus have ye made the commandment of God, of none effect,
							by your tradition”— Against traditional authority— Sensible and
							judicious— It clouded up in the course of the morning; rained all the
							afternoon; and as evening came on turned to Snow, which continued some
							hours till the ground was covered— I read the first Sermon of the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and last Volume of <persRef
								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>—on the substitution of Jesus
							Christ for the victims of the Levitical Law.— The text is Hebrews
							10.5.6.7. a quotation by S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul from Psalm
							40.6. according to the Greek Septuagint—with a remarkable variation, in
							the Hebrew Bible, which reads thou<hi rend="strikethrough">g</hi> hast
							bored my ears; alluding to Exodus 21.6. The Septuagint have it thou hast
							given me a body— Saurin explains all this as well as he can.— Other
							perplexing difficulties he leaves without solution— I had read this
							morning in <persRef ref="pearson-william">Pearson</persRef> § 23 A new
							polymetric reticle, an instrument of his own invention; otherwise called
							Pearson’s Crystal Micrometer—and § 24. Reticulated Diaphragms; which

							relating to my father’s life.— He returned to me <persRef
								ref="mercer-charles">C. F. Mercer’s</persRef> Report of 18. March
							1836. on the National Observatory, which I had lent him; and said that
							he had written to <persRef ref="osullivan-john2">M<hi rend="superscript"

							He said also that he had thoughts shortly after the commencement of the

							Commonwealth, he is Chairman of the Board of Education, and takes great
							interest in the success of the efforts now making to raise the standard
							of Education in the State— The institution of the Normal Schools is now
							the labouring point of this system, and its most formidable difficulty,
							is the necessary increase of expense to carry it into execution.— The
							Spirit of the Towns, is parsimonious— The increase of the School tax
							will not easily be carried, and if the Legislature should make it
							imperative, a reaction like that now operating against the License-law
							would ensue— I also conversed much with him, upon the disposal of the
							Smithsonian bequest fund— I told him what had passed between <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President Van Buren</persRef> and me on this
							subject; and of my own wishes with regard to the preservation and
							appropriation of the fund— He assented to the justice of my principles,
							and strongly expressed the hope that my purpose may be carried into
							effect— He promised me a copy of his Letter to <persRef ref="u"
								>professor Farr<unclear>ow</unclear></persRef>, from Göttingen, on
							the subject of an Observatory and suggested several points worthy of
							deliberate consideration; among which was that of having two Astronomers
							attached to the Observatory— One as Observer, and the other for the
							calculations; which he says is the principle of the establishment at
							Göttingen.— I asked him, who, he thought would be the most suitable
							person for observing Astronomer.— He named several persons,
							distinguished in the pursuit of mathematical and astronomical studies,
							and appeared to give the preference to <persRef ref="olmsted-denison"
								>professor Olmstead</persRef> of Yale College— I requested M<hi

							to give any suggestion that might occur to him for the promotion of the

							make no more— After 2 I called at Charles’s Office, and then at his

						<p>I had an almost sleepless Night— Heard the Midnight Clock, and between
							one and two was awakened by sharp cramps in the calf of my right leg,
							which forced me out of my bed, but immediately subsided— I laid however
							till 4. meditating this as an admonition, and considering how easily
							such a turn in my solitude might take me to my account without further
							notice— And in fervent prayer, that I may be duly prepared for such a
							visitation, and a spirit of humility to meet it— I then rose, and in
							going out found the snow falling, and a white sheet already upon the
							ground— Of course no sight of Stars— After making my fire washing face,
							hands, feet and mouth with cold water, I found I could not write— Read

							1826. in favour of a National Observatory. The further I proceed in the
							consideration of this subject, the more I feel the want of more mature

							the estimate upon which we had agreed and for which he had paid me— But
							he said he was not satisfied with it; and wished to enquire further
							concerning it— He was going to Dedham, upon his lawsuit, with <persRef
								ref="cummings-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cummings</persRef> the teacher of the central school, who refused to
							receive and teach his children. He recovered a verdict against the

							or to-morrow— <persRef ref="spear-william">Deacon William
								Spear</persRef> was afterwards here, and told me the point of Law in
							the case of Alpheus’s suit.— In Districting the town for Schools, the
							old Mount Wollaston house was included in the Germantown District.— The
							new house built perhaps 30. feet west of it, Alpheus considered as
							within the centre District, and he sent his children to the centre
							school, where the master refused to instruct them— The Deacon had much
							more discourse with me on political topics, and particularly on the
							license law, which is about to revolutionize the State into a <persRef
