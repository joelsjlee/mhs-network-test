								Davis</persRef> came on with <persRef key="adams-charles2">my

							Charles rode with me to the Capitol— I introduced them into the library.
							H.R.U.S. The duelling report came up. Half the members absent at the
							race-course. <persRef ref="may-william">May</persRef> of Illinois moved
							on adjournment—rejected by yeas and nays 7 to 156— <persRef
								ref="duncan-alexander">Duncan</persRef> had moved to strike out from
							my motion the words the paper purporting to be (the report) I agreed to
							their being struck out— Various motions made for amending the
							Instructions. It was agreed to take the questions separately on the
							commitment and each branch of the Instructions, when <persRef
								ref="thomas-francis">Thomas</persRef> moved to strike out the second
							branch of the Instructions—which was carried 96 to 68.— And then Thomas
							moved to strike out the other part of the Instructions, avowing that
							after that there will be no motive for recommitment— Then <persRef
								ref="rariden-james">Rariden</persRef> moved a substitute for my
							Resolution, to which <persRef ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef>
							moved an Amendment requiring the Committee to report a Bill to prevent
							the practices of duelling, all which I accepted, instead of my
							Resolution—whereupon <persRef ref="toucey-isaac">Toucey</persRef> asked
							leave to report the Bill from the Senate with amendments, which was
							admitted by unanimous consent. The Bill and Amendments were referred to
							the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union— I ordered to be
							printed— <persRef ref="legare-hugh">Legaré</persRef> declared himself
							against the Bill, and defended the practice of duelling— <persRef
								ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> made a speech against all the
							proceedings of the House in this case, questioning the power of the
							House, but he was arrested by the <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>Speaker</persRef> as out of order.— <persRef ref="chambers-john"
								>Chambers</persRef> of Kentucky made a bitter Speech against the
							proceedings of the Committee— <persRef ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod
								Williams</persRef> moved a reconsideration of the vote rejecting the
							second Instructions to be given on recommitting the report— <persRef
								ref="boon-ratliff">Boon</persRef> made the point that there was no
							Quorum in the House— I moved a call—rejected by 60 to 68 showing a
							Quorum, no sooner found than it was gone again. Three several motions
							were made to adjourn—twice rejected by yeas and nays, at my call—
								<persRef ref="yell-archibald">Yell</persRef> proposed to set aside
							the duel and take up the army Bill; but a third motion to adjourn was
							made and carried 78 to 56. before three O’Clock. The members were all
							gone to the Horse-Race— Coming home I met <persRef
								ref="kemble-gouverneur">G. Kemble</persRef>, returning from the
							race— T. K. Davis dined with us.— <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi

							and I to the Birth-night Ball of <persRef ref="pontois-edouard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pontois</persRef>, the French
							Minister— We went early, about 9. and came home before 11. Company
							large—crowd great— Apartments small almost the whole Senate there— Many

							private Citizens and Strangers— There was dancing and a supper, and the
							party broke up about 3. of the morning.</p>

						<p>Owing to the labours or the pleasures of yesterday, my Catarrhal cough
							was this day much worse— H.R.U.S. The motion of <persRef
								ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod Williams</persRef> to reconsider the
							vote to strike out the Resolution to discharge the Committee from the
							further consideration of the question of the breach of privileges of the
							House, and of the Petitions and Memorials <persRef ref="connor-henry"
								>Connor</persRef> moved a call of the House, upon which after much
							consumption of time only 180 members were found present— The question of
							reconsideration was variously debated— <persRef ref="mckennan-thomas"
								>M’Kennon</persRef> offered a substitute for both my Resolutions of
							Instructions, but afterwards withdrew it— The question of
							reconsideration returned; and I spoke perhaps an hour and a half, and
							exposed the course pursued by <persRef ref="thomas-francis"
								>Thomas</persRef> to evade the manifest purpose of the House, by
							indirection; and I denounced the whole proceeding as an administration
							measure, entirely one sided and partial, which brought up all the bile
							of Thomas, and of <persRef ref="boon-ratliff">Boon</persRef> of Indiana,
							and they poured it forth in fury— Thomas repeatedly interrupted me and
							got in peppery Speeches, under colour of explanation Boon impertinently
							intruded upon the debate, and I got a general laugh of the House upon
							him, by saying that they surely could not understand me as referring to
							him, fair, candid, and impartial as they had daily opportunities of
							observing him to be, when I charged this proceeding with the reverse of
							all these qualities— Upon the laugh, Boon turned pale as a ghost, came
							round opposite where I was speaking— Stared me in the face while I was
							speaking, as if he thought he could brow-beat me— I looked him
							occasionally in the face, with cool indifference, and went on— When
							Thomas had finished his reply, Boon snarled out his rage in scurrilities
							for which he was called to order by the House, and the <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef>, though I intreated that he might
							be permitted to proceed— <persRef ref="murray-john10">Murray</persRef>
							of Kentucky moved to lay the whole subject on the table; rejected by
							yeas and nays 47 to 124.— The motion to reconsider the vote of
							yesterday, to strike out the Instructions moved by <persRef
								ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> and accepted by me, was
							rejected by yeas and nays 82 to 90— Then came the question, upon my
							first instructions, as modified by the motion of <persRef
								ref="rariden-james">Rariden</persRef>, accepted by me— The clause
							moved by <persRef ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef>, requiring the
							Committee to report an Anti-duelling bill, fell of course, by <persRef
								ref="toucey-isaac">Toucey’s</persRef> Report yesterday of the Bill
							from the Senate with Amendments— The vote against Thomas’s motion to
							strike out the instruction was by yeas and nays 93 to 82.— <persRef
								ref="fletcher-isaac">Fletcher</persRef> of Vermont then moved an
							amendment, requiring the Committee to report again upon the petitions,
							and memorials— <persRef ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef> moved an
							amendment to this which was rejected— Fletcher’s amendment was carried
							by yeas and nays 89 to 86— <persRef ref="loomis-arphaxed">Arphaxad
								Loomis</persRef> moved an amendment, requiring the Committee to
							strike out from their report all that required punishment of members of
							the House— I frightened him out of it by approving <hi rend="italic"
								>it,</hi>
							<pb n="471" type="ms"/>it; and he changed it for an amendment, excepting
							the question of the breach of privilege from the instruction to strike
							out the argumentative parts— <persRef ref="reed-john">Reed</persRef>
							moved as an amendment to this, that if any member of the house should
							prove involved, the Committee should report the facts specially without
							measures of punishment— After some debate on the amendments there were
							sundry motions to adjourn, and one call of the House rejected by yeas
							and nays, one by the casting vote of the Speaker 88 to 88—after which,
							past 5. O’Clock a motion was carried without yeas and nays to adjourn—
							On reaching home I found that <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa3">daughter</persRef> had arrived from Baltimore—
								<persRef ref="dawson-william">Dawson</persRef> of Georgia, told me
							in the House jokingly, that he had had thoughts of interposing between
							me and Boon, to restore the equality— But as I was coming out of the
							Capital, a man who announced himself to me as an old acquaintance, by
							the name of <persRef ref="u">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Knight</persRef> said he had something confidential to say to me,
							and took me aside, and with a solemn look, advised me to be upon my
							guard, for that Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Boon, at whose
							lodgings I understood him to say that he was a boarder, was a high
							tempered and violent man; and might perhaps attack me personally— He
							said that Boon had already been much offended at some quotation made by
							me in the house, but he did not tell me what it was— I simply answered,
							that I was obliged to him; and that it was well— I have had many such
							notices, which I have always despised— May these repeated warnings at
							least preserve me from giving any just cause of offence, without
							deterring me from any proper exercise of the freedom of Speech— I
							visited <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President Van Buren</persRef>
							this morning with my Son.</p>

						<p>My Cough returned severely last Night, and I thought I should be unable
							to attend in the House this day; but found myself much better again this

								ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="vail-henry">Vail</persRef> and <persRef ref="webster-taylor"
								>Webster</persRef> were there, and we formed No Quorum— H.R.U.S.—
							Three Messages from the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President</persRef> were read, two of which were referred to the
							Committee of foreign Affairs— One of them was with a Note of the
								<persRef ref="martinez-francisco">Mexican Minister</persRef>
							concerning the affair of the Steamboat— The other concerning the claim
							of Territory on the borders of the South Sea— The consideration of this
							at <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing’s</persRef> motion was postponed
							to this day week— <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> of Tennessee
							moved to suspend the rules to admit a motion, that when the House should
							adjourn it should be till next Monday, for time to cleanse the hall, and
							put down the matting, for the Summer arrangement— The concert of
							operation was strong, so as to prevent the yeas and nays being taken—the
							rules were suspended, and <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
							<pb n="472" type="ms"/>the Resolution to adjourn over adopted— Whereupon
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell immediately moved to adjourn— He
							suspended the motion at my request, until I had by leave reported from
							the Committee of Manufactures, the Bill from the Senate N 175. to refund
							to the Georgia Rail-road and Banking company certain duties paid on the
							importation of Spikes— It was at my motion referred to the Committee of
							the Whole on the State of the Union, and ordered to be printed for which
								<persRef ref="dawson-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dawson</persRef> of Georgia came to my Seat, and thanked me—

							Hall which they were visiting, after the adjournment of the House— As I
							was returning home, I met in the capitol yard <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H. Everett</persRef> who was going
							the House— He turned about and walked with me to my door conversing
							chiefly upon, a project which he is meditating of setting up a Newspaper
							in Boston to support the present Administration of the United States, on
							a different platform from that of the Advocate or that of the Morning
							Post— He seemed to think that <persRef ref="davis-thomas2">T. K.
								Davis</persRef> and <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>,
							were disposed to engage in this undertaking; but as to Charles at least
							was mistaken. I thought it altogether impracticable; and knew not what
							part of the political system of the present administration could be
							supported upon any sound principle— At home, the remainder of the day—

						<p>North-east storm— Rain at intervals throughout the day, and Evening— I
							had agreed to go with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles</persRef> to the race; but
							the weather was so bad that we gave it up— <persRef

								ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef> who is confined to his

							Letter of <persRef ref="canfield-lizur">Lizur B. Canfield</persRef> of
							Homer, Cortland County, New-York addressed to me and to <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster</persRef>, to certify to the

							7. June 1832. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards found the papers,
							forwarded to him by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canfield, and
							promised to report to me on the case— I then called at the Department of
							State, to ask a Passport for <persRef ref="cruft-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Cruft</persRef> who is going to
							Europe, and had sent me a description of his person— The Secretary,
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Forsyth</persRef> was at the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President’s</persRef>, but <persRef ref="dayton-aaron">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dayton</persRef> the Chief Clerk took

							which of them <hi rend="italic">he</hi>
							<pb n="473" type="ms"/>he would wish to have sent, in answer to his
							call— After consulting with me, he demanded the whole— A few days since,
							a very small part of them were sent, with a statement that it would take
							some time to have translations made of many of the others— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dayton at my request shewed me the list,
							and in answer to my enquiry when they would be ready to be sent to the
							House, said, in three or four weeks— I looked carefully over the list,
							and believe all the correspondence with Mexico is there— I found
							particularly the Letter, from <persRef ref="butler-anthony">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Anthony Butler</persRef> to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth of 17. June 1835. which Forsyth’s
							answer to it, of 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> July 1835. already
							communicated, had excited in me a strong curiosity to see. I thence went
							to <persRef ref="pettrich-ferdinand">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pettrich’s</persRef> Sculptor Study, but he was not there; and then
							to the Wigwam where I saw <persRef ref="catlin-george">M<hi

							Portraits, and Museum. He wishes to sell it to Congress, but talks of
							taking it to England— The Portraits have no merit as works of art— The
							War-dances and Council fires are caricatures of disgusting nature— The
							views on the Missouri river from 1200 to 1900 miles above S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Louis are very indifferent landscapes,
							and the buffaloes hunted by wolves, are not comparable to <persRef
								ref="snyders-frans">Snyder’s’</persRef> Boar hunting.— The

							Catlin was not there— As I was walking home I was overtaken by <persRef

							called on me yesterday, and told me he was going to Europe for a few
							Months to visit <persRef ref="newell-mary">his wife’s</persRef>

								ref="vanburen-martin">President Van Buren</persRef> and <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> are
							inferior as likenesses, and too much idealized— The Group of Charity,
							the boy holding a baptismal font—the sleeping innocence with a lamb
							sleeping between her arm and side—the angling girl, I had seen before—
							There was a bust of <persRef ref="blackhawk">Black Hawk</persRef>, and
							another Indian Chief in Chocolate coloured clay, which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Pettrich said he should send to <persRef
								ref="thorvaldsen-bertel">Thorwaldsen</persRef> at Rome— The walls of
							the Study are covered with outline sketches in black paint. Portraits of
							Indian Chiefs who have recently been, or are now here— Davis preferred
							these to the Sculpture; and they are more aboriginal in their character—
							The busts differ little from those of hard featured, and pain befurrowed
							white faces— His Black Hawk closely resembles <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
							<pb n="474" type="ms"/>the face on antient Statues and coins of the

							wheat is 25 cents a bushel. Starch is duty free— The consequence is that
							all the Starch making establishments in this Country except his own are
							suspended—the Starch being imported from Bremen— I invited M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Colgate to attend the Meeting of the
							Committee of manufactures next Monday Morning and to present his views
							and statements to them, but he said he wished to leave the City this
							afternoon— I told him I would then report to the Committee the substance

							so late in the Session, it would be possible to carry either alternative
							through both Houses of Congress.— <persRef ref="briggs-george">M<hi

						<p>I took my Granddaughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef>
							with me to the Presbyterian Church and heard a stranger from Isaiah
							55.2. “Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your
							labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and
							eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.”
							The inference drawn by the preacher from this text was that Man was a
							reasonable creature, and that it was surprizing how little regard to
							reason was discoverable his conduct—and then he came back in conclusion
							upon the depravity of man, and the atonement— Is not the doctrine itself
							of the depravity of man and the atonement a proof that man is not a
							rational being? Is not inconsistency a summary of the human character—
							If I am utterly depraved what is the use of preaching to me? If I am
							utterly depraved, how can I blame my neighbour for being so too? And if
							regeneration is the test of Salvation, must it not be because the new
							man is better than the old?— <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> and <persRef ref="davis-thomas2">T. K.
								Davis</persRef> were also there— The preacher gave notice of a
							Meeting to-morrow evening, to devise means, for the future support of
							the Pastor— We were <hi rend="italic">overtaken</hi>
							<pb n="475" type="ms"/>overtaken by a cold shower returning home. T. K.
							Davis dined with us— After dinner I attended alone at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church, where <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read the service for the third Sunday after Easter, and preached from
							Isaiah 52.7. “How beautiful upon the Mountains, are the feet of him that
							bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings
							of good, that publisheth salvation: that saith unto Zion, thy God
							reigneth!” The text above is worth a hundred Sermons— <persRef

							from <persRef ref="colgate-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Colgate</persRef>; and of his conversation with me; and the Memorial
							from the Starch-makers of Philadelphia was read again— It was agreed
							that the Starch makers had reason to complain that with a duty of 25
							cents a bushel on wheat; and of 50 cents to a 100 lb of flour, Starch is
							admitted duty free— But the Philadelphia Memorials ask a duty of 7 cents
							a lb which is at least 100 per Cent of the value— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Vail observed that the principal use of
							Starch was in manufactures of Cotton and Linen, and that the
							manufacturers of those Articles would earnestly resist the imposition of
							any duty upon Starch— H.R.U.S. I found the House in Session, and sundry
							members rising successively and presenting Petitions, Memorials and
							Resolutions, which were received and acted upon without opposition— I
							said I had also a few Petitions to present for which I asked leave—
							Objection was immediately made— I knew it would be in vain to ask a
							suspension of the rules—another member immediately asked leave to
							present a petition, to which I objected, and gave notice that I should
							object to the reception of any such motion, while the indulgences
							yielded to other members were denied to me— <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> moved a suspension

							Treasury Note— Bill— Lost 102 to 77. not near two thirds— The <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> announced the unfinished

							amendment moved by <persRef ref="loomis-arphaxed">Arphaxad

								<persRef ref="sawyer-samuel">Sawyer</persRef> of North-Carolina,

								>Duncan</persRef> and Bynum— This threw them into an ungovernable
							frenzy; but Rariden’s motion not being in order the question was taken
							upon Reeds amendment which was rejected 79 to 82— The question coming
							back upon Loomis’s amendment, <persRef ref="sibley-mark"
								>Sibley</persRef> moved an amendment to it instructing the Committee
							to report the names of all the members of the House concerned in the
							duel— Loomis accepted Sibley’s amendment as a modification of his own;
							but it brought off the steam from Bynum and Duncan— <persRef
								ref="dawson-william">Dawson</persRef> had moved to lay the whole
							subject on the table, and to print the Journal and evidence— <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> called for a division of the

								ref="thomas-francis">Thomas</persRef> became alarmed, and moved to
							lay the whole subject on the table; and to print all the papers. He came
							in thus a second time at a dead lift, and rallied the party with all his
							powers; but his motion was divided, and that for laying on the table was
							lost 73 to 95. About half the administration rank and file voting for
							and half against the motion— Sibley then replied with Spirit to Bynum
							and Duncan—and pressed <persRef ref="toucey-isaac">Toucey</persRef> so
							hard upon his vote to recommit the Petitions. and Memorials, that Toucey

							Bynum took the floor together— Bynum full charged to reply to Sibley.—
							But after several struggles, and refusals to adjourn a motion for it was

							by the <persRef ref="stansbury-arthur;otis-james2">Reporters</persRef>
							of my Speeches in the House last week, upon the duel Committee’s
							Reports— They sent me afterwards to the House the Notes which had been

								Senate</persRef> read part of the episcopal funeral service, and
							made a prayer— <persRef ref="reese-levi">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Reese</persRef> the Chaplain of the House delivered a discourse,

							Massachusetts, <persRef ref="edwards-john2">John Edwards</persRef> of

								ref="naylor-charles">Naylor</persRef>— I obtained a direction from
							the Committee to report to the House the Senate’s Bill 176. for
							refunding certain duties to a New-York Railroad Company, without
							amendment— H.R.U.S. immediately after the reading of the Journal a
							Message from the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> was
							received with a Report from the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary
								of the Treasury</persRef> urging the extreme necessity of the
							immediate necessity for the passage of the Treasury Note-Bill. <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cambreleng</persRef> gave notice that when the Report of the duel
							Committee should be disposed of, as he trusted it would this day, he
							should move to take up the Treasury Note Bill to-morrow Morning.— After
							some abortive attempts for a call of the House, <persRef
								ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> made a speech, utterly
							denying the right of the House to institute any enquiry into a duel for
							the purpose of censure upon any of its members— The <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> arrested him at the threshold of
							this argument, as out of order— Underwood insisted. The Speaker became
							peremptory— Underwood appealed from the decision, and reduced his point
							to writing— The Speaker then said, the Gentleman from Kentucky had
							narrowed down his claim to discuss the right, so much that he might
							proceed, whereupon Underwood for about an hour took a range of argument
							against the power of the House to institute any such investigation, and
							that there had been no violation of the privileges of the House,
							whatever.— As he was drawing to a conclusion, <persRef
								ref="owens-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Owens</persRef> of
							Georgia took me into the lobby of the House and introduced to me, the
								<persRef ref="howard-charles2">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
								Charles Wallace Howard</persRef>, who presented me a recommendatory
							Letter from <persRef ref="gilmer-george">Governor Gilmer</persRef>. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Howard is going to England, to procure
							copies of documents relating to the Settlement and History of Georgia at
							the Colonial Office; and also a Library and apparatus for Oglethorpe
							University— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Owens had asked of me, a
							Letter for him to <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Rush</persRef>, <hi rend="italic">which</hi>
							<pb n="479" type="ms"/>which I promised to give him. He said he was at
								<persRef ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef>; and should go
							to-morrow Morning for New-York, there to embark on the 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> for England— On returning into the House
							I found <persRef ref="thomas-francis">Thomas</persRef> speaking with
							great fervour and finally concluding with the same motion he had lost
							last week— To lay all the Reports and documents of the duel Committee on
							the Table, and print them—not naming the Journal— The motion was not
							debateable— But a division was called— The motion to lay on the table
							was carried by yeas and nays 102 to 76 almost every administration
							member voting for it— Then came the question upon the printing, which I
							required should be put as it was entered on the minutes of the Journal—
							The Speaker refused this, saying that the <persRef ref="franklin-walter"
								>Clerk’s</persRef> entries were only private minutes, and not the
							Journal of the House— <persRef ref="petrikin-david">Petriken</persRef>
							moved the previous question upon the printing, which the Speaker decided
							would be in order; although only half the motion had been decided—before
							that, the main question, would have been upon the Resolutions reported
							by the Committee— But the report, being laid on the table, the main
							question would now be on the printing— <persRef ref="garland-rice">Rice
								Garland</persRef> moved a reconsideration of the vote to lay on the
							table— Thomas objected that the motion to reconsider could not be made,
							till the vote should be taken on his whole Resolution; and the Speaker
							so decided— Rice Garland then appealed from the Speaker’s decision; but
							afterwards withdrew his appeal and the motion to reconsider. I renewed
							the appeal, but the Speaker decided that Garland having withdrawn his
							motion to reconsider I could neither renew the appeal nor the motion to
							reconsider, as I had voted against laying on the table— The question
							upon the printing was then divided and taken first on the three reports
							carried 123 to 74 and then on the evidence and journal 189 to 4. I voted
							for the printing on both questions— I then enquired of the Speaker what
							would be the effect of moving a reconsideration; he said it would be
							upon each of the questions separately taken, and not upon the whole—
							This decision seemed to me absurdly inconsistent with the previous
							decision that a reconsideration of the first vote could not be moved;
							till after the subsequent votes on a divided resolution— For if the
							reconsideration of one part of the whole resolution could not affect the
							other questions on the same motion, there is no reason why it should not
							be moved immediately after the taking the vote— But all this had been
							settled by a party meeting out of the House, and probably by a
							compromise with an opposition party meeting— Laying the whole on the
							table, is in fact smothering the report; but it leaves the resolutions
							of expulsion and of censure suspended over the heads of the members
							implicated— And perhaps this is the most equitable result of the whole
							affair that could occur.— It is a strong though indirect censure of the
							House upon the principals and seconds to the duel, and upon the practice
							itself—and it is a censure alike indirect, not less strong, and as just
							upon the report of the Committee, laid upon the table outrageous as it
							is upon every sense of impartial Justice— All the parties to the duel
							are severely censurable— None more so than the <hi rend="italic"
								>man</hi>
							<pb n="480" type="ms"/><persRef ref="cilley-jonathan">man</persRef> who
							fell. The Majority of the Committee who presented this Report, are still
							more censurable, for instead of holding an impartial balance between the
							parties they have turned the whole subject into an electioneering engine
							of party.— After the decision of this day, <persRef ref="boon-ratliff"
								>Boon</persRef> moved that twenty thousand copies of the majority
							report should be printed for the dear People, which the Speaker declared
							to be out of order— Other business followed, and I by leave reported
							from the Committee of Manufactures, the Senate Bill N. 176. without
							amendment— It was referred to the Committee of the whole on the State of
							the Union, and ordered to be printed— Adjourned at half past 3— I wrote
							the Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Howard; and left it at his lodgings at
							Gadsby’s. <persRef ref="hall-hiland">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hiland Hall</persRef> and <persRef ref="hall-dolly">his

								ref="grennell-george">Grennell</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="phillips-stephen">Phillips</persRef>— We had each of us
							received printed copies of three sets of Resolutions adopted by the
							Legislature of Massachusetts at their late Session— One against the
							Sub-treasury Bill—one urging an Act of Congress against duelling, and
							one against the annexation of Texas to this Union.— But they are without
							Letter from the <persRef ref="everett-edward">Governor</persRef> or from
							the <persRef ref="bigelow-john">Secretary of State</persRef>; and
							without authentication, other than that they came under a cover sealed
							with the Seal of the Governor and Council— On the Resolves against the
							annexation of Texas there is a request that they may be presented to
							both Houses of Congress; but not on the others. After some consultation
							we agreed to have an adjourned Meeting on Saturday the 19<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month, in the expectation of
							receiving some other Resolutions, which we know were adopted by the
							Legislature, and perhaps some further authentication of the whole—
							H.R.U.S. I was called out from my Seat, by the <persRef ref="u">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bogue</persRef>; who came from<space/>New York, as an Agent, with a
							Petition in behalf of the Cherokees, which he at first asked me to
							present to the House, but which he afterwards said, he thought it would
							be best of him to ask <persRef ref="foster-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Foster</persRef>, the Representative
							from the District whence he came to present; he therefore kept it to
							give it to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Foster, and I promised to give
							every aid in my power to urge it upon the consideration of the House— I
							told him that I had several other petitions with the same prayer, but
							the House would barely receive them and lay them on the table— They have
							already so disposed of the Cherokee memorial itself, and of the whole
							subject. On returning to the House I found them debating on the extra
							printing of the duel Committee papers— <persRef ref="graves-william2"
								>Graves</persRef> had moved for the printing of 20000 copies of the
							testimony and Journal because a very large <hi rend="italic"
								>Edition</hi>
							<pb n="481" type="ms"/>of the majority report had been printed and
							franked by the administration members— Then <persRef
								ref="fairfield-john">Fairfield</persRef> moved that 20000 copies of
							the three reports should be printed— <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha"
								>Whittlesey</persRef> moved to reduce the number to 10000— <persRef
								ref="mason-samson">Sampson Mason</persRef> opposed the printing of
							an extra number altogether, on the ground that the majority report was
							unjust and partial, which he went on to prove with unanswerable force—
							The <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> frequently interrupted
							him on the pretence that it was not in order to refer to the <hi
								rend="italic">merits</hi> of the duel. Mason however persisted,
							disregarding the restriction of the Speaker which was wholly
							unwarrantable, until the expiration of the hour when <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> called for the
							orders of the day. Mason then gave way— I asked him if he could not have
							insisted on continuing; as the question in debate was on the privileged
							subject of the duel Committee report— He said the idea had not occurred
							to him— At Whittlesey’s request all the Committees were called on for
							reports— Then Cambreleng called up the Bill to carry into effect the act
							of 12. October 1837 authorising an issue of treasury Notes—a false and
							fraudulent title— It was considered in Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union— <persRef ref="ingham-samuel">Ingham</persRef> in the
							Chair— Cambreleng made a Speech of about half an hour upon the
							prosperous condition of the Country; the abundance of our resources; the
							sufficiency of our revenues; the inflexible patriotism and firmness of
							the administration, and the immediate indispensable necessity of
							furnishing the Treasury with money. He was followed by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing in a Speech of about the same
							length; but whether in opposition to the Bill or not, it was not easy to
							say. <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> followed in
							a set Speech against the Bill as unconstitutional; and urging, upon the
							administration a loan; though not venturing to propose one himself
							because it would be unpopular— Thompson had not half finished his speech
							when <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> moved the
							Committee to rise— vote by tellers 55 to 53. No Quorum. The Committee
							rose, but Ingham the Chairman, reported, instead of the fact of no
							Quorum that they had risen without coming to any resolution— <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> immediately moved to adjourn
							which was carried by yeas and nays 71 to 69. by <persRef
								ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod Williams’s</persRef> changing his
							vote. We should else have had a fair prospect of sitting the whole
							Night—</p>

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Cushing</persRef>, with <persRef ref="daveis-charles"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles S. Daveis</persRef> an
							Agent from the State of Maine, concerning the North-eastern boundary;
							and also concerning the shipping interest of that State going to ruin
							under the Treaty negotiated by <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Van-Buren</persRef>, with England—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing said he was preparing a
							Report for the Committee of foreign Relations upon that subject, and
							upon the South-Sea boundary— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daveis
							advised him to consult my Article in the American Quarterly Review on
							the trade with the British Colonies. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Daveis brought me a recommendatory Letter from <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Governor Edward Everett</persRef> and I
							received also by the Mail a private Letter from the Governor— The two
							Letters are of the same date and compare curiously together. H.R.U.S.
							The day began with a debate, on a motion heretofore made by <persRef
								ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef> from the Committee of Roads
							and Canals to print 1500 extra copies of a survey of the Allegany river,
							which consumed the morning hour— <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole</persRef> opposed the printing, because he saw in it a
							covert attempt to revive the <hi rend="italic">exploded</hi>
							<pb n="482" type="ms"/>exploded system of internal improvements—the
							first vote taken on the printing was 46 to 52. no quorum— But
							Dromgoole’s resistance kindled a Spirit, under which <persRef
								ref="beatty-william">Beatty</persRef> moved to increase the number
							of copies from 1500 to 3000, and the order passed by yeas and nays 69 to
							81. against Dromgoole’s motion to lay on the table and without yeas and
							nays though demanded by <persRef ref="rencher-abraham">Rencher</persRef>
							for the 3000 copies. <persRef ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef>
							offered a joint Resolution as a substitute for the Treasury Note Bill,
							but the House refused to suspend the rules to receive it 69 to 107—
								<persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> asked the suspension of the
							Rules to offer a Loan as a substitute—refused—82 to 94— The Treasury
							Note Bill was taken up in Committee of the whole, <persRef
								ref="ingham-samuel">Ingham</persRef> in the Chair, and debated till
							past midnight— <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef>
							finished his Speech; which was rather a vindication of his own opinions
							as a Southern man against <persRef ref="calhoun-john">John C.
								Calhoun’s</persRef> recent apostasy, than an argument against the
							Bill— He was followed by <persRef ref="rhett-robert">R. Barnwell
								Rhett</persRef>, in what <persRef ref="menefee-richard"
								>Menefee</persRef> called a volcanic eruption, and <persRef
								ref="southgate-william">Southgate</persRef> an Earthquake Speech.
							Rhett’s oratory is the ne plus ultra of South-Carolina rhetoric— Ranting
							for eloquence. Emphatic inconsistency and absurdity— He uttered a
							furious diatribe against the Banks— Said they were waging War against
							the People— They were instigating Congress to refuse the Supplies—
							Denied that there was any War of the Government against the Banks— Said
							that he was a friend to the Banks—but called them all <persRef
								ref="shylock">Shylocks</persRef>, and said if they did not cease to
							wage this War against the People, the People would pull their banking
							Houses down about their heads. In delivering this rhodomontade, he threw
							himself into convulsive attitudes reminding me of those by which
								<persRef ref="satan">Satan</persRef> is said to have been discovered
							at the gate of Paradise, in <persRef ref="milton-john"
								>Milton’s</persRef> Poem, He was immediately answered by Menefee,
							and Southgate of Kentucky, in his own Style of blustering and defiance—
							Southgate before commencing moved that the Committee should rise, it
							being near 5 O’Clock, but was refused by tellers 80 to 97— Hopkins then
							offered <persRef ref="rives-francis">Rives’s</persRef> printed Bill as a
							substitute for that before the Committee— <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> objected to this as
							not in order— Bell and myself contended for it as being in order, but
							Ingham the Chairman decided that it was not, and Hopkins did not appeal—
							Bell made a short Speech against the Bill, charging the <persRef
								ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> and the
							Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, with presenting the State
							of the Treasury as far more destitute than it is— <persRef
								ref="robertson-john2">Robertson’s</persRef> offered as an amendment
							the first Section of the Bill which Hopkins had presented, and the
							Chairman admitted it, as in order— From 8 in the Evening till half an
							hour after Midnight, the time was consumed by <persRef
								ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost Johnson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="harper-alexander">Harper</persRef> of Ohio, speaking against
							time, with motions at intervals of about ten minutes for the Committee
							to rise, always failing by the casting vote of the Chairman, or by
							majorities of one or two votes—several times with a majority of one for
							rising; balanced by the vote of the Chairman making a tie, and thus
							defeating the motion— When Midnight came <persRef ref="pope-john"
								>Governor Pope</persRef> made it a point of Order, whether the
							Committee should continue in Session on the Sabbath, and moved the
							Committee to rise, to take the question of adjournment by yeas and nays—
							Ingham read from the Journals of 1836. the precedent of the case when
								<persRef ref="lawler-joab">Lawler</persRef> made the same point of
							order; and as Lawler had then withdrawn his appeal, Ingham decided that
							it was in order to legislate, on the Sabbath, from which decision Pope
							took an Appeal— The vote on Pope’s motion to rise was <hi rend="italic"
								>83</hi>
							<pb n="483" type="ms"/>83. to 82. The Chairman voted in the negative,
							made a tie and declared that the Committee had refused to rise— Pope
							made an argument of delivery with him, and said that as it was a vote
							upon an appeal, from the Chairman’s decision, he ought not himself to
							vote— <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> contended that
							as it was an appeal on a point of order from the decision of the
							Chairman, and as the statement of the question must be, shall the
							decision stand, as the opinion of the Committee, it must be carried by a
							positive majority, and the Chairman’s tie could not affirm his decision,
							but affirmed the vote of the Committee to rise— At last <persRef
								ref="morgan-william4">Morgan</persRef> of Virginia, rose and said he
							was convinced it would be useless longer to struggle to come this night
							to a conclusion, and he moved the Committee should rise— Two or three
							votes were changed— The Committee rose, and the motion to adjourn was
							carried by yeas and nays 85 to 72. 5 minutes before One O’Clock Sunday
							Morning— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cambreleng took a seat with me
							in my Carriage, and I took him to his lodgings— I had taken nothing but
							a glass of water since breakfast— After a warm cup of Shells, and a
							slice of bread and butter, I reached my bed just before two.</p>

							His election was contested on two grounds—first that he was not an
							inhabitant of the District in Maryland for which he was chosen—and
							secondly that he was a half pay British Officer— Woodley is in the
							District of Columbia— But he had a house in the adjoining County of
							Montgomery in Maryland, where he occasionally resided— The House
							confirmed him in his Seat, and he represented the District in several
							successive Congresses— The house is now in a somewhat dilapidated
							condition and until recently taken by Kervand had been long uninhabited—
							The trees are not yet in full foliage, but for the first time this
							Season I observed a Horse-chesnut tree, studded with its white
							plumes.</p>

								<persRef ref="boon-ratliff">Boon</persRef> of Indiana, acting as he

								ref="bond-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bond</persRef>.
							He withdrew it, and Boon’s motion to suspend the rules was lost by yeas

							day for receiving Resolutions, but <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
								>Cambreleng</persRef> moved a suspension of the Rules to go into

							resumed the floor from Sunday Morning and concluded his Speech against

								>Hawes</persRef> of Kentucky, a brother of the member of the last

						<p>The state of my health is deeply affected by the length of my days—
							Relief more or less, for a single day from infirmities, increasing from
							week to week, and from month to month, is all that I can henceforth
							expect, for the short remnant of my days— The hours of yesterday hung
							heavy upon my hands— This day was more supportable.— H.R.U.S.— <persRef
								ref="boon-ratliff">Boon</persRef> renewed his motion to suspend the
							Rules, for the consideration of <persRef ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod
								Williams’s</persRef> Resolution, which Williams declared his assent
							to turn from an instruction to the Committee of Ways and Means, into a
							joint Resolution— On a call for the yeas and nays, no Quorum appearing
								<persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> moved a call of the
							House which was commenced, but suspended before it was gone through— The
							yeas and nays for the suspension of the Rules were 111 to 70. a large
							majority, but not two thirds. A Resolution from the Senate for the
							Relief of <persRef ref="ellis-vespasian">Vespasian Ellis</persRef>,
							passed through its three readings at the urgency of <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">H. A. Wise</persRef>, who was named in it and had
							some agency in the transaction to which it applied— After some other
							business of Routine, the Rules on <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
								>Cambreleng’s</persRef> motion were suspended and the Treasury Note
							Bill, reported last Night to the House was taken up. Cambreleng moved an
							amendment referring additionally to the act of 12. October 1837.
								<persRef ref="robertson-john2">Robertson’s</persRef> amendment,
							proposing a loan as a substitute for the Treasury Notes, and a further
							amendment proposing a loan, together with an issue of 2. Millions of
							Treasury Notes were before the House for Consideration— <persRef
								ref="hoffman-josiah">Ogden Hoffman</persRef> began the debate with a
							speech of great heat, chiefly in answer to <persRef ref="rhett-robert"
								>Rhett</persRef>, and South Carolina Nullification— But as Hoffman
							touched upon the sore of South-Carolina, <persRef ref="thompson-waddy"
								>Waddy Thompson</persRef> against whom Rhett’s speech had been
							chiefly pointed, felt himself bound to defend his State in reply to
							Thompson— <persRef ref="jones-john9">John W. Jones</persRef> of
							Virginia, followed with a moderate and sensible Speech in support of the
							Bill— Jones is a member of the Committee of Ways and Means—a lame and
							mean looking man; seldom speaking, though a very handsome speaker, and
							covering under a cold exterior of indifference a deep and rancorous
							malignity— Wise succeeded him, in a Speech of not much impression,
							because he has been a week absent, and had taken no time for
							premeditation. He exhibited an old continental bill for 30 dollars of
							May 1775—and a sheet of North-Carolina 5 and 10 dollar Bills of 1778.
							and compared them with the Treasury Notes, issued under the Act of 12.
								Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1837. <persRef ref="bynum-jesse"
								>Bynum</persRef> came next with an effusion of his oil of vitriol
							for about two hours. Evening was coming on— <persRef ref="garland-rice"
								>Garland</persRef> of Louisiana moved to adjourn; but on opposition
							made withdrew the motion, afterwards renewed by <persRef
								ref="calhoun-william">Calhoun</persRef> and rejected by yeas and
							nays 64 to 125. <persRef ref="cushman-samuel">Cushman</persRef> then
							moved the previous question— There was a call of the House till the
							presence of 200 members was ascertained— The vote seconding the previous
							question was 98 to 95— That ordering the main question 99 to 99. a
							tie—carried by the casting vote of the <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>Speaker</persRef>— The vote to engross the Bill was 106. to 99— The
							Virginia conservatives and <persRef ref="rariden-james"
								>Rariden</persRef> of Indiana voting for it— Sherrod Williams moved
							to recommit the Bill with Instructions to Report a Loan, Treasury Notes
							and the sale of the Bonds of the Bank of the United States. Cushman
							moved again the previous question carried 103 to 94. Rariden moved a
							reconsideration of the engrossment of the Bill; which the Speaker
							against the Remonstrances of <persRef ref="bell-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef> pronounced not in
							order— The Bill was then passed without taking the yeas and nays. <hi

							<pb n="487" type="ms"/>I moved to strike out from the title, the words
							“to carry into effect the act approved the 12<hi rend="superscript"

								ref="fletcher-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fletcher</persRef> moved to add the words, “to meet the current
							expenses of the Government.” which was also agreed to. Rariden then gave
							notice that he should to-morrow move the reconsideration of the vote on
							the passage of the Bill— At a quarter past ten in the Evening the House
							adjourned— I walked home, and after slight refreshment went to bed—
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> being yet

						<p>H.R.U.S. This day, the first for several weeks was devoted by the House

							less than a Quorum of the Members present— Many reports from Committees

							gratuitously by the Bank of the United States— The Pension agency now
							are a considerable charge, and established without concert of system.
							There was debate between <persRef ref="fletcher-isaac"

							John’s Church, read the Evening service for the 5<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Sunday after Easter, and preached from 2. Samuel 7.18.
							“Then went <persRef ref="david">king David</persRef> in, and sat before
							the Lord, and he said, who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that
							thou hast brought me hitherto? 19. And this was yet a small thing in thy
							sight, O Lord God; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for
							a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord God?” M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley’s discourse was chiefly a
							commentary upon the words “and is this the manner of man[”]— The
							building of the Temple at Jerusalem, is among the most remarkable events
							in the History of the Jews— And is to be considered under various
							aspects— It was a Church— Why should such transcendant importance have
							been attached to the building of a Church? Temples innumerable had been
							long before built to the heathen Gods in all the surrounding Countries?—
							In this 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of the second Book of
							Samuel, the project of building a Temple is stated as having casually
							occurred to David after he had conquered his enemies, and <hi
								rend="italic">had</hi>
							<pb n="491" type="ms"/>had built a Palace for himself— He consults the
							prophet <persRef ref="nathan">Nathan</persRef> who at first approves the
							design; but receives the same Night a command from the Lord to go and
							tell David not to build the Temple, but that <persRef ref="solomon">his
								Son</persRef> shall build it, and that the kingdom shall be
							established in his, David’s family forever. In the 17<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of the first book of Chronicles
							this narrative is repeated—and in both places the reason assigned for
							the interdict is, that from the time of the delivery of the Law upon
							Sinai, the Lord had never commanded that a House should be built for
							him— But in the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> chapter of 1.
							Chronicles v. 8. David says that the reason assigned by the Lord for
							forbidding him to build the temple was that he had been a man of War,
							and had shed blood—which he repeats in the same Book. Chapter 28 v. 3.
							in his address to the People, on declaring his Son Solomon their king.—
							Why is it that the reason assigned to the prophet Nathan, and by him
							reported to David, so essentially differs from that twice stated by
							David to have been revealed to himself? Was it that the divine
							communication to Nathan, was not complete? That the divine purpose was
							to spare David the mortification of hearing from his subject, a reason
							for refusing his intended act of homage, which implied displeasure, and
							disapprobation of his conduct— And throughout all the Scriptures, is
							there a more tender and sublime admonition, to kings and rulers of men,
							to cultivate peace, and to hold human blood precious and inviolable,
							than this prohibition of Almighty God, to the man after his own heart,
							to build him a temple, because he had been a warrior—a shedder of
							blood?— But I have no time for a Dissertation upon the Temple—</p>

						<p>Attended at the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures, at 1/2 past 9,
							but the only other member who attended there, was <persRef
								ref="slade-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Slade</persRef>,
							and of course we could do no business— H.R.U.S— The States beginning
							with Maine were called for Petitions; of which I presented 35 being
							exactly the number of days since the last presentation— 24 of these were
							against that abomination the fraudulent Treaty of New Echota, and for
							justice and mercy to the Cherokee Indians— I presented them all at once,
							knowing that every one of them would be separately laid upon the table—
							Multitudes of other Petitions to the same effect were thus laid on the
							table at the motion of the members from Georgia— <persRef
								ref="morris-calvary">Calvary Morris</persRef> afterwards presented
							one from 177 citizens of Marietta, Ohio, which with a short Speech he
							moved should be referred to a select Committee— <persRef
								ref="owens-george">Owens</persRef> moved it should be laid on the
							table— Morris called for the yeas and nays— <persRef
								ref="chapman-reuben">Chapman</persRef> of Alabama moved a call of
							the House, but it was denied, and the Petition was laid on the Table 107
							to 71— I presented the petition of <persRef ref="toller-stephen">Stephen
								Toller</persRef> and 30 inhabitants of Jeffersonville, Goochland
								C<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi> Virginia, praying for my expulsion,
							as a nuisance, which I moved should be referred to the Committee on the
							judiciary— <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> said he
							supposed it was a Quiz—or if not; it was a question of privilege, and
							must be decided by the House— He moved it should be laid on the Table
							unless the Gentlemen from Massachusetts wished to give it another
							direction. I said the Gentleman from Massachusetts cared very little
							about it—and it was laid <hi rend="italic">on</hi>
							<pb n="492" type="ms"/>on the table— Of the Resolutions of the
							Legislature of Massachusetts those concerning the Militia were presented
							by <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Gov<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Lincoln</persRef>, and referred to the Committee of the Whole on the
							state of the Union—those on the Subtreasury Bill, to the Committee of
							Ways and Means—presented by <persRef ref="fletcher-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher</persRef>— Those on the
							North-eastern boundary, by <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing</persRef>; referred to the
							Committee of the whole, upon <persRef ref="evans-george2">George
								Evans’s</persRef> Bill— Those on our Indian Relations by <persRef
								ref="reed-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Reed</persRef>, and
							at the motion of a Georgia member laid on the table— They objected also
							to their being printed—and that question was laid over. Those against
							the annexation of Texas were presented by <persRef ref="briggs-george"
								>George N. Briggs</persRef>, who moved their reference to the
							Committee of foreign Relations, and that they be printed— <persRef
								ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> was just moving to lay them on
							the table, when I appealed to his candour; and generosity and also to
							his State rights principles, to let them be referred; observing that I
							hoped and trusted the questions relating to Texas and Mexico, would now
							cease to be causes of division, among us— That the Mexican proposal for
							an arbitration of our differences has been accepted. That the Texian
							proposal for annexation has been, or is about to be withdrawn— That all
							objection to a fair consideration of these Memorials and Petitions
							seemed to be removed; and the Gentleman from Georgia, might be well
							assured that no report from the Committee of Foreign Relations on this
							subject, unfriendly to his views was to be expected— Haynes then said
							that to shew his generosity since I appealed to it, he would withdraw
							his objection to the reference and the printing of these Resolutions— No
							other person made objection and the Resolutions were referred this point
							being gained I moved the reference to the same Committee of all the
							petitions this day presented against the annexation of Texas; of which
							there were several— Some uneasiness was manifested by several members,
							and particularly by <persRef ref="mercer-charles">C. F.
							Mercer</persRef>, who objected to the reference of one Memorial, but
							upon being told by the <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> that
							several had been referred withdrew his objection, not without
							muttering.— <persRef ref="calhoun-william">W. C. Calhoun</persRef>
							presented the Massachusetts Legislative Resolution against the admission
							of any new Slave State into the Union— The first Resolution was half
							read, until the <persRef ref="franklin-walter">clerk</persRef> came to
							the word Slavery, when he was stop’d by the Speaker, and the Resolutions
							were laid on the table under the order of 21. Dec<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> 1837.— <persRef ref="grennell-george">Grennell</persRef>
							presented the Resolutions on the subject of duelling which were referred
							to the Committee of the whole House on the state of the Union, to which
							the Bill from the Senate against duelling has been referred. There
							remain three sets of Resolutions of the Massachusetts Legislature to be
							presented hereafter— Among the petitions which I presented was one with
							documents which I found on my table, from <persRef ref="kibbey-lianah"
								>Lianah Kibbey</persRef> for a widows pension— The Speaker presented
							several petitions, and I reminded him of one from the workmen employed
							here on the public buildings thrown out of employment by the suspension
							of the work on the Treasury building— He presented it, and it was
							referred to the Committee on the Public buildings After the call for
							Petitions was gone through, <persRef ref="boon-ratliff">Boon</persRef>
							had leave to make an explanation; which was that he and <persRef
								ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod Williams</persRef> had disagreed as
							to the mode and form in which the Resolution against the Specie circular
							was to be brought forward, and so he had no alternative <hi
								rend="italic">but</hi>
							<pb n="493" type="ms"/>but to resume his Seat— The Bill making
							appropriations for the suppression of Indian hostilities (nearly 6.
							Millions) was taken up in Committee of the whole. <persRef
								ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> in the Chair, and after some
							discussion and amendments proposed by <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef> and <persRef ref="wise-henry"
								>Wise</persRef>, the Committee rose—the Bill authorising the
							appointment of an additional judge of the Orphans Count for the County
							of Washington in the District of Columbia passed to a third reading, and
							passed as it came from the Senate— An Amendment had been proposed by the
							District Committee, that the tenure of Office of the additional judge
							should be limited to four years— The incumbent is superannuated and
							incompetent the amendment was rejected— <persRef ref="pope-john">M<hi

						<p>Morning visits from <persRef ref="flower-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Flower</persRef> an Englishman heretofore celebrated as
							an Englishman, who came to this Country and made a large Settlement in
							the State of Illinois.— With him was a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnard</persRef>, also a native of
							England, but many years settled in this district; and residing in the
							City— <persRef ref="catlin-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Catlin</persRef> also called and invited me to visit his collection
							or gallery of Indian curiosities; but I had visited it already— He told
							me it was to be removed to morrow, and he intends to take it to England—
							He brought it here with the expectation or hope that Congress would
							purchase it—but of that no one has even ventured a proposition— He
							values it at 50,000 dollars, and Congress would not take it at a tenth
							part of that sum— <persRef ref="stansbury-arthur">Stansbury</persRef>
							and others of his friends have intimated wishes to me to solicit
							Congress, to take his Indian Museum, but I should make myself
							ridiculous— He himself said he was apprehensive the duty upon the
							importation of his Indian pictures in England would be oppressive—and
							asked if I thought he could obtain a remission of it—75 cents a square
							yard of his canvas— It would amount to 3000 dollars— I told him I
							believed it would be impracticable to obtain a remission of the duties,
							unless by act of Parliament— The <persRef ref="victoria">Queen</persRef>
							herself not having the power of remission— Going to the Capitol I stop’d
							at <persRef ref="u">Elliot’s</persRef> buildings, where <persRef
								ref="fowler-orson">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler</persRef>
							the Phrenologist, took a cast of my head and face in Plaster— His mode
							of operating was entirely different from that formerly used by <persRef
								ref="browere-john">Browere</persRef>— In this case I lay on my back,
							stretched on a table the head resting on a board; boxed up as in a large
							bowl, and the liquid plaster poured in so as to rise round the head, and
							flow over the face, the eyes being closed; the nostrils open, and the
							ears stop’d with cotton— In the space of half an hour all this is done;
							the plaster hardens into a cake, and the mask is taken off from the face
							and the shape of the skull from behind, by manual operation, and without
							causing pain— He had already taken this morning the head of <persRef
								ref="polk-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Polk</persRef>, the
							Speaker, and he had a number there, all of whom that I knew, I
							immediately recognized among them were Mess<hi rend="superscript"

								>Benton</persRef>, <persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> of
							Alabama, and <persRef ref="hunt-memucan">Memucan Hunt</persRef> the

									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Davis</persRef> the Senator from
								<hi rend="italic">Massachusetts</hi>
							<pb n="494" type="ms"/>Massachusetts, who was in waiting to be taken,
							but who insisted upon giving way to me, and said he would come again
							to-morrow— Short as the time was absorbed by this masking and unmasking
							it belated me at the House— I found them taking the yeas and nays on a
							motion by <persRef ref="connor-henry">Connor</persRef> to suspend the
							rules, for a Resolution that the morning hour of meeting for the House
							should be ten O’Clock; which was carried. <persRef ref="boon-ratliff"
								>Boon</persRef> attempted to engraft upon it a recess from 2 to 1/2
							past 3. or from 1/2 past 2 to 4—but failed. <persRef
								ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod Williams</persRef> made a
							counter-explanation to that made yesterday by Boon, and asked a
							suspension of the Rules to take up his Resolution for rescinding the
							Specie Circular— Yeas and Nays 104 to 83. not two thirds— A message from
							the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> was received,
							with an ultimatum from the <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of
								War</persRef> to the Cherokee Delegation now in this City, accepting
							conditionally their proposal of a new Treaty in the place of that of New
							Echota, which raised a breeze in the House, and occasioned a long debate
							The Message was at first referred to the Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union there a reconsideration moved and carried, and after
							a fruitless motion to lay it on the table, it was finally referred to
							the Committee on Indian Affairs.— The House then took up <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cushing’s</persRef> motion to refer to the Committee of foreign
							Relations the Message from the President concerning the territories West
							of the Rocky Mountains, and on the pacific Ocean Cushing concluded his
							speech, dwelling emphatically upon the usurpations of the British
							trading companies on the North-west Coast— He was followed by <persRef
								ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> who without opposing
							Cushing’s motion of reference, or his proposed instructions, feebly
							resisted parts of his argument— <persRef ref="elmore-franklin"
								>Elmore</persRef> of South-Carolina moved different and much
							enlarged instructions to the Committee, but assented to Cushing’s
							proposal that they should be additional to those proposed by him, and so
							they were adopted— Elmore said he had proposed to address the House on
							the subject, but was not now prepared, and would forbear— It was 4.
							O’Clock and the House adjourned— The day was sultry, and there was a
							thunder shower in the Evening— A dancing party at <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tayloe’s</persRef> to which <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef>, with <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his
								wife</persRef> went after ten in the Evening— That is now the hour
							of the assembling of evening parties at Washington— I was invited this
							Evening; but after some hesitation preferred my bed.</p>

							on the Bill of Appropriations to suppress Indian Hostilities— <persRef
								ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> moved an Amendment authorising an

								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> made a long and ardent speech upon

								>Filmore</persRef> had by some unnatural influence been induced to
							assume the defence of <persRef ref="schermerhorn-john"

								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							to consult together on the subject, and that a previous meeting of the

							of the City Council of New-York— How these papers got among the

								>Waddy Thompson</persRef> moved that a Message be sent to the

								<persRef ref="downing-charles">Downing</persRef>, the delegate from

						<p>I intended to have called this morning on <persRef ref="fowler-orson"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler</persRef> to see my mask,
							but was so much belated that I had no time for the visit. H.R.U.S.
							Immediately after the reading of the Journal, a message was received
							from the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> requesting
							permission to withdraw the two obnoxious papers concerning which,
								<persRef ref="hoffman-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hoffman</persRef> had yesterday moved a suspension of the rules for
							him to offer his resolution— The Message says that sensible that those
							extracts were of a character which would if attention had been directed
							to them, have prevented their transmission to the House, the President
							requests permission to withdraw them— With the message there was a
							report rather aukwardly apologetic for the transmission of the
							papers—one was a newspaper. the other a printed slip from another
							Newspaper; with an endorsement in <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury’s</persRef> own hand writing
							directing the Clerk to file it with the papers concerning the
							introduction of paupers— Hoffman was not in his place, and some
							discussion was had what should be done with the Message, and with the
							extracts— It was agreed to call the Reports of Committees, to give time
							for Hoffman to come in— <persRef ref="bouldin-james">Bouldin</persRef>
							Chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia, reported without
							amendment the Bill from the Senate, for continuing conditionally till
							the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July 1840. the Charters of the
							District Banks, and with great earnestness urged its immediate adoption—
								<persRef ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> moved to postpone
							the consideration of the Bill, till next Monday week and was evidently
							opposed to the Bill itself.— Bouldin, <persRef ref="thomas-francis"
								>Thomas</persRef> and <persRef ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef>
							urged the immediate passage of the Bill, and <persRef
								ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef> equally earnest for that
							result, was desirous of striking out one of the conditions prescribed in
							the Bill from the Senate— Bouldin moved the previous question— I had
							been endeavouring to obtain the floor to propose an amendment—a fourth
							condition—that no dividend to Stockholders should be made whenever
							Specie payments are suspended— I asked Bouldin to withdraw his motion
							for the previous question to give me the opportunity to offer this
							amendment but he refused— The previous question was carried, and the
							Bill passed to the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> reading by a vote of
							131. to 41. upon the question <hi rend="italic">when</hi>, the Bill
							should be read the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> time, Petrikin moved
							again Monday week—lost—next Monday—lost—To morrow—lost—This day—and the
							Bill was read the third time— The question being put on its passage, I
							moved it should be recommitted to the Committee on the District of
							Columbia, with Instructions to report my amendment, and asked for the
							yeas and nays which were ordered— <persRef ref="fillmore-millard"
								>Fillmore</persRef> thought an additional clause would be necessary,
							requiring the acceptance by the Banks of the prescribed conditions—
							Bouldin was perfectly willing to adopt both the amendments, but was
							afraid of risking the Bill, back with any amendment to the Senate—he was
							for driving through the Bill <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, and Thomas <hi
								rend="italic">was</hi>
							<pb n="498" type="ms"/>was prompting him to call the previous question
							again, when the hour expired and the orders of the day were called—
							Bouldin moved to suspend the Rules to take the question upon the Bill;
							but I resisted and he failed— Hoffman had now come into the house, and a
							desultory debate followed on the Message from the President relating to
							the two slanderous papers— <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
								>Cambreleng</persRef> had moved that the pauper Committee should be
							discharged from the consideration of them; that they should be taken
							from the files and returned to the President— This was finally carried
							by the Previous Question—after which the Message was laid on the table
							and ordered to be printed, with some desultory censure upon the
							President, and especially upon the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi"
								>Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, and some unsettled enquiry how
							the offensive papers were to be abstracted from the files of the House—
							The remainder of the day was occupied in the consideration of private
							Bills and the question of allowance of interest upon a great number of
							old revolutionary claims, was again earnestly debated— The clause
							allowing interest was finally, on the motion of <persRef
								ref="allen-heman">Heman Allen</persRef> of Vermont, struck out from
							all the Bills. Adjourned after 4— Evening party and supper at <persRef

						<p>Met the Massachusetts delegation in both Houses at 9. this Morning in the
							Chamber of the Committee of foreign Relations; to consult upon what
							shall be done with respect to this North-eastern boundary question—
							There was not even time for a useful interchange of opinion, concerning
							it. In the present state of the Negotiation, there is a proposal from
							the British Government to draw a Conventional line of boundary, or to
							submit the question again to an arbitration—both of which are declined
							by the Legislature of the State of Maine; which is urgent upon the plan
							of making a survey; and has resolved that if it be not made by authority
							of the United States, with or without the concurrence of Great Britain
							before next September, it shall be made by authority of the State alone—
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>, <persRef ref="davis-john4">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> and myself made some
							remarks indicating not an entire uniformity of opinion, as to what is to
							be done— At last it was agreed that the two Senators should be a
							Committee to consult with the <persRef ref="ruggles-john;williams-reuel"
								>Senators</persRef> from the State of Maine; and agree upon a time
							and place for a consultation between the two delegations— Scanty as the
							time for discussion had been, when the Meeting adjourned I found the
							House in Session, and the <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef>
							was calling over the Committees for Reports— The only one of interest
							was by <persRef ref="morris-mathias">Matthias Morris</persRef>, Chairman
							of the Committee on expenditures in the Department of State, which was
							not read but ordered to be printed— The House after passing the Bills
							which had yesterday been engrossed for a third reading went <hi
								rend="italic">into</hi>
							<pb n="499" type="ms"/>into Committee of the whole, <persRef
								ref="mckennan-thomas">Thomas M. T. M’Kennon</persRef> in the Chair,
							upon a great mass of Bills, reported by the Revolutionary and Invalid
							Pension Committees— Two hundred and thirty-six bills were passed through
							the Committee and the House in the course of the day—almost all without
							amendment—a very few with amendments. They were all read once—then by
							their titles and great numbers of them were finally passed by one
							lumping vote.— A Bill granting to <persRef ref="browne-pamela">Pamela
								Brown</persRef>, the widow of <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General
								Jacob Brown</persRef>, five years half-pay under the act of 1802 met
							with considerable opposition— <persRef ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod
								Williams</persRef> a member of the Committee who reported it, moved
							to strike out the enacting clause, upon a harum skarum question whether
							General Brown’s death in 1828. could have been by reason of his wound
							received in 1814.— <persRef ref="aycrigg-john">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Aycrigg</persRef> by a medical opinion gave Sherrod too
							much countenance; but <persRef ref="mallory-francis">Mallory</persRef>
							who said that he too was a Doctor gave his opinion the other way— I said
							that from personal acquaintance, and familiar intercourse with General
							Brown during the last years of his life I had no doubt of the fact—the
							Bill passed by a large majority through the Committee, but Sherrod
							Williams renewed his motion to strike out the enacting clause in the
							house, and the bill was postponed.— While the House was in Session,
								<persRef ref="pontois-edouard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pontois</persRef>, the French Minister, came in, upon the floor,
							behind the Bar, with the <persRef ref="francoisdorleans">Prince de
								Joinville</persRef>, a Son of the French king <persRef
								ref="louis-philippe">Louis Philippe</persRef>— He is an Officer in
							the French Navy, and is ranging round the world for his improvement—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pontois sent <persRef
								ref="duboisdesaligny-jean">Saligny</persRef> to call me from my
							Seat, and with many apologies for the shortness of the notice, invited
							me to dine with him, in company with the Prince this day. The Prince’s
							stay here being so short that he would be obliged to leave the City on
							Monday Morning— He is going to Philadelphia, Pittsburgh—the falls of
							Niagara—New-York, Boston, and Newport, Rhode-Island, where the line of
							Battle-ship, L’Hercule, of 100 guns is to go to take him up, in 15 days
							from this— He arrived in this ship a few days since at Norfolk— And is
							obliged to return to France to be at home in July— I accepted the
							invitation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pontois, whose dinner party
							consisted of the Prince—<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ernoux</persRef>, his aide de Camp, and I suppose, travelling
							companion— <persRef ref="u">Captain Rosamel</persRef>, Son of the
								<persRef ref="rosamel-claude">French Minister</persRef> of Marine,
							and Commander of the Corvette Favorite, sailing with L Hercule— The
							Surgeon of the Prince, and two young Midshipmen, Sons, <persRef ref="u"
								>one</persRef>, of <persRef ref="durantdemareuil-joseph">Monsieur de
								Mareuil</persRef>, heretofore Minister of France here, and the other
							a <persRef ref="u">Las Cases</persRef>, of the <persRef

							Secretary of the Navy—<persRef ref="legare-hugh">Hugh S.
								Legare</persRef>, member of the House from South-Carolina, and
							myself— The Prince is a young man between 19. and 20. of very grave
							appearance, and great simplicity of manners— Tall, slender, with a
							sallow complexion, dark prominent eyes; rather hard of hearing—slow
							enunciation, and a slight stoop of the head, giving him an aukward
							appearance, but probably habitual, from intenseness of attention to hear
							what is said to him. Great composure and gentleness in his manner, and
							French politeness in his deportment. <hi rend="italic">He</hi>
							<pb n="500" type="ms"/>He told me that this was his fifth maritime
							campaign, and that he had now been nine Months absent from France— I sat
							between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pontois and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ernoux, with whom I had a great variety of
							conversation upon Subjects interesting to Frenchmen while the
							Vice-President had not a little with me, across the table. We sat down
							to table between 6. and 7. and I came home about 10. <persRef

						<p>Dissipation always encroaches upon to-morrow— The Supper party of the
							Evening before last, and the Dinner party of yesterday, took large
							tribute from the morning hours of this day, and consequently from the
							punctuality of this Diary— I heard a Stranger this morning at the
							Presbyterian Church, from Isaiah 1.18. “Come now, and let us reason
							together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be
							as white as snow: though they be red like crimson, they shall be as
							wool.[”]— Return visit to <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> after the morning service from <persRef
								ref="dickerson-mahlon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dickerson</persRef> the Secretary of the Navy— <persRef
								ref="campbell-archibald">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Campbell</persRef> dined with us—and he and <persRef
								ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull</persRef> performed the part of
							Choirister’s at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church; the
							organist of which is sick— After dinner, at S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> John’s Church <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef> read Evening prayers,
							with only the second lesson, for the fifth Sunday after Easter, and a
							Stranger preached from John 8.51. “Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a
							man keep my saying, he shall never see death.” There were scarcely
							thirty persons in the House— The neglect of public worship in this City
							is an increasing evil; and the indifference to all religion throughout
							the whole country portends no good. There is in the Clergy of all the
							Christian denominations, a time-serving, cringing subservient morality,
							as wide from the Spirit of the Gospel, as it is from the intrepid
							assertion and vindication of truth— The counterfeit character of a very
							large portion of the Christian ministry, in this Country, is disclosed
							in the dissensions growing up in all the protestant Churches, on the
							subject of Slavery.— The abolitionists assume as the first principle of
							all their movements that Slavery is <hi rend="italic">Sin</hi>— Their
							opponents halting between the alternative of denying directly this
							position, and of admitting the duty binding upon them, to bear testimony
							against it, are prevaricating with their own Consciences, and taxing
							their learning and ingenuity to prove that the Bible sanctions Slavery—
							That <persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef>, <persRef ref="isaac"
								>Isaac</persRef>, and <persRef ref="jacob">Jacob</persRef> were
							Slave-holders, and that <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t.</hi> Paul</persRef> is the apostle of Man-Stealers because
							he sent <persRef ref="onesimus">Onesimus</persRef> back to his master
								<persRef ref="philemon">Philemon</persRef>— These preachers of the
							gospel might just as well call our extermination of the Indians, an
							obedience to divine commands because Jehovah commanded the children of
							Israel to exterminate the Canaanitish Nations. This question of Slavery
							is convulsing the congregational churches in Massachusetts. It is deeply
							agitating the Methodists— It has already completed a Schism in the
							presbyterian Church, two separate bodies of which are now in Session at
							Philadelphia, each pretending to be the general Assembly of the whole
							Church— From all this present evil, may the fountain of all truth draw
							future and transcendent good— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My
								wife</persRef> has not yet sufficiently recovered to leave her
							chamber— With <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef>—Charles and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>, I spent the
							Evening at <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							<hi rend="italic">Frye</hi>
							<pb n="501" type="ms"/>Frye had been exceedingly anxious to see me, and
							had written me a note, which he gave me— It was to ask me to withdraw my
							motion for making it a condition of the continuance of the Charters of
							the District Banks, that they shall make no dividends while their specie
							payments are suspended— He says the proposal is so just that they are
							afraid, if it passes the house, it will defeat the passage of the Bill
							in the Senate— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye, that he might
							set his mind perfectly at ease with regard to my amendment— It would be
							overridden by the previous question, and the Bill would pass as it came
							from the Senate, by a vote of at least three to one— We came home about
							ten O’Clock.</p>

						<p>Morning visit from <persRef ref="jay-john4">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> John Jay</persRef>, son of <persRef ref="jay-william"
								>judge William Jay</persRef> of Bedford—New-York. This young man is
							an only son, but has <persRef
								ref="jay-anna;jay-maria2;jay-sarah2;jay-eliza;jay-augusta">four
								Sisters</persRef> all unmarried—he himself <persRef
								ref="jay-eleanor">was married</persRef> he told me, on his twentieth
							Birth-day— He said he was here on a transient visit, and could not
							forbear to call on me, though without introduction— His father is the
							second Son of <persRef ref="jay-john">John Jay</persRef> the eminent
							Patriot of the Revolution, and has published a memoir of his Life— He
							has also been the President of the American Ant-Slavery Society; and has
							published a pamphlet on the subject of Slavery— I had some conversation
							with this young man upon the same topic, and gave him some opinions
							which I requested him to Communicate to his father— He is a young man of
							very prepossessing appearance, and pleasing deportment. I was belated in
							my attendance at the House. It was the day for offering Resolutions, and
							as the <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> had begun the call of
							the States, with Maine; he had reached Pennsylvania, before I entered
							the House. I was obliged to wait until all the States and Territories
							were gone through, and then to ask leave to offer successively two
							Resolutions— The first, that all the Resolutions of State Legislatures,
							Petitions and Memorials, relating to the annexation of Texas to the
							United States, presented at the late, and present Sessions of Congress,
							and laid on the table, be referred to the Committee of foreign
							Relations, to which the Resolutions of the Legislature of Massachusetts,
							and sundry petitions against the said annexation have already been
							referred— This Resolution passed with only a symptom or two of
							opposition— The next was a call upon the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>President</persRef>, for any correspondence not heretofore
							communicated, with the Government of Texas or with any other Government,
							relating to the annexation of Texas to the United States, and for
							information whether the application from Texas for admission into this
							Union has been withdrawn— The Speaker objected that I had already
							offered one Resolution— I answered that this was upon the same Subject—
							He said the Rule was that no member should offer more than one
							Resolution, or one <hi rend="italic">Series</hi> on the same Subject—
							That I had offered one Resolution, and the Question had been taken upon
							it— I said it was true the Resolutions had been upon two separate
							papers; but that was mere matter of form, and I claimed as my right
							under the rule to offer the second. It happened that during this little
							altercation, there was no captious member who rose to countenance the
							Speaker, who finally said <hi rend="italic">that</hi>
							<pb n="502" type="ms"/>that hearing no objection, he would receive the
							Resolution— By the Rule, it should have lain over one day— But as no
							objection was made, he took the question upon the Resolution, and it
							passed without opposition— There could be no stronger proof of the
							change in the feeling of the House, regarding Texas— <persRef
								ref="hastings-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hastings</persRef> offered the Resolutions of the Legislature of
							Massachusetts against the <persRef ref="patton-john">Patton</persRef>
							gag—and moved that they should be read— They were read; and he moved
							that they should be referred to a select Committee and printed— <persRef
								ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> moved that they should be
							laid on the table, which was carried by yeas and nays 110 to 69.— I then
							moved that they should be printed; but the Speaker said that was not in
							order— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> then presented the
							same Resolutions, and moved that they be printed, which was ordered— The
							Speaker asked Cushing whether he proposed to have them laid on the
							table— Cushing said he did not make that motion. But <persRef
								ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> of Georgia made it, and on the
							table they were laid— A multitude of Resolutions were offered by other
							members, indicative of their peculiar humours, and most of which were
							laid over of course— <persRef ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod
								Williams</persRef>, against a Government Bank; with two or three
							long whereases— He moved a suspension of the rules for immediate
							consideration of his Resolutions—lost by yeas and nays 81 to 84—
								<persRef ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef> moved an
							anti-patronage Resolution; to transfer the appointment of subordinate
							offices, in the judicial and executive departments from the President to
							the Heads of Departments; and to require of them reasons for all
							removals— Haynes offered Resolutions for the distribution of all the
							public Lands to the People of all the States— After the call for
							Resolutions, Petitions were received, of which I had only two— One from
							Pennsylvania, Bradford County, praying for the expulsion of all members
							criminally concerned in the duel—referred to the Committee of the whole
							on the anti-duelling Bill— I asked when the Chairman of the duel
							Committee intended to call up that Bill—no answer— <persRef
								ref="toucey-isaac">Toucey</persRef> was not in his Seat— The other
							was from Lockport in New-York, in behalf of the Cherokees— Laid on the

							on the Union, <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> in the

								Fowler</persRef> had called at the House yesterday, and requested me
							to come this morning and have my eyes opened; that is, the eyes of my
							bust. I went accordingly, and an Englishman named <persRef
								ref="basham-frederick">Basham</persRef>, opened one of the eyes,
							requesting me to call again to-morrow morning to open the other— I found
								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> there,
							undergoing the same operation which I had gone through— <persRef
								ref="white-hugh">Judge Hugh Lawson White</persRef>, Senator from the
							State of Tennessee, and late Candidate for the Presidency afterwards
							came in, and was stretched on the table when I came out. <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">H. A. Wise</persRef> was with him— <persRef
								ref="parris-virgil">Virgil Delphini Parris</persRef>—a member from
							the State of Maine, in the place of <persRef ref="carter-timothy"
								>Timothy J. Carter</persRef> was qualified and took his Seat—
								<persRef ref="boon-ratliff">Boon</persRef> moved suspension of the
							Rules to take up his Resolution, fixing the day of adjournment; but the
							House refused— <hi rend="italic">Craig</hi>
							<pb n="503" type="ms"/><persRef ref="craig-robert">Craig</persRef>,
							Chairman of the Committee of Revolutionary claims, reported a
							Resolution, fixing next Saturday for the consideration of Bills reported
							by that Committee; which after being loaded with sundry others was
							adopted— <persRef ref="bouldin-james">Bouldin</persRef> called up the
							Bill, continuing for two years from the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							of July, the Charters of the District Banks— The yeas and nays had been
							ordered upon my proposed amendment to prohibit the making of any
							dividend, while specie payments shall be suspended— But <persRef
								ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> moved another amendment,
							excluding members of Congress and all Officers of the two Houses from
							being Directors of any of the Banks— <persRef ref="thomas-francis"
								>Thomas</persRef> said the members were ready to vote on the Bill,
							and moved the previous question, which he withdrew on <persRef
								ref="mercer-charles">Mercer’s</persRef> promise to renew it.—
							Mercer’s wise and honest observation, for which he thus bargained for
							the exclusive freedom of Speech was that my amendment was perfectly just
							and proper, but that these Charters were to be continued only for two
							years— So dishonesty only for two years reconciled M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Mercer to moving the Previous Question,
							and it was carried; and the bill was passed by yeas and nays 130 to 46—
							I had told <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef>, it would be so— There is no more desperate
							undertaking than that of controuling the Bank influence, and it is
							irredeemably and vitally dishonest— Frank Thomas, himself by Nature
							Education and habit an exceeding knave, has been year after year,
							railing at the District Banks, and now plays the game of knavery into
							their hands— This Bill is bristled with three conditions, of which they
							complain, but of no avail— They will accept and break them with equal
							indifference— The North eastern boundary Message then came up, <persRef
								ref="evans-george2">Evans</persRef> finished his Speech— He was
							followed by <persRef ref="fairfield-john">Fairfield</persRef>, and he by
								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> then moved the
							Previous Question, but withdrew it upon <persRef ref="howard-benjamin"
								>Howard’s</persRef> promise to renew it: which he did after making a
							Speech— There was no Quorum: and after refusing a call of the House,
							moved by Thomas, and much foolery about what the main question was; and
							yeas and nays 89 to 61. that it should be taken, Evans disconcerted the
							movement by a motion to lay the whole subject on the table, which was
							carried— Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, Howard in the
							Chair, on the six or seven Million Indian Appropriation Bill— The
							question was upon an amendment proposed by <persRef ref="bell-john"
								>Bell</persRef>, that two Millions of the sums appropriated by the
							Bill, may be allowed as additional to the Cherokees, to make them go
							peaceably and quietly to their new homes west of the Mississippi—
								<persRef ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> finished his Speech
							commenced yesterday— <persRef ref="harlan-james">Harlan</persRef> took
							the floor and moved that the Committee should rise—lost 58 to 67— Harlan
							spoke for about two hours, about once in each half hour yielding to a
							motion for the Committee to rise, rejected without a Quorum, which
							compelled the Committee to rise and report the fact to the House then a
							motion to adjourn; taken by yeas and nays, with a bare quorum, rejected
							by yeas and nays; a return in to Committee and no Quorum— The first time
							that the Committee rose and reported that they had no Quorum, I moved a
							call of the House, and asked for the yeas and nays—about Sunset— Call
							refused 47 to 99. I afterwards declined voting, and said I hoped others
							who wished to adjourn to do the same, and by leaving the majority
							without a Quorum, compel them to adjourn or to call the House. There was
							a majority, <hi rend="italic">about</hi>
							<pb n="504" type="ms"/>about 75 in number, the administration Bashaws
							and Helots, who would neither call the House, nor adjourn and a minority
							from 45 to 50. who suffered themselves for four hours to be made the
							tools of this dragooning majority by voting to make a quorum, instead of
							declining or refusing to vote which would have forced the majority to do
							their duty—which was either to call the House or to adjourn there was
							always a sufficient number of the minority who would omit to vote in the
							Committee, where no record of names appears, but had not the courage to
							withhold their answers when the yeas and nays were called in the House—
							This round of over bearing insolence and of tame submission, and of low
							skulking was carried on full four hours while Harlan and after him
								<persRef ref="holsey-hopkins">Holsey</persRef> of Georgia, were
							bawling at the intervals to empty armed Chairs— Five times the Committee
							rose and reported themselves without a Quorum—five times the House
							refused to adjourn by majorities of a quorum which they could not have
							made, but by the servile aid of the minority in voting at all. More than
							one hundred members were absent without leave, and the hack majority in
							the House, would neither call them to their duty in the House—nor
							release the minority from their forced attendance— When after they
							refused at my motion to call the House, I gave notice that I would no
							longer vote, and said I hoped others would do the same <persRef
								ref="cushman-samuel">Cushman</persRef> and Boon threatened a motion
							to expel me, and I called upon them to try their hands— They were after
							all obliged to give up the point— About ten O’Clock, upon Wise’s
							intimating that he proposed to make another long Speech upon the Bill,
							the Committee rose, and the House adjourned. It was near eleven when I
							reached home.</p>

								W. S. Smith</persRef> were here yesterday and took leave of them— I

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler’s</persRef>; but <persRef
								ref="basham-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="prentiss-seargent">Sergeant S. Prentiss</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="word-thomas">Henry J. Word</persRef> were sworn and
							took their Seats as Representatives of the People of the State of

								>Speaker’s</persRef> chair, Prentiss for himself and his Colleague
							addressed the Speaker, and said they were ready to be sworn; but claimed
							their Seats by virtue of their election last November; conformably to
							the Law of the State, and not by the more recent election which they
							held to be unconstitutional— The Speaker made no answer, but
							administered the Oath— A joint Resolution was received from the Senate
							passed by them yesterday, rescinding in effect the Specie Circular of
							11. July 1836— <persRef ref="boon-ratliff">Boon</persRef> who has made
							himself exceedingly officious upon this subject moved a suspension of

							moved the previous question again— Carried and the Resolution passed 154
							to 29— <persRef ref="lyon-francis">Lyon</persRef> of Alabama came in
							afterwards and asked leave to have his vote recorded for the Resolution,
							but was refused— <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> at
							first protested against the interruption of the order of business to
							take up the Resolution, but voted for it both at the second reading, and
							the passage— The Resolution had been adopted in the Senate by a vote of
							34 to 9. and <persRef ref="wright-silas">Silas Wright</persRef> the
							financier of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Van Buren</persRef> did not vote upon it at all— The
							Indian hostility Bill followed in Committee of the whole on the Union,
								<persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> in the chair.
								<persRef ref="holsey-hopkins">Holsey</persRef> of Georgia, finished
							his speech commenced last evening; chiefly a heavy, dull invective
							against me and my administration, and a glorification of Georgia, for
							having set me at defiance— Holsey affects to be a systematic lawyer—he
							said to day, referring to the decision of the Supreme Court of the
							United States against the Legislative Robbery by Georgia of the Indian
							Lands, which decision <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>
							prevented from being executed— Holsey said that <hi rend="italic"
								>Law</hi>, consisted of the co-operating action of three departments
							of Government The Legislative, the Judicial and the Executive— That
							wherever the concurrence of either of those Departments was wanting,
							there was no Law— That in the case alluded to there was against Georgia
							the concurrence only of the Legislative and the Judiciary, and so long
							as the Executive was on the side of Georgia, she would laugh to scorn
							the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States— And such is the
							composition of the House of Representatives of the United States, that
							discourse like this passes for argument— This same Holsey said on a
							former day that there were two kinds of Justice— Moral Justice and
							Political Justice— That the People of Georgia were at all times willing
							to dispense Political Justice, but would never suffer that <hi
								rend="italic">moral</hi> Justice should be secured to them— And this
							like the laughing to scorn of the decision of the Supreme Court of the
							United States, he said boastfully, to the honour and glory of the People
							of Georgia— Holseys Laws of Justice and of Nations, stung <persRef
								ref="naylor-charles">Naylor</persRef>, who followed him with a
							vehement denunciation of Georgia, and especially of that ne plus ultra
							of rascality the Treaty, so called of New Echota of December 1835 Naylor
							proved by numerous references to the Documents, the nefarious villainy
							of that whole transaction—but the Senate of the United States by the
							vote of two-thirds of the Senators present, advised and consented to its
							ratification— The frauds were all then exposed— But Holsey’s principle
							is the practical Law of the Land—Moral Justice—laudatur et alget. He was
							followed by <persRef ref="dawson-william">Dawson</persRef>, a far more
							intelligent and plausible man, who said he was considered in Georgia, as
							belonging to what was called the Indian party— He had always been the
							friend of the Indians, and was for doing them full Justice— But he
							attempted to justify the conduct of Georgia, by the principles of my
							Plymouth Oration, and by the <hi rend="italic">practice</hi>
							<pb n="506" type="ms"/>practice of all the older States— Dawson, was
							followed by <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> of Tennessee, who
							began a long Speech, as the sun was setting—but about 8 O’Clock, from
							mere weariness the Committee rose, and the House adjourned— I got home
							about nine— There is a panic rumour abroad, artificially gotten up; of
							Slave insurgency, amounting to nothing.</p>

						<p>I attended at 9 this morning at the chamber of the Committee of
							Manufactures, but only one other member, <persRef ref="slade-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Slade</persRef> attended, and we
							could do nothing.— H.R.U.S. A Resolution offered by <persRef
								ref="loomis-arphaxed">Arphaxad Loomis</persRef> on the 19<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March was adopted— A call upon the
								<persRef ref="kendall-amos">Postmaster General</persRef> for
							information of the account of postages received; and opinions concerning
							the reduction of postages.— Among the other miscellaneous business
							transacted was a call on the <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of
								War</persRef>, for Surveys of the Northern Lakes, which after some
							discussion was laid aside till to-morrow— Committee of the whole on the
							Union, <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> in the Chair,
							upon the Indian hostility Bill— <persRef ref="bell-john"
								>Bell’s</persRef> amendment was the proper subject for debate— It
							was to authorize the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef>
							to apply two Millions of the money appropriated by the Bill, to coaxing
							the Cherokees from their homes, instead of paying with it, white
							Soldiers, for driving them off at the point of the bayonet. But Bell
							upon this slender basis went into a general censorial review of all the
							measures of the late administration; and a vindication of himself
							against a systematic course of Slander pursued by <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>, and his toad-eaters, to run
							him down especially in his own State of Tennessee— Bell was about four
							hours upon his feet this day; after having discoursed about two hours on
							the subject yesterday— I had forgotten to mention a fiery speech
							yesterday, by <persRef ref="chapman-reuben">Chapman</persRef> of
							Alabama, immediately succeeding that of <persRef ref="naylor-charles"
								>Naylor</persRef>, and intended to answer it— Bell was this day
							followed by <persRef ref="everett-horace">Horace Everett</persRef>, who
							gave only the heads of a Speech of four hours, which he requested the
							Committee to consider as delivered by him; but from the hearing of which
							he would relieve the house and publish it in the Newspapers— Everett is
							a member of the Committee of Indian Affairs, and had prepared a very
							elaborate Speech, to prove the baseness, fraud and perfidy of the
							pretended New Echota Treaty of the <persRef ref="schermerhorn-john"
								>Reverend Caitiff Schermerhorn</persRef>— Things proved usque ad
							nauseam two years ago—reproved four or five times in the course of this
							debate, and by inevitable implication admitted in the recent Message,
							with the ultimatum from the Secretary of War, to the Cherokee Delegation
							now here— This message and ultimatum have indeed rendered all discussion
							upon the Schermerhorn counterfeit, superfluous— But Everett’s Speech was
							all prepared; and although he was willing to release the house from
							hearing it, he was not willing to lose it altogether— Next came <persRef
								ref="crary-isaac">Crary</persRef> of Michigan, who appeared as if he
							felt bound to make one Speech in the Session to prove his fealty to the
							administration, and that it might as well be upon this as upon any other
							question. <persRef ref="turney-hopkins">Turney</persRef> of Tennessee
							followed—a Heroite; and of course a virulent antagonist to Bell— He
							mumbles his words that it is impossible to hear him, without a degree of
							attention which it is not <hi rend="italic">much</hi>
							<pb n="507" type="ms"/>much more practicable to bestow— There was not
							half a Quorum present, and of them about one half were slumbering in
							their Seats; and the other half yawning over Newspapers— Here and there
							a strolling wanderer behind the bar was pacing to and fro to keep up the
							circulation of the blood— Two or three Settees each with a member
							stretched out his whole length, occuping it all, sound asleep— And
							groups of two or three, seated before each open window, gasping in idle
							conversation for fresh air— About 8 O’Clock Turney made a pause—a Motion
							was made for the Committee to rise; and <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> obtained an order to
							make the Bill the special order of the day for to-morrow, from 11.
							O’Clock— It was again between nine and ten, when I got home, after which
