						<p>On rising this morning I found it bitter cold— The moon nearly full was

							and the Sun at 6:56.— I put my thermometer out in the Seminary, and a

							I have ever known it in this climate so early as this in the Season. The

						<p>Another fall of Snow in the Night—and then rain— Then cleared up— When I
							rose I found Venus and Arcturus upwards of an hour risen— A hazy cloud
							at the Southeastern horizon intercepted the sight of Mercury at his
							rise, and before he emerged from it the twilight had rendered him
							invisible— The Sun was five minutes risen before I saw him— My
							thermometer in the open air was at 36— I read in <persRef

							Micrometer § 34 <persRef ref="ramsden-jesse">Ramsdens’s</persRef>
							Catoptric Micrometer; and § 35 <persRef ref="maskelyne-nevil">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Maskelyne’s</persRef> Prismatic
							Micrometer— And this reading led me to consult several Articles in
								<persRef ref="rees-abraham">Rees’s</persRef> Encyclopaedia,
							particularly the Theodolite, and the morning melted away and was gone.—
							I receive almost every day several Letters which I find no time to
							answer— Visit this afternoon from <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt</persRef>, who came to consult me
							concerning a disposition of the Choir of Singers of the parish, to lay
							aside the Psalm and Hymn book, used at the Sunday worship, and to
							substitute another in its place. I enquired what collection they
							proposed to take— That was not yet determined.— What was the motive for
							the change— The hymns now in use were not well adapted to the modern
							music— The whole concern resolves itself into a thirst for change, and
							novelty.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt said that <persRef
								ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frothingham’s</persRef> Society in Boston, and this Church at
							Quincy, were the only Religious Societies which still adhere to the
							collection made by <persRef ref="belknap-jeremy">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Belknap</persRef>—first introduced in<space/>and
							revised by <persRef ref="channing-william">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Channing</persRef> in<space/>It is an excellent
							collection, and will not be supplanted by a better one— There are
							several more recent compilations used in the congregational churches at
							Boston; and one made by <persRef ref="greenwood-francis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenwood</persRef> for the Stone
							Chapel Church at Boston, with Episcopalian forms and an unitarian creed.
							I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt, that whatever the Society
							here might chuse to do in the case should have my ready acquiescence—
							That I was not personally given to change, and thought little if any
							improvement was to be expected from discarding D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Belknap, and taking up another— That I did not well see how
							the music could be affected by it as there are not more than five or six
							measures in the whole book, and the <hi rend="italic">same</hi>
							<pb n="643" type="ms"/>same tune which serves for one psalm or hymn is
							equally adaptable to 50— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunt did not
							say, but I had a surmise that he wished to make a collection himself, to
							be used by the parish here— He inquired if I had not made a version of
							the Psalms— I said I had, and if I could find the manuscript would shew
							it to him.— He borrowed the collection given me by <persRef

							from the Wisdom of Solomon—1.6.—“For Wisdom, is a loving Spirit.”— The
							first instance that I ever knew of a text taken by a Protestant
							preacher, from the Apocrypha— The Sermon I thought excellent— He
							distinguished three kinds of Wisdom—that from above—the leading
							principle of which is benevolence— Worldly wisdom, the ruling
							characteristic of which is selfishness; and wisdom from the pit, under
							the guidance of malice— Of these, the only true Wisdom is that from
							Heaven; selfishness, being more properly the parent of Artifice and
							cunning; and the infernal wisdom operating by fraud and deceit— The
							afternoon discourse was from Titus 2.11. For the grace of God, that
							bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all men 12 teaching us, that,
							denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live soberly,
							righteously, and godly, in this present world— <persRef

								ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef>, upon the glory of the
							Christian; the glory of the cross—preached on the Sunday before

							refracting prism of rock crystal, or of a glass wedge—and §. 39. The

							alphabetical List of 123. Observatories with columns marking their
							places— Latitudes Longitudes in Time— Longitudes in Arc. Astronomers
							attached to them, and Stations— But fifty of them are without name of
							any Astronomer, and of course without constant observers.— There are
							however 73. with names of Astronomers; though I suppose a large
							proportion of them are rather nominal than real Observatories. There is
							one set down for Philadelphia.</p>

							that of <persRef key="adams-john">my fathers</persRef> bequest, and the
							Academy contemplated by him might be immediately carried into effect.—
							In the course of the conversation, it was apparent, that the Committee
							apprehend a difficulty in prevailing upon the Town to undertake the
							expence of a high School, though he said that with a population of 3000
							the Law expressly provided that they should— They said that <persRef
								ref="whitney-john2">Captain John Whitney</persRef>, the chairman of

							in this opinion— I said I had gone upon the assumption <hi rend="italic"

							<pb n="646" type="ms"/>that the Town was required by Law to keep a high
							school. On that supposition I supposed it must be brought by the School

							would instruct the Committee to prepare estimates of the expense, and a
							plan for the establishment of the School. Then would be the time for
							conferring with the Trustees of my father’s fund— A man by the name of
								<persRef ref="adams-john16">John H. Adams</persRef> came with a

						<p>Cloudy, starless morning— I read <persRef ref="pearson-william"
								>Pearson</persRef> §48 on the reading Microscope— 49. On the
							plumbline. 50. On the Spirit-level and 51. On Artificial Horizons— These
							are all inventions for improving and perfecting the great instrument of
							astronomical observation, the Telescope.— The practical usefulness of
							this Science seems confined to Navigators, on the Ocean; and they
							generally know little more of it than to take the Altitude, of the Sun
							upon the Meridian, and with the help of tables in the Nautical Almanac,
							to work out their Longitude.— To me, the observation of the Sun, Moon
							and Stars has been for a great portion of my life a pleasure of
							gratified curiosity; of ever returning wonder, and of reverence for the
							creator and mover of these unnumbered worlds— There is something of
							awful enjoyment, in observing the rising and setting of the Sun— That
							flashing beam of his first appearance upon the horizon. That sinking of
							the last ray beneath it—that perpetual revolution of the great and
							little bear round the Pole—that rising of the whole Constellation of
							Orion from the horizontal to the perpendicular position—and his ride
							through the Heavens with his belt, his nebulous sword, and his four
							corner stars of the first magnitude, are sources of delight to me which
							never tire. <hi rend="italic">Even</hi>
							<pb n="648" type="ms"/>Even the optical delusion, by which the motion of
							the Earth from West to East, appears to the eye as the movement of the
							whole firmament from East to West, swells the conception of magnificence
							to the incomprehensible infinite— There is indeed intermingled with all
							this a painful sensation of desire to know more of this stupendous
							system, of sorrow—in reflecting how little we ever can know of it, and
							of almost desponding hope that we may know more of it hereafter— While
							we were at breakfast there came on a heavy shower and gale, which
							continued in Squalls in quick succession through the whole day— At 2.
							O’Clock I rode with <persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirke</persRef> to the
							Mount Wollaston Farm, where the Fence-viewers, <persRef
								ref="spear-lemuel">Lemuel Spear</persRef>,<space/><persRef ref="u"
								>Silvester</persRef>, and<space/>met to survey the ground where
								<persRef ref="french-benjamin2">B. V. French</persRef> and other
							proprietors of the Salt-marsh adjoining upon my upland had summoned me
							to make a partition fence— Neither French himself the instigator of the
							whole proceeding, nor <persRef ref="bass-lewis">Lewis Bass</persRef> one
							of the signers of the complaint came there at all.<space/><persRef
								ref="hollis-caleb">Hollis</persRef><space/><persRef
								ref="bracket-lemuel">Brackett</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wild-pearson">Pearson Wild</persRef> came, but neither of them
							had his Deed; nor could either of them point out where the partition
							fence should run— There never has been a fence there— They said their
							Deeds bounded them by the upland; but the line between the upland and
							the meadow is altogether undefined, and they could not point it out—
							Hollis attempted to encroach by trickery, and pretended I had agreed to
							leave it to the Fence viewers. I told him I should leave it to them; not
							as a reference; but to decide according to Law— Bracket, stuck down a
							stake about 12 feet on the upland which I only said I thought an
							encroachment— The fence viewers refused to do any thing without the
							Deeds, and I came home in a hard squall of wind, with a torrent of rain—
								<persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> paid me a
							balance for the parish tax on the Mount Wollaston farm for the years
							1836–7–8— Dined between 4 and 5 O’Clock— <persRef ref="green-john3">John
								A. Green</persRef> brought me a proof slip of my answer to the
							Committee of the Whig Convention at Halifax which nominated me for
							re-election to Congress— They published my answer in the Old Colony
							Memorial at Plymouth, whence it has been republished in a Hingham
							Patriot extra. Green is also to republish it in the next Quincy
							Patriot.— The slip had only a part of the answer.— Green told me that
							the Administration democrats of this District, were to vote for <persRef
								ref="jackson-william3">William Morton Jackson</persRef> of Plymouth,
							a warm abolitionist, against me.— They had made no nomination, but would
							act in secret concert together.— Their choice of an abolitionist to
							support the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef>
							Administration is a specimen of electioneering honesty— I opened the

						<p>The rain had scarcely ceased when I rose having been awaked by the

							thermometer was at 67. but the moisture of the atmosphere was streaming
							down the glass windows of the chamber; I made a small fire and sat down
							to write for about three hours— Then read <persRef ref="pearson-william"

							<pb n="649" type="ms"/>La Caille’s methods of observing. and §. 53 on

							first establishment of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, in August
							1676, founded by <persRef ref="moore-jonas">Sir Jonas Moor</persRef>,
							and of which Flamsteed was the first Astronomer— The Historical account
							of Flamsteed’s labours, is interesting, and leads to enquiries which I
							would gladly pursue— His Historia Celestis and his Catalogue of British
							Stars, are necessary Articles for a good observatory— His first
							amanuensis was <persRef ref="stafford-john">J. Stafford</persRef>, and
							after his death, in May 1688, <persRef ref="sharp-abraham">Abraham
								Sharp</persRef>, a skilful mechanic was his assistant— Flamsteed

							age; but who lived till 1742— Here the notices stop; but Halley was

							discoverer of the aberration of light and of the nutation of the pole of
							the Earth— He died the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July 1761.
							at the age of 70—and was succeeded by <persRef ref="maskelyne-nevil"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maskelyne</persRef>—but for the
							sequel of this History I would enquire further— La Cailles observations
							were made shortly before the middle of the last century, at the Cape of
							Good Hope— The registers of both these Astronomers were kept in the
							Latin language— The transit-Clock, is the preliminary to the description
							of the transit instrument— I had a visit to take leave from <persRef
								ref="whitney-augustus">Augustus Whitney</persRef>, who is preaching
							at Dedham in the place of <persRef ref="lamson-alvan">D<hi

							succession of flooding rains and sharp frosts for the last month has
							almost totally disappointed my plantations for the present year.— I
							wrote three short and indispensable Letters— Charles brought out an
							Atlas Newspaper extra with intelligence of the result of the elections
							in the City of New-York on the first three days of this week— The whigs
							to their extasy of joy have succeeded, and <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="moore-ely">Ely Moore</persRef> have received their dismission—
							The returns from the State are yet to be received— In the evening I

								<persRef ref="latourmaubourg-marie">Latour Maubourg</persRef>, on

							<pb n="650" type="ms"/>work— While packing up for my departure, I had a

									>Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Governor Phillips</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="channing-william2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Channing’s Son</persRef>— They were here nearly two hours, and I had
							a long conversation with them upon Slavery and Anti-Slavery; abolition
							Societies and Slave-holding policy.— Doctor Channing asked my opinions,
							upon two points— One the present test question of the abolitionists—the
							immediate abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia and the
							territory of Florida; and the other whether in the event of the adoption
							of those measures the Southern States would secede from the Union— I
							said first, that to make a test question upon the <hi rend="italic"
								>immediate</hi> abolition was absurd and had something captious in
							it, because it was notoriously impracticable— There is in the present
							House of Representatives of nearly two to one opposed to the
							consideration or discussion of the subject; and if the proposition
							should be made they would refuse to consider it— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Phillips said he wished I would take some method of
							publishing this opinion— I told him of the Letter I wrote to <persRef
								ref="kirkland-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> C. P.
								Kirkland</persRef>, and said I should probably take some occasion to
							express similar opinions at the approaching Session of Congress— But
							that my opinions will have no influence upon the abolitionists; who have
							already given me repeated warnings that they will desert and oppose me,
							if I do not come over to <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, in the creed of
								<hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> abolition— I said, it was necessary
							to consider the Spirit of abolitionism, as a fact as well as a theory—
							As a phenomenon to be studied; and over which no individual can have
							much controul— As to the second question, I did not believe that the
							South would dissolve the Union, if Slavery should be abolished in the
							District of Columbia and in Florida— South Carolina might perhaps
							secede, but she could not carry the South with her— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Channing appeared to entertain great
							apprehensions for the Union and deep concern at the violence of the
							abolition Spirit— We had also some conversation upon the currency, Bank
							and Subtreasury questions.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Phillips
							expressed himself strongly averse to a National Bank— I said I thought a
							National Bank, indispensable for the safe collection and disbursement of
							the revenue, and if I had the power, that is if I could prevail upon
							Congress and the People to be of the same opinion, I would establish one
							to-morrow. But now there is a prejudice against it in the opinions of a
							large portion of the People throughout the Union— It is a bone of party
							contention, and therefore not now expedient— Nor should I have the same
							confidence in a National bank, to furnish a sound currency to regulate
							exchanges, and to check the over-issues of all the State Banks as did
							the two former Banks of the United States each for twenty years.— The
							main difficulty would now be to make up a Capital, for a National Bank;
							four fifths of the Capital of the last Bank having consisted of public
							securities, bearing an interest of 6. per cent, to which the faith of
							the Nation was pledged, and which now no longer exist— I promised to <hi

							Channing in Boston, before my departure, for Washington— <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> dined with us,
							and immediately after dinner, I came with <persRef ref="smith-louisa"
								>Louisa C. Smith</persRef> into Boston— She stop’d at <persRef
								ref="foster-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James H.
								Foster’s</persRef> in Bedford Street, and I alighted at <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my Son’s</persRef> House, N. 3. Hancock Avenue—
							The road was hard frozen, and rough, and the weather cold as mid-winter—
							Sent <persRef ref="kirk-john">Kirk</persRef> who had brought us in,
							immediately back to Quincy with the Carriage and Horses— I was stiffened
							with cold— Charles immediately told me that <persRef
								ref="fletcher-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fletcher</persRef> and two other Gentlemen had been here to invite
							me to attend the whig Caucus at Faneuil Hall, at 7. O’Clock this
							Evening, and to address the Meeting— I thought there would be an
							impropriety in this— The Gentlemen had said they would call again at 6.
							O’Clock; and to avoid a discussion with them, and the baldness of a flat
							refusal, I went and took tea, and spent the early part of the evening
							with my old friend <persRef ref="hall-joseph">Joseph Hall</persRef>, now
							in the 78<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year of his age— <persRef
								ref="hall-joseph5;hall-ellis">His two sons</persRef>, and his Sister
							Elizabeth who lives with him were there— He takes no further interest in
							public affairs; but loves to remember the political struggles in which
							he took part in days of yore.— On returning to Charles’s house between 8
							and 9 I found that <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> P. C. Brooks</persRef> had called to see me, and that
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher, and two companions had
							returned at 6. O’Clock to repeat the invitation of my attendance this
							Evening at the whig Caucus, in Faneuil Hall—upon being informed that I
							had gone out they enquired where I could be found— Charles said he did
							not know; but that to be candid he believed I had some objection to
							attending the Caucus: upon which they desisted— The impropriety of my
							appearance at the Caucus would have been aggravated by the fact that the
							whig party itself is convulsed with a foolish feud about a license law
							prohibiting the sale of spirituous liquors in quantities less than 15
							gallons at a time—</p>

								ref="halley-edmond">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Halley</persRef>
							first introduced its use, about 1750 at the Greenwich observatory, since
							which it has been used generally superseding the former method of
							ascertain the transit, by measuring correspondent altitudes— I attended

								ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>

							his text was Isaiah 33.9. “The earth mourneth and languisheth; Lebanon
							is ashamed and hewn down; Sharon is like a wilderness: and Bashan and
							Carmel shake off their fruits[”]— The discourse considered this as
							descriptive of the fall of the leaf and of the year: and then
							illustrated this change of the Season, by <hi rend="italic"
								>analogical</hi>
							<pb n="652" type="ms"/>analogical similitudes to the decline and

							were admitted at the same Meeting as members of the Φ.B.K. Society, with
							the fifty-two years of his life and mine which have since passed away,
							and felt with double power the melancholy musings of his mind which
							inspired and pictured out this discourse— The comparison of human life
							to the annual vegetation and decay of the deciduous leaves of trees is
							as old as <persRef ref="homer">Homer’s</persRef> Iliad, and the Sermon was an expansive commentary upon
							the lines of Homer; better adapted to them, than to the verse from the

							upon the subject of the abolition of Slavery.— The Doctor was heretofore
							an idol of the party now calling themselves whigs, has become very
							obnoxious to them— They had almost worshiped him as a Saint— They now
							call him a Jacobin.— He a deeply sensitive to this change in his worldly
							fame, and exceedingly fearful that the abolition cause will go to ruin,
							or that the abolitionists will stir up an insurrection of Slaves, and
							lead to a dissolution of the Union— In his youth he resided sometime in
							Virginia and is well acquainted with the character of the planters in
							that State, which he thinks has undergone a great and remarkable change
							since he lived there; that is, within the last forty years. He was then
							struck with the great, and unbounded security in which they lived in the
							midst of their Slaves and surrounded by them, and nightly at their mercy
							for their lives— They were also then a people careless of property,
							improvident and thriftless, and generally wasting their estates in
							expenses beyond their means— He thought them now at least as economical,
							thrifty and parsimonious as the people of the North. He spoke of the
							family in which he lived, the heads of which had been at one period
							while he was there been absent sometime from home, leaving him in charge
							of the domestic establishment— And there was then one Slave who slept
							not in the house himself, but came regularly every evening and locked
							him in for the night and carried away the key.— Much of this security
							was owing to the fact that among the household Slaves there was almost
							always one or more profoundly attached to their masters, and if ever any
							project of insubordination or disorder was formed among the
							field-Slaves, the House Servants always, disclosed it to their Masters—
							The Doctor said there were <hi rend="italic">now</hi>
							<pb n="653" type="ms"/>now at the South many women, inclined to favour
							the abolition of Slavery— That in the course of the last Summer, he had
							travelled in company with a Lady of Baltimore, who told him that she was
							herself an abolitionist, and that multitudes of Southern women were so
							at their hearts— But he recurred continually to the fear, that the
							Southern Slave-holders would dissolve the Union— Said he had heard it
							had been remarked by <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing</persRef> that there was a
							growing coldness, on the part of the Southern members towards those of
							the North; and asked me how the Southern members treated me— I said they
							all treated me as gentlemen, and most of them with kindness and
							courtesy— That M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing had been desirous
							of a very intimate personal intercourse with the Southern members, and
							perhaps had seen some change in their deportment towards him— I had
							thought it apparent that they generally held in contempt the Northern
							members who truckled to them, such as <persRef ref="randolph-john">John
								Randolph</persRef> had nicknamed dough-faces— But there was so
							marked a difference between the manners of the South and of the North,
							that their members could never be very intimate personally together— The
							Doctor appeared to entertain a great distrust of the political action of
							the abolitionists; and feared they would ruin their own cause and its
							friends— He asked me to write to him which I promised to do.— I met at
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dexter’s, her Son <persRef
								ref="dexter-franklin">Franklin Dexter’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="dexter-catherine2">wife</persRef>— I went with <persRef

							and saw the Somnambula, with a very amusing afterpiece, call truth, or a
							glass too much.— In the Opera the part of Amina was performed by
								<persRef ref="shirreff-jane">Miss Shirreff</persRef>—Elvino by
								<persRef ref="wilson-john10">Wilson</persRef>, Count Rodolpho by
								<persRef ref="seguin-arthur">Seguin</persRef>— The performance was

						<p>When we came out last evening before 11. from the Tremont Theatre, there
							was a bright Northern light and, it was the anniversary of the day
							renowned for its morning shower of luminous meteors in 1833. This
							morning the moon was in close conjunction with the Planet which I have
								be<unclear>en</unclear> since the beginning of last month taking for
							Venus, but which proves to be Jupiter; while that which I have been
							taking for Mercury, and which so suddenly has disappeared since last
							Tuesday is Venus.— The stars in such near conjunction the first days of
							last month were Jupiter and Venus— Mercury was then very near them both,
							but I saw him only one morning, and then without knowing him. The
							Almanack gives 3:15 as the time of the Moon’s rising this morning, and
							as the planet rose within 5 minutes of the same time it is evidently
							receding from the Sun, while Venus is to become the Evening star on the
								20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of next Month— Jupiter became
							morning Star on the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of September.— The
							conjunction of the 3. Planets was about the 3<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> of October. <hi rend="italic">Immediately</hi>
							<pb n="654" type="ms"/>Immediately after breakfast, I went out to Quincy
							with <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, and stayed about
							two hours there— A man named <persRef ref="u">Sears</persRef>, brought
							me a subscription book, for the new whig Magazine and review to be
							edited by <persRef ref="brent-henry">Henry L. Brent</persRef>, at
							Washington. He said he had been to <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Webster</persRef>, who advised him to
							come to me to ascertain whether I had engaged to write for this
							periodical, as the editor of the prospectus had affirmed; and whether I
							would subscribe for it— I told him the Editor had written to me, to
							request me to write for the work; but I had made no engagement so to do,
							and I would determine whether to subscribe for it or not; after reaching
							Washington— A <persRef ref="drew-joshua">Captain Joshua Drew</persRef>
							of Duxbury, brought me a Letter from <persRef ref="weston-gershom">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gershom B. Weston</persRef>— Captain
							Drew was Master of a vessel sailing between New-Orleans and Liverpool
							and on arriving at New-Orleans lately had been required to pay 253
							dollars foreign tonnage, because the men of his crew did not answer to
							the names on his shipping paper— The reason he said was that he had been
							obliged to ship a new crew at the very moment before he sailed; and had
							not had time to change the names—but he had two affidavits from Officers
							of the Custom house at New-Orleans—(not the Collector) that the men of
							his crew, all excepting two, (were Americans) and a certificate from the
							Consul at Liverpool, <persRef ref="ogden-francis">Ogden</persRef>, that
							there had been no trouble about these Seamen— Captain Drew told me, what
							did not appear upon the papers, that these men were free blacks— And
							that the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> had sent back his petition to have the foreign
							duties refunded, with the answer that the application must be to
							Congress— I told Captain Drew that if he would have his Petition made
							out in duplicates, to the two Houses, I would present the one to the
							House, and move its reference to a Committee; but I thought they would
							require, besides his papers attesting that they were all but two
							Americans, proof of the name of each man, and that he was an American—
							He said he could not procure this proof, because he knew not where the
							men now were— I said I would nevertheless present his petition, and do
							what I could to obtain a favourable decision upon it— I received a
							Letter from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>,
							advising me to wait some days longer before proceeding to Washington, as
							she was about removing to our house in F. Street, which <persRef
								ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="huntt-anna">widow</persRef> has concluded to evacuate— I
							returned at 1. O’Clock with Charles, to Boston; and at 3. we went and
							dined with <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> P.
								C. Brooks</persRef> at his house in Pearl Street. His Son <persRef
								ref="brooks-peter2">Peter C. jun<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi></persRef> with <persRef ref="brooks-susan">his
								wife</persRef> live with him— His eldest Son <persRef
								ref="brooks-edward">Edward</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Governor Edward Everett</persRef> were there.—
							I called and spent the early part of the Evening, at <persRef
								ref="cruft-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward
								Cruft’s</persRef>— <persRef ref="cruft-annah;cruft-elizabeth2">Three
								daughters</persRef> and one small boy were there; and his eldest
							Son, <persRef ref="cruft-edward2">Edward</persRef> came in while I was
							there— He returned this morning from a tour to New-York and Albany— The
							Election storm has not yet subsided— There has been a violent party
							convulsion throughout the Commonwealth— The whig party is shivering to
							atoms, by internal dissension upon the fifteen gallon license law— The
							Democrats, much more harmonious, and more skilled in the art of
							electioneering, are yet divided by conflicting individual ambitions— The
							issue of the election yesterday at <hi rend="italic">Boston</hi>
							<pb n="655" type="ms"/>Boston is not yet ascertained, and Quincy has
							been convulsed in Town-meeting yesterday without being able to effect a
							choice of Representatives to the State Legislature— They adjourned the
							Meeting to this day, and now chose <persRef ref="duggan-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Duggan</persRef>, a Democrat—and could
							not effect the choice of a second. In the 12<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Congressional District, there was no nomination of a
							candidate in opposition to me— But an opposition was secretly organized
							throughout the District, utterly unknown in many of the Towns, until the
							opening of the polls— No preparation had been made for such resistance,
							and multitudes did not vote, from the mere presumption that as there
							would be no opposition, it would be useless— To play the game with more
							effect a highly charged democratic abolitionist was selected for the
							Candidate, and the whole <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>Van-Buren</persRef> phalanx in every town of the District voted for
							him— Instead of an unanimous vote, my majority in the District will be
							but a few hundreds.</p>

						<p>To Quincy with Charles. His Lecture</p>
						<p>There was a heavy shower of rain in the Night but the morning was again

							with whom she was yesterday in conjunction— I wrote industriously till
							breakfast; immediately after which I had a visit from <persRef

								>Page</persRef>, at his painting room on Friday morning at 11.
							O’Clock, which I promised— I wrote to <persRef

							I shall postpone my departure for Washington, till I hear from her
							again. I called at <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							Office, and then at the Quincy Stage Office where I found <persRef
								ref="gillet-simon">Gillet</persRef>. He had a note from <persRef

							expected— At M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Page’s chamber I found a

							which I promised for ten O’Clock, Friday Morning— Met <persRef
								ref="parkman-daniel">Daniel Parkman</persRef> at the door of N. 22
							School Street, and walked with him to Summer Street— There I left cards
							for <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel
								Websters</persRef>, and <persRef ref="welles-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Welles’s</persRef> houses— Then

								>Mary</persRef>, whose health has improved— M<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="fletcher-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="hull-isaac">Commodore Hull</persRef> in the
							Mediterranean— <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef> is
							also with her mother.— At 7. O’Clock I went with Charles to the
							Town-Hall, where he delivered a Lecture upon the Revolution of American
							Independence as affected by the manners and habits of social and
							domestic life— The Hall was crowded and more than half the auditory were
							women.— The most perfect silence was observed and the deepest attention

						<p>One of my chief purposes for staying here this day was to finish my seed,
							nut, stone and acorn sowing, in which from the first of October I have
							been disappointed by alternate hard frosts and flooding rains— A steady
							rain the whole of this day disappointed me again and confined me to the
							house— I only had the seedling Pear trees from the Brown-Bury seed
							transplanted from the two Pots to the Seminary stands.— I had a long
							morning visit from <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">E. Price
								Greenleaf</persRef>, and <persRef ref="ayer-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ayer</persRef> the Carpenter from
							Boston who came out this morning for some work upon <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house dined with me— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf, gave me an account of the
							recent elections here, in which there was no violence—perhaps no
							absolute fraud—but abundance of trickery.— The election in the morning
							was only for the member of Congress at a Town meeting, upon the
							projected road from Braintree through my Penn’s hill lands to the
							granite quarries.— The meeting was thinly attended, and none but the
							initiated knew that a vote was to be given other than for me— But as
							soon as the polls were opened, a ticket for <persRef
								ref="jackson-william3">William Morton Jackson</persRef> of Plymouth
							came forth, and was announced, and recommended as the abolition ticket.—
							The vote was 115 for me, and 83 for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jackson— But the great struggle was in the afternoon, for the State,
							County and Town Offices. The Selectmen had published in the Quincy
							Patriot of the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> inst<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> a list of the qualified voters of the
							town 593 in number— There were at the afternoon meeting upwards of 400
							present; and the democratic ticket for Governor, Lieutenant Governor and
							Senators prevailed by a large majority— Then for the representation of
							the town in the State Legislature, after several trials, <persRef
								ref="duggan-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> W. B.
								Duggan</persRef> the democratic manager was elected; and the
							adjourned over to the next day. They voted then many times, and finally
							chose <persRef ref="spear-lemuel">Lemuel Spear</persRef>, the
							Fence-viewer, <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf’s</persRef> farmer, a democrat, and
								<persRef ref="newcomb-james">James Newcomb</persRef> the Select man
							a whig— The Democratic competitor <persRef ref="white-nathaniel2"
								>Nathaniel White</persRef> could not be carried— The opposition to
							the State Government sympathises with the National Administration and
							their watchword is democracy, the supremacy of the People— I wrote to
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, and

						<p>From Quincy to Boston—</p>
						<p>To the rain of all yesterday succeeded a thick fog this morning, and a

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ayer</persRef> breakfasted with me,
							and at half past 8. <persRef ref="gillet-simon">Gillet</persRef> came

							which I went to <persRef ref="page-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Page’s</persRef> painting room, and sat about half an

								>Shaw</persRef>, a son of <persRef ref="shaw-robert">Robert G.
								Shaw</persRef>, and some others, with whom I was not personally
							acquainted— After viewing the Portrait, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Loring addressed them, and said that it would now be necessary to
							determine what disposal to make of it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Phillips was then chosen Chairman of the Meeting, and with five others
							was appointed a Committee to withdraw and report Resolution to the
							Meeting for adoption— The went accordingly and soon returned with a
							Resolution that the Portrait should be presented to the City of Boston,
							to be suspended in Faneuil Hall. This Resolution was unanimously
							adopted, and the same Committee were charged with the Office of
							presenting the picture to the City authorities. They then passed a vote
							of thanks to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Page, for the handsome
							execution of the work; and a motion was made for a vote of thanks to me,
							for the favour of sitting to the Painter—upon which I interposed, and
							said that I felt this would be an inversion of the part suitable to be
							performed between them and me— That the thanks were due from me to them,
							and that I offered them with the deepest sensibility to their kindness—
							That when requested by two of them to sit to the Artist, I had
							cheerfully complied without knowing or enquiring what was the purpose of
							the proposal, nor had a conjecture entered my mind upon this subject
							till I was now made acquainted with it— That I intreated them to believe
							that I felt it as an honour doubly precious, in the act itself, and in
							the delicacy of the manner in which it had been performed—and if the
							return of my thanks to them was not expressed in elegance of language
							suitable to the occasion, I hoped they would attribute the deficiency of
							words, to the pressure of an overburdened heart.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Phillips the Chairman made a brief
							complimentary reply, and the meeting dispersed— I then went with D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> George Parkman to the house of <persRef
								ref="bowditch-henry">D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi><space/>Bowditch</persRef>, a son of the late <persRef

							works <hi rend="italic">upon</hi>
							<pb n="658" type="ms"/>upon Astronomy— The present <persRef
								ref="bowditch-olivia">Doctor Bowditch’s wife</persRef>, an English
							Lady, and <persRef ref="bowditch-mary">his Sister</persRef>, a daughter
							of the late Doctor were there— The Library was in the parlour— I then
							returned to Charles’s house, and D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Parkman
							took the Volume of <persRef ref="pearson-william">Pearson’s</persRef>
							practical Astronomy which he had borrowed for me— <persRef
								ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> P. C.
								Brooks</persRef> dined with us at Charles’s—and I went and spent the
							Evening with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Abbott Lawrence. He is
							perhaps the most leading man of whig politics in Boston; though not at
							present in any public office.— I had much conversation with him upon the
							present condition and prospects, both of the national and State
							politics— <persRef ref="lawrence-katherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Lawrence</persRef> occasionally came in; and once with
								<persRef ref="lawrence-timothy">her son</persRef>, a lad of about 12
							years old.— Lawrence is a frank open hearted man, who with a good school
							but not classical education has made a large fortune, and lives in much
							Affluence and hospitality— He has been for many years devoted to
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> and the main pillar of his support both pecuniary
							and political— He now thinks Webster has coalesced with <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">Harrison</persRef> against <persRef
								key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> upon the Presidential competition,
							and is himself for Clay— But such is the ascendancy of Webster over his

								>Goldsmith</persRef> says <persRef ref="garrick-david"
								>Garrick</persRef> did his— <lg>

							his carriage, and I went with him to the rural cemetery at Mount Auburn—
							I think it is five years since I was there before. There are therefore
							many monuments there now more than there were then— Among the rest that
							of <persRef ref="spurzheim-johann">Spurzheim</persRef> the phrenological
							professor— There are now a number of enclosures within durable iron
							railings of spaces of various dimensions from ten to perhaps 100 feet
							square— One with the name of Lawrence, wrought in gilt Letters into the
							railing— The grave of <persRef ref="bangs-edward">Edward
							Bangs</persRef>, sometime Secretary of the Commonwealth was covered over
							with evergreens, and black, white and red berries growing on small and
							slender stalks, apparently without roots; none of them elevated more
							than three or four inches over the sod, and how they have been made to
							grow there we could not devise. There is very little variety in the
							monuments yet existing, and not one epitaph or monumental inscription
							suited to teach the rustic moralist to die— The barrenness of obituary
							sentiment or reflection is the most striking character of the place— Few
							instances of any thing more than the name and years of the incumbent;
							and almost all the inscriptions carved in the stone, without colouring
							so that it is scarcely possible to read them— A long slender pyramidical
							shaft, of Marble, Granite or Connecticut Stone with the names engraved
							on one side of the shaft, and standing on a low pedestal, is the most
							common form of the grave stone— Upon one of these
								pyrami<unclear>ds</unclear> on the grave of an Officer in the Navy,
							there is carved in relief, a silk worm <hi rend="italic">feeding</hi>
							<pb n="659" type="ms"/>feeding on a mulberry leaf, lying on the web of
							his cocoon unfolded like a sheet, and over him a flame, out of which
							issues a butterfly— This emblem of immortality was almost the only
							reminiscence of the Soul, that I discovered in the garden— The ground
							was covered with the dry, and snuff-coloured leaves of Oak, Chesnut and
							Walnut trees, and the trees themselves intermixed with Pine, fir,
							hemlock, Cedar, ash, beech, the arbor vitae and various shrubbery, with
							two or three ponds of stagnant water, cover the alternate hillock and
							valley of about 100 acres of land.— There is upon it a small comfortable
							dwelling house, in which the keeper of the enclosure lives; and the
							appearance of the whole now partakes of the desolation of the Season— On
							our return to Boston, I left a card at <persRef ref="lloyd-hannah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lloyd’s</persRef>, and met in the
							Street <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H. Everett</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="lincoln-solomon">Solomon Lincoln</persRef>— Received a
							Letter from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>,
							advising me still to remain some days here— I dined with <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> at <persRef ref="davis-isaac"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Isaac P. Davis’s</persRef>.—
								<persRef ref="davis-john">Judge John Davis</persRef>, with <persRef
								ref="davis-susan">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Isaac P.</persRef>
							and her Son <persRef ref="davis-thomas2">Thomas K.</persRef> formed the
							whole party— <persRef ref="bancroft-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> George Bancroft</persRef> came in after dinner, and we
							had a long conversation, of which I engrossed too much— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bancroft engaged me to dine with him next
							Friday, if I should be here— On returning home, we found <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Governor Everett</persRef>, making a short
							evening visit.</p>

						<p>I omitted the mention yesterday of a morning visit from <persRef
								ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet Welsh</persRef>, and some conversation
							with her, upon the claim of the granddaughter of <persRef
								ref="gridley-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Richard
								Gridley</persRef> to a pension, which I ought not to forget at
							Washington— I omitted also to notice the most affecting incident of my
							visit to mount Auburn— It was the solitary inscription, of the name of
								<persRef ref="sargent-maria">Maria Osborne Sargent</persRef>, wife
							of <persRef ref="curtis-thomas">Charles P. Curtis</persRef>; born in
							1804. deceased at the age of 30 in 1835—daughter of <persRef
								ref="sargent-daniel">Daniel Sargent</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="frazier-mary">Mary Frazier</persRef> once to me the most
							beautiful and most beloved of her sex— In the 15<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> year of her age she gave me, then 22 the assurance of her
							affection and the pledge of her faith— A year afterwards she withdrew
							them, from distrust instilled into her mind, by an anxious cousin.—
							Twelve years afterwards She married Daniel Sargent, and in 1804 at the
							age of 30. died of a consumption consequent upon the birth of this only
							child— This child I never saw— She too closed her career at the early
							age of 30. and upon meeting unexpectedly here the inscription of her
							name upon the grave-stone, a mingled emotion of tenderness, of
							melancholy, and yet of gratitude to Heaven, affected me to tears— I
							imagined to myself what would have been her fate and mine, had our union
							been accomplished— That in all probability I should have lost her in the
							prime of life, and lost perhaps a child like this, cut off like this in
							the blossom— Dearly!—how dearly did the sacrifice of her cost me,
							voluntary as it was—for the separation was occasioned by my declining to
							contract an unqualified engagement, forbidden by <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father</persRef>, and by the advice of her
							cousin to her, to insist upon a positive engagement or a separation—
							Four years of exquisite wretchedness, followed this separation, <hi
								rend="italic">nor</hi>
							<pb n="660" type="ms"/>nor was the wound in my bosom healed, till the
							Atlantic Ocean flowed between us—till all the faculties of my Soul, were
							absorbed in the politics of a revolutionary period, and the incidents of
							a wandering and adventurous life, led me to the formation of other and
							more propitious ties—by which I am yet happily bound. At the first
							Church <persRef ref="gray-thomas2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Gray</persRef>, of Jamaica Plains, Roxbury, supplied the place of
								<persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								N. L. Frothingham</persRef>, who is yet confined to the house by a
							catarrhal complaint, following a bilious attack— D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Grays morning text was from Colossians 3.1.— “Seek those
							things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of
							God”—and that of the afternoon from Matthew 7.1. [“]Judge not that ye be
							not judged— 2. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and
							with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.”— I spent
							the Evening at <persRef ref="quincy-josiah">Col<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>The sky cleared away this morning at Sunrise, and the day was fine; the
							Snow melting in the Sun, and freezing in the shade. I called about noon
							at <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> Office, but he was
							not there. I then visited <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">Doctor N.
								L. Frothingham</persRef>, and found him confined to his chamber with
							a severe cough, and stricture at the breast— While I was there, <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Governor Edward Everett</persRef> came in— The
							walking in the Street was so bad that I could not pay any other morning
							visit— At half past 3. P.M. <persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis</persRef> came, and I gave him
							the duplicate signed by me of the Letter from the Executors of <persRef

							a composition for his debt— I assented also to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Curtis’s proposition for selling a further portion of the
							landed Estate at Princeton— In the Evening I went into Hancock Street;
							and in search of the house of <persRef ref="hall-patten">M<hi

							found myself in that of <persRef ref="hall-joseph5">M<hi

						<p>Clear cold morning— Arcturus, the Northern Crown, and Jupiter visible in

							age; one of the wealthiest men in this Country; and one of the most

							industry; and his great solicitude now is how to make it secure.— More
							secure than property can be made. He has gloomy forebodings of the
							dissolution of the Union, even before his own; and he is much
							dissatisfied with the proceedings of <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddle</persRef>, and the Pennsylvania

							But I said we must travel on in the journey of life; taking up with such
							fare, as the chances of the road can supply—and ready to sink at every
							stage into the repose of eternity; or like Howard on the way side,
							between Stage and Stage, without dreaming of a home, or abiding place
							upon Earth.— I finished an answer to two Letters from <persRef
								ref="bacheler-origen">Origen Bacheler</persRef> of New-York;
							soliciting a donation of money to the Peace Society, and the latter
							accompanied with a printed draught of a Petition and Memorial to

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenwood and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Frothingham had shewn me in the Brattle-Street Church hymn
							book, and of which they asked me if I knew the original— It is a

							in the volume of Poems; but I did find the Tragedy of Irene, remembered
							that I have never read it— I read it now, and found it a totally
							different thing from what I supposed it—bearing in comparison with
								<persRef ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef> some analogy
							to that of warm water with Maraschino de Zara— I fall irresistibly into
							desultory reading, from the gallery of Actors and Actresses on the

							Report, the North American Review and the Journals of the Provincial

							on my upland, but without any admeasurement— I paced the distance of
							French’s line, and found it 206 paces or by estimate 1030 feet or in
							round numbers 60 rods— I had with me the plan of my farm, surveyed by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Humphrey in October 1830— He now
							staked out the line, as he judged it to run between the Saltmarsh, and
							the upland; but the line is so winding, that the marsh in several places
							surrounds the upland; in which cases, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Humphrey considered the insulated upland, as included in the Meadow—
							Being obliged to return to Boston to dine, we could not stay for the

							(who was not there) Brackett, and Bass. We left them engaged in the work

							to Boston— <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> was
							absent—gone to Cohasset— The weather was pinching cold, and the ground

								>Euripides</persRef>. Ion is the son of <persRef ref="creusa"

							>Apollo</persRef>— At his secret birth, <persRef ref="mercury"
								>Mercury</persRef> leaves him in charge of the Priestess of Apollo
							at Delphi, to be brought up in the service of the God— Creusa afterwards
							marries <persRef ref="xuthus">Xuthus</persRef>, and having no children,
							they go to consult the oracle at Delphi, how to obtain the blessing— Ion
							has grown to manhood, and the Oracle declares him to be the son of
							Xuthus but not of Creusa— Whereupon she conspires to poison Ion, by two
							drops of the Gorgons blood mixed in a bowl of wine— This conspiracy is
							disclosed to Ion, who thereupon resolves to kill Creusa— But the
							Priestess <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
							<pb n="664" type="ms"/>of the temple prevents the Catastrophe, by
							declaring that Ion is the Son of Creusa, and by producing the wicker
							basket in which he was delivered to her at his birth— <persRef

							Apollo, and commands them to return to Athens and there to place Ion
							upon the throne of his ancestor <persRef ref="erechtheus"

							and State Legislatures, what their opinions are upon sundry questions
							relating to the abolition of Slavery, and if the answers are not exactly
							conformable to their opinions they vote against the candidate or scatter
							their votes to defeat his election— Very few of the candidates answer
							the questions to their satisfaction, and they shew their power by
							marring the Elections. The result of their interposition has been
							hitherto mischievous, and I believe injurious to their own cause. I
							urged this as strongly as I was able; but apparently without making any
							impression upon his mind.— The moral principle of their interference, to
							defeat elections when they cannot carry them, appears to me to be
							vicious; and I think the first result of their movements will be to
							bring the two parties together against them.— As yet their political
							action has only tended to break down the barriers between the parties,
							the natural consequence of which is to strengthen the administration
							which they abhor—</p>

						<p>The morning was so cold that I could not write before breakfast at-all,
							and absorbed the time in reading. <persRef ref="armstrong-samuel">M<hi

								Blagden</persRef> He called on me this morning, and I went with him—

							Mark 2.17. [“]When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, they that are
							whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick.— I came not
							to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” and Luke 19.10. “For
							the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.”— The
							Sermon was a sequel to one upon the same texts, preached last Sabbath
							morning, and presented the Calvinistic doctrine of the atonement in a
							mitigated form, but arguing that an unexceptionable performance of all
							the duties enjoined by the commandments of the second table is
							altogether insufficient for Salvation.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Armstong informed me that his pew was that once owned and occupied by
							the Patriot <persRef ref="adams-samuel">Samuel Adams</persRef>.—
							Immediately opposite to it <pb n="666" type="ms"/>to it was the pew of
								<persRef ref="parker-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John

							discovering that the House was on fire—which was extinguished without

							the afternoon we went to the Brattle-Street Church and heard <persRef

							The argument of the discourse was that Christianity as a religion, was

						<p>Another change in the condition of my domestic Life.— I have been living
							more than a fortnight in indolent enjoyment at <persRef

							troubled with the distracting cares of a family, without being dunned,
							and without disturbance of any kind— From this delightful dream, after

							leave— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher said he should proceed to
							Washington at the close of the week— It was the day of the second trial
							to elect members for the City of Boston, in the Legislature of the
							Commonwealth— The polls were to close at 4. O’Clock P.M—for which I
							could not wait— At the election of the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
								inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> only 20 were elected and 36 more
							were to be voted for now— After an early dinner Charles and his two sons
								<persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-charles7">Charles Francis</persRef>, rode with me to the
							Depot of the Providence and Stonington Railway— There I met <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Caleb

							myself to attend the approaching Session of Congress.— I Took leave of
							my Son, and his two Children, and at 5 minutes past 3. we started in the
							cars— Weather fine, clear and cold.— With the twilight after the setting
							Sun we crossed the Providence river, and just before 9 we alighted at
							Stonington, and immediately embarked in the Steamer Narragansett for
							New-York— The expedition of this mode of traveling surpasses the
							imagination of any thing in former days— Of the aspect of the Country
							between Providence and Stonington I can give no account, having
							traversed it in the darkness of the Night— They stopp’d at two places on
							the road to take a fresh supply of water— At the second I left the car
							for about 5 minutes— When I <hi rend="italic">returned</hi>
							<pb n="667" type="ms"/>returned, I found a young woman in the seat that
							I had left, and on reaching Stonington the Umbrella that I had left by
							the side of the Seat, had disappeared— There was no time to search for
							it, and I give it up as lost.— I only desired the Captain of the Steamer
							on his return to Stonington to inform the conductor of the Cars that I
							had lost my umbrella in them; and if he should find it, request him to
							send it to my Son’s house at Boston— Of my fellow passengers about 80 in
							number I knew only M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing, though a
							Pennsylvanian Anti-Mason accosted me, and told me he had been introduced
							to me, at an Anti-masonic Meeting at Washington in<space/>About 11.
							O’Clock I retired to bed—</p>

						<p>The Night was fine—clear and cold—with a bright moon ten days old— A

							where we breakfasted— Before which I wrote to <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, to inform him of my arrival
							thus far.— On taking my seat at table I found myself by the side of
								<persRef ref="peck-luther">Luther C. Peck</persRef>, a member of the
							House of Representatives of the United States from the State of
							New-York— On looking over the bar-keeper’s books, I found that <persRef

								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Edward Cruft</persRef> of Boston
							were at the House, and visited them at their chamber— They are here upon

							Cruft’s health— While I was there, their second Son, <persRef

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newbold</persRef>— He gave me
							his card with the name of the firm, and his own, and asked me to send

							By some accident we were detained nearly an hour on this road; and it

							just going with <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john5;sergeant-spencer;sergeant-william">his three

							saw <persRef ref="centlivre-susannah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Centlivre’s</persRef> Comedy, the Wonder, a Woman keeps a
							secret—very indifferently performed.— Excepting <persRef ref="u"

								ref="cramer-h">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> H. Cramer</persRef>
							as Violante has a voice like the boatswain of a Man of War— The play is
							a Comedie d’intrigue on the old Spanish platform and the Scene is at

							shews the authors acquaintance with female character and passions in low
							life— But Lissardo is a failure of the cunning and sprightly Scapin or
							Figaro stamp, and Gibby suffers himself to be kicked and cuffed rather
							too much for the honour of auld Scotland— The play was succeeded by
							sundry songs and dances and the ballet of La fille mal gardée; performed
							by a company of dancers from Paris, brought out by a <persRef
								ref="hazard-paul">Monsieur Hazard</persRef>, heretofore a successful
							dancing master at Philadelphia, but now a third rate ballet-dancer on

							scramble for Seats, or for the best parts of the dishes— A rapid
							passages—no delays and treatment always courteous and obliging— The

							wood on each passage up and down—or eight cords on every trip— As the
							passage, is usually little more than four hours, the consumption of wood
							is about 2 cords of wood, to an hour.— We sent our trunks immediately to
							the Office of the Washington Railway, and were detained there not more
							than a quarter of an hour. At 4. O’Clock P.M, the Cars started and at
							half past 6. we were at the railway house, at the foot of the Capitol

								ref="naudain-arnold">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Arnold
								Naudain</persRef>, heretofore a Senator of the United States from
							the State of Delaware; and now a Candidate for the Office of Clerk of

								ref="franklin-walter">Walter S. Franklin</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="may-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> May</persRef>, a
							member of the House from the State of Illinois—with a Lady; I suppose
							his wife— On landing at Washington we went immediately to the Hall of
							the House of Representatives, and took our Seats.— By a Resolution of
							the House adopted at the last Session, the <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>Speaker’s</persRef> chair has been transferred from the North to
							the South side of the House, and the whole arrangement of the Seats has
							been inverted and changed— There was a Resolution that each member
							should be entitled to a seat, corresponding in advantage with that which
							he would lose by the reversal— But a circular from the Clerk’s Office
							was sent some weeks since to every member stating that the new
							arrangement of the Seats was so different from the former that it was
							impossible to assign them, and that each member must select his own
							Seat. I took mine as nearly corresponding to that which I have occupied
								<hi rend="italic">for</hi>
							<pb n="669" type="ms"/>for the last five years, or six Sessions of the
							House— I then returned to the Railway Office for my trunk—took a hack,
							and about 7. in the evening alighted at my house in F. Street, to which
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and family
							had removed, and where blessed be God, I found them all well.</p>

						<p>Thanksgiving day, in my native Commonwealth of Massachusetts; and humble
							and hearty thanks I give to the disposer of all events, for all
							blessings that I have ever enjoyed, and particularly for those of the
							yet revolving year— I paid a morning visit to <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President Martin Van Buren</persRef>, whom I
							found alone in his Cabinet the East Chamber of the Presidential House.
							Half an hours conversation with him chiefly on the disposal of the
							Smithsonian bequest— I referred to my conversation with him before my
							departure hence last Summer—to the Letter I received afterwards from the
								<persRef ref="forsyth-john">Secretary of State Forsyth</persRef>;
							and to my two Letters to him in answer to it— He had not seen my
							Letters; but had on his table copies of them, and of a Report from
								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef>; and of a Letter from <persRef ref="wayland-francis"
								>President Wayland</persRef> of Brown University at Providence, all
							which he said had been sent to him this morning from the Department of
							State, and none of which he had yet read— With regard to the disposal of
							the fund, he should leave it entirely to Congress to make provision for
							it— I recurred to some of the remarks in my Letters to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth recommending the Establishment of
							an Astronomical Observatory.— He said he had found this idea of an
							Observatory favourably received by all to whom he had mentioned it. He
							spoke in high commendation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, for
							his ability in obtaining the money, from the Court of Chancery, and said
							that he had recommended his appointment— We had some conversation—also
							upon the disturbances on the Canadian frontier which he seemed to think
							more troublesome than I had expected.— He said <persRef ref="fox-henry3"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fox</persRef> had been greatly,
							and he thought unnecessarily alarmed; and had been made to believe that
							there was a projected invasion of Canada from our side of the river of
							200000 men— He said further that the greatest excitement on our side now
							was on the Michigan border, and the greatest danger at Cleveland.— From
							the President’s I went to the Office of the National Intelligencer, and
							saw Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							<persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef>— I enquired for Boston
							Newspapers of Tuesday Morning to ascertain the result of the Election
							for City Representatives in the State Legislature of Monday— But the
							papers of Tuesday, had not yet arrived. Evening visit from <persRef
								ref="woodbury-levi">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Woodbury</persRef>, the Secretary of the Treasury— He invited me to
							dine with him next Saturday, with the President, and some of the foreign
							Ministers— I accepted the invitation. But the dining of the President
							with the Heads of Departments and foreign Ministers, is a novelty
							introduced by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren; and of which I
							believe there is no example by any of his Predecessors— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury spoke about the disposal of the
							funds of the Smithsonian bequest; and gratified me much, by the
							statement, that the whole fund is now invested at an interest of 6 per
							cent a year—that the principal sum received is about 508000 dollars; and
							that it will yield upwards of 30000 <hi rend="italic">dollars</hi>
							<pb n="670" type="ms"/>dollars a year— He said further that a question
							had occurred whether the expenses occasioned by the recovery of the
							money, were to be deducted from the fund itself, or to be paid by the
							Public; and the <persRef ref="grundy-felix">Attorney General</persRef>
							had just given an opinion that no deduction from the fund should be
							made— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury that I was
							delighted to hear this. And I urged most earnestly upon him, as I had
							done this morning upon the President the duty of this Government, to the
							honour of the Nation and to the Testator, to keep this fund entire and
							unimpaired, and to devote its annual proceeds to the generous and
							glorious object to which it was devoted by him. To no purpose of common
							education—to no School, College, University or Seminary of Learning— But
							to the increase and diffusion of knowledge among Men. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury appeared to concur in those
							views; and I have a faint hope that the fund may be so managed as to
							produce some useful result— <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef> was here this
							morning.</p>

						<p>I rose this morning an hour earlier than yesterday, and attempted to
							write before breakfast— But this I must renounce henceforth during the
							winter’s cold, and as has often happened to me before must abridge my
							record, in proportion as the material for it grows important. I wrote to
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>— Called at the
							Washington Bank, and at <persRef ref="u">Tucker</persRef> the Tailor’s
							and went to the Hall of the House of Representatives.— At the Clerk’s
							Office I enquired for the Journals and Documents of the last Session;
							but they were not ready to be delivered— <persRef ref="burch-samuel"
								>Burch</persRef>, the most efficient clerk in the Office was in
							perplexity what to do between <persRef ref="jones-george2">George W.
								Jones</persRef>, and<space/><persRef ref="doty-james"
							>Doty</persRef>—both claiming the Seat in the House as Delegate from the
							Territory of Wisconsin.— The questions presented by this case resemble,
							but are not identical with those of the recent contested elections in
							Mississippi— The Delegates from Territories are admitted to Seats in the
							House, with the right of debating but not of voting, by a provision in
							the ordinance for the Government of the Northwestern territory, adapted
							by acts of Congress, under the general authority to make needful rules
							and regulations for the territories, to the organization of Congress in
							two houses— There are two Laws; one of 1817. which provides that the
							delegates shall be elected for the same term of two years, for which
							members of the House of Representatives are elected—and the other of
							1836. constituting the territory of Wisconsin and authorising the
							election of a delegate, once in every alternate year— Under this last
							law Jones was elected, and it being the second year of the 24<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress he sat not only in the second
							Session of that Congress, but in the first and second Sessions of the
							present 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress— At the expiration
							however of the two years another election was held, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Doty was chosen; and now Jones claims the
							seat for the remaining Session of this Congress, under the first
							election, and Doty claims it under the last election— Burch directed the
							list of the members to be made out, with the name of the Delegate from
							Wisconsin left in Blank; but not with the seat announced vacant— I
							enquired for the Journals and documents of the last Session, but they
							are not yet bound. Going to and returning from the Capitol, I met
							several members of the House just <pb n="671" type="ms"/>just arrived;
							and among them <persRef ref="polk-james">James K. Polk</persRef>, the
							Speaker.— Evening visits from <persRef ref="thomas-john7">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas</persRef> and from <persRef
								ref="parris-albion">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Albion K.

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> The first ten days of this month
							were passed at Quincy much like those of the preceding month; excepting

							<persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef>, and <persRef ref="adams-john17;adams-charles7;adams-henry4;adams-louisa3;adams-abigail4">his family</persRef> at

							days I came to Washington, and rejoined my family on the same day of the
							month, preceding that on which they had left me— I close the present
							Month with a renewed residence in an old house— My former residence here
							was in the last rising portion of my life— It is now that in which I may
							close my career— That it may be one in which the remnant of my days may
							be devoted to the glory of God; to Peace on Earth, and to the best
							welfare of my Country, I humbly and devoutly pray.</p>
