						<p>On going to the House this morning, I told my Coachman <persRef
								ref="nelson-thomas3">Thomas</persRef>, if he should come for me this
							Evening, not to come till Ten O’Clock— There was a Resolution, two or
							three days ago, reported from the Committee of Commerce; calling upon
							the <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of War</persRef>, to make
							report at the next Session of Congress, of a Survey of Lake Erie— As
							soon as it was before the House, Lake Huron was added to it by way of
							Amendment. <persRef ref="bronson-isaac">Bronson</persRef> then moved to
							add Lake Ontario— Others moved for Lakes Michigan and Superior— After
							some discussion upon each of these amendments, <persRef
								ref="whittlesey-elisha">Whittlesey</persRef> of Ohio, moved as a
							substitute a joint Resolution on authorising the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> to cause surveys to be
							made of such parts of Lakes Ontario, Erie, S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Clair, Huron, Michigan and Champlain, with their Bays,
							rivers and Straits— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> then moved
							to include the waters of Chesapeake Bay, and the Creeks adjacent
							thereto— After some resistance by Whittlesey, and a spice of sectional
							altercation, Whittlesey accepted Wise’s Amendment.— The <persRef
								ref="stanly-edward">Stanley</persRef> moved to include Albemarle
							Pamlico and Core Sound, upon which <persRef ref="shepard-charles"
								>Charles Shepard</persRef>, proposed other Sounds in North Carolina
							and thus the Resolution went on swelling till it was ready to break down
							by its own weight, when with the hour of 11. came the special order of
							the day, and the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union,
								<persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> in the Chair, upon
							the Indian Appropriation Bill— <persRef ref="turney-hopkins"
								>Turney</persRef> resumed his Speech of bitter personalities <hi
								rend="italic">against</hi>
							<pb n="508" type="ms"/>against <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef>,
							which he continued for nearly two hours; reading long extracts from old
							printed documents and Speeches of Bell, to convict him of inconsistency—
							Bell replied—using as he always does gentlemanly language, but in the
							tone which the most exasperated resentment assumes to express
							unmitigated contempt— He spoke of Turney as a man of whom he had
							scarcely known any thing—until he met him on the floor of the House—said
							his personal relations with him had been slight but not unfriendly— That
							Turney could have no possible motive for ill-will towards him; but that
							he had made himself the voluntary Scavenger of all the filth raked up by
							others. That the political associates for whom he acted (meaning
								<persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> the Speaker, and <persRef
								ref="grundy-felix">Grundy</persRef> the Senator from Tennessee)
							whether in or out of the House were men equally destitute of public
							principle, and of private worth— He had said all of this of them at
							home, in his own district, where he had dared them to meet him, and had
							exposed their falsehood and hypocrisy— That they never had dared to meet
							him, but had set Turney, to make this unprovoked attack upon him in the
							House—that Turney had thus become the voluntary instrument of the malice
							of others; the tool of tools.— At these words Turney who was sitting
							within arms reach of Bell, started up and with furious gesture looking
							him in the face,—cried it is false, it is false—upon which Bell struck
							him with his fist— Turney aimed a blow at Bell in return, and they were
							rushing at each other when the members adjoining separated them— Cries
							of Order, Speaker, <persRef ref="dorsey-roderick">Serjeant at
								arms</persRef>, instantly arose— Polk the Speaker, darted up to the
							Chair, turned Howard out of it, and called upon the Serjeant at arms to
							keep order— The tumult then subsided of itself and the Speaker to
							justify himself for resuming the Chair, read from <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson’s</persRef> Manual. p. 132. of the
							new Edition of the Rules, their Precedents as reported from the British
							House of Commons.— All was now quiet; but what was to be done with the
							dignity of the House— Howard, the extruded Chairman of the Committee of
							the whole, whose position seemed to me almost ludicrously aukward,
							thought himself obliged to apologize to the House, for what he had
							obviously no power to prevent— He said he had yesterday called once or
							twice Turney to order for wandering into personalities—that the incident
							this day was so sudden and instantaneous that there had not been time
							for the Chairman to interpose— A motion was made that the Chairman of
							the Committee of the whole House, should take the Chair again; but this
							was not comformable to the Precedents— <persRef ref="mercer-charles"
								>Mercer</persRef> was for resorting to his old expedient of
							requiring a pledge from the parties that they would pursue the quarrel
							no farther; but Wise remonstrated against this, and after a short
							discussion, Mercer’s motion was laid upon the table by the tellers 86 to
							52— The House were on the point of going into Committee of the whole
							again when <persRef ref="pennybacker-isaac">Pennybacker</persRef>
							offered a Resolution requiring Bell and Turney to make apologies to the
							House for having violated its privileges, and offending its dignity.—
								<persRef ref="yell-archibald">Yell</persRef> moved to lay this
							motion on the table, but <persRef ref="grant-abraham">Grant</persRef>
							called for the yeas and nays, which were 21. to 155— When the <hi
								rend="italic">call</hi>
							<pb n="509" type="ms"/>call had proceeded about one third through the
							names, and it was apparent that there would be a very large majority
							against laying it on the table; Wise asked that it should be superseded,
							both the Gentlemen being ready to volunteer apologies; very much ashamed
							of themselves, and quite sufficiently punished already the call was
							however carried through— Then without waiting for the passing of the
							Resolution, Bell and Turney successively apologized, and disclaimed all
							intention of disrespect to the House; whereupon the Resolution was by
							general consent laid on the table; and the House went on motion into
							Committee again. Bell then resumed his speech of self vindication
							against the slaver of Turney, but as he kept himself within the rules of
							order his discourse was stale and flat, like a pot of small beer after a
							bumper of pure whiskey. He was followed by <persRef
								ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>, and he by <persRef
								ref="halstead-william">Halstead</persRef>, who since his unlucky
							waterspout with <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>
							about the Jet d’eau has been silent, but who now gave a dissertation
							equally dull and self conceited— This closed the debate— The question
							upon Bell’s amendment was taken by tellers and carried 77 to 70. to the
							great astonishment, and annoyance of <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
								>Cambreleng</persRef> who called for a new count, insisting that
							many of the members had mistaken Bell’s amendment for the one which he
							was to offer, by instruction from the Committee of Indian Affairs— An
							additional Appropriation for the ultimatum from the Secretary of War to
							the Cherokees— <persRef ref="anderson-hugh">Anderson</persRef> of Maine
							said he had mistaken the question and moved a reconsideration of the
							vote— <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> raised a point
							of order, whether a reconsideration could be moved in Committee of the
							whole— The Chairman said it could. The Speaker was of the same opinion—
							Bell thought it could not, but moved the amendment proposed by the
							Indian Committee— Anderson withdrew his motion for reconsideration.— The
							amendment of the Indian Committee was adopted without a division, and
							the Committee of the whole on the Union rose and reported the Bill with
							the amendments— House adjourned.— It was pouring down floods of Rain— I
							took a Seat in a Hack with <persRef ref="sergeant-john"
								>Sergeant</persRef>, and <persRef ref="davies-edward">Edward
								Davis</persRef>, another member from Pennsylvania—drop’d them at
							their lodgings and came home— There was an evening party at <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Meade’s</persRef>, to which
								<persRef ref="adams-isaac">Hull</persRef> went, but <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> sent an excuse— There was some
							debating in the House, on the amendments reported by the Committee of
							the whole on the Union, to the Indian Bill, upon which Cambreleng urged
							for the passage to the third reading— The adjournment was carried by
							tellers 88 to 81.</p>

						<p>Our Coachman, <persRef ref="nelson-thomas3">Thomas</persRef>, as he was
							accounting to me this morning for purchases of provisions at market, was
							taken suddenly with a faint turn, which soon passed away; but left him
							so weak, that I thought it best for him to take some repose— <persRef
								ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef> volunteered and drove
							me in the Barouche to the Capitol. <persRef ref="hellen-mary"
								>Mary</persRef> and her daughter <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna"
								>Fanny</persRef> went with me— Hull took leave of me there, and went
							in this afternoon’s Cars, with his friend <persRef
								ref="campbell-archibald">Campbell</persRef> to Baltimore. Hull has
							been with us, from the 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March, and is
							now going to <persRef ref="adams-ann">his mother</persRef> at Quincy.
							Campbell belongs to Albany, and is going thither. H.R.U.S. <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> moved that the
							Indian hostility Bill with the amendments reported by the Committee of
							the whole on the state of the Union should be printed. Two Messages from
							the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> were received—
							One of them with a Report from the <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Secretary
								of State</persRef> in answer to the Resolution offered by me last
							Monday. He says that all the correspondence with Texas relating to the
							annexation has been already com-<hi rend="italic">municated</hi>
							<pb n="510" type="ms"/>-municated— That there has been no correspondence
							on the subject with any other Government, and that the proposition of
							annexation made by the Texas Government having been disposed of in the
							correspondence heretofore communicated has not been since deemed within
							the control of the United States— The question whether the application
							has been withdrawn, remains unanswered— The Message was referred to the
							Committee of Foreign Relations— There was a Report from the <persRef
								ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of War</persRef> on the cost of
							allowances to be made to the Cherokees to be removed, for improvements,
							spoliations and etceteras to the amount of more than two Millions—
								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> obtained a
							suspension of the Rules to offer a Resolution to fix next Monday which
							he afterwards modified to Friday, to take up the Bill reported from the
							Committee on the Public Buildings, for removing the Walls of the
							Treasury building now half finished and for erecting a fire proof
							Patent-Office— Three hours, from ten to one, were at last yielded
							against long and captious opposition— I called for the reading of the
							memorial from the starving workmen, and it was read— This day had been
							fixed for the consideration of Bills reported from the Committee of
							Revolutionary Claims— Committee of the whole, <persRef
								ref="elmore-franklin">Elmore</persRef> in the Chair 26 Bills were
							reported without amendment, among which the Bill for the relief of the
							Heirs of <persRef ref="sampson-crocker">Crocker Samson</persRef>. 51
							Bills were reported with amendments, principally striking out the
							allowance of interest reported by the standing Committee. Eleven Bills
							were reported with the enacting clause struck out, among which that for
							the relief of the heirs of <persRef ref="cazeau-francois">Francis
								Cazeau</persRef> and nineteen Bills were laid aside for further
							consideration— Among these was the Bill for granting seven years half
							pay to the widows or children of certain officers of the Continental
							line of the Revolutionary Army— There was a Bill authorising the issuing
							of Land warrants to the widows or children of certain revolutionary
							Officers, slain in Battle before the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							of Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1776.— I moved to amend by
							inserting, or who died in the Service, to take in the case of the
								<persRef ref="thomas-john8;thomas-nathaniel3">heirs</persRef> of
								<persRef ref="thomas-john9">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> John
								Thomas</persRef>—but <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"
								>Underwood</persRef> objected that this case had been provided for,
							by the seven years half-pay under the Resolution of Congress of 14.
								Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1780. and brought me a Volume of
								<persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="seaton-william">Seaton’s</persRef> Documents, containing a
							Report from <persRef ref="knox-henry2">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Knox</persRef> when Sec<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> of War shewing
							that the 7 years half pay had been paid to the heirs of Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thomas.— About 3. O’Clock some question
							was made on which it appeared there was no Quorum; and the Chairman,
							left the Chair and reported the fact.— Nothing had been done in
							Committee. An attempt was made to adjourn—which failed— A call of the
							House was ordered. <persRef ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef>
							moved to adjourn assigning on the Journal the want of a Quorum as the
							reason; and publishing the names of the members present— I moved as an
							amendment to strike out the names of the members present, and publish
							the names of the absent— The <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef>
							said the motion was not in order— The call was pursued until a bare
							Quorum appeared—the Speaker left and the Chairman resumed the Chair— The
							Committee completed its business, reported the bills on which it had
							taken questions, and asked leave to sit again upon the rest, which was
							granted. The House adjourned at 5. O’Clock— Returning home I met the
							Carriage with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef>,
							Mary and her daughter Fanny— They landed me at our house and pursued
							their ride. Hull was gone in the Cars— A young French woman named
								<persRef ref="u">Grandval</persRef> came, as a <hi rend="italic"
								>preceptress</hi>
							<pb n="511" type="ms"/>preceptress to the children— Speaking only
							French, it is hoped they will more easily learn the language.— <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">Mary-Louisa</persRef> is unwell, and seems to be
							in drooping health; never wholly recovered since she had the
							meazles.</p>

						<p>I took <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and her daughter
								<persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny</persRef> with me this morning
							to the Capitol, where in the Representative Hall, <persRef
								ref="livermore-harriet">Harriet Livermore</persRef> preached from
							Luke 23–34. “Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them, for they know not
							what they do”— A discourse on the absolute and unqualified forgiveness
							of injuries— Indirectly only against dwelling—not even indirectly
							against Slavery— Eleven years have passed away since I first heard her
							in the same Hall; more than six since I had heard her last— Age has in
							that time traced furrows on her brow.— She has no longer the charm of
							youth— The silver tones of her voice have become brassy, and she is
							labouring with one of these violent bilious coughs— She came to see me
							after the service, accompanied by <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cogswell</persRef> of New-Hampshire,
							who she said lodged at the same house with her and made a voluntary
							offer to come with her— I reminded her that when I heard her at the
							Capitol in 1832 she had announced her intention of going to the western
							Indians. She said she had been there with the approbation of the
							Government, and the warm recommendation of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President Jackson</persRef>— But the <persRef
								ref="schermerhorn-john">Schermerhorns</persRef> of that region, by
							which I understood the male missionaries had forced her away, and robbed
							her of all her property— She had stated her claim for restitution or
							indemnity to <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President Van
								Buren</persRef>, who had graciously referred her to the <persRef
								ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of War</persRef>— He was sick—but
								<persRef ref="cooper-samuel4">his chief Clerk</persRef> had assured
							her that her claim would be faithfully enquired into, and this she had
							no doubt was the last she would hear of it— She said she had since been
							at Jerusalem, and had only three weeks since returned to the United
							States— She spoke with great kindness of the converted Jew missionary
								<persRef ref="wolff-joseph">Joseph Wolff</persRef>, who she said was
							the greatest man living and of whose prediction that the Millennium is
							to commence in 1846 she declared her entire belief— Tis rather too soon—
							There is a permanency in this woman’s monomania, which seems accountable
							only from the impulse of vanity; and the love of Fame— The religious
							Spirit easily allies itself to these Passions, and they, eagerly grasp
							the garb of religion.— The holy Spirit avails itself of these purposes
							to promote its own cause— When Harriet Livermore preaches in the
							Representative Hall of the United States the forgiveness of
							injuries—alas! how few converts, will she make! and yet? is there no
							blessing of God, for a word spoken in Season? Is there no avenue to
							improvement in the heart of man? There is— Harriet Livermore towards the
							close of her discourse, upon the absolute, unqualified and irremissible
							command of Jesus Christ to his disciples <hi rend="italic">to</hi>
							<pb n="512" type="ms"/>to practice the duty of mutual forgiveness, said
							there was no portion of mankind, upon whom that obligation was more
							imperiously binding than upon those who filled the Seats in that Hall—
							May some of those who heard her lay it to their hearts, and Harriet
							Livermore will have worthily fulfilled her destiny upon earth— <persRef
								key="frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frye</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="johnson-catherine2">Miss Johnston</persRef> were here
							after morning worship at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s church,
							but did not stay— I attended there after dinner. A stranger read the
							Evening service for Whitsunday and preached from Jeremiah 31.31.
							“Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant
							with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: 32. Not according
							to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took
							them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt; (—) 33. But
							this shall be the covenant that I will make with the House of Israel:
							After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward
							parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they
							shall be my people.” The preacher had upon his countenance the traces of
							a thinking man, as well as of affliction— His discourse was very
							intelligent and yet too unwieldy for his grasp— He had many reflections
							not fully digested on the nature of Covenants and he intimated that the
							term was improper as expressive of any relation between God and
							man—because he said the general acceptation of the word covenant,
							implied something like equality between the parties— The word covenant
							therefore thus used was equivalent to commandment or Testament— It was
							the word used for both parts of the Bible—the old and the new Covenant,
							and meant the Sovereign will of God. All this is true— But Covenant is
							not mere will— Obedience to the Will of God is the universal Law of the
							Bible— But it is the obedience of a free Agent, and therein consists the
							peculiar nature of Man— Matter, obeys the will of God— The brute
							creation obeys the will of God— All submit to his controul— All fulfil
							his commands— With man only, he makes a covenant, and man only by the
							immortality of his nature acquires the faculty of contracting even with
							God— This principle requires developement, and is the key to the whole
							bible, and the whole duty of Man.</p>

							<pb n="513" type="ms"/>had not time to hear him; and promised to call at

							motion of <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">E.
							Whittlesey</persRef>—sundry Bills from the Senate were twice read and
							referred to Committees— The presentation of Petitions took not more than
							two hours.— I presented one from <persRef ref="swinterton-anna">Anna
								Swinerton</persRef>, for a widow’s pension— I found it on my table,
							and know not whence it came.— I stated that I had received certain
							Resolutions of the Legislature of Massachusetts, adopted at their recent
							Session, relating to Slavery and the Slave trade in the District of
							Columbia, and in the Territories, which under ordinary circumstances, I
							should deem it my duty now to present— But it would be recollected by
							the House, that last week one of my Colleagues—<persRef
								ref="calhoun-william">W. C. Calhoun</persRef> had presented to the
							House certain Resolutions of the same Legislature, of a kindred
							character, though not the same—they related to the admission into the
							Union any new State, with a Constitution tolerating the existence of
							Slavery within its borders— That the <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker
								of the House</persRef>, by a construction which I deemed erroneous
							of the Resolution of the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of December
							last, had decided that those Resolutions, presented by my Colleague
							should be laid on the table without being read, printed, referred, or
							considered— That my Colleague on a subsequent day, had applied to the
							House for leave to withdraw those Resolutions; with the avowed purpose
							of making known to his constituents and mine the manner in which they
							had been treated by the House— That this leave had been granted, and
							that afterwards my Colleague had offered a Resolution, now pending for
							the future consideration of the House; declaring that the order of the
								21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of December 1837. shall not be
							construed to include the Resolutions of any State Legislature— That I
							should not now present the Resolutions of the Legislature of
							Massachusetts with which I was charged, but should reserve them, until
							by the action of the House upon the Resolution offered by my Colleague
							it should be ascertained, whether the Resolutions of the Legislature of
							my native Commonwealth would be treated by this House, with the respect
							to which they are entitled, or with contempt.— While I was making this
							Statement <persRef ref="campbell-john7">Campbell</persRef> of
							South-Carolina first rose, and made a question of order— The Speaker
							said, that if I had Resolutions of the Legislature of Massachusetts to
							present——— I said I was stating to the House the reasons why I should

								>Ingham</persRef> of Connecticut, presented two sets of Resolutions
							of the Legislature of that State, one in favour of the claimants for

							protesting against the <persRef ref="patton-john">Patton</persRef> Gag—
							They were laid on the table and ordered to be printed— <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> presented a Petition
							from coloured Citizens of New-York; complaining, of a regulation in the
							Island of Cuba, by which coloured mariners arriving there are
							imprisoned— There is precisely such a regulation at Charleston

						<p>This day and tomorrow had been some time since fixed for the
							consideration of Bills relating to the Territories— <persRef
								ref="whittlesey-elisha">Whittlesey</persRef> of Ohio proposed that
							before commencing upon them the Committees should be called for Reports—
							But the whole of the two days having been assigned to the Territories,
								<persRef ref="yell-archibald">Yell</persRef> of Arkansas objected to
							taking up anything else. Several Reports from Committees were received
							and <persRef ref="bouldin-james">Bouldin</persRef>, Chairman of the

							the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> after the morning hour. He had
							proposed Tuesday the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> but Yell again
							interposed and said it should be a more distant day— So he proposed the
							day <hi rend="italic">before</hi>.— I objected that Monday was the day
							for Petitions, and Bouldin modified his motion, to except the morning
							hour, and thus it was adopted— The Committee of the whole was discharged
							from the consideration of all the Bills relating to the Territories,
							which had been referred to them, and they were all referred to the
							Committee of the whole on the State of the Union— The House then went
							into Committee of the whole on the Union <persRef ref="sergeant-john"
								>John Sergeant</persRef> in the Chair— Bills to open land-offices in
							Wisconsin, West of the Mississippi, to create a surveyor general, to
							establish a new judicial district in Florida, to survey and ascertain
							the boundary lines between Wisconsin and Missouri, and between Wisconsin
							and Michigan, were laid aside to be reported after very short discussion
							upon one of them—the Bill to divide the Territory of Wisconsin, and
							establish the territory of Iowa, was the first that bred debate—
								<persRef ref="mason-samson">Mason</persRef> of Ohio, without
							declaring himself against it, moved to strike out the enacting clause,
							to elicit information; stating that allegations were abroad of numerous
							occupations of the public Lands by unlicensed <hi rend="italic"
								>interlopers</hi>
							<pb n="515" type="ms"/>interlopers— <persRef ref="crary-isaac"
								>Crary</persRef> of Michigan briefly answered him— <persRef
								ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef> opposed the Bill, as
							unnecessary and inexpedient until the portion of Wisconsin East of the
							Mississippi shall be constituted as a State— <persRef
								ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> with more candid
							disclosure of real purpose opposed the Bill on the avowed ground of
							maintaining the balance of power between the Slave-holding and
							non-slave-holding States. He said he would never consent, and hoped no
							Southern man would ever vote, for making new Territories, or admitting
							new States from the Northwest into the Union, so long as the Northern
							fanatics were pouring in floods of petitions, against the admission of
							that great and glorious people of Texas, which had applied for admission
							into our Union, as was desired most earnestly by a large portion of our
							own Country and for which proposals in this House had been made but not
							considered— <persRef ref="bronson-isaac">Bronson</persRef> complimented
							Thompson for his candour, remarked that the Northwestern territory was
							actually a parcel of our Union to the People of which we were under
							obligations of positive duty— He would not enter into the discussion
							about the annexation of Texas, but it was not now within the pale of the
							Union— <persRef ref="pope-john">Pope</persRef> spoke in favour of the
							Bill, and said the present population of Wisconsin West of the
							Mississippi was much more numerous than that of Arkansas when gifted
							with a territorial Government— Bronson said the present population was
							about 30000 each side of the Mississippi— Thompson replied, insisting
							upon the claim of the people of the South to the annexation of Texas, to
							preserve the balance of power, especially in the Senate— Mercer,
								<persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="jones-george2">Jones</persRef> of Wisconsin, <persRef
								ref="shepard-charles">Charles Shepard</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="white-john6">White</persRef> of Kentucky took part in the
							debate, but no answer was given to Thompson— I rose once and addressed
							the chairman, but he did not hear me— The motion to strike out the
							enacting clause was rejected without a division— <persRef
								ref="bond-william2">Bond</persRef> moved a reduction of the Salary
							of the Governor, which after some discussion was adopted— Then came a
							Bill granting Land to the Territory of Wisconsin to open a Canal—after
							some discussion laid over— An appropriation for a Law Library for the
							Councils and Courts in Florida—and an appropriation for a compilation of
							the Laws of Florida— The Committee reported all the Bills, excepting
							that for the grant of the land to open the Canal— The amendments were
							adopted in the House and the Bills, passed to the third reading and
							passed—except the Bill constituting the Territory of Ioway—which
							Thompson moved to lay on the table— The House adjourned about 5. without
							taking this question— I called at <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Caldwell’s</persRef>, and he told me,
							not very clearly his grievances against the <persRef ref="kendall-amos"
								>Postmaster General</persRef>, and the Post-Office Committee—
								<persRef ref="briggs-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Briggs</persRef> who is on that Committee came in while I was there;
							and I referred Caldwell to him for redress, promising my aid if there
							should be occasion— I had written out, what I said in the House
							yesterday, concerning the Resolutions of the Legislature of
							Massachusetts, upon Slavery and the Slave trade in the District of
							Columbia and the Territories— I left the paper with <persRef
								ref="gales-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef> at
							the Intelligencer Office— Afterwards, recollecting that I had by mistake
							dated it Monday 28 May. I wrote a Note to Gales, or the foreman of the

						<p>Dark and heavily showery day. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My
								wife</persRef>, our grand child <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary
								Louisa</persRef>, and myself are afflicted with severe and obstinate
							coughs, which have been epidemic this Season, and which return with
							every change of weather— That of my wife is distressing. H.R.U.S.
								<persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">Elisha Whittlesey</persRef>
							succeeded this morning in his motion that the Committees should be
							called for Reports, and I reported from the Committee of Manufactures,
							the Bill for repayment to the Georgia Steamboat company, of the duties
							paid by them on the importation from Liverpool of iron for a Steamboat
							in 1836.— <persRef ref="fairfield-john">Fairfield</persRef> gave notice
							that he would on Friday call up the Northeastern boundary Bill— The
							territorial Bills were again taken up— That for creating a surveyor
							General in Wisconsin, and that for ascertaining the Southern boundary of
							the Territory were passed— The Bill constituting the Territory of Ioway
							was largely debated— <persRef ref="downing-charles">Downing</persRef>,
							the delegate from Florida moved the Previous Question but it was not
							sustained. <persRef ref="bond-william2">Bond</persRef> had moved to
							reduce the Salary of the Governor proposed in the Bill at 2000 dollars
							as Governor, and 1500 dollars as Superintendent of Indian Affairs to
							1500 as Governor, and 1000 as Indian Superintendent— The sums reported
							in the Bill were declared by the Chairman of the Committee, <persRef
								ref="bronson-isaac">Bronson</persRef>, to be the same established by
							Law, and now received by the <persRef ref="dodge-henry">Governor of
								Wisconsin</persRef>. Bond called for the yeas and nays, and
							intending to vote against the reduction, I gave my reasons for the vote;
							and commented upon the spurious economy which vents itself in charges of
							extravagance and declamations against executive patronage, and contents
							itself practically with nibbling at the Salaries of subordinate
							Officers— I took the occasion while up of answering <persRef
								ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson’s</persRef> declaration that he
							would vote for no new Northern Territory, while Northern fanatics were
							pouring in Petitions against the annexation to this Union of the great
							and glorious Republic of Texas— I objected to the peculiar glory of
							Texas which consisted in having made of a Land of Freemen, and land of
							Slaves— I said we had too much of that sort of glory already—and was
							proceeding to illustrate by the atchievements of the late Philadelphia
							Mobs when the stunning cries of order emboldened the <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> to order me to take my Seat—
							Thompson intreated that I might be allowed to proceed, insisting that I
							was strictly in order— But I had said as much as I wished to say then,
							and I did not appeal from the Speaker’s decision— I had some sparring
							with <persRef ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef>, about the size of
							the new Territory— It was finally found that Bond’s amendment put the
							Salary of the Governor of the Territory of Ioway at the same sum now
							allowed to the Governor of Wisconsin— The amendment was accepted and the
							Bill after further discussion passed by yeas and nays 113 to 51—
							Committee of the whole again on sundry territorial Bills, reported to
							the House and passed with some exceptions.— Adjourned about 5.— <persRef
								key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>
							was here in the Evening— I received a Letter from <persRef

							informing me that my nephew <persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph Harrod

							special privilege to <persRef ref="lamar-gazaway">G. B Lamar</persRef>
							to import two iron-boats and to remit the bonds of the Georgia Steam

							present except myself incline against the general Law; and the special

							Thursday.— H.R.U.S.— <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha"
								>Whittlesey’s</persRef> transformation of a Resolution reported by
							the Committee of Commerce directing the <persRef ref="poinsett-joel"
								>Secretary of War</persRef> to send to the House at the next Session
							copies of Surveys in his Office of Lakes Erie and Michigan, into a joint

							Chesapeake Bay, Albemarle, Pamlico and Core Sounds, and maps and charts
							of such Surveys to be made; without one cent of appropriation came up,
							and ran through to the question upon its third reading without one word
							of opposition— I then rose and observed that approving exceedingly the
							object of the Resolution, I thought it should be in the form of a Bill,
							with an Appropriation— That the Chesapeake Bay, and the North-Carolina
							Sounds were superfluous, being already included in the general survey of
							the Coast, and as this measure would be a gigantic stride in the system
							of internal improvement, it would be well for the House to understand
							what they were about in passing this Resolution— Some of the Southern
							internal improvement haters were startled, but it was too late— <persRef
								ref="cushman-samuel">Cushman</persRef>, was in favour of the
							Resolution and moved the previous Question, insisting that the
							Resolution would not involve one cent of expense— <persRef
								ref="mallory-francis">Mallory</persRef> called for the yeas and nays
							and they were refused— <persRef ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef>
							moved to recommit to the Committee of Commerce, to report a general
							survey— No!— A Resolution which if its import had been understood would
							have raised Months of debate, and then certainly rejected, was now
							driven through by the shrewdness of Elisha Whittlesey, and the dogged
							mortification at the anti-internal improvement men, at their own failure
							to detect the mine sprung upon them by this Resolution— The gravity of
							Whittlesey and the stolidity of Cushman in maintaining that it involved
							no expense were diverting. Mallory intimated that the Resolution was
							smuggled through the house, which was resented with great indignation by
							Whittlesey, who scourged the Southern men, for first lumbering his
							Resolution with Chesapeake Bay and North-Carolina Sounds, <hi
								rend="italic">and</hi>
							<pb n="518" type="ms"/>and then urging the weight of the Resolution to
							break it down— It was passed by the previous question, and without yeas

							suspension of the rules to offer a Resolution to suspend for two years
							the provisions in the acts of 14. April and 23. June 1836. which forbid

							5 dollars— On the yeas and nays the <persRef

								ref="phillips-stephen">Phillips</persRef> who did not vote, and
								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> and myself, who voted
							against the suspension, voted for it— The vote for the suspension was 96
							to 91—not two thirds— The rule was of course not suspended; but there
							was an ascertained majority for the measure— <persRef
								ref="carter-william2">Carter</persRef> of Tennessee attempted to
							obtain a special order for the Bill to extend the pension system, but
							failed— <persRef ref="fairfield-john">Fairfield</persRef> moved to go

								>Craig</persRef> of Virginia, was Chairman of the Committee.
							Fairfield and <persRef ref="garland-rice">Garland</persRef> of
							Louisiana, rose and addressed him simultaneously—but though Fairfield
							had moved to go into the Committee, and stated the object of his motion
							to take up the Boundary Bill, the Chairman gave the floor to Garland,
							who moved to take up the land pre-emption Bill, and it was taken up—and
							debated—various amendments offered until about 4 O’Clock when the
							Committee rose, with a prospect of much more future debate—adjourned
							about 5— I came home with a heavy heart— Evening visit from <persRef
								ref="daveis-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Daveis</persRef>, and long conversation with him on the North-eastern
							boundary— I told him the administration would not suffer the boundary
							Bill to pass and that they ought in candour to say so to the Maine
							delegation. I inferred it conclusively from the incidents of this
							morning in the House.</p>

							<pb n="519" type="ms"/>could not forego the glory of conquering by his
							Speech, and promising to detain the Committee only a very few minutes,
							and had been about half an hour in full blast of a Speech without

							that the hour of one had arrived and the Committee must rise— There was

							insisted upon the Committee’s rising, and they did, and reported
							progress— Lincoln moved a suspension of the Rules to go into Committee
							again; which was done, with the same Chair-man— Lincoln abridged and
							finished his Speech— He called upon <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
								>Cushing</persRef> to testify to the bad construction of the Custom

							Cushing was irresistibly facetious, and while up, gave his advice to
							take down the embryo Palace of the Treasury Department, and build a
							plain, brick fire-proof, republican work house for the Department in its
							place.— Then there was a desultory debate— Amendments proposed—a motion
							to strike out the enacting clause of the Bill 44 to 63 no quorum—then 59
							to 66—rejected—sundry amendments adopted and reported with the Bill to
							the House— <persRef ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod Williams</persRef>
							then moved to lay the Bill on the table and a call of the House— The

							Sundry Bills from the Senate were twice read and referred to Committees—
								<persRef ref="johnson-henry">Henry Johnson</persRef> moved an

						<p>Second day of high Summer heat— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">My

							racking cough— Sleepless Nights in Succession— <persRef
								ref="thomas-john7">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas</persRef>
							in attendance twice a day— I could not reach the Capitol till 1/2 past
							9. Made an apology to <persRef ref="perrine-henry">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Perrine</persRef>, and engaged to meet
							him at the chamber of the Committee of Agriculture next Tuesday at 1/2
							past 9— I met <persRef ref="sherwood-henry">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Sherwood</persRef> with <persRef ref="dwight-sereno"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sereno E. Dwight</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cushing</persRef> in the chamber of the Committee of Manufactures,
							and heard till 11. their exposition of the discovery which D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sherwood claims to have made, and of the
							machines invented by him for ascertaining the Latitude and Longitude of
							places by the variation of the magnetic needle.— I have not Science
							enough to understand it; but as the elements of his discoveries, he
							claims to have achieved what all preceding writers on magnetism had
							conceded to be impracticable—that is to magnetise an iron ring— He had
							with him two magnetised rings— He avers that the magnetic Poles of this
							Globe are upon the Arctic and Antarctic circles—and that the variations
							of the magnetic needle have a range East and West from the Poles of 23
							degrees and 28 minutes— He reduces the Laws of Variation to fixed and
							unalterable rules, and makes the variation of the Needle and the
							Latitude and Longitude of any given spot on the globe mutual
							demonstrations of each other— There is great ingenuity in the invention
							of the instrument, but I comprehended very imperfectly its adaptation to
							the theory— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sherwood wants the patronage
							of Congress for the publication of his book, and remuneration for the
							expenses and labours of his researches. He saw last Evening <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>,
							who took a deep interest in his invention— He proposed that it should be
							explained to a select meeting of members of both Houses—named several
							members of the Senate, and suggested that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cushing and I should name such members of the House, as would take
							pleasure in attending such a meeting— I marked down the names of several
							members of the House, and gave the list to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cushing to select from the list, and add others as he should
							see fit— I told him that for my part I should be glad if our whole
							delegation were of the number— At 11. O’Clock on going in to the House
							we found they had been an hour in Session— <persRef ref="titus-obadiah"
								>Titus</persRef> of New-York—<persRef ref="pope-john">Pope</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="bond-william2">Bond</persRef> had successively moved
							the suspension of the Rules, for Resolutions to fix a day to consider
							Bills, extending the benefit of the Pension Laws—but all without
							success— <persRef ref="birdsall-samuel">Birdsall</persRef> from the
							Committee of Revolutionary claims had reported adversely to several
							memorials and among the rest to that of the <persRef
								ref="thomas-john8;thomas-nathaniel3">Heirs</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="thomas-john9">Major General John Thomas</persRef> for Bounty
							Lands— <persRef ref="thomas-francis">Thomas</persRef> Chairman of the
							Judiciary Committee had reported without amendment a penal Bill from the
							Senate. A number of private Bills which had been postponed to this day
							were now taken up, briefly discussed and almost all rejected— Upon the
							Bill for the relief of the representatives of <persRef
								ref="vigo-francis">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Francis
								Vigo</persRef>, the Committee of the whole had struck out a clause,
							allowing interest to three or four times the amount of the original
							debt— It was one case of a multitude in which the select Committee had
							allowed from 50 to 60 years of interest—all which the Committee of the
							whole had invariably struck out— This case was supposed to be stronger
							than all the rest, because the Sovereign State of Virginia <hi
								rend="italic">had</hi>
							<pb n="521" type="ms"/>had a concern in it— In this debate I took a part
							for concurring with the Committee of the whole to strike out the
							allowance of interest, and the House did concur by yeas and nays 86 to
							56— Sundry other Bills were taken up and postponed, when upon a question
							to concur with the Committee of the whole in striking out the enacting
							clause of one of them the vote was 46 to 19. only 65 members voting— It
							was just after 2 O’Clock, and the House adjourned for want of a Quorum.
							I had ordered <persRef ref="nelson-thomas3">Thomas</persRef> to come for
							me at 4. the heat of the Sun being too intense for a walk of two miles
							in the middle of the day; I therefore remained after the adjournment, in
							my Seat, and began a Letter in answer to one from <persRef
								ref="bacheler-origen">Origen Bacheler</persRef>— I had written only
							the first page when <persRef ref="fletcher-isaac">Isaac
								Fletcher</persRef> a member from Vermont and <persRef ref="u"
								>Williams</persRef> a member from Maine came, and sat down by me,
							and commenced a conversation with me, which continued till past 4. It
							consisted entirely of enquiries made by them, about men and things with
							which I have been heretofore conversant in Europe, and in this Country,
							and of my answers which were garrulous— They both told me they were
							natives of Massachusetts—Williams, of the town of Plymouth— He said he
							had been there last Summer, and in passing by my house had seen that
							built by <persRef key="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> upon the Hill.
							Immediately after they left me I found Thomas waiting for me and came
							home— Evening warm.</p>

							died for the ungodly”— The atonement. There is an artificial system of

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler averred that the whole

							ungodly? why not make them godly without dying? why are any ungodly,
							after he died with intent to save them? How can the omnipotence of God
							be reconciled with the perverseness of man?— How is it possible that so

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler is from <persRef ref="paul"
									>S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>— Of all the

								<persRef ref="jotham">Jotham</persRef>, <persRef ref="ahaz"
								>Ahaz</persRef> and <persRef ref="hezekiah">Hezekiah</persRef> kings
							of Judah— A series of visions during a space of nearly half a
							century—predicting the ruin of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, and the
							subsequent glories of the Messiah, and of his kingdom— It is the most
							cheering book in the world to those who believe in the improvable
							capacity of the human race— It promises the final extinction of War and
							Slavery <hi rend="italic">from</hi>
							<pb n="522" type="ms"/>from the face of the Earth— It is a collection of
							prophesies to which the occasions whence they originated are merely
							incidental— The 6<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter tells of a
							vision in the year that king Uzziah died— The 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> in the days of Ahaz— Subsequent chapters are prophesies
							against Babylon, Moab, Syria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Assyria, Edom, Tyre,
							Ephraim (the kingdom of Israel) till the 36<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Chapter, which commences with the Assyrian invasion of
							Judah in the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> year of Hezekiah— This
							same event is related in the second Book of Kings 18<hi

								>d.</hi> Book of Chronicles— The sickness and recovery of
							Hezekiah—the embassy from <persRef ref="merodachbaladan"
								>Merodach-Baladan</persRef>, king of Babylon—the kind reception of
							them by Hezekiah, who shews them his Treasures, and the appalling
							prophesy of the Babylonian captivity with the meek if not abject
							resignation of Hezekiah, conclude with the 39<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> chapter, immediately followed by that unparalleled
							sublimity of the 40<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter “Comfort ye,
							comfort ye my People”—and the proclamation of the Messiah— The reign of
							Uzziah, or Azariah began 810 years before Christ—that of Jotham 758—of
							Ahaz 742—of Hezekiah 726. and of <persRef ref="manasseh"
								>Manasseh</persRef> 698— The prophesy of the 6<hi rend="superscript"

								rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter in 713. and that of the 39<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter about 710. There is no prophesy
							of Isaiah of a later date than this— There is nothing of the <persRef
								ref="aristotle">Aristotelian</persRef> doctrine of the unities in
							the composition of the Hebrew prophets. The Book of Isaiah is a
							collection of Rhapsodies, delivered in a course of 50 years—prophesying
							first events to happen in and to the kingdom of Judah, and other
							cotemporaneous Asiatic and African Nations—but secondly the advent—the
							life and death of Christ, and the universal prevalence of his dominion
							upon earth— We know not why these two descriptions of prophesies were
							thus associated together. It is not clear that Isaiah himself or any
							other of the Prophets of the Old Testament, had any conception of the
							manner in which their predictions were to be fulfilled— More than 700
							years were to pass away, when the 40<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>

						<p>A woman named <persRef ref="pierce-elizabeth">Elizabeth Pierce</persRef>
							had come without money, from Rhode-Island, in search of Land claims,
							without knowing what they were, or how or where, or when to apply for
							them— She had applied to <persRef ref="burges-tristam">Tristam
								Burges</persRef>, who had given her in writing the name of some
							other person to apply to— She had written to <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Daniel Webster</persRef>, whose answer
							promising his aid she shewed me—and she came to me with a list of names
							and sums of final Settlement certificates in the revolutionary War— I
							referred her to the <persRef ref="whitcomb-james">Commissioner</persRef>
							of the Land-Office whose name I gave her and told her where the Office
							was— At last she asked for <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef>, who I told her was
							confined to her bed by illness— She intimated that what she wanted was
							money— She afterwards came again to the Capitol—had me called from my
							Seat in the House—shewed me another set of sums without names, which she
							said was <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
							<pb n="523" type="ms"/>all she could get at the Land Office— That M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster had been very short with her and
							told her he had very important business to attend to; and that she had
							not a cent of money— I gave her a five dollar bill, and advised her to
							apply again at the Land Office— I attended at the Committee of
							Manufactures <persRef ref="slade-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Slade</persRef> was the only other member of the Committee who
							attended— No Quorum, and we adjourned to Thursday— The States and
							Territories were called for Resolutions beginning with Wisconsin— The
							rule of alternating on Mondays the Call for Petitions and Resolutions,
							with that excluding debate upon either on any of those days, has proved
							a great accommodation to the receipt both of Petitions and Resolutions—
							Yet they were trammelled this day by the special order to take up the
							business relating to the District of Columbia, at 12. O’Clock— The
							States were called through for Resolutions but not for Petitions A
							number of the workmen upon the public buildings sent and called me out
							from my seat, and asked me to present a petition from them stating their
							distress from the suspension of their work, and praying for relief— When
							12. O’Clock came, <persRef ref="bouldin-james">Bouldin</persRef>,
							bustled for the special order, and moved to go into Committee of the
							House— I asked leave to present a Petition. He objected— I said it
							related to the business of the District of Columbia— He then withdrew
							his objection— I presented the Petition, and moved that it should be
							read— It was read. I moved it should be printed, and referred to the
							Committee of the whole who had the business of the District before them—
								<persRef ref="thomas-francis">Thomas</persRef> moved to take up the
							motion of reconsideration pending upon the Treasury building Bill, and
							by settling that question, put the workmen again immediately upon
							wages.— He carried it by a vote of two thirds— <persRef
								ref="harrison-albert">Harrison</persRef> moved to lay the motion to
							reconsider on the table—lost 86 to 100— <persRef ref="yell-archibald"
								>Yell</persRef> called for the yeas and nays on the
							reconsideration—103 to 91— Motion to lay the Bill on the table, lost.
							Amendments proposed. <persRef ref="cushman-samuel">Cushman</persRef>
							moves to lay the Bill and amendments on the table—lost, 95 to 98— More
							discussion on the Bill and amendments, and then another motion by
								<persRef ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef> to lay the whole on
							the table—carried 94 to 91— It was at last a close party vote: and it
							was determined to continue the building as begun, to escape the reproach
							of having spent so much money upon it, and then taking it down— <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> stung them into the final vote, by
							calling it the House that Jack built; and running a parallel between its
							unfinished unfinishable half erected ruin, and the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew;vanburen-martin">late and present
								administration</persRef>— Between the first vote of 86 to 100 and
							the last of 94 to 91. The mutes of the administration party were moving
							round the house and rallying the stragglers to the fold. The building
							will be continued at an enormous expense—but whether ever finished is
							doubtful, and whether it will stand if finished is more so— It is now
							unequivocally an administration building, though several administration
							members voted for taking it down, and about an equal number of the
							opposition against it— Wise’s house that Jack built settled the
							question— I offered a Resolution that Wednesday the 20<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> at one
							O’Clock be assigned for the consideration of Bills from the Senate
							numbered 147. 175 and 176. reported by the Committee of Manufactures
							without amendment— The <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> said
							it would require a vote of two thirds— I explained that these were bills
							for the remission of duties, peculiarly <hi rend="italic"
								>interesting</hi>
							<pb n="524" type="ms"/>interesting to the States of Georgia and Alabama;
							but no one of the members from either of those States supported me, and
							the vote for the assignment was 61 to 68— Among the Resolutions offered
							was a series of 8 upon the late Mississippi elections, and the
							proceedings of the House upon them, which lie over and were ordered to
							be printed—presented by <persRef ref="prentiss-seargent">S. S.
								Prentiss</persRef>— <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef>
							moved a call on the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Sec<hi
									rend="superscript">y.</hi> of the Treasury</persRef> for returns
							of receipts and payments in the several States in 1837.— <persRef
								ref="hopkins-george">Hopkins</persRef> moved to add, in 1833–34–35.
							and I moved to add in 1836— So the resolution passed, <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> moved an instruction of
							enquiry to the Committee of Manufactures concerning books— Several other
							Resolutions were offered, and adopted or laid over, on various subjects
							interesting or otherwise— Explanation about the Bill for the relief of
								<persRef ref="wickham-william">William Wickham</persRef>— A
							reconveyance gratuitous to him of a Fishery, appurtenant to land which
							he sold three or four years since to U.S— The moment the district of
							Columbia Bills were taken up, there was no quorum— Two thirds of the day
							were consumed in counting the members present, finding no quorum;
							reporting the fact to the house— Motions to adjourn; calls of the house;
							sending for stragglers—making just a Quorum: Going into Committee again,
							and Petrikin making questions to count votes and find no quorum— Through
							all this Bouldin by dint of confused agitation and humble supplication
							succeeded to get two very insignificant Bills relating to the District,
							reported to the House, which about 7 O’Clock adjourned. When the motion
							to rise and report the Bills was made Thomas moved to take up the Bill
							prohibiting the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Corporation from issuing Bills
							of less than 5 dollars. <persRef ref="underwood-joseph"
								>Underwood</persRef> the Chairman decided that after the motion to

							Successor, and late Speaker of the House in the Virginia Legislature. I
							contested the point on the practice of the House, but did not appeal

							Relations; before whom <persRef ref="sherwood-henry">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Sherwood</persRef> with the
							assistance of <persRef ref="dwight-sereno">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Sereno Dwight</persRef>, explained again the theory of
							his magnetic discoveries.— That he has made discoveries cannot be
							doubted— That of magnetising a ring for example— But whether the
							magnetic poles are on the arctic and antarctic circles—whether the range
							of variation of the needle is 23 degrees 28 minutes and above all
							whether the variation is in a straight line from the Poles to the
							equator so as infallibly to indicate the Latitude and Longitude of every
							place, there is not yet sufficient evidence to shew. The immense
							magnitude of the claim requires a proportional certitude of proof. I
							cannot resist incredulity. H.R.U.S. <persRef ref="grennell-george"
								>Grennell</persRef>, by suspension of the rules carried a motion
							that from and after this day, the House would daily take a recess from 2

								<persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">Elisha Whittlesey</persRef> moved a

								>Casey</persRef> of Illinois, and <persRef ref="crary-isaac"
								>Crary</persRef> of Michigan followed Mason, and gave the whole
							theory of the Settlers on the public Lands—which is that the only just

							as well as social— That every man has a right to take up unoccupied
							land; and having taken it up has the right to purchase the right of the
							community at the lowest price, and in preference to all others. Crary
							compared the right of the Squatter on Land, to the right of the
							fisherman upon the Ocean— It was a common right, and the fisherman was a
							squatter upon the water, just as the Settler is a squatter upon the
							land— This is the tone of opinion throughout the new Western States, and
							so thoroughly is the sense of right and wrong in the human heart
							subservient to the physical wants of the human animal, that this utter
							perversion of the elementary principle of property passes throughout the
							western region for irrefragable logic— I take no part in this debate—
							The public Lands are irrecoverably lost, and it were a worthless and a

							came in while I was there— H.R.U.S. Reports of Committees— Legare from
							the Committee of Foreign Affairs. presented his Report upon the
							Petitions from the Peace Societies, which he had shewn me, and which I
							had rend— Ten thousand extra copies of it were ordered to be printed,
							opposed only by <persRef ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef>. Then
								<persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> from the same

							consideration of all the Resolutions of State Legislatures, and of the
							Memorials and Petitions of individuals relating to the annexation of
							Texas to the United States, and that they be laid on the Table.—
								<persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> another member of the
							Committee, objected to the report, and offered a Resolution that the
							report be recommitted with instructions to report upon the merits of the
							Resolutions and Memorials and Petitions referred—some debate arose— I
							enquired, if the Committee had given five minutes of consideration to
							the Resolutions of State Legislatures, and the Multitudes of Petitions
							and Memorials referred to them— Droomgoole immediately rose and denied
							my right to ask the question and said he would not be catechised by me—
							I said that was enough for me— The refusal to answer would warrant me
							and the People in the inference that the Committee never did consider
							the subject referred to them— <persRef ref="carter-william2"
								>Carter</persRef> of Tennessee, opposed Cushing’s Resolution; and
								<persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef> of South-Carolina
							supported it— <persRef ref="cushman-samuel">Cushman</persRef> said a
							proposition to annex an independent republic to this Union should come
							from that republic— No such proposition was before the House— The debate
							was irregular, and he moved the previous question— Confusion and
							Laughter. I asked him to withdraw the motion, to allow an answer to his
							Speech— He refused; but the vote upon his motion was 74 to 81. no
							second; and <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef>, Chairman of
							the Committee of foreign Affairs took the floor— The hour had elapsed,
							and the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union took up again
							the pre-emption Bill— <persRef ref="chapman-reuben">Chapman</persRef> of
							Alabama and <persRef ref="prentiss-seargent">Prentiss</persRef> of
							Mississippi made long Speeches in favour of the Bill, and <persRef
								ref="robertson-john2">Robertson</persRef> of Virginia part of a

							often obliged to leave my Seat, and go to breathe at one of the windows—
								<persRef ref="daveis-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> C. S.
								Daveis</persRef> called me from my Seat, and enquired where he could
							find, my discussion of the right to the fisheries to which Howard of
							Maryland had lately referred with commendation in a Speech— This
							commendation had been excessive; but I did not know to what he had
							specially alluded— I asked Howard what it was and he said it was the
							discussion in the pamphlet I had published— I took M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Daveis into the Library, and there found
							the pamphlet— The Duplicate Letters, the Fisheries and the Mississippi,
							and pointed out to him page 184. the passage to which Howard had
							referred. I shewed him<hi rend="strikethrough">self</hi> also my two

								>Gales</persRef> and <persRef ref="seaton-william">Seatons</persRef>

								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							At the meeting after the recess Robertson finished his Speech against

							Cushing avowed the most licentious of the doctrines subversive of

							individual occupancy He takes his cue from Webster, and hazards opinions
							unpopular now in our State and Section, but which he knows will prevail
							here, and against which he sees that all resistance is vain— <persRef

							<pb n="527" type="ms"/>adopted or rejected— Two or three votes taken
							without a Quorum, and at last by common consent the bill and amendments

							I was instructed to prepare a Bill, remitting the duties on iron for two
							Steamboats, imported by <persRef ref="lamar-gazaway">G. B.
								Lamar</persRef> and the bonds on one for the Georgia Steam boat
							Company— Resolution of 11. June instructing the Committee to enquire
							into the expediency of providing by Law for adding to the Treasury
							returns of commerce and Navigation the books produced in the United
							States—to lie for further consideration, and to enquire what <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cushing</persRef>, who offered the Resolution, understands by Books
							produced in the United States.— H.R.U.S. Great part of the morning hour,
							was consumed in Motions to suspend the Rules, to fix a day of
							adjournment, and to make a special order for considering the Bills to
							extend the Pension Laws—lost by yeas and nays—the first 82 to 55. the
							second 88 to 81. in neither case two thirds— The Texas question coming
							up, <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy Thompson</persRef> moved an
							Amendment to Cushing’s Resolution—to recommit the report of the
							Committee with instructions—to strike out all after that word and
							insert, “to report a joint Resolution directing the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> to take the necessary
							steps for the annexation of Texas to the United States, as soon as it
							can be done consistently with the Treaty stipulations of this
							Government.”— <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> then began
							a Speech chiefly in answer to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cushing’s
							remarks in support of his Resolution to recommit the report— His main
							argument was that there was no proposition for the annexation of Texas
							before the house; but that argument now failed— Thompson’s proposition
							having brought a proposition directly before the House— Howard said he
							regretted that <persRef ref="cushman-samuel">Cushman’s</persRef> motion
							for the previous Question yesterday did not prevail— That the
							proposition from Texas itself had been promptly rejected— And he
							intimated that Thompson by precipitating the recognition of the Texian
							Independence had greatly increased the difficulty and retarded the
							possibility of effecting the annexation— Howard had not finished when
							the hour expired and the pre-emption Bill was taken up— It was debated
							the whole day with much pertinacity, and <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2"
								>Governor Lincoln</persRef>, the only member of the Committee on the
							public Lands, representing an interest to preserve them as the property
							of the People, obtained with the assistance of <persRef
								ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> two or three palliative
							amendments, which I believe not worth contending for— The thirst of a
							tyger for blood, is the fittest emblem of the rapacity with which the
							members of all the new States fly at the Public Lands— The constituents
							upon whom they depend are all Settlers, or tame and careless spectators
							of the pillage— They are themselves enormous speculators and
							Land-jobbers— It were a vain attempt to resist them here— The heat was
							so intense, that I could not remain in my Seat— I found on my table a
							note from <persRef ref="daveis-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Daveis</persRef> expressing a wish that I would go into the Senate
							chamber, and hear <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Webster</persRef> speaking upon the North-eastern
							boundary question— I went accordingly and heard him upon <hi
								rend="italic">the</hi>
							<pb n="528" type="ms"/>the Northwest Angle of Nova-Scotia— His
							exposition was clear and unquestionable, but his hearers apparently took
							little interest in it— <persRef ref="preston-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Preston</persRef> to whom I returned
							the sketch of a projected picture for the Rotunda, which he had some
							time since left with me, pressed me to take his seat as he was going
							out— I took it—<persRef ref="buchanan-james2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Buchanan</persRef> came behind me and whispered—the
							worst of it is, there is no doubt—an oracular sentence of which I did
							not ask the explanation— Buchanan is chairman of the Senate’s Committee
							of Forign Affairs, and when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster
							finished, moved to postpone the subject till Saturday when he would make
							some proposition— I then left the Senate chamber, and found the members
							of the House—dispersing for the recess—which I passed in the chamber of
							the Committee of Manufactures writing part of a Letter— After the
							recess, the pre-emption Bill was again taken up and passed— Governor
							Lincoln and Briggs, succeeded in carrying amendments confining the
							operation of the Bill to the benefit of actual bone fide settlers— They
							were vehemently opposed by <persRef ref="crary-isaac">Crary</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="casey-zadok">Casey</persRef>, and the Western members,
							whose tactics are to abuse without mercy the speculator in debate, and
							to oppose every possible expedient to guard against them— <persRef
								ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> moved to recommit the
							Bill to a Committee of a member from each State with instructions to
							report a land Bill, for the distribution of the proceeds of the public
							Lands—which after an abortive motion from Cushman for the previous
							question, was rejected by yeas and nays—79 to 123. <persRef
								ref="may-william">May</persRef> proposed an amendment giving a
							general license to every one to settle on the public Lan<unclear>ds</unclear> and after a
							year’s occupancy, a right of pre-emption to one quarter Section. This
							and sundry other amendments were rejected, as was repeatedly the
							Previous Question; but that was at last moved by <persRef
								ref="boon-ratliff">Boon</persRef> and carried—the vote for
							engrossment was 132 to 70. and that for the final passage of the Bill
							107 to 52— Adjourned after 9. in the evening—10 when I got home.
							Excessive heat drove me frequently to the windows for breath.</p>

							and prayed generally for relief— They had been set to work the very next
							day, and that was considered as a compliance with the prayer of their

							by next Monday, I would present it, and do what I could to promote its

								ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole’s</persRef> report concerning Texas
							is now the regular business of the morning hour— Before <persRef
								ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> resumed his argument I

								Thompson’s</persRef> Amendment—to strike out all after the word
							Instructions and insert to report the following Resolutions— That the

							Government of the United States but has been reserved to the People—
							That any attempt by Act of Congress or by Treaty to annex the Republic
							of Texas to this Union would be an usurpation of power, which it would
							be the right, and the duty of the Free People of the Union to resist and
							annul— This, being an amendment to an amendment gives me the right to
							the floor immediately after Howard— He finished his Speech against the
							recommitment, and all the instructions— <persRef ref="petrikin-david"
								>Petrikin</persRef> moved to lay the whole subject on the Table—but
							withdrew the motion, first for an explanation from <persRef
								ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef>, and afterwards generally by
							request— Waddy Thompson told me two or three days since that we should
							have the Texas discussion, for that it had been promised to him. All the
							South Carolinians desire it— I enquired of Howard as Chairman of the
							Committee whether he sustained Dromgoole in his refusal to answer
							whether the Committee had taken into consideration the Resolutions,
							Petitions and Memorials relating to Texas referred to them by the House—
							Howard answered that he did— That it was disrespectful to the Committee
							to ask such questions, and he should go the whole length of the
							Gentleman from Virginia, and refuse to answer— I then put the question
							to <persRef ref="hoffman-josiah">Ogden Hoffman</persRef> another member
							of the Committee who was standing before me, and said I should be glad
							to put it to every member of the Committee—but the <persRef
								ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> interposed and anounced the
							orders of the day, without allowing even Hoffman time to answer— This
							gave me however the floor for tomorrow— The house then went into the
							consideration of private business; to which it was impossible for me to
							give much attention— <persRef ref="daveis-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daveis</persRef> the agent from the
							State of Maine asked to have some conversation with me during the

							of Manufactures: giving me an account of his conversations with <persRef
								ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Poinsett</persRef> on the boundary question— With <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef> he is utterly disgusted— He
							consulted me with great anxiety, about what he was to do, and wrote down
							a proviso, which he had thoughts of proposing to modify the Bill for
							surveying the boundary— I gave him freely my advice—which was to let
							such proviso come from the administration side— He said that <persRef
								ref="williams-reuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Reuel
								Williams</persRef> was convinced that the Bill would not pass— After
							the recess there was a call of the House and an exact Quorum answered to

						<p>H.R.U.S. After some little trickery to consume the time of the house in
							motions out of order and to suspend the rules, for other purposes, I
							obtained the floor, on the motion to recommit the report of the
							Committee of Foreign Relations concerning Texas— <persRef
								ref="tillinghast-joseph">Tillinghast</persRef> asked me to give way
							for the reading of the Resolutions from the Legislature of Rhode-Island
							against the annexation; I told him it was my purpose to notice them and
							have them read in the progress of their remarks on this
							occasion—whereupon he desisted and I commenced my argument, and
							continued until the expiration of the hour when the orders of the day
							were announced and private business was taken up— I confined myself
							entirely to the points made by <persRef ref="dromgoole-george"
								>Dromgoole</persRef>, <persRef ref="howard-benjamin"
								>Howard</persRef>, and <persRef ref="legare-hugh">Legare</persRef>,

							anxious even to dejection with regard to the mode of treating it best
							suited to the <hi rend="strikethrough">magnitude</hi> success of the
							cause— Instead of private business, the day was occupied with two Bills
							from the Senate relating to the explosions of Steamboats— At the recess
								<persRef ref="kemble-gouverneur">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gouverneur Kemble</persRef> went with me to <persRef

							for a dinner, nor even for a collation; but with relishes for tasting
							the wines— Cold Tongue, Cheese, Bologna Sausages, Olives &amp;c—and a
							few very fine looking Strawberries were handed round of which each would
							have been able to take one or two. The President Soon withdrew, and
							after tasting six or seven variety among the wines, of which two were
							called Champagne, I retired also with G. Kemble, and went and dined with
							him— Howard was there and immediately after dinner went off with
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Latrobe</persRef>,
							by the Cars to Baltimore— There was another young man who dined with us.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kemble returned with me to the House,
							which we found in Committee of the whole <persRef ref="davee-thomas"
								>Davee</persRef> in the Chair, on the two Bills from the Senate
							purposing to guard against Steamboat explosions— An absurd
							Constitutional scruple of <persRef ref="robertson-john2"
								>Robertson</persRef> of Virginia, led him to offer an Amendment
							excepting Steam boats navigating within the waters of a State—and this
							made a debate of half a day, and actually prevented for this time the
							passage of the Bill— Robertson’s amendment and others congenial to it
							bred in the compost of fermenting debate were rejected, but the passage
							of the Bill was postponed— The other Bill was reported to the House and
							passed— Adjourned at 1/2 past 6 I heard for half an hour the Marine
							Corps band from the Eastern front steps of the Capitol and walked home—
							I took out from the Library the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> volume
							of <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">Jefferson’s</persRef> writings, to
							use in my argument— The 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> volume of both
