								>Charles’s</persRef> House, and which is now continued till it comes

								<persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Daniel Greenleaf’s</persRef> wharf, and bathed and swam about 5
							minutes—but the effect of those two baths has been to bring out a

						<p>Hingham— Cohasset— Perch fishing— Tranquility Grove.</p>
						<p>With <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> in his Gig to
							Hingham 16 minutes to Bent’s point Bridge. 16. minutes to the next
							Bridge and Toll-house— 16 minutes to <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring’s</persRef> House at Hingham—
							There at 7. A.M found <persRef ref="brooks-charles">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> Charles Brooks</persRef>— He went
							with my Son, and I with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring to
							Cohasset for a fishing party— There were no boats ready— Found at the
							House at Cohasset, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Nichols</persRef> the blind old Lady of 82, who reminded me of my
							visit to her, on the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of August last
							year— I had forgotten the day, but she remembered it because it was her
							birth-day— She said she had lived with seven generations of the human
							family—distinctly remembering her great-grandfather who died at the age
							of 94, when she was 6 years of age— Then her grandfather and father—her
							children grand children, and great grandchildren; of whom she has 8; all
							born since she became blind—nine years since.— She prides herself much
							upon her age, and is quite intelligent, and cheerful— They took me on to
							the further beach, where I went out in a row-boat, exchanged on the
							water for another— I had three companions, all unknown to me; but whose
							names I learnt by their discourse with one another— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi><space/><persRef ref="u">Lincoln</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barnes</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Foster</persRef>— We
							fished between 2 and 3 hours, changing four or five times our position,
							caught each about one dozen white and read perch—and only one
							mackerel—landed soon after noon and returned to the Nichols house to
							dine upon <hi rend="italic">chowder</hi>
							<pb n="566" type="ms"/>chowder— The party at dinner consisted of more
							than twenty persons, several of whom I did not know, or did not
							recognize— Among them were <persRef ref="richardson-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Richardson</persRef> the Minister, my
							predecessor in Congress, <persRef ref="doane-james">J. C.
								Doane</persRef> of Cohasset, <persRef
								ref="lincoln-solomon;lincoln-jotham;lincoln-jairus">Solomon, Jotham
								and Jairus Lincoln</persRef>, <persRef ref="sprague-peleg">Peleg
								Sprague</persRef>,<space/><persRef ref="gould-benjamin"
								>Gould</persRef> formerly teacher of the Latin School in Boston and
							others— We dined temperately at 2. and after a couple of idle hours
							returned to Hingham— On our way stopp’d at the Old Colony House and saw
							my old fellow-student and friend <persRef ref="pickman-benjamin"
								>Benjamin Pickman</persRef>, now 75 years of age—almost a wreck— He
							has lost <persRef ref="pickman-anstiss">his wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="pickman-benjamin2">Son</persRef>—<persRef
								ref="pickman-elizabeth;pickman-martha">his daughters</persRef> have
							married and departed from him—he has left Salem, and now lives with
								<persRef ref="pickman-hannah">his Son’s widow</persRef> in Boston—
							He says he was now driven by the heat of the Season from Boston, where
							he feared it would wholly break him down, and took lodgings at the Old
							Colony House, not being able to find any at a private House— He is so
							deaf that he finds it difficult to hold conversation, but says that he
							has more comfort of life residing in Boston with his Son’s widow, than
							he could have had in his solitude at Salem, or indeed any where in this
							world. I returned with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring to his
							house, and thence at 6. O’Clock went with him to Tranquility grove,
							where was an assemblage chiefly of Ladies at a Pic-Nic Tea-party.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring had told me this morning that there
							would probably be as many as 500 Ladies there— That he had told them
							they must not expect a Speech from me; but he hoped that when he should
							introduce me to the company, I would make a few remarks— I have a
							natural antipathy and utter unfitness for extemporaneous public
							Speaking, without a topic, or with so worthless a topic as myself— And
							often as I have been called to do it, every time of going through the
							operation is more irksome to me than the last before— All the pleasure
							of my fishing party was poisoned by the anticipation of the awkward
							figure I should make by speechifying to the Ladies, upon public
							affairs.— But what was my amazement and confusion when upon reaching the
							spot where they were assembled, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring
							introduced me as the Representative of the District in Congress; took
							from his pocket a written Speech of about ten minutes length loaded with
							the most fulsom adulation which he read in a tone of animated Oratory—
							Instead of sinking into the ground overwhelmed with shame, I had the
							utmost difficulty to refrain from bursting into a fit of laughter— But
							preserved the most immovable gravity of face, and answered by a helter
							skelter address to the Ladies, of about five minutes in duration— The
							merit of brevity served as a substitute for all other and it passed off
							without sign of displeasure, and without mortifying apology— Tea and
							Coffee and Cakes were then served round, and a song as sickening as the
							written speech of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring, was read by the
								Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brooks, with much animation, and sung by several Ladies and Gentlemen—
							Other songs followed, and it was near 8 O’Clock when, my family, who had
							come over this afternoon from Quincy, retired— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef>—<persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef>—<persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4"
								>Charles’s wife</persRef> had all come over— I returned, where I saw
							for a few minutes <persRef ref="thaxter-edward2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Edward Thaxter</persRef>— I condoled with him on the
							decease of <persRef ref="thaxter-susan">his wife</persRef> who has died
							since I saw her this time last year— I rode home with Charles, and
							alighted at my door, just before the Evening bell at nine—</p>

						<p>Twenty-nine years this day since we sailed from Charlestown in the Ship

								<persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lunt’s</persRef> morning Sermon was from 1. Corinthians 10.16. “The
							cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of
							Christ? the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of
							Christ?” The doctrine was that the Christian dispensation instituted a
							new and distinct community, selected from all the Nations of the Earth,
							and bound together by the ties of one common faith—one Lord, one
							baptism, and that in its ultimate result all tyranny and oppression, War
							and Slavery must vanish from the face of the Earth— The communion was
							administered jointly by <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi

						<p>I spent a couple of hours this morning in my Garden and Nursery for

							than three years my Senior, but broken down with years—his hearing gone—
							His voice turned to childish treble, and with an unsteady gait, but a
							still warm, benevolent and affectionate heart— He said there were two
							Ladies with him, who had stop’d at French’s tavern, to visit <persRef

							<pb n="572" type="ms"/>adjoining the <persRef ref="boylston-ward"

						<p><persRef ref="hall-nathaniel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathaniel
								Hall</persRef> of Dorchester, preached this morning, from James
							4.14—“For what is your Life?”—out of which he made a very ingenious
							discourse, though not as it appeared to me much adapted to the argument
							in which the Apostle applies this question—which is, never for a moment
							to lose sight of the uncertainty of life, or of the duty connected with
							it of prayer to God for its continuance and for the ability to perform
							our engagements— An excellent moral principle; worthy of all acceptation
							and practice— There is not <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> enough in his
							delivery— He dined with us once the last year or year before, but I did
							not now recollect or know him— He now dined with <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>. His afternoon Sermon was
							from Psalm 68.6. “God sitteth the solitary in families”— The verb
							sitteth has here an active or transitive sense— <persRef
								ref="thomson-charles">Thomson’s</persRef> translation is “God
							settleth the lonely in a family.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall
							has been lately married, and his Sermon was a very good exposition of
							the duties of the members of a family to each other—but his elocution
							was yet cold and lifeless— I read the second Sermon of the 11<hi

								>Saurin</persRef>, upon the sentence of condemnation pronounced by
							Jesus Christ upon <persRef ref="judas-iscariot">Judas
							Iscariot</persRef>—“It would have been better for that man if he had
							never been born.” He says Judas is the only individual of all mankind of
							whom this can be positively said— This is an approach to Universalism—
							He says also that there are degrees of punishment and of torment in
							Hell— All insupportable, but some more aggravated than others— For which
							opinion there is, I think no warrant in Scripture.— I brought my Letter
							to my Constituents nearly to a close; and at the dusk of Evening visited
								<persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter

							the benefit of <persRef ref="bass-joseph">Joseph Bass</persRef>, an
							infirm old man said to be in the 88<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> year
							of his age— There were 25 male singers, and 8 or 9 girls.— Two fiddles;
							one Base Viol one Violoncello, one flute and one Trombone— The Capel
							meister or leader of the band was <persRef ref="tirrell-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tirrell</persRef> the wheelwright,
							whose only personal performance was the song “There’s nothing true but

							of taste— One very pretty girl, <persRef ref="fiske-sarah">Sarah

								>Shopkeeper</persRef>, played on the Piano and sung the Solos
							between Chorus— She sung once also to her own playing; not a remarkably

							were generally good— The Cherubim and Seraphim of <persRef
								ref="handel-george">Handel</persRef>— The lift up your heads ye
							everlasting Gates, which I once joined in performing at an exhibition at
							Cambridge— The closing Stanza of Old Hundred were among my most

							<pb n="573" type="ms"/>persons were musicians by profession— The hall
							was well filled, and the most perfect order and decency was observed in

							of his own composition, and possesses as he claims a durability
							belonging to no other.— In his person he is a temperance Teatotaller of
							the most rigid sect, and made his evening meal of warm milk and water—
							The principal merit of his performance here was to restore the colouring

							nothing— Only filed my Letters, and wrote one of four lines to <persRef
								ref="edwards-james">James L. Edwards</persRef>, which ought to have
							been written, ten days since, to enclose the papers of Widow <persRef

							Charles, <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> and son
								<persRef ref="adams-john17">John Quincy</persRef> dined with us, and
							after dinner I took a ride with him; first to Mount Wollaston farmhouse,

							<pb n="575" type="ms"/>away this morning on a journey to be absent, four

							to enquire about the present Patent Law, and Regulations of the Patent

							entire confidence in its success, he wished to know, if he could guard
							against any other persons taking out a patent for the same invention,
							before him— I told him I thought he might enter a caveat; but promised

						<p>The clouds, gathering yesterday, dispersed last evening, and the sky was
							clear— They rallied again this morning, and thickening, through the day,
							fell in moderate showers, with something of a squally gale at night.—
							The rain however was quite insufficient to slake the burning thirst of
							the Earth— I visited my garden, nursery and Orchard; the last of which
							is planted with potatoes, but is overrun with gigantic weeds, as I found
							the garden, nursery and seminary. Morning visit from <persRef
								ref="boylston-alicia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Alicia

							visits also from <persRef ref="thayer-minot">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Minott Thayer</persRef>, and a young <persRef ref="u"
								>nephew</persRef> also named Thayer— Minott lent me a Letter of

								<persRef ref="thayer-ebenezer2">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Ebenezer Thayer</persRef> his father, upon the death of his eldest

								>y</hi> 1774— The Letter is dated<space/>April 1774—and is one of
							those of which I have no copy— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer
							mentioned that a <persRef ref="wright-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Wright</persRef> was now lecturing in Braintree as an

							disclaims to be— <persRef ref="perkins-jonas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Perkins</persRef> the Orthodox Minister of the Weymouth

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wright Lectures and discusses

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Thayer.— He said he thought it would be

							<pb n="576" type="ms"/>to be held at Hanover, on the 3<hi

							to take the place of our primitive New-England system of Town Schools—
							It is in high favour at this present 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							of August 1838. and may be a great benefit to the Country, but I know
							not what has been done, nor what is proposed to be done; and see that
							under a momentary glow of popularity some very difficult questions of
							organization, of expenditure and of Government are involved upon which I
							need more observation and explanation— I received also a Letter from

							the exceptionable Masonic Oaths— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Babcock
							is upon excursion from home for curiosity and amusement; and is passing
							a few days at the Old Colony House in Hingham— I took morning exercise

							Apricot Stones from Washington, and 3 Plum-stones of the cherry plum
							from <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T.

							and the drought. It is melancholy to look at them— There is scarcely one
							seedling of the present year— <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> went to Boston, and returned home to dine— At 4
							this afternoon I rode with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Charles</persRef> to the Mount Wollaston farm, and there met

								<persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> turns his

								<persRef ref="spear-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								Spear</persRef> to engage the fence viewers to divide the lines,
							that each of us might know what fencing he has to make— I then visited

							the Oaks and Chesnuts of which I planted the Acorns and Nuts in 1830.
							there are at least 200 trees growing, and as thrifty as total neglect

								>his great grandfathers</persRef> in 1679. That is the first of the
							name, and all that he knows of his father is that he came from this

							whose name he knows not told a relative of his in Boston, named <persRef
								ref="tirrell-adams">Adams Tirrell</persRef>, that there was a landed
							Estate in England, at Thornton, the heir to which he had heard say was

							Letter in answer to them by a man named <persRef ref="u"
								>Maginnis</persRef> dated in March last, who says there are thirty
							places in England named Thornton, in ten or twelve different Counties,
							and that without knowing which of them it is, it would be an idle and

							David Tirrell no better comfort— <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi

							from Washington— Mary’s daughter Mary-Louisa, and Charles’s Louisa

								>Charles’s</persRef> House— He rises there nearly behind the Stone

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frederic Augustus Whitney</persRef>—
							Morning text— Matthew 20.27. [“]And whosoever will be chief among you,
							let him be your Servant.” The preacher is the second son of the Pastor
							of the Church <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Peter Whitney</persRef>, and has only within a few weeks
							begun to preach— I was on the whole pleased with his discourse, though
							it contained a complimentary notice of <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>, and the family thought another of myself, which
							would have been better omitted. I have as little relish for flattery as
							for insult, which I have sometimes received from the pulpit— This young
							man’s intention was no doubt to please— His doctrine was good, that true
							greatness consists in rendering service to others, and especially to
							mankind— His Sermon was well composed of good sense in good language,
							not brilliant but solid—his voice strong and clear—his articulation too
							distinct and slow, his self composure for a beginner quite sufficient.
							His prayers suitable, and not common place— His afternoon discourse was
							from Psalm 126.6— [“]He that goeth forth and weepeeth, bearing precious
							seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves
							with him.” on the beneficial uses of Affliction— Both M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney’s texts were remarkably well
							chosen— On returning home I found <persRef ref="hellen-walter2">Walter
								Hellen</persRef> at our door— He is on a Summer excursion for health

								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef>, on the narrative of the Passion of Christ.— The
							Doctrine of Passive Obedience to wicked Sovereigns is laid down in this
							discourse without qualification— There are some sensible observations
							upon the absurd abuse of the Scriptures, by fanciful interpretations of
							them— There is a curious account of the antient usage of appointing
							master’s of a feast, see Ecclesiasticus ch: 32. whence he derives the
							modern sport of king making or the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							Night after Christmas; and an awkward argument about predestination in
							which he almost ludicrously commands human reason to hold her tongue!— I
							went to Charles’s House, and saw the Sun set beautifully clear, and

							Meeting— That it would be useless to fence part of the ground leaving
							the rest unfenced, and that some of the proprietors would be unwilling
							to incur the expense— He promised to see and consult with them all, and
							he thought it would be best at all events to wait till <persRef

								<persRef ref="bond-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William

						<p>I have a morning hour very different from that which I wasted for three

						<p>The heat and drought continue— My seedling trees suffer from them and the

								<persRef ref="french-benjamin2">Benjamin V. French</persRef> of
							Braintree who insists upon the fence. All however have now agreed to
							wait for the return of <persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus
								Spear</persRef>, before doing any thing more— I despatched a dozen
							Letters enclosing the Quincy Patriot of last Saturday which contains my
							Letter to my Constituents, and <persRef ref="legare-hugh"
								>Legare’s</persRef> report on the Peace Society Petitions, to one
							member from each town in the District represented at the Convention of
							this day last year— I finished my Letter in answer to that of <persRef
								ref="edwards-justin">President J. Edwards</persRef> with his queries
							concerning the abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia. Four of
							the Letters which I have written since I returned home from Washington
							have <pb n="582" type="ms"/>have already been published in the
							Newspapers— This practice renders my correspondence irksome, because I
							never can be sure that what I write will not be published and of course
							I should be cautious to write nothing unfit for publication— It gives an
							air of constraint to my Style; and makes the writing of a Letter, a
							laborious task— Besides this I was nearly two hours busied this
							afternoon in hunting up the two Letters that I had received last winter
							from <persRef ref="capen-nahum">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nahum
								Capen</persRef>, concerning the project of establishing a School or

							the files of Letters that I have received within the last two years, and
							which nearly fill a chest— My practice is to file all the Letters that I
							receive, and the consequence is that the files encumber my trunks with
							trash— Two grains of wheat in two bushels of chaff— I think I do not
							answer upon the average more than one Letter in five that I receive, and
							yet in looking over my Letter-books I find in them much frivolous
							correspondence and a plentiful lack of mind— I was journalizing this
							afternoon when <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> called at

							on the Dedham road to the turn East of the Milton Meetinghouse thence

						<p>My passion for seedling trees is returning and occupies more than the
							morning hour— In spite of all my yearly failures and disappointments, I
							have several hundreds of trees; fruit and forest from 11 to 1. year old;
							flourishing in my garden Nursery and Seminary—and about 50 apple
							seedlings in 3 large wooden boxes, which ought to have been transplanted
							last October but were not, because I was absent— Early Ann Peaches this
							day first ripe—very small, but good— I planted one Stone—in <persRef
								ref="adams-georgeanna">Fanny’s</persRef> peach table— There is a
							peach seedling, a Strawberry vine, and a grape vine up from the last
							years planting in <persRef ref="adams-mary4"
							>Mary-Louisas</persRef>—nothing up in either of the other tables of that
							row— The apple seedling of 1834 in front of my easternmost South window,
							grows not rapidly but well— I planted an oblique row, of black Currants
							crushed, from the bush at the West end of the garden, at the easternmost
							end of the seminary border— I was called form my garden by <persRef
								ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi></persRef>, who had a draught of a Letter to <persRef
								ref="ellsworth-henry">Henry L. Ellsworth</persRef>, the Commissioner

							would call for me here— <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>

							which he sent me to sell the Warrant for him, and remit to him the

							searching for the Letter of <persRef ref="vaughan-petty">Petty

								>Ward N. Boylston</persRef>, and to <hi rend="italic">which</hi>

						<p>The fire last night was of a barn at South Weymouth, struck with
							lightning— From the distant sound of the thunder I should not have
							imagined it was so near— But I was confident that soon after the heavy
							thunder storm of last night on our borders, we should very soon have it
							over our heads—which was this day realized—from 4 this afternoon till 10
							this evening, there was a continual succession of copious showers and
							the most terrific peals of thunder which I ever witnessed— Abundance of
							rain, but no superfluity to satiate the parching thirst of the earth. It
							came on suddenly The morning was clear, and the heat of the day sultry.
							I planted 3. early Anne peaches in the seminary table row of <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna;adams-louisa3;adams-john17;adams-charles7"
								>my five Grand children</persRef>; and a circle of Apple-seeds and

								ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy</persRef>; who invited me to
							Commencement next Wednesday, and to <persRef ref="boylston-nicholas"
								>Boylston</persRef> prize declamations of the next Morning; which he
							said was a matter of duty— I thought my age and infirmities would excuse
							me, but felt the force of the remark— I had much conversation with him
							upon the educational movement now one of the agitations of the day; and
							especially upon the project of establishing Normal Schools for the
							Education of Teachers in every County of the Commonwealth. I asked him,
							what was to be its operation upon our Colleges, and especially upon the
							University at Cambridge— His answers greatly increased my doubts as to
							the expediency of these Normal Schools— He seemed reluctant to give his
							opinions freely on the subject, but he evidently entertained
							apprehensions similar to those which have occurred to me— He said that
							there were always more of the bachelor graduates perfectly competent to
							keep schools than could obtain schools to keep— That the school
							committees of all the towns were always looking out for the cheapest
							Article, for the schoolmaster, and he thought the normal schools would
							rather make it dearer.— While we were at dinner <persRef
								ref="capen-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Capen</persRef> of
							Braintree came to make known to me his grievances about a fence between
							his land and that which was once <persRef key="adams-thomas">my

							possession to <persRef ref="adams-ann">his widow</persRef> for her life,
							and intend to secure to <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail2;adams-elizabeth;adams-isaac;adams-john3;adams-joseph"
								>her children</persRef> after her decease— Her tenant <persRef
								ref="hayden-charles">Hayden’s</persRef> Cattle, trespass upon M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Capen’s land, and will not make a fence,
							nor a ditch either of which would sufficiently bar out the cattle. I
							told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Capen that the possession and the
							profits of the land were in M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B. Adams;
							and she being much indisposed I advised him to see her son Joseph, and
							make some arrangement <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
							<pb n="584" type="ms"/>of the matter with him; to which he finally
							consented, though he thought the most proper person for settling the
							difficulty was the lawful owner of the land— While he was here, his
							brother in Law, <persRef ref="adams-josiah">Josiah Adams</persRef> came
							in, and I rode with him to <persRef ref="gay-henry2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gay’s</persRef> tan yard, where we saw
								<persRef ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi></persRef> Vertical Bark Cutter and its operation by
							wheel and horse power— It is apparently a great improvement upon the old
							usual machine, which we also saw there— The bark they use is of hemlock—
							We had been there but a few minutes when a thunder cloud came up, and we
							had barely time to reach my home, before the plentiful rain ensued— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Adams’s horse and chaise were put into the

								Newell</persRef> of Cambridge preached this morning from Psalm.
							139.7. [“]Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? or whither shall I fly
							from thy presence?” upon the omnipresence of God—a them upon which it is
							not difficult to expatiate, but which is not alike easy to understand—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newell dined with us, and his
							afternoon Sermon was from Matthew 10.5. [“]These twelve Jesus sent forth
							and commanded them saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles and into
							any city of the Samaritans enter ye not. 6. But go rather to the lost
							sheep of the house of Israel. 7. And as ye go, preach, saying, the
							kingdom of heaven is at hand— 8. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers,
							raise the dead, cast out devils; freely ye have received, freely give.”
							Upon the nature of the commission given by Christ to his apostles— These
							Sermons were both edifying, but not of extraordinary power, and less
							efficacious to me, owing to the great distrac- of my mind, and the
							lamentable failure of my memory— I requested M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Newell, if he should see <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2"
								>President Quincy</persRef> to say to him that my present intention
							is to go to Cambridge next Thursday the Prize Declamation and Φ.B.K.
							day— <persRef ref="degrand-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Degrand</persRef> came out from Boston; and dined, and spent the day
							with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">us</persRef>— <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef> here this Evening— From the
							morning bell at 10—till the same hour of the Evening, I could not even
							visit my chamber— I then read the fourth Sermon of the 11<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volume of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques"
								>Saurin</persRef>, upon the denial of Christ by <persRef ref="peter"
								>Saint Peter</persRef>—a subject the treatment of which by this
								<persRef ref="calvin-john">Calvinist</persRef> Hugenot preacher is
							less satisfactory than in many other cases— It is indeed no easy topic
							to handle by any person believing the doctrines of Christianity, and of
							a philosophical turn of mind— The extent and the limitation of the
							miraculous power, the perpetual agency of the Scriptures in both
							covenants, is equally beyond the reach of human reason— The Commission
							to the twelve Apostles when first sent forth gave them power to raise
							the dead— Peter had not only witnessed many of the miracles performed by
							Jesus, and had been one of the three witnesses of the transfiguration—
							He had been so self-confident of his own fidelity, as stubbornly to
							promise perseverance in it against the <hi rend="italic">solemn</hi>
							<pb n="585" type="ms"/>solemn warning of Jesus himself— He draws the
							sword and cuts off the ear of <persRef ref="malchus">Malchus</persRef>,
							which Jesus by a miracle immediately restores.— Yet at the trying
							moment, he deserts and denies his Lord and master.— No book in the
							world, discloses so effectively the frailties and infirmities of human
							nature as the Bible— Saurin comments with acuteness and ingenuity every
							part of the narrative.</p>

						<p>Planted 5 early Ann Peach stones in oblique row, parallel to the fence

							their row tables, each two Early Ann Peach Stones, and I planted in Pot

								>Josiah Adams jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> brought his
							Letter to <persRef ref="ellsworth-henry">H. L. Ellsworth</persRef>,
							Commissioner of the Patent Office, with the drawing of his Vertical

							wrote myself to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellsworth and enclosed to

								wife</persRef>, with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail4">Abby</persRef> went to Boston, where
							Mary had a tooth drawn which has for the last fortnight tormented her
							with the tooth ache. They returned before dinner, all unwell, and Mary
							was confined the remainder of the day to her chamber. With the Quincy
							Stage this afternoon came out <persRef
								ref="dewindt-john;dewindt-caroline">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> De Wint</persRef>—<persRef

							two daughters, <persRef ref="dewindt-julia">Julia</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="dewindt-emily">Emily</persRef>— The rest went immediately to
								<persRef ref="adams-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> T. B.

							the Stone Meeting house <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lunts</persRef> and <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> houses— There was while I
							was walking a light sprinkle scarcely amounting to rain, but immediately
							afterwards came to a gentle steady rain which continued all the Evening—
							Charles came over, but his wife was too unwell— The last Night had been
							cold almost to a frost, and this morning before Sun rise Crystal clear.
							I visited my orchard in the forenoon, and took note of several trees— It
							is now planted with Potatoes, and with Ellsworth Indian Corn— I received
							a very grateful Letter from <persRef ref="gregory-james2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> James Gregory</persRef> of Marblehead
							returning the Letter from the <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of
								War</persRef>, and report from the <persRef ref="edwards-james"
								>Commissioner of Pensions</persRef>, about the Marblehead widows
							which I had sent him— Also a second letter from <persRef
								ref="loud-jacob">Jacob H. Loud</persRef>, for <persRef
								ref="adlington-john">John Adlington’s</persRef> Pension certificate
							which I cannot find— A Letter from <persRef ref="clark-aaron">Aaron
								Clark</persRef> Mayor of New-York, and one from <persRef
								ref="tremain-er">E. R. Tremane</persRef> Chairman of the Lecture
							Committee of the Mercantile Library Association at New York, urgently
							pressing an invitation to deliver the introductory Lecture to their
							course, early in November next— I had declined performing the same
							service for the last winter’s Season in March 1837. on account of the
							state of my voice which of course grows weaker and weaker every year— I
							have as much as I can now do to answer these Letters— I read a Lecture
							on Public Instruction in Prussia, read before the American Institute, by
								<persRef ref="hillard-george">George S. Hillard</persRef> in August
							1835, but written by <persRef ref="robbins-elizabeth">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Elizabeth Robbins</persRef>—published
							at Philadelphia, in 1836. and given me I believe last summer by <persRef
								ref="brooks-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								Brooks</persRef> of Hingham— There is some account in it of the
							Prussian system—extracted from the report of <persRef
								ref="cousin-victor">Cousin</persRef>— It states that in a population
							of 12,726823. in Prussia, there were 2,043,030. children between 7. and
							14. at school. 13.15<hi rend="superscript">ths.</hi> of the whole

								Adlington</persRef>, which he left with me last winter to sustain
							his application for an increase of his pension, and which he now wants
							to receive his half years pension payable the first of next month; but
							could not find it— This with due attention to visitors absorbed the
							whole day.— The multitude of Petitions with which I was charged at the
							last and preceding Congress, amounting to about one thousand, with the
							other business of the House was so distracting that in spite of every
							precaution to keep a special register of them of my own, and minutes of
							what was done with every one of them it has been impossible for me to
							avoid mislaying several papers, belonging to others and every one of
							them is now called for— Thus I lost the day without writing a single
							Letter, and without reading a page of Public Instruction</p>

						<p>To Cambridge— Prize Declamations ΦBK. Home.</p>
						<p>At half past six this morning, I took <persRef ref="nelson-thomas3"
								>Thomas</persRef>, to drive me, with <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> Buggy, and one of my horses, and at eight
							O’Clock I was at <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President
								Quincy’s</persRef> house at Cambridge and in his study— The judges
							of the <persRef ref="boylston-nicholas">Boylston</persRef>-prize
							declamations dropped in one by one till 9. when we proceeded to the
							Meeting House, and the prize declamations commenced— There were eight
							competitors of the Junior Class— 14 of the Senior Class, and two of the
							Class yesterday graduated— One of the Juniors, one of the Seniors did
							not speak; and there were 22 who spoke— The rule limits each speaker to
							5 minutes of time, but some of them exceeded it— The performance was
							over about a quarter past 11. The judges then returned to the Presidents
							study, and awarded the prizes— There were 11. votes—<persRef
								ref="gray-francis">F C Gray</persRef>—<persRef ref="loring-charles"
								>Charles G. Loring</persRef>, <persRef ref="merrill-james">Judge
								Merrill</persRef>, <persRef ref="shaw-lemuel">Chief Justice Lemuel

									>r</hi> Walker</persRef>, Minister of Charlestown, <persRef
								ref="ward-thomas">T. W. Ward</persRef>, and 3. others, with
							President Quincy and myself— We first balloted for the two first prizes
							at once—but there was not a majority for any one speaker— Then the
							ballot was for one— The prize was taken by <persRef ref="eliot-samuel4"
								>Samuel Elliot</persRef>, a son of <persRef ref="eliot-william"
								>William Eliot</persRef> deceased, and a Grandson of <persRef
								ref="bradford-alden">Alden Bradford</persRef>—the brightest Star of
							all the Undergraduates—a Senior— The other first prize was taken by
								<persRef ref="dawes-thomas3">Thomas Dawes</persRef>, also a Senior,
							in my judgment much the best speaker of the day; but not remarkable as a
							Scholar— He spoke <persRef ref="catoyounger">Cato’s</persRef> soliloquy,
							Elliot spoke a passage from <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
								>Webster’s</persRef> Eulogy on <persRef key="adams-john"
								>Adams</persRef> and <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
								>Jefferson</persRef>— The three second prizes were taken by <persRef
								ref="capen-francis">Francis Lemuel Capen</persRef> a Senior, who
							spoke in Latin, part of the fourth Oration of <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef> against <persRef ref="catiline"
								>Catiline</persRef>; the only Latin that was pronounced and he spoke
							it well— By <persRef ref="bowditch-william">William Ingersoll
								Bowditch</persRef>, a graduate of the present year, a son of the
							late <persRef ref="bowditch-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bowditch</persRef>, but no heir to his labours— He had no part at
							the Commencement—he spoke a passage from <persRef ref="byron-george"
								>Byron’s</persRef> Marino Faliero—and by <persRef ref="kebler-john"
								>John Kebler</persRef>, a German, who is of the Senior Class and
							spoke an admirable passage from <persRef ref="burke-edmund"
								>Burke’s</persRef> Reflections on the French Revolution— The
							speaking was all good, and so nearly equal that there was scarcely one
							of the performers, but had one or more votes for one of the prizes.
							Dawes drew an involuntary clap from the auditory; but President Quincy
							rose and requested that there might be no clapping.— The judges returned
							to the Church and the President announced the names of the successful
							competitors, with a remark on the general excellence of the speaking,
							and the nearly equal merit of all the performers— The members of the
							ΦB.K. society then left the Church and went to the Chapel Hall whence
							they walked in procession; beginning with the immediate members, Seniors
							and Juniors Undergraduates, and naming the classes backward beginning
							with the class of 1838, and calling successively the class of each
							preceding year to 1790. There they stopped and of several classes
							between that and 1800 there was no representative— Four veterans,
								<persRef ref="mellen-prentiss">Prentiss Mellen</persRef> of 1784.
								<persRef ref="ware-henry">Henry Ware</persRef> of 1785, Alden
							Bradford of 1786. and myself of 1787. closed the procession, preceding
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef>, who as
							Governor of the Commonwealth took the lead of us, and was followed
							immediately by the <persRef ref="stetson-caleb">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> Caleb Stetson</persRef> the Orator,

							<pb n="588" type="ms"/>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stetson delivered

							and no one thought it long— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richmond’s
							poem was a sort of Monody upon <persRef ref="metacom"
								>Pokamoket or Philip Sachem of Mount Hope</persRef>, who has of late
							become a great favourite with our historical romancers— The

							to <persRef ref="waterhouse-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Waterhouse</persRef> and reached home shortly before 9 in the
							Evening— There was a heavy thunder shower between 1 and 3 P.M. the

							himself was not very encouraging as a warrant for asking a
