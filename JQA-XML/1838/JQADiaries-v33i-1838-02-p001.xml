						<p>Attended a meeting of the Committee of Manufactures— I had notified all

								Hunter</persRef> of Virginia, who had said as I had heard that he
							knew and cared nothing about manufactures, and did not wish to attend

								>Slade</persRef>, <persRef ref="tillinghast-joseph"

								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lindsley</persRef> the silk
							worm breeder and silk manufacturer, attended before the Committee,
							exhibited some of his sewing silks, and a pair of silk socks knit by
								<persRef ref="u">his wife</persRef>, and was arrayed in his full
							suit of cloth woven from the floss of the silkworm. The Committee
							discussed the subject of the Memorial from this City asking for
							patronage and for the privilege of occupying certain squares of the
							public lands, in this City— They finally agreed to a Resolution, that
							some of the City lands may be on conditions occupied temporarily, for
							raising the white mulberry, and they authorised me to confer with the
							Committee of Agriculture to which this subject has been also Conferred—
							There was no time for taking up any thing else— H.RU.S— <persRef
								ref="rhett-robert">Rhett</persRef> of South Carolina said his name
							was not recorded on the yeas and nays of the rescinding vote of
							yesterday—that he had voted in the negative— His name was accordingly
							recorded— There were few reports of Committees— My call for <persRef
								ref="gorostiza-manuel">Gorostiza’s</persRef> pamphlet came up again—
							I resumed my argument of yesterday—caused to be read by the <persRef
								ref="franklin-walter">Clerk</persRef> the Letter from <persRef
								ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef>
							to the <persRef ref="casairujo-carlos">Marquis de Casa-Yrujo</persRef>
							of 15. Jan<hi rend="superscript">y.</hi> 1806. and Yrujo’s two answers
							of 16 and 19. Jan<hi rend="superscript">y.</hi>—the Note added to his
							Letter of Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1805. reviewing and abusively
							commenting on <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">President
								Jefferson’s</persRef> Message to Congress—and also <persRef
								ref="onis-luis">Onis’s</persRef> intercepted Letter of 2. Feb<hi
								rend="superscript">y.</hi> 1810.—and the Resolution of both Houses
							of Congress on the rupture of the Negotiation with <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> of 12. Jan<hi
								rend="superscript">y</hi> 1810. This brought up again the Hour of
							one, and the Mississippi election— The <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>Speaker</persRef> reconsidered and reversed a decision, which he
							had hastily made yesterday to favour a trick of <persRef
								ref="howard-benjamin">Howard’s</persRef> coupling an amendment
							declaring <persRef ref="prentiss-seargent">Prentiss</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="word-thomas">Word</persRef>, not entitled to Seats in
							the House with the amendment yesterday carried; which declared <persRef
								ref="claiborne-john">Claiborne</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gholson-samuel">Gholson</persRef> not members— Howard being
							sure of carrying his amendment wanted to tack it to the other so as to
							force upon the majority of yesterday, the compulsive vote against their
							own proposition, or to vote against a resolution declaring Prentiss and
							Word duly elected— This knavish expedient is just worthy of Howard, and
							the Speaker yesterday supported him in it— This morning however he
							recanted and said the question on the two amendments would by the 41<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> rule of the House be divisible— Howard
							modified the amendment he had offered yesterday to read that Prentiss
							and Word are not members of the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Congress and said if that was adopted he should move a Resolution to
							communicate a copy of the two Resolutions to the <persRef
								ref="mcnutt-alexander">Governor</persRef> of the State of
							Mississippi— <persRef ref="pope-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pope</persRef> offered a similar Resolution declaring the seat of
								<persRef ref="yell-archibald">Yell</persRef> of Arkansas as vacant;
							but the Speaker rejected it as not in order— Howard’s amendment was
							debated by <persRef ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="cilley-jonathan">Cilley</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="robertson-john2">Robertson</persRef>, Tillinghast, <persRef

							of Indiana, to whom <hi rend="italic">Prentiss</hi>
							<pb n="2" type="ms"/>Prentiss finally replied.— Between five and six
							O’Clock the House adjourned— <persRef ref="tyler-benjamin">B. O.

						<p>In the House this day I finished my remarks upon <persRef
								ref="howard-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Howard’s</persRef> motion to strike out the part of my Resolution,
							calling for the name of a foreign Minister— I was compelled to abridge
							them, labouring as I am under a severe cold, hoarseness and sore
							throat.— Howard began a reply,—but was interrupted by the expiration of
							the morning hour— The Mississippi election followed— <persRef
								ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> of Tennessee made a Speech in support
							of the election of <persRef ref="prentiss-seargent">Prentiss</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="word-thomas">Word</persRef>; and <persRef
								ref="rhett-robert">R. Barnwell Rhett</persRef> of South Carolina a
							speech against them— <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> said
							a few words in explanation of his protest at the commencement of the
							special Session against the organization of the House without requiring
							the production of the credentials of the members— No it was not this day
							but to-morrow that Bell and Rhett made their speeches— Prentiss this day
							replied to the arguments against him— <persRef ref="yell-archibald"
								>Yell</persRef> of Arkansas whose case was precisely the same in
							principle with that of <persRef ref="claiborne-john"
							>Claiborne</persRef>, and <persRef ref="gholson-samuel"
								>Gholson</persRef>, attempted to explain the reason why in his own
							case he acted one way and in theirs votes the other way— The real is
							that he is a shallow foolish fellow without principle enough to stand on
							the point of a needle—fitter for the brawler of a bar room than for a
							Representative of the People in Congress.— He said that he considered
							himself elected in July for the whole Congress, though he ran as a
							Candidate at the subsequent election, and produced his credential, and
							was sworn again at the commencement of the present Session— <persRef
								ref="patton-john">Patton</persRef> made a speech of about an hour,
							sound in principle, as he has been right on this subject throughout the
							whole contest—but his Speech made no impression upon the house.—
								<persRef ref="legare-hugh">Legare</persRef> made a laborious and
							painful effort to sustain the ground he had taken at the Special
							Session; which he carried triumphantly then, but which has now crumbled
							under him; He said now that the decision of the special Session
							declaring Claiborne and Gholson elected as members of the 25<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress, was binding upon every man
							woman and child of the United States until the day before yesterday— At
							this monstrous doctrine I could hardly keep my seat in Silence; but it
							settled Legare in my mind as a flashy declaimer with-out substance—
							There was an abortive attempt to adjourn, which <persRef
								ref="cushman-samuel">Cushman</persRef> defeated, by calling for the
							yeas and nays. Then <persRef ref="menefee-richard">Menefee</persRef>
							made a very animated and somewhat severe Speech, appealing to correct
							principles which mere common sense in this case could not mistake— It
							was now <hi rend="italic">past</hi>
							<pb n="3" type="ms"/>past five O’Clock, and Bell said he was desirous of
							offering some remarks to the house, and hoped they would adjourn and
							come, determined to sit it out and take the question to-morrow—and the
							House did accordingly adjourn— The weather is severely cold, and I ride
							to and from the Capitol—</p>

						<p>H:R.U.S. The presentation of Petitions was confined to the morning hour;

							praying that the Resolution of 21. Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							1837. be rescinded— <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor

							<pb n="4" type="ms"/>Governor Lincoln took the task out of my hands—
								<persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> enquired whether these

							said that upon mature deliberation he had concluded they did not— Wise
							said then the Resolution was of no use whatever— <persRef
								ref="patton-john">Patton</persRef> moved the Question whether the
							House would consider the Resolution, and <persRef ref="boon-ratliff"
								>Boon</persRef> moved to lay that motion on the table— The yeas and
							nays were then called and the whole subject was laid on the table by a
							vote of 128 to 75— This occupied so much time that when my turn came to
							present Petitions, I could get only one received; that of <persRef
								ref="turner-lydia">Lydia Turner</persRef> for a widow’s pension— I
							asked a suspension of the rules to permit me to go through, and for the
							yeas and nays—but <persRef ref="hoffman-josiah">Hoffman</persRef> asked
							that the suspension should be general; for all the members to present
							their Petitions— To this I assented, but the House refused to suspend
							the Rules or to grant the yeas and nays. At 1. O’Clock the Mississippi
							Election was resumed.— <persRef ref="martin-joshua2">Martin</persRef> of
							Alabama though not a violent man made a very violent Speech against
							<unclear>her</unclear> right of <persRef ref="prentiss-seargent">Prentiss</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="word-thomas">Word</persRef> to their Seats.— <persRef
								ref="glascock-thomas">Glascock</persRef> presented to the House a
							Letter from <persRef ref="claiborne-john">Claiborne</persRef> enclosing

								>Gholson</persRef> were and are the choice of a large majority of

							are satisfied with the decision of the House at the special Session: and
							that the conduct of Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Gholson and
							Claiborne, relating to the Sub-treasury and Bank questions, and the
							stand they had taken against the discussion of Slavery was highly
							approved— Claiborne’s Letter was a half bullying remonstrance against
							the vote to rescind the Resolution of 3. October declaring him and
							Gholson members of the House for the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Congress, and a half whining supplication to them to turn out Prentiss

							Mississippi legislative Caucus, from the Globe, till the <persRef
								ref="franklin-walter">Clerk</persRef> came to the Resolution about
							the sub-treasury and Bank— <persRef ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod

							Article introducing the proceedings of the Caucus should be read; but
							after some captious debate this was refused by vote 90 to 80; and the
							reading was stopped before coming to the Resolution about Slavery—
								<persRef ref="parker-amasa">Parker</persRef> of New-York made a
							Speech for referring back the election to the People of Mississippi; and
								<persRef ref="clowney-william">Clowney</persRef> of South Carolina,

							the House, and upon <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard’s</persRef>
							amendment, declaring Prentiss and Word, not members of the House the
							vote by yeas and nays was 117 to 117. a tie— The Speaker decided the
							question against them— The question upon rescinding the Resolution <hi
								rend="italic">of</hi>
							<pb n="5" type="ms"/>of 3. October, declaring Claiborne and Gholson
							members of the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress had been
							carried 121 to 113.— Then the question upon Howard’s amendment was taken
							again and carried 118 to 116. <persRef ref="snyder-adam"
								>Snyder</persRef> of Illinois who has been for weeks confined by
							sickness, having come in at the dead-lift, and <persRef

							power— Evans’s character is under a dark cloud, but there are few if any

							this day in introducing his bill by the trickery of the Speaker, if he
							had not been thoroughly versed in the tangle of rules of the House,

							move the reference to a Committee of the Message with instructions to

							actions now pending, to which the late Bank of the United States may be
							party, with a small amendment—and he moved the third reading of the
							Bill— I enquired if the Committee had considered the question, whether
							suits by or against the Bank could be commenced by or against the Bank
							after the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March next.— He said they
							had; but had forborne to make any provision for it, to avoid endangering

							urgent— I moved that the Bill be recommitted, to provide for continuing
							the capacity to sue and be sued after the 4<hi rend="superscript"

							in the recommitment of the Bill— It appeared that only five members of
							the judiciary committee had been present at the meeting this morning
							when they agreed to report the Bill, and that the others had not seen
							it— Neither the Committee nor any of the anti-bank members of the House
							who debated my motions to recommit, appeared to be aware that the Bill
							to prevent the abatement of suits at the expiration of the Charter is
							quoad hoc a re-creation of the Corporation, or capable of assigning a
							reason why or how the expired body could be amenable to judicial process
							upon suits commenced, and yet not capable to sue or be sued for rights
							and liabilities existing before the expiration of the charter. The
							Northeastern boundary bill was now taken up, and the objection to
								<persRef ref="evans-george2">Evans’s</persRef> introducing his bill
							was withdrawn— This only produced a change of forms— He brought in his
							bill, which was read twice, and referred to the Committee of foreign
							Relations— He then concluded his speech in about two hours, and <persRef
								ref="fairfield-john">Fairfield</persRef> took the floor—but it was

							nor yet trust my faith to take <hi rend="italic">passage</hi>
							<pb n="11" type="ms"/>passage in his airy boat— H.R.U.S. The day was
							again absorbed by the debate upon the alleged corruption of a member of
							Congress. <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> read a paragraph from
							a Newark Newspaper, stating that the editor knew all about this
							disgraceful transaction— That the witness was a citizen of that place,
							and the member of Congress, a Senator now in his place— <persRef
								ref="smith-francis">Smith</persRef> of Maine made a speech from

							was adopted 140 to 46— <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef>
							moved certain interrogatories to be put to the witness, which raised a
							debate; during which at my motion the witness was directed to withdraw—
							The debate was on the first interrogatory proposed by M<hi

							Washington— This was not an issue, and I with many others objected
							against it— I said he would certainly not answer it, and the house could
							have no right to compel him.— They carried nevertheless the question 83
							to 78, but left it optional with the witness whether to answer it or
							not—without letting him know, that he had this option— Davis was sworn
							by the Speaker, not to answer interrogatories but to tell the truth, the
							whole truth and nothing but the truth touching the matter before the
							House, and when the question was put to him whether he was the author of
							the Letter signed the Spy in Washington, he asked leave briefly to
							address the house to shew that this question ought not to be put to him—
							Then a sharp debate of an hour, whether he should be permitted to
							address the House, closed by the previous question moved by Howard and
							carried by yeas and nays 103 to 90 that he should— He presented a
							protest against the right of the house to ask the question, and
							therefore declined to answer it, and sent his protest to the Speaker
							with a request that it should be entered on the Journal of the House—
							The Speaker received the protest, and no objection was made to its being
							entered on the Journal— The second question was whether he knew the name
							of the member of Congress alluded to in the Letter of the Spy—he said he
							did— The third question was whether it was a member of the House—he said
							it was not, and was immediately discharged— The House then a quarter
							past four adjourned— Rainy and very uncomfortable day— I took my

								<persRef ref="clark-aaron">Aaron Clark</persRef>, Mayor of the City
							of New-York, and sundry others, praying for the aid of Congress to
							obtain the making a ship Canal across the Isthmus of Panama— I moved its
							reference to a Select Committee, but a motion was made and carried to
							refer it to the Committee on Roads and Canals— A Petition from a man
							named <persRef ref="judson-daniel">Judson</persRef> that Congress would
							appropriate money to build a Wall, like the Wall of China, between the
							free and the slave holding States— I asked the Speaker if that came
							under the Resolution of 21. December—he said it did not— I then moved
							its reference to a select Committee—but a motion was immediately made
							and carried to lay it on the table— The Petition for an Appropriation
							for the relief of <persRef ref="lovejoy-celia">M<hi rend="superscript"

							praying that Congress would take measures to protect Citizens of the
							North going to the South from danger to their lives— When the motion to
							lay that on the table was made, I said that in another part of the
							Capitol, it had been threatened that if a Northern abolitionist should
							go to South-Carolina, and utter a principle of the Declaration of
							Independence—here a loud cry of order—order—burst forth, in which the
							Speaker yelled among the loudest— I waited till it subsided and then
							resumed; that if they could catch him they would hang him— I said this
							so as to be distinctly heard throughout the Hall, the renewed deafening
							shout of order—order notwithstanding— The Speaker then said, the
							Gentleman from Massachusetts will take his Seat—which I did, and
							immediately rose again; and presented another Petition— He did not dare
								<hi rend="italic">to</hi>
