                            and our own— He was more inquisitive than communicative, but said that
                            affairs in Canada were so very bad, that Lord Durham had thought it his
                            duty to make the best of his way home; without indulging himself in a
                            visit of curiosity to the United States— He said that the worst feature
                            in the condition of Canada was the inveterate and rancorous mutual
                            hostility between the English and French population— He was followed by

                            up claimed an acquaintance of more than 25 years standing. His name had
                            not been announced, and when he came up I did not recognize him; but
                            immediately on his naming the acquaintance of 25 years, I knew him for
                            the Baron Marechal, Secretary of Legation to <persRef

                            1811 and 1812. But I remembered not a feature of his face— He was then a
                            young man, certainly not exceeding 25. he is now an elderly personage
                            turned of fifty—but very lively and conversible— He told me Count S<hi

                            foreigners whom we had both known there, it was a mere necrology; as if
                            we were wandering among the Sepulchres of a Church yard— Even the story
                            of the survivors was not joyous— <persRef ref="nesselrode-karl"

                            himself came on a mission to Brazil in 1819. and lived there 11 years.
                            He returned home in 1830 and has been residing the last 8 years in
                            Europe— My last morning visitor was <persRef ref="kingsbury-harmon">M<hi

                            object now, and intimated rather obscurely a wish that I would introduce
                            the Bill— But I do not inclined to enter upon that controversy— I told
                            him that the shortest way would be to call up the petition of the last
                            year and have it referred to a Committee; and if he was prepared with
                            another petition, it might be presented and referred to the same

                            aside every weight, and the sin which doth <pb n="673" type="ms"/>doth
                            so easily beset us, and let us run with patience, the race that is set
                            before us 2. Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith;
                            who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising
                            the shame, and is set down, at the right hand of the throne of God.”— In
                            the afternoon I went to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church
                            and heard the Evening service for Advent Sunday performed by a Stranger,
                            who <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Hawley</persRef> told me was a <persRef ref="u">M<hi

                            But my thoughts were so much absorbed by painful worldly cares, that I
                            retained little, very little, of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler’s
                            Sermon, and not even the text of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bradley—
                            Nor was I more successful in taking up the first Volume of the <persRef

                            pages, and was obliged to lay it down. Too often on the Sabbath does my
                            Spirit, struggle with the world in vain— I was preparing for the
                            commencement of the Session of Congress, and never had it been more
                            necessary for me in entering upon the duties of the Time and Place, to
                            implore of the father of Spirits the Urim and the Thummim; the <hi

                            guides for my conduct in the new Trial through which I am to pass— I was
                            drawing up Resolutions for presenting to Congress the writings of
                                <persRef ref="lafayette">La Fayette</persRef>, from <persRef

                            to a select Committee the Anti-Texian, Petitions, Memorials,
                            Remonstrances and Resolutions; for an enquiry into the conduct of

                                ref="perry-matthew">Captain Perry</persRef> in that affair, and for
                            re-introducing the Senate’s Bill, against duelling—all which after long
                            and anxious deliberation I believe to be my duty, but in no one of which
                            can I expect success; except in the mere presentation of the books— In
                            the present composition of Congress, I can bring forward no public
                            measure of probable utility with the remotest hope of success; and the
                            only practical consideration for me must be, what measures it may yet be
                            my duty to propose, with the certainty that they will fail; and how it
                            may be practicable to treat them when introduced— Measures may fail in
                            Congress, and yet make a salutary impression upon the public mind— They
                            may fail in both at least for a time, and yet be just, and important in
                            themselves— The question whether and when to bring them forward is of
                            great difficulty and requires the coolest self-scrutinizing exercise of
                            the judgment— This is now the condition of my mind; and in reflecting
                            upon it, the thought occurred to me while at Church this morning that I
                            needed a <hi rend="italic">Lamp</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">Key</hi>—
                            The idea fermented through the day, but bore no fruit. <persRef

                            members were qualified— For the Territory of Wisconsin two persons

                            My Motion was laid on the table by yeas and nays 136 to 61. I gave
                            notice, that I proposed to ask leave to morrow to introduce a Bill to
                            prohibit the giving or accepting within the District of Columbia, of a
                            challenge to fight a duel, and for the punishment thereof— The bill from
                            the Senate of the last Session. And immediately after I offered a
                            Resolution for a Committee of Enquiry, upon five points relating to the

                            I can obtain the consideration of the House to the Resolutions that I
                            have offered, relating to the controversy between <persRef
                                ref="stevenson-andrew">Andrew Stevenson</persRef>, and <persRef
                                ref="oconnell-daniel">Daniel O’Connell</persRef>— There is no
                            subject before the House which I believe to be more important; and there
                            is none more difficult to manage, and requiring above all things the
                            perfect mastery of my own temper, for which I pray for aid from above—
                            My ultimate object is to rally the public mind as much as possible
                            against the barbarous and abominable practice of dueling— I well know
                            that the House will pass no vote of censure upon Stevenson, or upon
                                <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President Van Buren</persRef> for
                            suffering to pass without rebuke or censure the conduct both of

                            But if my power were equal to my will I could turn these incidents to
                            account, at least so far, as to compel the Congress, under the influence
                            of public opinion, to enact some law to suppress, or at least to check
                            the detestable custom of private War— <hi rend="italic">Inflexible</hi>
                            <pb n="677" type="ms"/>Inflexible firmness, untiring perseverance,
                            imperturbable coolness, composure, courtesy, and prudence are all
                            indispensable for the management of this subject, and a failure in the
                            exercise of either of these would not only expose me to obloquy and
                            odium but bring dishonour upon the cause which I am most anxious to

                            morning, and held a conversation of an hour and a half with me on the
                            affairs of Canada— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Papineau had the
                            discourse almost entirely to himself, for I deemed it proper to hold
                            myself entirely reserved upon all that he said— His object was to urge
                            the propriety of some expression of <hi rend="italic">sympathy</hi> for
                            the People of Canada upon Congress.— The tenour of his argument was the
                            earnest desire of the People of Canada to become a part of the North
                            American Union, and the unequivocal interest of the United States in the
                            same event. He said that in the year 1822 he had been sent to England as
                            an agent in behalf of the suffering Canadians, and then had several
                            conferences with <persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Lord Bathurst</persRef>
                            then the Colonial Secretary of State concerning the grievances then
                            complained of by the Canadians— That Lord Bathurst’s professions were
                            highly friendly and conciliatory—that he admitted the insuperable
                            difficulties of a Government at the distance of 3000 miles from the
                            people governed. That the time must come when the Canadas must have an
                            independent Government of their own— That the policy of the British
                            Government was accommodated to that expectation— That they wished to
                            retain their authority there, only during their feeble condition, with a
                            thin and scanty population, incapable of coping with the great and
                            growing power of the United States. It was the interest and policy of
                            England to cherish, and lay the foundation in this country of a
                            counterpoising power to the United States, and when they shall have
                            acquired a sufficient consistency to stand by themselves, they might
                            separate amicably from Great-Britain, substituting an alliance offensive
                            and defensive in the place of a superintending Government— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Papineau stated that he had candidly
                            expressed to Lord Bathurst opinions widely different from these— He had
                            avowed the conviction that a transatlantic Government could not serve
                            the purpose for a long time of a free people. That the separation must
                            therefore at no distant day must take place; and he believed that the
                            highest interest both of the United States and of Canada, dictated to
                            them the most intimate of National Unions— That by an alliance offensive
                            and defensive with Great-Britain, Canada, the weaker power would
                            necessarily be always involved in all the quarrels of the stronger— That
                            Canada could have no possible motive for engaging in European wars, and
                            no possible interest adverse to that of the United States— That <hi

                            <pb n="678" type="ms"/>her natural policy would be precisely the same
                            with that of the Union, Peace with all the world, and harmony with her
                            immediate Neighbours— Lord Bathurst’s reply was that these were the
                            opinions of a young man which he would find occasion by experience to
                            revise; and still insisted upon the policy of England to treat the
                            People of Canada with all possible kindness, and to cherish them as a
                            counteracting check upon the growing and formidable power of the United
                            States— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Papineau said that he had soon
                            after returned to Canada— That the policy of the British Government as
                            laid down to him by Lord Bathurst had been so ill managed or so
                            radically wrong that it had alienated the whole people of Canada— That
                            the detestation of the British Government in lower Canada, was
                            unanimous, and was shared by the majority of the People in Upper Canada—
                            That year after year the Executive Council had been struggling against
                            successive houses of Assembly passing bills, with majorities of 80 to 8
                            or 10— That the outbreaks of the last winter and recently were rash and
                            premature. Not approved by him; but lamented as injurious to the cause
                            which they were intended to promote. But that the British Government in
                            the Canada’s was now a barbarous, cruel, and vindictive despotism— It
                            was utterly detested by the People of Canada, whose principles and
                            affections and feelings were all turned towards the United States. That
                            in this their distressed condition he had hoped that some mark of
                            sympathy with the sufferings of the People of Canada might be obtained
                            from Congress, and he had addressed himself to me, as possessing
                            influence in that body, for advice and Counsel in their behalf— I asked
                            him if he had seen the President— He said he had not. That he had a
                            Letter of introduction to him, but supposing that at the commencement of
                            the Session he would be incessantly engaged not only in business, but
                            with visitors, he had not yet called upon him— I asked him if he had
                            read the part of the Message relating to the troubles in Canada— He said
                            he had— I said that the course of policy to be pursued by the Government
                            of the United States with reference to that interest was there fully set
                            forth: and it would be sustained by all the supporters of the
                            administration— I believed that the opposition generally considered the
                            Canadian subject nearly in the same point of view, and that the public
                            opinion ran so much in the same direction, that whoever should undertake
                            to go counter to it, would only expose himself to severe animadversions
                            without benefiting the Canadians at all. That our standing policy, had
                            been in all similar cases, Peace and neutrality. That for myself, I felt
                            the warmest sympathy for the sufferings of the Canadian People, But that
                            the statements now made by him had opened to me a view of the subject
                            entirely new— That I had never been made acquainted with the specific
                            grievances of the Canadians; and that from the appearances, hitherto,
                            both last winter and <hi rend="italic">recently</hi>
                            <pb n="679" type="ms"/>recently, the transactions there had more the
                            appearance of invasions from the United States, effected by our own
                            people, than of insurrections among the people of Canada— He said those
                            appearances were all delusive— That the people of Canada were nearly
                            unanimous against the British Government, and if they were armed would
                            join any invading party to overthrow that Government That the British
                            troops had burnt and destroyed many towns and villages of which he named
                            several, and had treated the people with the greatest possible outrage
                            and brutality; and that nothing but the bayonet now kept or hereafter
                            would keep them in subjection— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nelson,
                            was one of 8 persons who were sent by <persRef ref="lambton-john">Lord

                            Government had disavowed and censured— He said that when they arrived,
                            the <persRef ref="chapman-stephen">Governor</persRef> had informed them
                            that he had no authority to detain them, and that they might go where
                            they pleased— They asked him then for a vessel to return home; which he
                            answered he had no authority to do— So they hired a small vessel of not
                            more than 32 tons and came <hi rend="strikethrough">and</hi> to Norfolk—
                            They had not reached that port 24 hours before the British frigate Pique
                            came there in pursuit of them— This and much more was said by these
                            Gentlemen which I have no time to record— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Nelson asked me whether as members of the late Canadian Legislature,
                            they could be admitted behind the bar of the House; a question which I
                            could not answer— After they had left me, I overtook them again in the
                            Pennsylvania avenue and walked with them to the Capitol— H.R.U.S— The
                            contested Wisconsin election was again postponed till next Monday—and
                            the order passed for the appointment of the standing Committees—
                                <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> moved a new rule
                            of the House, that all elections by the House hereafter shall be by a
                            ballot; which motion lies over one day.— According to notice, I asked
                            leave to introduce a bill prohibiting the giving or accepting of a
                            challenge in the District of Columbia and providing for the punishment
                            thereof— It was read a first and second time by its title, and referred
                            to a select Committee of nine members.— I then offered as connected with
                            the bill 3. Resolutions, calling for any report or communication

                                    >r</hi> Martinez</persRef> Minister Plenipotentiary from Mexico;
                            who has returned here; and the Negotiations have been resumed since the
                            close of the last Session— He told me that the people of Mexico felt
                            themselves under great obligations to me— I said it was very pleasing to
                            me that what I have done should be considered by the People of Mexico as
                            beneficial to them— That I had acted under a commanding sense of duty to
                            my own country, and I had earnestly laboured for the preservation of
                            Peace and the restoration of harmony between the two Countries; which I
                            believed to be for the highest interest of both— He told me that he had
                            been here twenty years ago, attached to the Spanish Mission of <persRef
                                ref="onis-luis">Don Luis de Onis</persRef>—but this I had entirely
                            forgotten— I then called at the Department of War and saw <persRef
                                ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Poinsett</persRef>— I left with him a Letter from <persRef
                                ref="maul-john2">John Maul</persRef>, an unfortunate man, who 25
                            years ago, was a Captain of Infantry in the army; and is now at Houlton
                            in the State of Maine enlisted as a common soldier.— He has been
                            performing hard service in that capacity one or two years; in removing
                            the Indians to their Western abode, and now on the border of the North
                            eastern boundary— I earnestly recommended this poor man for some
                            promotion, but was unable to answer the question put by M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Poinsett, what were his habits? He said he
                            would have the enquiry made and if not intemperate he should be
                            promoted— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Poinsett spoke to me of the
                            exploring expedition, which he rejoiced to say was departed upon its
                            enterprize, and he hoped we should ere long have a good account of it.—
                            He spoke also of the Smithsonian bequest and declared himself warmly in
                            favour of appropriations for an observatory upon the largest and most
                            liberal foundation from it.— But he gave several intimations from which
                            I could draw no good augury— He said the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
                                >President</persRef> had not made up his mind in favour of an
                            Observatory—whence I infer that he will ostensibly neither favour nor
                            oppose it; but that he will underhandedly defeat it, taking care to
                            incur no personal responsibility for its failure— 2. He insisted that a
                            Salary of 1800 dollars a year would not be near enough for the
                            astronomer; whence I infer that jobbing for favourites is to be the
                            destiny of the Smithsonian fund— And 3. He said that among the
                            scientific men whom the President had consulted for the disposal of the
                            fund was the English Atheist South-Carolina professor <persRef

                        <p>There was a <persRef ref="u">stranger</persRef> with <persRef

                                Fowler</persRef> this morning who preached from Deuteronomy 32.9.
                            “For the Lord’s portion is his people; <persRef ref="jacob"
                                >Jacob</persRef> is the lot of his inheritance— 10. He found him in
                            a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he
                            instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye. 11 As an eagle
                            stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her
                            wings, taketh them on her wings 12. So the Lord alone did lead him, and
                            there was no strange god with him.” The discourse was upon the
                            superintending care of God; and it would seem as if nothing could be
                            added on that theme <hi rend="italic">to</hi>
                            <pb n="682" type="ms"/>to the picture in the text— Maternal affection,
                            solicitude and toil for her offspring; illustrated by the action of a
                            bird, painted in words to the eye, and ennobled by the nature of the
                            bird—for if you suppose the bird to be a wren the similitude would lose
                            all its grandeur, and if you suppose it an owl it would be ridiculous—
                            In the afternoon, somewhat belated by failing to hear the church-bell, I
                            attended alone at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church and

                            advent, and preach from Zechariah 12.10. “And I will pour upon the house
                            of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef>, and upon the inhabitants of
                            Jerusalem, the spirit of grace, and of supplications; and they shall
                            look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as
                            one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as
                            one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.” In this text again the
                            tender affections of the relation between the parent and child are
                            introduced with great pathos— In his comments upon the mourning for an
                            only son, and on the bitterness for a first-born, M<hi

                            tongue; and I felt what it would have been utterly impossible for me to
                            express— I finished reading the introduction to <persRef
                                ref="gleig-george">Gleig’s</persRef> History of the Bible, in which
                            I was surprized to find a statement that [“]the notion that the use of
                            Letters was unknown to our antediluvian ancestors, seems now to be
                            universally rejected”— If by Letters is meant alphabetical writing, the
                            evidence is all against its existence before the flood, and there is not
                            a particle of evidence to shew that any written record of any kind was

                        <p>A black man came this morning to my house and sent in a note signed
                                <persRef ref="william3">William Lodge</persRef>, asking money for
                            rent; and with the note, a Bible— I told my waiting man, <persRef
                                ref="smallwood-moses">Moses Smallwood</persRef> that it must be a
                            mistake, and that the man must be enquiring for some other person. He
                            then sent in word that he wanted to see me— He came in, and said that he
                            had got a white man named <persRef ref="u">Reynolds</persRef> to write
                            the note for him, but that it was only to get the means of seeing me—
                            That he had a message to me from the Lord, who had appeared to him, and
                            commanded him to say to me that the Negros must be made free— I enquired
                            of him his name. He said the name given him by his Parents was that
                            subscribed to the Note— William Lodge— But the Lord had given him the
                            name of John— I asked him of his occupation, and he said that until last
                            Thursday he had been working with a shoemaker in the Pennsylvania
                            Avenue, but he had then left him and was now without work— On further
                            enquiry I found that he had formerly lived with <hi rend="italic"
                                >me</hi>
                            <pb n="683" type="ms"/>me, and in the Summer of 1830 went with the
                            family to Quincy. He was then not more than eighteen or nineteen years
                            old, and I was obliged to turn him off for gross misconduct in the
                            house— The summer afterwards while my Son <persRef key="adams-john2"
                                >John</persRef> was living with his family in the House on the
                            President’s Square, in this City, the House was broken open in the Night
                            and robbed, by a gang of which this Messenger from the Lord was the
                            pilot and perpetrator— He was taken up, and lodged sometime in jail; but
                            was finally released for want of positive proof to convict him— I had
                            not heard of him since, and did not recognize him now, till upon
                            pressing enquiries he acknowledged that he had lived with me— And he
                            said that the Lord had told him that after <persRef key="adams-john">my
                                father’s</persRef> death, his Estate at Quincy belonged to him— I
                            told him to go away, and to deliver no more such Messages from the Lord
                            to any one, for so sure as he did, he would be taken up, and committed
                            to jail, and sold— That I would not complain of him to the police—but
                            others would if he should make any more revelations from the Lord—

                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Polk</persRef> the Speaker last
                            Saturday in the entry of the War Department, and he had asked if I
                            should have any objection to his naming on my Committee the members of
                            the Committee of the last Session; and I said, none at all. He said he
                            would give me a Committee favourable to the object of the Bill— I asked
                            him then the question which <persRef ref="nelson-wolfred"
                                >Nelson</persRef> the Canadian exile had put to me—whether as
                            members of a foreign Legislature they could be admitted on the floor of
                            the House behind the bar. The Speaker said they could if they were now
                            members of the Legislature— But as the Legislature itself has been
                            suppressed, they come not within the rule— In the House two Messages
                            were received from the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
                                >President</persRef>, with a large mass of Documents relating to the

                            and referred to a select Committee of nine members— There was also a
                            message, with a report from the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary

                            relating to the defalcation of the late Collector at New-York should be
                            referred to a select Committee, requesting however that he might not be
                            appointed upon it— The question of the contested Seat as Delegate for
                            the territory of Wisconsin was at the motion of <persRef

                            of the House, that in all cases of Election by the House, the vote shall
                            be taken viva voce,—was then debated— <persRef ref="briggs-george"
                                >Briggs</persRef> and Tillinghast offered amendments, and after an
                            hour or more of discussion the previous question was carried— I then
                            recurred to the express provision in the Constitution of the United
                            States, that when the choice of a President of the United States
                            devolves upon the House of Representatives, the House shall choose <hi
                                rend="italic">by ballot</hi>— The Speaker told me that I was out of
                            order, but I read the passage in the Constitution, and appealed to it,
                            in vain—the Resolution was adopted by yeas and nays 126 to 85—but so
                            glaring was the violation of the Constitution, that after the rule was
                            adopted, at the motion of <persRef ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod
                                Williams</persRef> an amendment was adopted confining the new rule
                            to the election of “Officers of the House[”]— This incident affords an
                            illustration of the utter recklessness with which deliberative
                            assemblies in voting trample upon written Constitutions which every
                            member of them is sworn to support— Mercer obtained a suspension of the

                        <p>Walking to the House this morning I overtook <persRef

                                Preston</persRef> of South-Carolina, and enquired of him if he knew
                            any thing about the pictures, which in joint Committee we had ordered
                            for the vacant pannels of the Rotundo— He said he had heard nothing of
                            them— That they had turned him out of the Library committee of the
                            Senate, and his colleague (<persRef ref="calhoun-john"
                            >Calhoun</persRef>) engrossed all the favours of the <persRef
                                ref="vanburen-martin">Administration</persRef>.— He spoke of the
                            electioneering campaign, which since the last Session of Congress he had
                            been obliged to pass through in South-Carolina, in a subdued tone, of
                            indifference unwilling to disclose the bitterness of his Soul— He
                            enquired of me with much earnestness of manner, whether I knew of any
                            picture of <persRef ref="allston-washington">Alston’s</persRef> of any
                            size which he could purchase— And he told me that he doubted whether

                            the picture for the <hi rend="italic">Rotundo</hi>

                                >Fleischmann</persRef> presented me a Letter of Introduction from

                            to Congress proposing a National Institute of Agriculture to be
                            established under the Smithson legacy— There was a proposal made in the
                            House that the States should be called for Petitions; whereupon <persRef
                                ref="atherton-charles">Atherton</persRef> of New-Hampshire rose and
                            offered five Anti-petition Resolutions—objection being made he moved a
                            suspension of the rules; which was carried by yeas and nays<space/>and
                            his Resolutions were introduced; and after supporting them by a speech
                            of about half an hour he finished by moving the previous question— These
                            Resolutions had been agreed upon at a Caucus of Administration members
                            last Saturday Evening. <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> of
                            Virginia was the only man who attempted direct resistance against this
                            process— He objected that the Resolutions surrendered the rights of the
                            South; and asked leave to present Resolutions of his own; but the House
                            would not suffer them even to be read. Other members, chiefly Southern,
                            asked for postponement of consideration till to-morrow; asked to be
                            excused from voting—for the printing of the Resolutions, and other
                            expedients for staving off the Vote; but all was in vain— I saw it would
                            be so from the beginning, and thought it not only most prudent, but most
                            proper to confine myself exclusively to the answer of ay or no, to each
                            of the questions as it arose, taking no part in the debate— There was a
                            call of the House at which 223 members answered to their names— The
                            second to the demand for the previous question was carried by a single
                            vote 103 to 102—18 members not voting. But the first of Atherton’s
                            Resolutions—denying to Congress all jurisdiction over the institution of
                            Slavery in the States was carried by 198 to 6. 19 members not voting— 7.

                            books placed on his table— The Secretary of the Senate was not there— I
                            told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King, that the Books and my Letter
                            to him were in the Secretary’s Office and he said there was no
                            difficulty in the case.— This morning I saw in the Intelligencer, that
                            the joint Resolution had been taken up in Senate, and referred to the
                            Committee on the Library; not yet appointed— I went again to the Senate
                            chamber— Neither the President, nor the Secretary was there— But I asked
                            for <persRef ref="machen-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Machin</persRef>, a Clerk in the Secretary’s Office, and at my
                            request he placed on the President’s table the packet of books, and
                            produced my Letter, which <persRef ref="davis-john4">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis</persRef> the Senator from

                            done, and the Senate concurred in the joint Resolution— For all this
                            delay I am chiefly responsible for not having spoken on the very day
                            that the Resolution passed the House, and requested the President of the
                            Senate, when it should be received there, to call for my Letter and the
                            Books. H.R.U.S. <persRef ref="atherton-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Atherton’s</persRef> four Anti-Abolition Resolutions
                            were all adopted by yeas and nays; and each in two divisions—numbers of
                            members asking to be excused from voting, but all refused— Several did
                            not vote, and <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> insisted upon
                            having it entered upon the Journal that he refused to vote— The
                            Resolutions were cunningly enough composed, blending together questions
                            of State rights and Congressional powers, and arguments and inferences,
                            all in wretched grammar and worse logic, and yet puzzling enough to
                            ensnare the whigs, and some of the abolitionists— Many of whom voted for
                            parts of the resolutions; as if any of them were not null and void—or as
                            if any Resolution of the House could define or circumscribe the powers
                            of Congress— At the instant when the last half of the last Resolution
                            was announced by the Speaker as adopted—that which declares that all
                            abolition Petitions, Resolutions and papers shall be laid on the table
                            without being read debated or referred, I rose and addressed him to
                            offer a Resolution that No Resolution of the House could add to or
                            deduct from the powers of Congress conferred by the Constitution of the
                            United States. But <persRef ref="kennedy-john">Kennedy</persRef> of
                            Maryland addressed the Speaker at the same time, and the Speaker gave
                            him the floor— He offered a Resolution to correct the grammar of one of
                            the Resolutions already adopted, against which he said he had voted,
                            because it was bad grammar, and before the question was taken whether
                            Kennedy’s Resolution should be received a motion to adjourn was made and
                            carried— Before the Meeting of the House I met <persRef

                            he had voted yesterday for Atherton’s first Resolution without
                            understanding it— That on seeing it in print this morning, he
                            disapproved it, and was disgusted with the whole proceeding— That he had
                            thoughts of moving a reconsideration of the Resolution for which he had
                            voted yesterday; but he did not. <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi

                            being conferred by the Constitution of the United States, no Resolution
                            of this House can add to or deduct from them. Objection was made to its
                            introduction. I moved a suspension of the rules, to introduce it, which
                            was refused by yeas and Nays<space/><persRef ref="wise-henry"
                                >Wise</persRef> then offered a string of what he called Southern
                            Resolutions ultra-servile; but the suspension of the rules was again

                            Atherton’s Resolution as related to that subject be rescinded.
                            Suspension of the rules refused<space/>John Calhoun of Kentucky, offered
                            a Resolution, instructing the Committee on the judiciary to report Bills
                            for enforcing in the non-slave holding States, the restitution of
                            fugitive Slaves. Suspension again refused. The comparison of the yeas
                            and nays upon these different questions might perhaps lead to some
                            useful conclusions— They indicate the rallying of the whole South to the
                                <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> Standard—the
                            close adhesion to it of the Northern and Western Serviles, and the total
                            want of settled principle in the Northern and Western opposition whigs—
                            I doubt if there are five members in the House who would vote for a Bill
                            to abolish Slavery in the District of Columbia, at this time— The
                            conflict between the principle of liberty, and the fact of Slavery is
                            coming gradually to an issue— Slavery has now the power and falls into
                            convulsions at the approach of Freedom— That the fall of Slavery, is
                            predetermined in the counsels of omnipotence, I cannot doubt— It is a
                            part of the great moral improvement in the condition of man, attested by
                            all the records of History— But the conflict will be terrible, and the
                            progress of improvement perhaps retrograde before its final progress to
                            consummation. This business having been disposed of the House proceeded
                            to the election viva voce of a Chaplain— Nine or ten persons were
                            nominated—of whom I nominated the <persRef ref="fowler-philemon">Rev<hi

                            to take it in his place, but I declined— The professor himself also came
                            to me with a Resolution ready prepared which he requested me to
                            offer—but I declined to take any part in the proceedings whatever— M<hi

                            was a rigmarole about the wonderful exemplification of the use of common

                            by the Rules of the House to private business— The <persRef
                                ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> said the call for Petitions was
                            the business first in order every day of the first thirty of the

                            The Speaker Commenced with New Hampshire, where the House had been left
                            by <persRef ref="atherton-charles">Atherton’s</persRef> Resolutions.
                            Then passing to Massachusetts, <persRef ref="cushing-caleb"
                                >Cushing</persRef> offered two Resolutions, recommitting to the
                            Committee of Foreign Affairs certain petitions, Resolutions and other
                            papers, which had been referred to them at the last Session, and he gave
                            notice that he should ask leave to introduce a Bill for the protection
                            of Citizens of the United States in the territory of Oregon— <persRef
                                ref="calhoun-william">W. B. Calhoun</persRef> presented several

                            objected to their being received— The Speaker said that under the
                            Resolutions which had been adopted by the House the question of
                            reception could not be made— From this decision Wise took an appeal, and
                            a debate of nearly two hours ensued, all between the Slaveholders
                            whether a question of the reception could be made of a paper which the
                            house had predetermined should be laid on the table— The Speaker
                            recurred to the precedents for the three last Sessions of Congress; and
                            Wise and <persRef ref="pickens-francis">Pickens</persRef>, groped about
                            to find a distinction, between the Resolutions of Atherton, and those of

                                <persRef ref="taylor-william7">Taylor</persRef> of New-York called
                            for the previous Question which was carried, the main question being
                            whether the decision of the Speaker should stand— When my name was
                            called by the <persRef ref="garland-hugh">Clerk</persRef>, I rose and
                            said, “M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Speaker—considering all the
                            Resolutions, introduced by the Gentleman from New-Hampshire as[”] . . .
                            the Speaker roared out—the Gentleman from Massachusetts must answer ay
                            or no, and nothing else—order!— With a reinforced voice— “I refuse to
                            answer, because I consider all the proceedings of the House as
                            unconstitutional[”]— While in a firm and swelling voice I pronounced
                            distinctly these words, the Speaker and about two thirds of the House
                            cried Order!— Order!! Order!!! till it became a perfect yell— I paused a
                            moment for it to cease, and then said— A direct violation of the
                            Constitution of the United States— While speaking these words with loud
                            distinct and slow articulation, the bawl of Order! Order!! resounded
                            again from two thirds of the House— The Speaker with agonizing lungs
                            screamed, [“]I call upon the House to support me in the execution of my
                            duty.!”— I then coolly resumed my Seat— <persRef ref="thompson-waddy"

                            back—the Gentleman from South-Carolina is out of order!—and a peal of
                            laughter burst forth from all sides of the House— The Clerk will proceed
                            with the call, said the Speaker and the yeas and nays 185 to 6. Wise
                            refusing also to answer, <hi rend="italic"><persRef ref="mercer-charles"

                            consists in attributing the supremacy if not the totality of Christian
                            virtue to <hi rend="italic">Faith</hi>— <persRef ref="paul">S<hi
                                    rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>, with great solemnity,
                            and with diffuse illustration of what he means by the word, ascribes it
                            to Charity— <persRef ref="watts-isaac">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
                                Watts</persRef>, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler, consider
                            the word here as synonymous with <hi rend="italic">Love</hi>. But Love
                            is a Passion— Charity is action— Action it may be, identical with that
                            of Love, but proceeding from a different motive Love, is a mere impulse
                            to action. There is in the English language no word synonymous with
                            Charity as here used by the Apostle— Beneficence comes perhaps the
                            nearest to it— Christ himself, in revoking the antient Levitical Law of
                            an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, instead of the precept thou
                            shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy says to his disciples—<hi
                                rend="italic">love</hi> your enemies—do good to them that hate
                            you—the first part of which precept bears on the temper of the heart—the
                            second to its manifestation by deeds—both are comprized in the word—
                                D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Watts’s paraphrastic hymn from this
                            chapter says, If Love to God and Love to men, be absent, all my faith is
                            vain— But the Charity of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul has
                            reference to the relations of Man, not with God but exclusively with his
                            fellow man— Charity to God, would not only be an inappropriate but an
                            improper expression— Love to God, is most emphatically enjoined by
                            Christ upon his disciples and it is the source of Faith, and perhaps of
                            Hope— But Charity is the bond of perfectness between Man and Man—
                            Perfectly distinct from Faith which relates to God, and from Hope, which
                            bears only upon self— Charity is the principle of united kindness and
                            beneficence—of good will and good deed to our fellow creatures of the
                            human race. And this S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul pronounces the
                            transcendent Virtue of Christianity—in competition with which all others
                            are <hi rend="small-caps">Nothing</hi>— In the afternoon, at S<hi

                        <p>I attended at the Capitol and in the chamber of the Committee of
                            Manufactures an hour before the Meeting of the House, making out the
                            list of Anti-Slavery Petitions, which I expected immediately to be
                            called to present— <persRef ref="edmonstone-james">Edmonston</persRef>
                            and <persRef ref="phillips-william4">Phillips</persRef>, were at the
                            door of the House and had me called out, but I told them I could not
                            wait, as the State of Massachusetts was under a call for Petitions— But
                            immediately after the Journal was read <persRef ref="fry-jacob">Jacob
                                Fry j<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> of Pennsylvania
                            offered a Resolution, calling upon the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
                                >President of the United States</persRef>, to inform the House,
                            whether the <persRef ref="ritner-joseph">Governor</persRef> of the State
                            of Pennsylvania, has called upon him for a military force, and powder
                            and ball, and buck shot and ammunition of War, to put down the People of
                            Pennsylvania at Harrisburg— Objection was made, and Fry moved, and
                            carried a suspension of the Rules, and his Resolution, one of those
                            which should lie over, one day, was considered immediately, and sprung a
                            debate of two hours, chiefly between the members from Pennsylvania—
                                <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef> moved an amendment of
                            further enquiry whether any officer of the general Government had been
                            concerned in the popular movement from Philadelphia to Harrisburg. Fry
                            accepted this amendment and the Resolution was adopted after some
                            sharpshooting between <persRef ref="petrikin-david">Petrikin</persRef>
                            and <persRef ref="beatty-william">Beatty</persRef> on one side, and

                                ref="mckennan-thomas">M’Kennan</persRef> on the other— Fry himself
                            has no power of Speech to answer any thing; but Petrikin is crusted with
                            rabblement filth, and Beatty speaks the vernacular of the emerald isle—
                            Naylor said the object of all this was to cheat him out of his election
                            to the next Congress— That the first fraud had been the attempt to throw
                            out votes giving him a majority of 1000 over his competitor, and return
                                <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles
                                J. Ingersoll</persRef> as the member elected— And that since this
                            expedition to Harrisburg, he had received a Letter threatening a
                            repetition of the same Scene here, if he should dare to take his seat in
                            the next Congress— After this brush, Petitions were called for from the
                            Massachusetts members— <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef>,
                                <persRef ref="parmenter-william">Parmenter</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="grennell-george">Grennell</persRef> presented sundry
                            anti-slavery petitions, among these was one praying that Congress would
                            recognize the Republican Government of Haïti, and enter into the usual
                            relations of National intercourse with that Island— This not being
                            included within the gag-Resolution, was without notice referred to the
                            Committee of foreign affairs— Afterwards Grennell presented one which
                            prayed for all the Slavery Abolitions, and also for the recognition of
                            Haiti, and moved that this part of the Petition should be <hi
                                rend="italic">referred</hi>
                            <pb n="693" type="ms"/>referred to the Committee of foreign Affairs;
                            upon which <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> rose and objected to
                            receiving the Petition— The <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef>
                            told him that one such Petition had already been referred to the
                            Committee of foreign Affairs— Wise then moved a reconsideration of that
                            vote— The Speaker and <persRef ref="garland-hugh">Clerk</persRef>, at
                            this point started a principle, more demonstrative of the agonizing
                            struggle of anti-abolition than any thing that had before occurred— Wise
                            asked to see the Petition, and the Clerk not finding it immediately
                            under his hand said it had not been sent to his table; upon which the
                            Speaker said that altered the case— If the Petition was not on the
                            Clerk’s Table, it was not in possession of the House, and the vote of
                            reference to the Committee had no effect, and the Petition was not
                            received— Now it is every days practice to receive and refer Petitions
                            without sending them to the Clerk’s table, till afterwards— This was one
                            of the Speaker’s wooden nutmegs; but it did not avail him; for after
                            further search the Petition which Grennell insisted he had sent to the
                            Clerk’s table was found upon it. Wise then turned again to his prior
                            objection to <hi rend="italic">receiving</hi>, the subsequent Petition
                            upon which he made a Speech, and was answered by me, immediately after
                            which the House adjourned— There was a fall of Snow, which covered the
                            ground. In the Evening I went to the theatre with <persRef

                        <p>I rose this morning with a bad cold, hoarseness, sore throat and cough;
                            attributable perhaps in equal portions to my speech in the House
                            yesterday; to my walk home through the slushy Snow; and to my visit last
                            Night to the cold and damp theatre— It has disabled me, for the present
                            to speak in public— I called on <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi

                            Anti-duelling Bill, whom I had caused to be notified to attend there

                            Republic of Haïti, on the objection made by <persRef ref="wise-henry"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wise</persRef> to its reception
                            was before the House— <persRef ref="grennell-george">Grennell</persRef>
                            made a speech of half an hour in favour of receiving it. <persRef
                                ref="fillmore-millard">Fillmore</persRef> expressed some impatience
                            for the question— <persRef ref="loomis-arphaxed">Loomis</persRef> moved
                            the Previous Question, and Wise moved to lay the whole subject on the
                            table; which was rejected by yeas and nays 65 to 121— The previous
                            Question was then carried; and the Petition was received by yeas and
                            nays 157 to 32. <persRef ref="reed-john">Reed</persRef> moved its
                            reference to the Committee of Foreign Affairs. <persRef
                                ref="stuart-archibald">Stewart</persRef> of Virginia moved to lay
                            the petition on the table which was refused by 84 to 105— These three
                            votes shew a graduation of unsettled opinions, and the panic terrors of
                            the South upon abolition. It is remarkable too that only 187 votes were
                            given on the first question and 189. on the second and third— More than
                            50 votes absent— Wise then withdrew his motion for reconsideration of
                            the prior reference of another petition— <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2"

                                >Saltonstall</persRef> presented numerous Anti-slavery
                            petitions—which were all laid on the table under the general order.—
                            Saltonstall presented another petition for the recognition of Haïti—
                                <persRef ref="legare-hugh">Legare</persRef> then objected again to
                            the reception of the Petition, and with some difficulty obtained a
                            hearing for a very elaborate and impassioned Speech—immediately after
                            which <persRef ref="cushman-samuel">Cushman</persRef> moved the Previous
                            Question, but failed 66 to 79. <persRef ref="petrikin-david"
                                >Petrikin</persRef> moved to adjourn—lost 75 to 89. Saltonstall
                            answered Legare very handsomely, and then the House adjourned— Morning

                                >Elmore</persRef> and <persRef ref="clark-john">Clark</persRef>— The
                            Bill and the Amendments of the former Committee were thoroughly
                            discussed, and all the amendments of the old Committee, but one, were
                            adopted with slight modifications— I disapproved most of the Amendments,
                            because they reduced the penalties of the Bill, as it came from the
                            Senate, instead of which they should in my opinion have been increased—
                            But a majority of the members of the Committee now present were members
                            of the former Committee, who had reported the amendments unanimously.
                            They had also reported a Section, relating to Commitments by the House
                            for contempt— I objected to this as a useless incumbrance to the bill,
                            and it was struck out— I was directed to report the Bill as amended—and
                            the Committee adjourned without day— In the House immediately after the
                            reading of <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
                            <pb n="695" type="ms"/>the Journal, with the permission of the House, I

                            amended, and referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the
                            Union— <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">M<hi rend="superscript"

                            Question, which was carried, and the reference of the Petition to the
                            Committee of Foreign Affairs was ordered without a division— <persRef
                                ref="williams-sherrod">Sherrod Williams</persRef> asked leave to
                            offer a Resolution for a new Rule—that on the presentation of a
                            Petition, objection being made to its reception, the question shall be
                            put and decided without debate— Objection was made and the suspension
                            was refused by yeas and nays. 91 to 99.— A Message was then received
                            from the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef>, with copies
                            of the correspondence, called for by <persRef ref="fry-jacob"
                                >Fry’s</persRef> Resolution, relating to the call of the <persRef
                                ref="ritner-joseph">Governor of Pennsylvania</persRef>, on the
                            President and Government of the United States for aid to quell the mob
                            at Harrisburg which prevented the organization of the State Legislature.
                            The papers were all read.— <persRef ref="naylor-charles"
                                >Naylor</persRef> moved that they be read and referred to a
                            Committee of the whole on the State of the Union— <persRef
                                ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef> moved that they be
                            printed and laid on the table, which was finally carried without a
                            division— Naylor made an ardent and passionate Speech and <persRef
                                ref="potter-william">Potter</persRef> an adverse one, in which he
                            said that the difficulties at Harrisburg were likely to be all amicably
                            settled. That is to say that three members of the whig house of
                            Representatives have gone over to the Democratic House, leaving the
                            whigs without a Quorum, and making one for the Democrats without
                            counting the members from Philadelphia, whose Seats are contested, but
                            who will now be secured to them by their compeers— The correspondence
                            shews a refusal by the President to give the aid called for by the
                            Governor of Pennsylvania, and a concurrence of all the Departments of
                            the general Government to countenance and support the popular movement
                            to overawe the Legislature— The whole series of these Events, is a
                            developement of our condition, of no good omen to the future operation
                            of our political institutions— Charges of gross fraud and corruption in
                            the election returns from Philadelphia, were made by both parties
                            against each other, neuter falso—both true— The result was two sets of 8
                            members returned to the Legislature— The elections for the remainder of
                            the State were so equally divided, that the eight members thus contested
                            form the majority of the House— Both sets repair to Harrisburg claiming
                            their Seats, and divide into two parties, each numbering a Quorum of the
                            House, and each organizing itself as a House— At this juncture a number
                            of individuals proceeding from Philadelphia and other place, occupy the
                            Halls of both Houses of the Legislature, and by threats of personal
                            violence, intimidate the members and interrupt the deliberations of the
                            body— The Governor of the State calls upon the Militia for the
                            restoration of Law and order—and also upon the President of the United
                            States for aid to suppress the Insurrection. The <hi rend="italic"
                                >call</hi>
                            <pb n="696" type="ms"/>call on the militia was answered— An armed body
                            of them were conveyed to Harrisburg, and order was restored— But three
                            members of the regularly constituted House, went over to the other, and
                            thus the party, which resorted to the direct interposition of the People
                            has prevailed, and the mock democracy becomes the democracy of numbers—
                            Fraud and violence have thus been introduced in to our elections, and
                            have signally triumphed— And the Government of the United States, called
                            to interpose for the preservation of the Laws and of order, refuses its
                            aid; affects a great abhorrence at interfering in the political
                            divisions of the people in the States, and thus gives its real aid and
                            support to fraud and violence against order and Law— But a precedent is
                            established by which in the event of a servile insurrection, all aid to
                            suppress it may be explicitly refused by the General Government, and by
                            all the free States.— After some small business Cambreleng moved to take
                            up his motion to refer to a select Committee the part of the Message

                            hoarseness have returned upon me, and almost suspended my voice—
                            Inability to sleep is one of its co-incidents, and I rose this morning
                            by half-past 3.— I received last Evening a Letter from <persRef

                            the call; and he said that it was a general call made by order of the
                            new judge upon all guardians of minors who had not settled accounts— I
                            said that as Administrator on the Estate of <persRef key="adams-john2"
                                >their father</persRef> I had settled a final account with a large
                            balance due from the Estate to me— That the children had no property of
                            their own, and that if a formal account must be stated I must charge
                            them with four years of maintenance, nurture and education, at such
                            allowance, as the judge should please to allow, and with nothing on the
                            debit side of the account— He turned to minutes on his record book and
                            said he found I had overpaid nearly 3000 dollars on my administration
                            account. He added that it would be sufficient for me to make a written
                            statement of the facts as I had now verbally done to him— That the judge
                            attended at the Office twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays usually
                            from Noon till 3. or 4. O’Clock— I said I would call again on one of
                            those days, as soon as I should have the opportunity— At the House,
                                <persRef ref="wise-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Wise</persRef> claimed the floor, on the ground that he had it
                            yesterday until the adjournment of the House but the <persRef
                                ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> decided that the Petitions must
                            first be called— Wise moved a suspension of the Rules, and for the yeas
                            and nays, both of which were refused— The call for <hi rend="italic"
                                >Petitions</hi>
                            <pb n="697" type="ms"/>Petitions was still upon Massachusetts, and all
                            the other members of the delegation having presented theirs, I now
                            presented mine. I began with the Memorial of <persRef
                                ref="edmonstone-james">James Edmonston</persRef> and the Stone
                            cutters and brick-layers workmen on the public buildings praying to be
                            indemnified for the loss of their time during the suspension of their
                            labours last Spring by order of the Committee on the public buildings— I
                            said I did not know why the <persRef ref="noland-william">Commissioner
                                of the public buildings</persRef> had not paid them their full wages
                            without requiring any action of Congress to authorise him to do them
                            mere Justice— I had thought of moving a simple Resolution directing the
                            Commissioner to pay them in full for their lost time— <persRef
                                ref="lincoln-levi2">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
                                Lincoln</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee then said that he had
                            been directed by the Committee to offer a Resolution for the payment of
                            these men; upon which I moved the reference of this Memorial to that
                            Committee— I presented several petitions for widows pensions and called
                            up others on the files— Also two long memorials for the Establishment of
                            scientific institutions, which were referred to the Smithsonian
                            Committee— I finally presented 6<space/>Abolition and Anti Slavery
                            Petitions and Memorials, all of which were laid on the table,
                            excepting<space/>praying for the recognition of the Republic of Haÿti,
                            all of which but one were referred to the Committee of foreign affairs.
                            Several of the abolition petitions contained a prayer that the Petion
                            should be referred to a select Committee, before whom the Petitioners
                            might be heard by themselves or by Counsel, and I moved that so much of
                            the Petition, should be granted— The Speaker decided that the Resolution
                            of the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript"
                                >t.</hi> requiring that all abolition petitions should on
                            presentation be laid on the table, and no further action of the House
                            had thereon, my motion was not in order. From this decision I appealed,
                            insisting that the prayer to be heard was a distinct, and separate
                            petition, which might be granted, and yet that all the other prayers
                            might be laid on the table— I referred to the precedent of yesterday
                            when so much of a Petion as prayed for the recognition of Hayti was
                            referred to the Committee of foreign Affairs although mingled up with
                            sundry abolition prayers which were laid on the table— I asked and
                            barely obtained the yeas and nays, and the decision of the Speaker was
                            affirmed<space/>Most of my colleagues deserting me on this question.
                            When I presented the first of the petitions for the acknowledgment of
                            the republic of Hayti, I moved it should be referred to the Committee of
                            Foreign Relations, with instructions to consider and report thereon—
                            Assigning as my reason for the Instructions, the argument used by
                                <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef>, the Chairman of the
                            Committee, yesterday; that similar petitions had heretofore been
                            referred to that Committee and were never heard of again: and adding
                            that it would be so now— I said it was this fact that former petitions
                            had been so treated, which was true, and the sort of pledge, given by
                            the Chairman of the Committee that these petitions should be so treated.
                                <persRef ref="cushman-samuel">Cushman</persRef> who was sitting two
                            rows behind me, here <hi rend="italic">said</hi>
                            <pb n="698" type="ms"/>said so loud that I heard him— “that insinuation
                            should not be made against a Gentleman” on which I turned to him and
                            said, I shall make what insinuation I please and then turning again to
                            the Speaker, said this is not an insinuation, but a direct and positive
                            assertion— <persRef ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> then made a
                            point of order, and the Speaker said, as the Petition occasioned debate
                            it must lie over one day— Upon which I withdrew the motion for
                            instructions and the petition was referred— I afterwards presented
                            another petition, and moved the instructions again to lie over a day for
                            debate; telling Howard that I would give him an assortment with and
                            without instructions— Among the Petitions that I presented were four
                            abolitionist from Ohio County, Virginia. and one signed by <persRef
                                ref="cowperthwait-w">W. Cowperthwait</persRef> and 220 citizens of
                            Philadelphia, to rescind the gag-resolution— All laid on the table—
                                <persRef ref="slade-william">Slade</persRef> presented a Petition
                            for the recognition of Hayti, and moved its reference to the Committee
                            of Foreign Affairs with instructions to bring in a bill; which was laid
                            over for debate— The call for Petitions went through the States and
                            Territories entire, and the house adjourned after four O’Clock— <persRef

                            with Cramps in the Night, and the Bible reading this morning was
                            intermitted— H.R.U.S. <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">Cushing</persRef>
                            moved an amendment to the Journal stating that on his presenting a
                            petition which was laid on the table under the gag-Resolution, he had
                            protested that in submitting to this application of the Resolution, he
                            yielded, not to right but to power, conceiving the resolution,
                            unconstitutional null and void; which protest he moved to have entered
                            on the journal. But the <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef>
                            decided that the motion was not in order— <persRef
                                ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> alarmed at this proposition
                            made an attempt to suppress it altogether— I had thus recorded by a
                            motion to amend the journal, my protest against the gag-resolutions of
                            the last Congress and shewn that the rejection of the motion as
                            effectually secures the record of the protest as its adoption. Dromgoole
                            insisted that something should be done to prevent this record of
                            contumacy; and Howard proposed that when the journal of this day should
                            be read to-morrow morning, the entry of Cushing’s motion should be
                            struck out— I said that would not be sufficient for the purpose of
                            suppression— For the motion to strike out must itself shew what was to
                            be stricken out and the protest must be recorded even in the motion to
                            erase it— <persRef ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> said if they were
                            going to adopt the <persRef ref="benton-thomas">Bentonian</persRef>
                            process of expunging, he for one would go for the gentleman from
                            Massachusetts— Dromgoole said he saw there was a difficulty in the case,
                            but that it ought not so to be— The question upon the motion was taken
                            by yeas and nays, and the amendment was rejected 14 to<space/>but the
                            protest stands of course upon the record— After this and some discussion
                            between <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> and
                            Wise, Reports from Committees were called— Cambreleng reported sundry
                            Bills from the Committee of Ways and Means, after <persRef
                                ref="buchanan-andrew3">Buchanan</persRef> from the Committee of
                            Elections, had reparted <hi rend="italic">on</hi>
                            <pb n="699" type="ms"/>on the contested election of the delegate for the
                            Territory of Wisconsin concluding with a Resolution that <persRef
                                ref="doty-james">James Duane Doty</persRef>, is entitled to the
                            seat; and that <persRef ref="jones-george2">George W. Jones</persRef> is
                            not— The case is so perfectly clear, that as the Delegate has no vote,
                            the report of the Committee is consistent with common sense. There was
                            not so much as a colourable pretence for claiming the Seat; but the
                            logic of both the reports of the Committee on the Mississippi elections
                            was in his favour. The consideration of the report was at his request
                            postponed, and made the special order of the day for next Thursday— The
                            Reports of Committees were numerous, and occupied the House till past
                            two O’Clock. Among them was a joint Resolution from the Committee on the
                            Public buildings, for the settlement of the claims of the workman for
                            the term during which their work was suspended by order of the <persRef
                                ref="vanburen-martin">President of the United States</persRef>— It
                            was read twice and ordered to be engrossed for a third reading
                            to-morrow— At last Cambreleng’s resolution for a select Committee of
                            enquiry concerning <persRef ref="swartwout-samuel">Swartwout’s</persRef>
                            defalcation, with <persRef ref="garland-hugh">Garland’s</persRef>
                            amendment extending the enquiry and proposing the choice of the
                            Committee by ballot; and Wise’s amendment to refer the whole subject be
                            referred to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, came
                            up— Wise resumed his argument, left unfinished the day before yesterday
                            and spoke six hours without intermission. The Speech was the most
                            powerful and unanswerable attack upon the administration and especially
                            upon the <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the
                                Treasury</persRef> that has ever been made in Congress, and as he
                            passed from charge to charge, he supported every imputation by the
                            documents from the Treasury Department itself— So utterly callous to the
                            grossest and rankest abuses have the supporters of this Administration
                            become, that when Wise began four-fifths of them left the house and did
                            not return—and as soon as Wise sat down, Previous Question <persRef

                        <p>H R.U.S. I found myself immediately after the reading of the Journal
                            unexpectedly engaged in debate. The <persRef ref="polk-james"
                                >Speaker</persRef> said that before the call for Petitions, the
                            question laid over upon the Petition for the recognition of the Republic
                            of Haÿti, that it should be referred to the Committee of foreign Affairs
                            with Instructions to consider and report thereon, was now open for
                            consideration— <persRef ref="dromgoole-george">Dromgoole</persRef>,
                            moved a division of the question: first on the reference, and then upon
                            the instructions— The question of reference was carried without a
                            division, and I assigned my reasons for moving the Instructions; which
                            were the fact stated by the Chairman of the Committee <persRef
                                ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef>, which I knew to be true;
                            that similar Petitions had been heretofore referred to that Committee
                            and were never heard of again; and the pledge given by him, that if the
                            House would refer these Petitions to that Committee they would share the
                            same fate— I urged the duty of Committees to repost on subjects referred
                            to them by the House, as a duty to the House; to the Petitioners and to
                            the Country— I said I took it for granted there would be no reason
                            assigned <hi rend="italic">by</hi>
                            <pb n="700" type="ms"/>by the Chairman of the Committee for resisting
                            the motion for Instructions or withholding a report— The answer would be
                            the previous question or the laying on the table— I must therefore infer
                            that the reasons for not reporting would be the same as those given by a
                            member of the Committee (<persRef ref="legare-hugh">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Legare</persRef>) two days ago, for
                            refusing to receive the petition— I then took up and refuted Legare’s
                            arguments; but was soon called to order by the Speaker and by sundry
                            Southern members— I was perfectly in order, and therefore persevered,
                            till <persRef ref="bynum-jesse">Bynum</persRef> objected to my being
                            permitted to proceed— Upon which <persRef ref="briggs-george"
                                >Briggs</persRef> moved that I might proceed <hi rend="italic">in
                                order</hi>.— The question was taken by yeas and nays, and the vote
                            was 114 to 47. that I might proceed— The Speaker said—the leave to
                            proceed is granted—to which I replied— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Speaker I have not asked leave to proceed— But I did proceed; and said
                            the Gentleman from South-Carolina, so familiar with <persRef
                                ref="hatsell-john">Hatsell</persRef> knows and will not deny that
                            what by direct reference may be not in order, is altogether
                            parliamentary when stated hypothetically— So I will suppose that the
                            Committee should have the same reasons for neglecting to report, that he
                            had assigned for refusing to receive the Petition, and I contend that
                            they are not good and sufficient reasons— And then I dissected and
                            pulverised his whole argument— When I first assailed it, he was not
                            there. He came in while I was in the midst of the Analysis, and after I
                            had finished he came to my seat, and said he regretted he had been
                            absent; and had not had the remotest suspicion that the question would
                            come on this day.— I told him it had been equally unexpected to me—
                            Howard was not there, but Bynum answered me in a tempest of fury. Bynum
                            is a member of the Committee and a spitfire democrat. He is a small thin
                            man, with a perpetual agony in his face—a dark brow; a livid complexion,
                            a haggard look, a ghastly smile, and when he speaks his face is
                            distorted with convulsion— His discourse is one uniform growl of
                            invective upon federalists; the bank, Loco-pocos, old women and priests—
                            But he is a favourite Orator of the party— Bynum was time after time
                            called to order by the Speaker, of which he complained bitterly, but
                            vented all his gall— He speaks always in a menacing tone, and pointed at
                            me with his finger, and looked as if he would eat me the whole time he
                            was speaking— <persRef ref="bouldin-james">Bouldin</persRef> made a
                            feeble, timid, faltering speech in favour of my motion; for which he
                            said he should vote; but <persRef ref="campbell-john7"
                                >Campbell</persRef> of S.C. moved to lay the motion on the table and
                            it was carried by yeas and nays, 110 to 46.— Bouldin did not vote— Nor
                            did <persRef ref="parmenter-william">Parmenter</persRef>— No other
                            business of any consequence was done; and the house by yeas and nays 110
                            to 69 adjourned over till Wednesday— I got the old Petitions from
                            Plymouth for a Custom House; from Wareham for a Port of Entry, and from
                            Hingham for work to improve their harbour sent to the Committee of
                            Commerce; and obtained the printed documents of the second Message of

                        <p>In the course of the last Night the wind came round to the North-west,
                            and a cold gale blew the whole day, sharpening to the extreme of
                            Winter.— Morning service at the Presbyterian Church, where a stranger
                            preached from Revelation 3.20. [“]Behold I stand at the door and knock;
                            if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come into him, and
                            will sup with him, and he with me.”— This is a part of what <persRef
                                ref="john">John</persRef> was commanded to write, to the Angel of
                            the Church of Laodicea, that the Amen the true and faithful Witness, the
                            beginning of the creation of God, said— Three distinct figures of
                            oriental imagery to signify Jesus Christ— He is the Amen. A mere
                            abstraction— He is the faithful and true Witness. He is the beginning of
                            the creation of God— The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of created
                            beings—but a creation of God—therefore not God.— But of this the
                            preacher took no notice.— Nor that the words of the text were a part of
                            the Spirits address to the Laodiceans, whom he tells that they are
                            neither hot nor cold—nor did the preacher notice this— But the whole
                            discourse was upon Christ’s standing at the door and knocking; which
                            figure he ran down by the multitude of repetitions— After the service, I
                            rode over to the heights of Georgetown, and left Cards at <persRef

                                    >r</hi> Calderon de la Barca’s</persRef> the Spanish Minister.
                            After dinner I went to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church,
                            but there was no service there; I suppose owing to the severity of the
                            cold— I read the second, and part of the third Chapter of <persRef
                                ref="gleig-george">Gleig’s</persRef> History of the Bible, and found
                            with no small surprize that he seriously argues that the narrative of
                            the fall from Paradise in the Book of Genesis must be taken in a literal
                            sense— That there was a garden—a tree of knowledge—a tree of life and a
                            talking Serpent— That the fruit of the tree of knowledge was an apple,
                            and that the whole race of man was accurst, because their first
                            progenitors were tempted with apples growing upon a tree, and plucked
                            and ate them— Credat Judaeus Apella— The account of <persRef ref="moses"
                                >Moses</persRef> I believe is a translation into alphabetical
                            writing of more antient records in hieroglyphics.— The trees of
                            knowledge and of life are personified abstractions, and the Serpent is
                            the fascinating and seductive Spirit— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Gleig like other theological commentators starts strong objections to
                            meet them with feeble answers. I read also part of a very interesting
                            historical address to a youthful Society at Philadelphia; of which I
                            have received a copy, from its author, <persRef ref="reed-william2"

                            week, if I would attend such a conference— I said no— That from the
                            peculiar position, in which I stood, I had since 1829. taken no part in
                            the Presidential elections, and should take none for the remnant of my
                            life, unless called to vote as a member of the House, in which case I
                            should vote for the candidate favoured by the majority of my

                            the Kentuckians, upon the subject of the Presidency— Reed whom I met
                            yesterday in the Street that they had postponed for a week the

                            and found him alone— He is like myself under deep concern at the

                            been exhibited within the last four years; for the introduction of which

                            resign his Seat in the Senate— There is no good will lost between M<hi

                            the distribution of its topics among the Committees— Haynes had made

                            then failed— Objection was now made, but he moved and carried a

                                >Speaker</persRef> called me to the Chair.— Haynes moved thirteen
                            Resolutions, distributing the fragments of the message among the several
                            Committees, which were read at the <persRef ref="garland-hugh"

                            it with very great severity— He complained that the House was taken by
                            surprize in this sudden movement upon the Message, and that he was quite
                            unprepared for the discussion upon it— But he made a speech of three
                            hours, and as he sat down <persRef ref="prentiss-seargent">Sargeant S.

                            however only the introduction. I suppose him charged with a Speech of at
                            least three hours— After announcing his purpose he moved the Committee
                            to rise, and without opposition they rose and I reported that the
                            Committee had had under consideration the Message of the President of
                            the United States, and had come to no Resolution thereon— Upon Haynes’s

                            to C. Cushing about a meeting of the delegation to prepare a
                            communication to the Legislature of Massachusetts— He said he would
                            confer with the other members of the delegation to fix upon a time. He
                            said he had already written a Letter to his constituents to be published

                            of the United States, the cream of the land, the culled darlings of
                            fifteen millions, scattered over a surface of two Millions of square
                            Miles, the remarkable phenomenon that they present is the level of
                            intellect and of morals upon which they stand— And this universal
                            mediocrity is the basis upon which the liberties of this Nation repose—
                            H.R.U.S. this was the day which had been fixed for the consideration of
                            the Report of the Committee of Elections on the contested Seat of the

                            Buchanan was asked whether his motion was made at the request of Jones

                            substantiating the facts— He appeared to be heard too with the same
                            indifference, and the same dropping off of the administration members
                            from their Seats— When he sat down, <persRef ref="cushman-samuel"

                            when the House adjourned without taking the question— The administration
                            party were disconcerted at this sudden sally; dreading above all things
                            the publication of the documents, and yet dreading with equal terror the

                            Thomas made a desperate plunge to put it upon the detected errors of the
                            list of Defaulters in the Document N. 111. Wise took this argument from
                            him by withdrawing the call for document 111. upon which Thomas’s last
                            resort was to object to the number of the remainder— He was willing to

                            the rules was rejected by a minority of more than one third. Several
                            Bills from the Senate were read the first and second time, and referred
                            to the appropriate Committees— One, for the remission of duties on

                            moved the reference to the standing Committee of the Public Lands— A

                            embezzlement and waste— Seven members of it, out of nine deeply
                            interested, politically, factiously and individually in wresting and
                            pilfering the public Lands from the Nation whose inheritance they are—

                            years upon all those superannuated claims— The Committee at the last

                            Matthew 5.14. “Ye are the light of the world.” It was just five weeks
                            since I had heard a Sermon upon the same text from <persRef

                            solicitation was in no wise bashful—for there was a blank paper and a
                            pencil placed in every pew, for those who were liberally disposed to set
                            down what they would give and secondly there was a collection taken up,
                            between the last hymn in the Doxology—and the preacher informed the
                            auditory that it was desirable that the <persRef ref="fowler-philemon"

                            Association, which he would be by a contribution from his flock; of 50
                            dollars; only 5 dollars each for ten persons, and only half that sum.—
                            The congregation preferred making smaller and immediate contributions,
                            and of them not many.— This mode of sturdy beggary between a hymn and a
                            doxology, adds nothing to the reverence of the place, and was I think
                            not approved either by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fowler or by his

                            they know not what they do.”— I read the remainder of Chapter 3. and

                            there is nothing in scripture to account for the colour of the African
                            negro, or to countenance the pretence that Ham was of a different colour
                            from his father Noah, or his brothers <persRef ref="shem">Shem</persRef> and <persRef ref="japhet"

                        <p>I received this morning a Letter postmarked and dated Montgomery,
                            Alabama, threatening me with assassination for offering in the House the
                            three Resolutions of the House to call on the <persRef
                                ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> to know whether he has

                                <persRef ref="perry-matthew">Captain Matthew C Perry</persRef> to
                            account for their conspiracy against the life of <persRef

                                ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef> of Georgia moved to go in to
                            Committee of the whole on the state of the Union upon the Presidents
                            message and his resolutions— But as this was the regular day to call the
                            States for Resolutions, he was urged from various quarters to withdraw
                            his motion, and did so.— The States and Territories were called through,
                            for Resolutions and it consumed the day. The <persRef ref="polk-james"
                                >Speaker</persRef> began with Maine— When the turn of Massachusetts
                            came, and my Colleagues had offered all their Resolutions, I asked the
                            House to take up the three Resolutions offered by me on the 6<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month; which I observed had been
                            ordered to lay over one day which had already lasted nearly one month.
                            The house instantly bristled with objections, and the Speaker said the
                            Resolutions must lay over because they occasioned debate— I then moved
                            to suspend the rule, and to induce the House to take up my Resolutions I
                            sent to the <persRef ref="garland-hugh">Clerk’s</persRef> Table the
                            threatening Letter which I had received this morning, and asked that it
                            might be read— It was read in a bungling manner, and it caused nothing
                            but laughter in the house— I said, I did not send the Letter, to found
                            upon it as I might, a claim of privilege but merely to ask the House now
                            to consider my 3. Resolutions— <persRef ref="thomas-francis"
                                >Thomas</persRef> started up in great agitation, and said it was a
                            miserable quiz and he hoped the house would not notice it— They refused
                            to suspend the rules, and the Letter was returned to me at my demand.
                            Many of the members had clustered round the clerk’s table to inspect it—
                                <persRef ref="lewis-dixon">Lewis</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="martin-joshua2">Martin</persRef> of Alabama and <persRef
                                ref="turney-hopkins">Turney</persRef> of Tennessee, came to my Seat
                            and asked to see the Letter— Lewis said Montgomery was in his
                            District—and Martin expressed regret that it should have come from his
                            State— Three of the Reporters sent me notes and a fourth spoke to me
                            asking leave to take copies of the Letter for publication, to which I
                            consented— A multitude of other Resolutions were offered; among which
                            one by <persRef ref="cushman-samuel">Cushman</persRef> for an Amendment
                            to the Constitution, disqualifying duelists for Office— Several by

                            chosen by ballot— Cushman objected to the consideration of this
                            Resolution— <persRef ref="calhoun-william">W. B. Calhoun</persRef> moved
                            a Resolution that the Resolutions of the State Legislatures shall not be

                            near four. In the Evening I called on <persRef ref="pope-john">M<hi
