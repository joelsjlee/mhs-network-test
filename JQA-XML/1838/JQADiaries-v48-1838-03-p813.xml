                            on two Committees and Harrison, because he had too much other business
                            to attend to.— <persRef ref="bouldin-james">Bouldin</persRef> Chairman
                            of the Committee on the District of Columbia, made a report on that part

                            referred to the Committee, perfectly characteristic of himself— It was
                            read at my demand, and a debate arose which ended in a recommitment of
                            the Report at the motion of <persRef ref="jenifer-daniel"

                            with large amendments—but now he moved the Previous Question, cutting
                            off all the amendments reported by himself and his Committee to take
                            without debate the question upon the Bill from the Senate to prevent the
                            abatement of suits I objected—but the Previous Question was carried; and
                            the Bill was passed to a third reading, and passed— The Pension
                            Appropriation Bill was then taken up and debated— <persRef

                            there was to be also a report, but at the request of the minority it was
                            postponed till next Tuesday— There has been in fact no minority upon

                            second Judge of the Orphan’s Court—the present judge being superannuated
                            and incapable— Dawson reported an amendment also limiting the term of
                            the judge’s Office hereafter to four years—debate arose, the hour
                            expired and the new neutrality Bill reported yesterday and made the
                            special order for this day was taken up; and after a warm debate passed

                            accommodated to my amendments. While the Clerks were engrossing it— I
                            asked leave to offer a Resolution calling on the <persRef

                            would be useless to move a suspension of the Rules— I invited a meeting
                            of the members of the Massachusetts delegation to-morrow morning; to

                            read my draft of an answer to the Letter from <persRef

                            twice, and much objection rose against it, and much diversity of opinion
                            concerning it— Governor Lincoln especially seemed much annoyed by it and
                            by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alvord’s Letter— I proposed that my
                            draft should be referred to him, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Fletcher to revise and amend at their discretion, but he positively
                            declined, and it was finally referred to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Fletcher and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Reed— Lincoln takes exactly
                            the course that he did in the Committee of the overseers of Harvard
                            University at the time of the mutiny of the Students— He will neither
                            take nor follow a lead— The phantom always before his eyes is
                            responsibility— The other members of the delegation in this case are
                            scarcely less so— Between two fires Anti-Slavery and the right of
                            Petition— Distrustful of Cushing and of his course—somewhat emulous, not
                            to say envious of his aspirations— And absolutely angry with him for
                            presenting the Resolutions— I find in all this admonition to extreme
                            caution in my own steps— We found the House in Session— Reports of
                            Committees. The Bill for the appointment of a second judge of the
                            Orphan’s Court and limiting his term of service to 4 years was postponed
                            till next Tuesday— <persRef ref="johnson-william2">W. Cost

                            shut up— I then went with Elizabeth to Trinity Church where the morning
                            service for the first Sunday in lent was performed, and the sermon was
                            from 1. Peter 2.21. [“]For-ever hereunto were ye called; because Christ
                            also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his
                            steps”—a discourse on the atonement— We did not stay to witness the

                            is to do the will of him, who sent me, and to finish his work— The day
                            was occupied in filing noting and recording the Petitions received
                            within the last week; I received a note from <persRef

                            to prevent the barbarous and unchristian practice of duelling— I have
                            been urged by sundry pious persons to busy myself about this reform and
                            I would enter with great zeal, into the project; if zeal could effect
                            any thing. My position in a minority makes it useless for me to
                            undertake any thing— I fear also that in the present state of the world,
                            it is an absolutely impracticable thing to suppress the practice of
                            duelling. What influence of fear of punishment can be exercised over men
                            who begin by deliberately staking their lives upon a feather?— <persRef

                                Ratcliff</persRef> was here this morning. His memorial for

                            to the Committee of Roads and Canals M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

                            the subject— I advised it— I received by the Mail this morning from
                            Rocky Mount, Franklin County Virginia, signed by <persRef
                                ref="brown-john12">John V. Brown</persRef> and 12 others, a Letter
                            and Petition to Congress, to arraign at the Bar of the House and expel
                            forever John Quincy Adams— At the House it was the day for calling up
                            the States, for Resolutions— The <persRef ref="polk-james"
                                >Speaker</persRef> began with Wisconsin and Florida, going through
                            the Territories and new States, then North and East, concluding with
                            Maine— When Massachusetts was called after all the other members of the
                            delegation who had resolutions to offer had finished, I offered a
                            Resolution, that the Letter and Petition, with the names of the signers
                            be printed and referred to a Committee of nine members, to consider and
                            report thereon, with liberty to send for persons and papers— The Speaker
                            said the Petition could not then be received— Resolutions having then
                            the exclusive right to reception I claimed the reception of the
                            Petition, as involving the privilege of the House and its Members— It
                            was accordingly received and read, with the names, <persRef

                            that district said he did not know one of the signers and believed the

                            if the question of <hi rend="italic">reception</hi> could not be made—
                            The Speaker said it was too late— Mercer moved the question of
                            consideration—another moved to lay the whole on the table, and that was
                            carried— The Resolutions of the Legislature of Alabama, for the
                            annexation of Texas were introduced by <persRef ref="lawler-joab"
                                >Lawler</persRef> and at his motion ordered to be printed and laid
                            on the table— I moved their reference to a select Committee, and barely
                            obtained a vote by yeas and nays—<space/><persRef ref="thompson-waddy"
                                >Waddy Thompson</persRef> told me that he had received last winter a

                                n="818" type="ms"/>presented it— After the call for Resolutions had
                            gone through the Speaker began again at Wisconsin the call for
                            Petitions— Proceeding as far as Virginia, when after several
                            unsuccessful attempts, a motion to adjourn, about 4. O’Clock was
                            carried— I walked home, accompanied to the parting point by <persRef

                            There were several votes taken this day without a quorum— This evening a

                            ten dollars of me to bear his expenses down to Norfolk where he said he
                            was going by order of the <persRef ref="dickerson-mahlon">Secretary of
                                the Navy</persRef>, to prepare for his examination— He said he had
                            just returned from a Station in the West-Indies— He said he belonged to
                            Boston, and had no friends or acquaintance here—and should receive the
                            money for his travelling expenses at Norfolk and would immediately send
                            me the money— I trusted his coat, and his story—lent him the ten dollars
                            and took his note— Not thinking to look into the Navy Register till
                            after he was gone, and finding there no Midshipman of that name—</p>

                            should be acted on— The Amendments to the Neutrality Bill from the

                            trade— Among the amendments was a limitation of the act to two years
                            debated but agreed to. The civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill was
                            debated in Committee of the whole on the Union— Post Office
                            Appropriation not sufficiently specific debated and amended—no question

                        <p>Rainy night and morning— I called at the Pension office, and made
                            enquiries of the Commissioner <persRef ref="edwards-james">J. L.
                                Edwards</persRef>, concerning the claims of <persRef

                            overburthened with official labour.— I left the note with M<hi

                            a meeting of six members of the delegation, but could not agree upon any
                            part of the answer; and he returned my papers to me— Reed apologized to
                            me for giving me so much trouble; but seemed not to know whether they
                            would answer the Letter at all— <persRef ref="fletcher-richard"

                            there yesterday— It is evident that they are all averse to any action
                            which may countenance the Anti-Slavery excitement at home— Their wish
                            is, as much as possible to suppress it— Their policy is dalliance with
                            the South, and they care no more for the right of petition, than is
                            absolutely necessary to satisfy the feeling of their Constituents.— They
                            are jealous of Cushing who they think is playing a double game— They are
                            envious of my position as the supporter of the right of petition—and
                            they truckle to the South to court their favour for <persRef

                            with the South on the Slavery and the Texas questions.— <persRef

                            opinion, but does not venture to part from them in policy— Fletcher,
                            since his Caucus Speech in Faneuil-Hall and his faltering defence of it
                            in the house is a cypher, and will drop from his Seat or decline a
                            re-election. I will keep with them as long as I possibly can, but may be
                            forced to separate from them even before the close of the present
                            Session of Congress— I asked leave this morning to present two petitions
                            relating to the <persRef ref="cilley-jonathan">Cilley</persRef> duel—one
                            from <persRef ref="tracy-fp">Frederic P. Tracy</persRef>, and 5 other
                            Methodist clergymen in Massachusetts praying for the expulsion of
                                <persRef ref="graves-william2">Graves</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> from the House—the other, from
                                <persRef ref="fuller-john2">John E. Fuller</persRef> and 27 other
                            abolitionists in Boston, praying for the expulsion of all the parties
                            concerned in the duel, and for an act of Congress to prevent duelling
                            between their members in future. I merely stated that they related to
                            the duel, and that my wish was to have them referred to the
                            investigating Committee. Objection <pb n="821" type="ms"/>was made, and
                            I asked for the yeas and nays— They were refused, and less than
                            two-thirds voted to suspend the rules—but there was no quorum—a second
                            vote was taken, more numerous, but still less than two thirds to
                            suspend, and no Quorum— <persRef ref="patton-john">Patton</persRef> who
                            in the meantime came in, took up from my table the Petition of Fuller
                            and others, looked it over and asked for the yeas and nays which were
                            then granted, the vote to suspend was 9 to 53—not two thirds, and so the
                            rule was not suspended— Patton told me that if the rule had been
                            suspended he should have asked for the yeas and nays on the <hi
                                rend="italic">reception</hi> of the Petition— He did not see the
                            Petition which prays for the expulsion of Graves and Wise by name.— The
                            Reports from Committees were then called for— The Senate, insisted
                            yesterday, upon their amendment to the neutrality Bill to which the
                            house had disagreed, and asked a conference— <persRef
                                ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> moved that the House should
                            insist on their disagreement, and agree to the conference, which was
                            done; and a committee of Conference appointed— The civil and diplomatic
                            appropriation Bill was resumed in Committee of the Whole on the Union
                                <persRef ref="casey-zadok">Zadock Casey</persRef> in the chair. some
                            question arose, upon which it was found there were only 72 members in
                            the House— They were gone to hear speeches on the Treasury Bill in the
                            Senate— The Committee rose, reported the fact of no Quorum— There was a
                            call of the House which brought in about 140 members, and was then
                            superseded, and the Chairman of the Committee again took the chair— Much
                            debate arose upon an amendment proposed by the Committee of Ways and
                            Means to keep up the pay of the Custom-house Officers at the rate of
                            1832. <persRef ref="briggs-george">Briggs</persRef> at last made it a
                            question of order— The chairman decided that it was not in order— The
                            Committee rose, and he reported his decision on the point of order—
                            There was no appeal from the decision, and the Speaker said there was no
                            question before the house; but if his decision was desired he should say
                            the amendment was not in order— Adjourned after 4.— A <persRef

                            no time for discussion, before the adjournment to attend the House—
                                <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> from the Committee
                            of Conference, reported that they had agreed with the Committee of the
                            Senate; but the report was made to and from the Senate— <persRef

                            concerning the Public Lands was the unfinished business of the morning
                            hour— But his colleague Howard informed the House, that he was
                            indisposed and wished the House to proceed to the orders of the day; to
                            take up his Resolution to-morrow— As the order of the day <persRef
                                ref="fairfield-john">Fairfield</persRef> contested the floor with
                                <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef> who claimed
                            it for the civil and diplomatic appropriation Bill— The <persRef
                                ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> gave the floor to Fairfield, who
                            said he had not expected to obtain it, and was evidently disappointed at
                            getting it— He made however a dull speech of about two hours professedly
                            in support of <persRef ref="evans-george2">Evans’s</persRef> Bill but
                            from beginning to end in fact against Evans’s speech and against my
                            administration.— The instant he finished Cambreleng started up and moved
                            the previous question.— Evans intreated him for fifteen minutes to reply
                            to Fairfield; and <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
                                Lincoln</persRef> also imploringly asked for liberty to make a
                            Speech— Cambreleng was inexorable, till the Speaker told him that after
                            much consideration and reflection upon it all this morning he had made
                            up his mind that in this case, the main question would be the
                            engrossment of the Bill for a third reading— Cambreleng insisted that it
                            would be the reference of the Bill to the Committee of Foreign
                            Relations. But finding he could not maintain that position against the
                            Speaker he moved to postpone the further consideration of the Bill till
                            the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April— Upon a count by tellers
                            he lost this motion 53 to 55, but there was no quorum— It was near four,
                            and the House adjourned— I rode to and from the capitol—</p>

                            had moved yesterday an amendment to the 63<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
                            rule of the House, to allow the addition of contingencies to
                            Appropriation Bills, though not authorised by previous Law. He asked the
                            suspension of the rules, to consider his proposed amendment this
                            morning, but only 51 votes favoured his motion, and it was lost—
                                <persRef ref="chambers-john">Chambers</persRef> asked a suspension
                            of the rules, to move that the future daily Meetings of the House should
                            be at 11. O’Clock A.M.—instead of 10 which he had before proposed— He
                            called for the yeas and nays, which were granted 59 to 95 Next week this
                            motion will succeed— The report of the Committee of Conference between
                            the two Houses on the neutrality Bill was taken up, debated and
                            adopted.— <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> boasted that
                            the Conferees on the part of the Senate had given up the point of
                            difference between the two houses for a mere formality of concession by
                            the conferees of the House— The fact was directly the reverse.— The
                            Senate Bill had been cunningly devised to arrest all the movements on
                            the Northern frontier, and to leave those on the Southern,
                            unrestrained—quailing to Great-Britain, and fraudulently licensing the
                            continuance of hostile movements against Mexico— The House was not
                            prepared for the <pb n="824" type="ms"/>transparent duplicity of this
                            Bill, and after long and thorough deliberation rejected it, by yeas and
                            nays— The Committee of Foreign Affairs prepared a fair and honest bill
                            which was carried with little opposition, and by a large majority— The
                            Senate adopted it, with a proviso, excepting the contraband trade <hi
                                rend="italic">by</hi>
                            <hi rend="italic">Sea</hi>, that is with Mexico and Texas—there being no
                            trade by Sea, with Canada— The House disagreed to this proviso and that
                            was the subject of the Conference— The <persRef ref="polk-james"
                                >Speaker</persRef> appointed 3 conferees all secretly favouring the
                            fraud of the Senatorial proviso, to which they agreed with the addition
                            of nor any other trade, not prohibited by Treaty or by the Laws of
                            Nations— The proviso thus taken together may either nullify the whole
                            Bill, or operate practically only to interdict the breach of the
                            Northern frontier, and the Bill itself is a memorable example of
                            swindling Legislation— The report of the Committee of Conference was
                            carried by the Previous Question and by Yeas and Nays 105 to 51— I met

                                >Robert Fulton</persRef> was taken up, and sluggishly debated
                            without a quorum in the house till near 4. O’Clock when they adjourned—
                            In the Evening I attended the second Lecture of <persRef

                                Nourse</persRef> called on me this morning to explain to me an item
                            of appropriation, proposed by <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
                                >Cambreleng</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means,
                            to which I and others had objected.— It was for a republication of an
                            abstract in four Volumes of the Receipts and Expenditures of the United
                            States from 1789 to 1828. They were annually published in folio
                            pamphlets, till then— Since which they have been somewhat abridged and
                            published in 8<hi rend="superscript">vo.</hi>— M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Nourse said there was but one copy of the 38 pamphlets till
                            1828 at the Treasury Department, and that was believed to be the <pb
                                n="825" type="ms"/>only complete collection of them extant— He
                            thought the republication of the abstract would be of great public
                            utility; and wished to satisfy me that it was not as I had apprehended a
                            mere job— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                                Masi</persRef> came for a charitable subscription for the orphan

                                Force</persRef> the Mayor of the City, brought a memorial to
                            Congress, praying for a bounty on the raising of Mulberry trees, which I
                            promised to present to the House, on the next Petition day, and to move
                            to have referred to the Committee on Manufactures.— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Force spoke to me also, of a small volume,
                            translated from the French, and into French from the Chinese—being a
                            Chinese Treatise on silk making; which he has published; and of which he
                            sent me a copy—and of the first Volume of the documentary History of the
                            American Revolution compiled by him and just published.— I have not had
                            time to examine either of them— In the House the only business discussed
                            was in Committee of the whole, <persRef ref="mckay-james"
                                >M’Kay</persRef> in the Chair, on a Bill for restoring the
                            jurisdiction of certain cases to the U.S. District Court for the Western
                            District of Virginia—a squabble between six or seven members from that
                            State— When they came to take the question, there were scarcely 60
                            members in the House— The Committee rose and reported the fact— A call
                            of the house was ordered and proceeded just far enough to make a quorum,
                            when a motion to adjourn was carried, before two O’Clock.— I went into
                            the Senate chamber where I found <persRef ref="calhoun-john">John C.
                                Calhoun</persRef>, discoursing to his own honour and glory, and
                            vituperating <persRef key="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef>; upon which
                            delicious topics he had already been two hours occupied and used up
                            another hour after I went in— It was the settlement of accounts which
                            Calhoun had threatened when Clay attacked him, a fortnight or three
                            weeks ago— Clay replied instanter, saying that though much indisposed,
                            he would not take three weeks to concoct a retort upon the Senator from
                            South-Carolina— He was from a half to three quarters of an hour, and had
                            manifestly the advantage in the debate— Calhoun had affected to consider
                            himself as on the defensive in this contest— But between the special and
                            the present Sessions of Congress he had written a Letter at Fort-Hill,
                            his residence, to vindicate himself for his change of party, in which he
                            declared that he <pb n="826" type="ms"/>had no reason to confide in the
                            firmness or Patriotism of the whigs, and that if he continued to act
                            with them, the fruits of victory would all go to them and not to him and
                            his friends— Clay took his text from that Letter, and drove him from his
                            defensive ground irrecoverably— There was rejoinder, surrejoinder,
                            rebutter and surrebutter— The truth and the victory were with Clay; who
                            closed with a taunting hope that the settlement of accounts was as
                            satisfactory to the Senator from South-Carolina, as it was to him— Clay
                            spoke of the South-Carolina Nullification with such insulting contempt,
                            that it brought out <persRef ref="preston-william2">Preston</persRef>,
                            who complained of it bitterly— Preston’s countenance was a portraiture
                            of agonizing anguish— These personal oratorical encounters between Clay
                            and Calhoun are Liliputian Mimicry of the Orations against <persRef
                                ref="ctesiphon">Ctesiphon</persRef> and for the Crown—or the debate
                            of the second Philippic— It was past 5. when the Senate adjourned—and 6.

                            necessarily be followed by practice— He did not very conclusively shew,
                            to what practical result the doctrine of the Trinity is essential; nor
                            was his doctrine very logically deducible from his text, which very
                            emphatically distinguishes between <hi rend="italic">God</hi>, and the
                            Lord Jesus Christ, on one hand, and the Holy Ghost on the other— There
                            are to be sure three persons distinguishable in the text, and one of
                            them is God—but there is not the shadow of an intimation, that either
                            the Lord Jesus Christ, or the Holy Ghost is identical with God— The
                            irresistible implication is the reverse— The blessing invoked by the
                            Apostle upon his Corinthian disciples is three-fold— The grace or favour
                            of the Lord Jesus Christ—the Love of God, and the communion of the Holy
                            Ghost— Now the favour of Jesus Christ as Mediator between God and Man is
                            one thing—the Love of God is another—the communion of the Holy Spirit is
                            a third—but if Jesus Christ is God, what is the difference between his
                            grace, and his love—and if the Holy Ghost be God, what is the difference
                            between his communion and his love— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Higbee drove rough shod through all this, but his whole Sermon was
                            didactic and not argumentative—breathing the Spirit of the Athanasian
                            creed, and dealing damnation round every stubborn unbeliever. The church
                            was unusually chiefly with women, filled, for an afternoon service, and
                                M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Higbee’s positive and domineering
                            tone, was apparently very acceptable to the auditory— Such is generally
                            the Trinitarian temper, but it is not the temper of the meek and lowly
                            Jesus— I have tried very hard, and very sincerely to believe in the
                            doctrine of the Trinity, because there are passages in the New Testament
                            which I cannot deny give countenance to it—but when a dogmatist gives me
                            a text which to my naked reason furnishes an argument against it which I
                            find it difficult to answer, and then threatens me with eternal
                            damnation for not believing <hi rend="italic">him</hi>—incredulus odi—my
                            spirit revolts against the yoke, and loses much of its reverence for him
                            who would impose it.</p>

                            an answer as short and irresponsible as possible— The difficulty all
                            along has been Lincoln’s terror of responsibility; and he still declines

                            motion— After taking twice the question without the yeas and nays, and
                            no quorum, they were again called, and gave a vote of 90 to 54. not two
                            thirds, and Fairfield could not present his Petitions—among the negative
                            votes were no small proportion of his own party— The business of the day

                            written me a note to give me notice of this, but, had afterwards
                            postponed his departure till this afternoon, and therefore had not sent
                            his note to me— He unpacked his trunks and took a sitting of more than
                            three hours, which entirely exhausted my patience— Yet he did not
                            finish, but bespoke other sitting, after his return from Philadelphia,
                            which he expects will be in the course of a week or ten days— On my way

                            just obtained them 71 to 66.—105 members absent— The Call for
                            Resolutions was succeeded by a call for Petitions, of which I presented
                            fifteen, and the Speaker went through all the States with both Calls;

                            reports, a multitude of private Bills were reported— <persRef

                                >Cambreleng</persRef> offered an amendment increasing from 30 to
                            40000 dollars the item for the relief and protection of American Seamen—
                            I enquired the reason for this increase— Cambreleng had nothing but a

                            made a debate upon it, which I encouraged, to ascertain the cause of the
                            increased appropriation, which proves to be the loss on exchange in
                            making remittances, and alteration in the mode of making remittances,
                            which instead of being made to the Bankers in London, with power to the
                            Consuls to draw upon them under the supervision of the Minister, are now
                            (since 1835) all made by Bills of the Consuls drawn directly upon the
                            Department of State and therefore subject to enormous losses of

                            oppose it, my object being only to ascertain its cause— Shepperd and
                            M’Kay would have cut it down— A question was taken and the vote on the
                            amendment was 44 to 19. no Quorum— The Committee rose and reported the
                            fact to the House— <persRef ref="reed-john">Reed</persRef> moved to
                            adjourn and called for the yeas and nays to make a quorum 121 to 9.—

                            such motions are waste of time, and inherently unjust, but they make
                            warm debate as did this— Casey pronounced Bell’s amendment not in order,
                            from which Bell appealed— The decision of the Chairman was sustained 66
                            to 57— <persRef ref="halstead-william">Halstead</persRef> moved to <pb

                            bill— So the Committee rose, and the House adjourned at 4.— In the

                            judgment, and egregious vanity— He had prepared a speech of two hours,
                            to be published in the Newspapers, upon a question of 4000 dollars, for
                            a jet d’eau, and on this basis he took a comparative view of all the
                            expenditures of the late administration, compared with mine— Assuming
                            the false and base representations of the retrenchment Committees, as if
                            they were all true and well founded, he presented comparative statements

                            so denounced and reproached— This comparison is addressed to the narrow

                            violent attack upon him yesterday, and <persRef ref="boon-ratliff"

                            and something of a compunctious visiting for his severity yesterday.
                            Halstead had alluded yesterday to <persRef ref="johnson-richard">R. M.

                            all measure; and they Savage like, took their revenge.— Mercer with much
                            address moved an amendment to Halstead’s proposed amendment so as to
                            strike out the 4000 dollars for the jet d’eau, but to leave it under a
                            more general appropriation for improving <pb n="841" type="ms"/>the
                            grounds according to the plan adopted by the last Congress.— This was
                            rejecting Halstead’s amendment by seeming to adopt it.— <persRef

                            the explanation was not satisfactory, and that he could not retract the

                            sustained— Bell then moved to reduce 25 per Cent the appropriations for

                            House—rejected— The Committee rose and reported the Bill with
                            amendments, and at 4 O’Clock the Speaker declared the House adjourned— I
                            went over to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carr’s house, and heard the

                            voted only for the recommitment; without the instructions.— <persRef

                        <p>I attended again in the chamber of the Committee of Elections a meeting

                            Consideration postponed till next Tuesday.— <persRef

                            not yesterday, when the Motion to amend was made, but not debated— The

                            the General Post-Office, was drawn up, to evade the specification of any
                            items of appropriation, and to leave the whole sum appropriated for the
                            service of the general <pb n="844" type="ms"/>Post-Office, entirely at

                            Bill— It was disguised under a provision, requiring of him specific
                            estimates—and now in his report he says his object has been to <hi

                            carried 88 to 84— The independent Treasury Bill was read twice, and
