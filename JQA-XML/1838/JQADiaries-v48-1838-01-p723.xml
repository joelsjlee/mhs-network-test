						<p>H.R.U.S— It was resolved yesterday to take up the Mississippi election

							and with their consent had the report recommitted to furnish the

								>Bronson’s</persRef> Resolution declaring that <persRef

								>Claiborne</persRef> elected members of the 25<hi rend="superscript"

							Prentiss and Word that the House were ready to hear them in support of
							their claim to seats; and Prentiss addressed the House in a Speech of
							two hours, full of Spirit, and of argument; seldom surpassed as a
							specimen of eloquence in that house. He reviewed the former decision of
							the House, and proved that it was not irreversible as res judicata— He
							commented with keen severity upon the report of the Committee of
							elections, upon the suppression by Gholson and Claiborne of their
							Credentials at the special Session, upon their <pb n="729" type="ms"
							/>positive averments that the People of Mississippi had <hi

							there was a Committee appointed to inform me of my election— I said I
							had no other objection to accepting that Office than the sense of my own
							unworthiness to fill it: but that it would be impossible for me to
							deliver the Address for want of time to prepare it.— This morning
								<persRef ref="ratcliff-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>Prentiss</persRef> finished his argument in support of his right to
							represent the People of the State of Mississippi— <persRef

							for two hours without approaching to a conclusion, in support of the

							gag; and the labour that he has taken to justify this absurd violation
							of the right of Election by which the House have manufactured two <pb

							of Mississippi, I believe was dictated far more by the qualms of his own
							conscience than from an expectation that it was needed or would have any

							and the day was consumed in acrimonious and inflammatory debate on the
							Indian Appropriation Bill— There was a Letter from the <persRef
								ref="poinsett-joel">Secretary of War</persRef>, urging for an
							instant appropriation for the Florida Campaign, which <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise</persRef> opposed on the ground that he would
							consent to no further appropriation till the House should institute an
							enquiry into the causes and conduct of the War in Florida— <persRef
								ref="downing-charles">Downing</persRef> the Delegate from the
							Territory then came out with a violent attack upon Wise, upon all the
							opposition to the administration, whom he charged with being the cause
							of the expense and protraction of the War—upon the Cherokee Delegation,
							sent by the Secretary of War to mediate with the Seminole Indians, and
							upon the abolitionists who petition for the abolition of Slavery in the
							Territories— This engaged an altercation between Downing and Wise which
							was followed by speeches from <persRef ref="cilley-jonathan"
								>Cilley</persRef> of Maine, <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy
								Thompson</persRef>, <persRef ref="haynes-charles">Haynes</persRef>
							of Georgia, <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef> of Tennessee, and
								<persRef ref="everett-horace">Everett</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="robertson-john2">Robertson</persRef>, all embroiling the whole
							subject more and more— Wise found himself charged with being an
							abolitionist, and cowered under the charge more than I have ever seen
							him before— Thompson imputed his siding with the Indians to <hi
								rend="italic">morbid</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">sensibility</hi>— Bell deserted him, and said he
							should have reserved his opposition for the time when the remainder of
							the appropriation should be moved for.— He finally moved to reduce the
							appropriation from one Million to 500000 dollars— There were calls to
							rise and report the Bill, but at 1/2 past four <persRef
								ref="biddle-richard">Biddle</persRef> took the floor—a motion was
							made for the Committee to rise, and carried 81 to 73—and the House

							till the end of the month; but could not obtain it. He left us therefore
							this afternoon to go in the Railway cars to Baltimore; whence he is to
							proceed to Norfolk, there to join the sloop of war John Adams; bound on
							a cruise to the East-Indies— H.R.U.S— The House went immediately into
							Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, upon the two
							Appropriation Bills— <persRef ref="thompson-waddy">Waddy
								Thompson</persRef> made an explanation, taking back a part of his
							charges against the North, of hating the white people of the South— He
							now qualified the assertion by confining it to the abolitionists, and
							then to the violent abolitionists—but his real sentiment was what he
							said yesterday— <persRef ref="biddle-richard">Biddle</persRef> had the
							floor and was beginning to notice the discussion of yesterday upon
							abolition, in a tone which instantly raised a call to order— The
							Chairman, <persRef ref="connor-henry">Connor</persRef> said that every
							allusion made yesterday to the subject of abolition was out of order;
							and that whenever it had been alluded to, he had intended to call the
								<persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> to order; but that just
							as he was about to remind them <unclear>of</unclear> the Rules of the House each of the
							Speakers had passed to another subject— Waddy Thompson said that as he,
							after the subject had been introduced by the member from Maine <persRef
								ref="cilley-jonathan">Cilley</persRef> had been the person who made
							the remarks which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddle <pb n="738"

							to order, and insisted that the rules of the House should be observed—
							Biddle submitted; and passed to other parts of <persRef
								ref="downing-charles">Downing’s</persRef> Speech— He exposed with
							bold indignation, the private Letter from <persRef ref="jesup-thomas"
								>Jesup</persRef>, to <persRef ref="blair-francis">Blair</persRef>,
							the Editor of the Globe, upon which <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President Jackson</persRef> recalled <persRef ref="scott-winfield"
								>General Scott</persRef> from the command in Florida, and appointed
							Jesup to take his place— The base acquiescence of the <persRef
								ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of War Cass</persRef>, to this injustice
							of Jackson— The censure by the court-martial which tried Scott upon this
							Letter.— The adulation of Jackson, by the Court in their notice of this
							transaction— The overbearing spirit of Jackson in sending back that part
							of their report to be expunged, and their tame submission to his order
							in expunging it. He concluded it with some forcible remarks upon the
							pernicious effects of favouritism and intrigue upon the moral character
							of the army; and upon young Officers— With the exception of rather
							overcharged panegyric upon Scott which gave the speech a partizan
							colouring it was admirable— He was followed by <persRef
								ref="underwood-joseph">Underwood</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="glascock-thomas">Glascock</persRef>, <persRef ref="bynum-jesse"
								>Bynum</persRef>, and <persRef ref="pope-john">Pope</persRef>, who
							brought the Committee back to the only question properly before them—the
							necessity of the appropriation; which was self-evident— <persRef
								ref="wise-henry">Wise’s</persRef> motion to reduce it without a
							count was rejected— Wise himself was absent—the other Bill, of
							appropriation for the Northern frontier was then taken up, and both
							Bills were reported to the House— Bynum had insisted in calling the yeas
							and nays on the Florida-Bill—they were 164 to 2. but there were about 40
							members who did not vote— Adjourned about 4— On returning home, I found
							the Carriage at the door to take my nephew and namesake to the Cars—
							There was but time to bid him Godspeed— There was a Northern light in
							the Evening— I spent it chiefly in filing and assorting Letters—</p>

							in imminent danger of being led by them into presumption, and puffed up
							with vanity— The abolition Newspapers—the Liberator, Emancipator,
							Philanthropist, National Enquirer and New-York Evangelist, all of which
							are regularly sent to me, contribute to generate and nourish this
							delusion, which the treacherous, furious, filthy and threatening Letters
							from the South on the same subject cannot sufficiently counteract— My
							duty to defend the free principles and Institutions is clear, but the
							measures by which they are to be defended are involved in thick
							darkness.— The path of right is narrow, and I have need of a perpetual

							the memorial was laid on the table by 123 to 84— The Speaker then
							referred to certain Resolutions of the Legislature of Maine upon the

							unfitting me for the labours of the day. By a new arrangement of the <pb
								n="745" type="ms"/>mails that from the North comes in at Night
							instead of the morning, and last Night at ten O’Clock there came a
							budget of Newspapers and about twenty Anti-Slavery petitions in addition
							to the twenty that I had received in the morning— This morning <persRef
								ref="nourse-michael">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Michael
								Nourse</persRef> came to make enquiries, as to the probability that
							Congress would grant lots of the public grounds in this City for the
							culture of silk and the worm— I gave him little encouragement, but said
							I would press the subject upon the consideration of the Committee of
							manufactures at their meeting next Thursday; and I advised him to
							consult the <persRef ref="deberry-edmund">chairman</persRef> of the
							Committee of Agriculture to which his subject has also been referred by
							the House.— <persRef ref="mccaleb-theodore">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Caleb</persRef> a young lawyer from New Orleans, came to enquire
							if there were any documents to which he could recur to shew upon what
							grounds this Government had maintained that West-Florida was included in
							the cession of Louisiana; and par<unclear>ti</unclear>cularly whether it had been
							discussed at the negotiation of the Florida Treaty in 1819. I told him
							it had not— That the pretension had first been started by <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="livingston-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Livingston</persRef>, after the conclusion of their Florida <unclear>&amp;
							France</unclear> Treaty but Spain had indignantly remonstrated against it— France
							had pronounced decidedly against it; and it had been given <unclear>up</unclear> by
								<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef>— Afterwards when <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Bonaparte</persRef> conquered <unclear>Sp</unclear>ain there
							were commotions and insurrections in Florida; <unclear>an</unclear>d political confusions
							till the negotiation of the Treaty by which both the Florida’s were
							ceded, and as that was to give <unclear>us</unclear> possession of the whole nothing was
							said between <persRef ref="onis-luis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Onis</persRef> and me of preceding disputes about the parts— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Caleb <unclear>sa</unclear>id he wanted the information,
							for the management of <unclear>so</unclear>me land-claims under grants from the Spanish
							Government, now pending before the Supreme Court of the <unclear>Un</unclear>ited States—
							H.R.U.S— The <persRef ref="polk-james">Speaker</persRef> consumed the
							whole <unclear>mo</unclear>rning hour within ten minutes in calling for reports from <pb
								n="746" type="ms"/>Committees— <persRef ref="mckay-james"
								>M’Kay</persRef> chairman of the military Committee reported a Bill
							to increase the army. The Speaker then announced my call on the <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">President</persRef> for the copy and
							translation of <persRef ref="gorostiza-manuel">Gorostiza’s</persRef>
							pamphlet, with the name of the foreign functionary, who communicated a
							copy of it to the <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Secretary of
								State</persRef>— The pending question was upon <persRef
								ref="howard-benjamin">Howard’s</persRef> motion to strike out the
							call for the name— Howard said that when the subject was last before the
							house, <persRef ref="cushing-caleb">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cushing</persRef> had the floor intending to address the House—he
							moved therefore that the subject should be postponed till to-morrow— To
							this I objected, and said I had understood M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cushing had no particular desire to say any thing further on
							this question and I was very anxious to have a decision of the House on
							the Call; it being necessary for the house to know what the pamphlet was
							before the could judge of the propriety of the heavy charges against it
							in the Report of the Secretary of Sta<unclear>te.</unclear> I believed that the Secretary
							had totally misapprehended the character of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gorostiza’s offence which at the worst appeared to be
							nothing more than an indiscretion— He had represented it as an
							unexampled outrage, and held it up as the preeminent provocation
							authorising the breaking up of all friendly negotiation with Mexico—
							That it was from being unexampled, I referred to the case of the French
							Revolutionary Minister <persRef ref="genet-edmund">Genet</persRef> who
							appealed from the administration of <persRef ref="washington-george"
								>Preside<unclear>nt</unclear> Washington</persRef> to the People— Here the Speaker
							interrupted me, and announced the order of the day the Mississippi
							Election. <persRef ref="legare-hugh">Legare</persRef> of South Carolina
							now made his justificatory Speec<unclear>h.</unclear> He had flashed and foamed upon it
							at the special Session by an argument in gaudy colours, but totally
							destitute judgment— The case on Constitutional and legal grounds is
							clear as day— Legare darkens counsel with words— The whole of his Speech
							today was a labour uphill of an argument which was continually recoiling
							upon him— As soon as Legaré finished <persRef ref="cushman-samuel"
								>Cushman</persRef> started up to move the previous question; <pb
								n="747" type="ms"/>But <persRef ref="evans-george2">Evans</persRef>
							of Maine was also on the floor and the Speaker, who does not see Cushman
							as quickly as he did in the last Congress, gave the floor to Evans, who
							answered <persRef ref="foster-henry">Foster</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="bronson-isaac">Bronson</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="pennybacker-isaac">Pennybacker</persRef> and Legare— To answer
							one of them was to answer all— Evans’s talents, fine talents have gone
							into eclipse, with his character.— When he closed Cushman made his
							motion for the previous question— <persRef ref="prentiss-seargent"
								>Prentiss</persRef> however claimed his privilege of reply to the
							speeches made against his election and Cushman withdrew his motion—
								<persRef ref="mason-john5">Mason</persRef> of Virginia then asked to
							address the house, and announced that he had changed his opinion since
							the special Session— He then voted for the Resolution declaring <persRef
								ref="claiborne-john">Claiborne</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gholson-samuel">Gholson</persRef> elected for the 25<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> Congress— He now has State rights
							scruples of Conscience against nullifying a State Law by a Resolution of
							the House and therefore will vote for rescinding the Resolution in
							favour of Claiborne and Gholson, and then will vote that Prentiss and
								<persRef ref="word-thomas">Word</persRef>, are also not duly
							elected— Mason’s intellect has <unclear>on</unclear>ly half administered to his
							conscience— He votes to rescind his own former vote, because it clashed
							with the Law, of the State of Mississippi, and he now sets aside the
							same Law of the State of Mississippi, to deprive her two members of
							their seats, and the People of Mississippi of their representation on
							this floor for at least four months— Here was a new bone pick for
							deliberation, and M’Kay of North-Carolina, a per<unclear>pe</unclear>tual halter between
							two opinions sustained Mason— The House adjourned shortly before 5.
