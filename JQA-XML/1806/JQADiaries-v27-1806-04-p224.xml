						<p><date>1. </date>In Senate— The invalid Bill pass’d as amended by the
							Committee of the Senate, with some little debate— I was unable to give
							it proper attention, being employed in preparing to meet the Bill in
							favour of <persRef ref="caramelli-hamet">Hamet Caramalli</persRef>— This
							was taken up soon after 12 O’Clock. <persRef ref="bradley-stephen">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bradley</persRef> the Chairman of the
							Committee which reported the Bill, made a speech of about an hour and a

									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Baldwin</persRef>— I replied in a
							speech of about the same length, and endeavoured to prove by recurrence
							to the documents that the report was erroneous in all its parts— I was
							interrupted at least twenty times in the course of my observations by
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Bradley and <persRef
								ref="wright-robert">Wright</persRef>; several attempts were made to
							stop me as out of order; and to suppress the reading of documents, to

								>President</persRef> himself very much inclined— I persisted however
							with success, and derived rather an advantage to the <hi rend="italic"
								>effect</hi> of my argument, from their frequent interruptions— But
							it disconcerted the <hi rend="italic">method</hi> which I had intended
							to pursue, and made my remarks more desultory and confused than they
							would else have been. In the <hi rend="italic">manner</hi>, I was as I
							always am, <hi rend="italic">miserably defective</hi>— But the substance
							was not without weight— I finished at about half past three, when the

						<p><date>2. </date>In Senate— After the usual formal business of first and

								<persRef ref="hammond-samuel">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Hammond</persRef>, was negatived— There had been heretofore much

							taken up, and <persRef ref="wright-robert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Wright</persRef> in a speech of more than two hours,
							replied to my yesterday’s objections— He abandoned however almost the
							whole ground taken by the Committee, and placed the claim upon a
							foundation altogether different. <persRef ref="bradley-stephen">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bradley</persRef> began to propose
							Amendments to his own Bill— <persRef ref="sumter-thomas3">General
								Sumpter</persRef> opposed them, on the ground that the Bill was
							connected with the Report, which he <hi rend="italic">disapproved</hi>
							in <hi rend="italic">all its</hi> parts— Senate adjourned without a
							decision— <persRef ref="baldwin-abraham">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Baldwin</persRef> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Sumter came
							to me after the adjournment and consulted with me how we could dismiss
							this bill so as to shew our dissent from the report, and yet do
							something for the Tripolitan Ex-Bashaw, who as all agree has some claim
							upon our generosity— By agreement with them I engaged to call on
								<persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Madison</persRef>, who from his knowledge of all the Circumstances
							might suggest something which we may adopt— I called on him accordingly
							this Evening, and he appeared to be well pleased that something
							temporary like what General Sumter has suggested should be agreed to— He
							express’d himself with his usual caution but with disapprobation of the
							Report.— On returning home I found <persRef ref="decabre-jean">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> De Cabre</persRef> below.— <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard</persRef>
							this morning said to me that this affair of Hamet Bashaw had already

						<p><date>3. </date>In Senate, Among the business transacted before 12
							O’Clock, <persRef ref="bradley-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Bradley</persRef> moved for the printing of certain other papers on
							the subject of the Bill, in favour of <persRef ref="caramelli-hamet"
								>Hamet Caramalli</persRef>— <persRef ref="sumter-thomas3">General
								Sumter</persRef> moved to recommit the Bill— This was declared not
							in order, the Bill not being then before Senate— It was then determined
							that Bradley’s motion to print should lay, untill the Bill should be
							under consideration— A Bill for regulating the Salaries of the Officers
							of the two Houses finally pass’d, the Senate receding from an Amendment
							they had proposed for adding to the Salary of one of their Clerks. There
							had been a disagreement between the two Houses and a Committee of
							Conference, which had reported that the Senate should recede from their
							amendment <hi rend="italic">so far</hi>, as to adopt a new modification
							of it, allowing one of the Clerk’s of the House of Representatives a
							like addition of Salary. the Senate had accepted the report of the
							Committee of Conference— The House disagreed to the proposed
							modification, and <hi rend="italic">adhered</hi> to their disagreement
							to the Amendment of the Senate— At <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Stage
							Bradley moved that the Senate should <hi rend="italic">insist</hi> upon
							their <hi rend="italic">modification</hi>, and ask a second conference—
							It was a trick, to prevent the passage of the Bill; for after the House
							had <hi rend="italic">adhered</hi>, they would not have agreed to any
							new conference, and the Bill must have been lost— I therefore objected
							to Bradley’s motion as not in order, and it was so decided by the Chair.
								<persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Bayard</persRef> moved to recede from the Amendment, to which the
							House had disagreed, by which the bill would be pass’d— <persRef
								ref="tracy-uriah">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy</persRef>
							then, without precisely declaring against Bayard’s motion, started an
							Objection that by the inaccuracy of the wording one Section of the Bill,
							if the Senate should ever grant a sum from the contingent fund, to their
							Chaplain, it must be deducted from the Salary of their Serjeant at Arms
							or Doorkeeper— The Section was carelessly drawn, but their could be no
							danger of the Construction Tracy argued upon— I replied to him, with too
							much warmth and vehemence, of which he complained with Justice, and on
							which he retorted with moderation— At the same time he abandoned his
							objection— Bayard’s motion prevailed, and the Bill pass’d— That in
							favour of Hamet Caramalli was taken up: M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Sumter renewed his motion to recommit the Bill, <hi rend="italic">with
								the Report</hi>, and documents, which was much opposed— A Question
							was made whether a <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> could be
							committed—decided by the President that it could— The recommittment was
							agreed to, by yeas and nays 15 to 14— A Question then arose whether it
							should be to the same Committee or a New One— It was finally referred to
							the same with the addition of two new Members—General Sumter and myself—
								<persRef ref="smith-samuel2">S. Smith</persRef> who was on the
							former Committee offered to excuse himself, being now President pro Tem:
							but M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy complaining that the <hi
								rend="italic">feelings</hi> of the Committee had been injured, urged
							Smith not to excuse himself— So that he agreed still to serve.— Senate
							then adjourned— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard asked leave of
							absence for the remainder of the Session which was granted— He told me
							that a Commission had been sent from New-York to take his deposition
							respecting an agreement stipulated between him and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith of Maryland, in behalf of <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef>, when he was <hi rend="italic">first</hi>
							<pb n="226" type="ms"/>first elected— That such a stipulation was made—
							That Bayard had engaged the votes of three States, Delaware, New-Jersey
							and Maryland, to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Jefferson on three
							Conditions. 1. That the public Debt should not be touched, by any
							measure to impair the public faith 2. That<space/>and 3. That no <hi
								rend="italic">subordinate</hi> Officers should be removed, merely on
							account of their political opinions.— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Jefferson positively pledged himself to these three things, and the
							votes of the three States were given him and decided his election in
							consequence of it— I went for a few minutes into the House of
							Representatives, where they were discussing a Bill relative to
							Post-Offices &amp; Post-Roads— <persRef ref="baldwin-abraham">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Baldwin</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="logan-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Logan</persRef>,
							both requested me to let Smith publish in the National Intelligencer my
							day before yesterday’s speech on the Bill in favour of Hamet
							Caramalli—to which I agreed, if Smith should ask me for it— As it was
							altogether unprepared and unpremeditated, I have to take it down wholly
							from recollection, and accordingly began this Evening.</p>

							intelligibly on the subjects connected with the Report of the Senate’s
							Committee; at which he express’d himself to be much concern’d— His
							object in sending for Hamet he told me had been to have him at Syracuse—
							To ascertain there what his means and resources were; and then upon
							consultation with all the Commanders of the Squadron, to have determined
							what engagements it would <pb n="227" type="ms"/>be proper to take with

							him untill he should get to Derne; and give him full warning that after
							that, Hamet must maintain himself at his own risk and on his own
							strength— But when he got there he was as impotent as before— Utterly
							unable to maintain himself a moment, or to be of the smallest use to us.
							Captain James Barron who was also there confirmed much of this
							Statement— I came home in the Evening much fatigued; but wrote an hour

									>D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Logan’s</persRef> call for the

							the ratification; but <pb n="230" type="ms"/>did not eventually prevail—
							We advised the ratification last Saturday.— On Monday the <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">President</persRef> sent a message to
							Congress stating that the <persRef ref="mellimelli-sidi">Tunisian
								Ambassador</persRef> had made inadmissible demands, with a threat of
							War in case of refusal— That they had been refused, and he was going
							home without withdrawing the threat— And this Statement was made that
							Congress might consider the propriety of renewing the <hi rend="italic"
								>provisions</hi> of such an Act i.e. the Mediterranean fund. On the
							same Monday <persRef ref="randolph-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								John Randolph</persRef> in H.R. offered a Resolution which pass’d
							almost unanimously to <hi rend="italic">repeal</hi> the duty on Salt,
							and continue the 2 1/2 per Cent untill the end of the next Session of
							Congress— A Bill to this Effect was passing through the House of
							Representatives, when Logan moved the call on the Executive, for the <hi
								rend="italic">Cause</hi> of the differences with Tunis, and the
							Correspondence between the Tunisian Ambassador here and the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">Secretary of State</persRef>— The <hi
								rend="italic">motion</hi> was made in public, with open doors, and
							upon Legislative business— Yesterday the papers came, and proved that
							Tunis was as insolent and overbearing in the negotiation as France had
							been— That the Secretary of State had assumed and maintained a tone of
							proper firmness, and terminated the negotiation by a peremptory denial
							of his peremptory demands— Logan was then for printing the papers; but
							some of his more cautious friends obtained a vote to have them referred
							to a select Committee, with a view as was urged to select some of the
							papers which it might be improper to print; that the rest might be
							printed— But this day the Chairman of the Committee (<persRef
								ref="baldwin-abraham">Baldwin</persRef>) to whom these papers had
							been publicly committed, after being publicly read, moved to go into the
							consideration of Executive Business; and when the Galleries were cleared
							presented a Report, to recommend to the President to renew the
							Negotiations with the Tunisian Ambassador, and to comply with all his
							demands—tribute—Naval Stores, and every indignity of humiliation. I
							instantly objected against receiving this Report as on Executive
							business— The Committee having been appointed legislatively, and all the
							proceedings hitherto appearing on the public Journals— It was a
							violation of every Rule and form of proceeding—and dangerous as a
							precedent— The project of acting as on Executive business was then
							abandoned—the doors were opened, and immediately Baldwin moved to shut
							them again for business that required secrecy— This by the Rules must be
							done of course, to discuss the propriety of acting secretly— But as soon
							as the doors were shut I moved to open them again, on the ground that
							the discussion ought to be public— The President’s Message was
							public—and recommended firm and vigorous measures— The Report of the
							Committee which recommended tribute and submission ought not to be
							secret— I could not however obtain a vote to open the doors— For
								<persRef ref="smith-samuel2">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Smith</persRef> our President pro Tem told us that he had seen the
							President this morning, who was astonished when he told him that the
							papers had been publicly read— He had thought the call for them was from
							Senate acting executively, and therefore had not marked them
							confidential. He had indeed requested they might be returned, on the
							ground that they were the originals, and there was not time to make out
							copies— But this has become his common practice with regard to important
							papers—he sends the originals with request of their return— So that no
							copy of them may be within the reach of members who might use them for
							purposes different from his own— We had therefore the discussion in
							secret.— But the recommendation to crouch, and pay and implore pardon of
							Tunis, could not get a majority— That part of the report was struck out
							by a small majority, on yeas and nays taken, and the Resolve merely
							pass’d to <hi rend="italic">return the papers</hi>— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Logan by whose want of management this
							whole project failed, left his seat with an air of more mortification
							and temper than I had ever seen in him before. The whole proceeding of
							public apparent vigour, and secret real pusillanimity was an exact
							counterpart, of the proceedings with respect to Spain—the issue however
							was different. this was the only business that occasioned much
							discussion in Senate this day—the remainder of the time was principally
							past in dispatching the bills which crowd at the close of a Session—
							Adjourned to 10. Monday Morning— Evening at home.</p>

							manner, that the same Grand-Jury which found the Bills against them,
							made a presentment against the Judge himself, for his conduct in taking

							memorialists considering Congress as the only power competent to relieve
							them, submit their Case to the wisdom of Congress, and pray such relief
							as the laws and Constitution of this Country, and the Wisdom and
							goodness of Congress may afford them”— The President then put the
							question whether the Memorials should be received and the answer was
							unanimously in the affirmative— I then read both the memorials, one of
							which was long— And after the reading was finished, I observed that
							these Memorials having been transmitted to me with a request that I
							would present them, I had thought myself bound in duty so to do— But
							that as one of the Memorialists was nearly related to me, I did not
							think proper to propose any measure upon them; but should leave their

							silenced them on that point, by an appeal to my written paper, and to
							the President who repeatedly declared that I had been strictly in order—
							Wright, as usual, raved like a bedlamite; and amidst a torrent of silly
							personalities, for which he was repeatedly called to order by the
							President and several other Members, threatened once and again to move

							obtained, it being without precedent, and inconsistent with the

							should have leave to withdraw their Memorials;—but Wright could not be
							satisfied with that— He insisted upon rejecting the Memorials, after
							repeated declarations from the Chair that it could not be done— <persRef
								ref="mitchill-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Mitchill</persRef>, withdrew, and renewed, and altered, and renewed
							again his motion to suit Wright upon every return of his paroxysms. At
							last Wright produced a motion, for which Baldwin quoted a precedent in
							the other House “to return the Memorials, to the Memorialists on account
							of the highly exceptionable matter contained in them—[”] But D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Mitchill’s motion for simple leave to
							withdraw the Memorials, was before the Senate, and they would not give
							him leave to take it back— In order therefore to get at the question of
								<hi rend="italic">censure</hi>, Wright moved to amend the motion of
							simple leave to withdraw, by striking out the words: <hi
								rend="strikethrough">the words</hi> “the memorialists have leave to
							withdraw their memorials”—to insert “the memorials be returned to the
							Memorialists.”— I then called for a division of the question, which was
							first taken on the striking out—the votes upon this question were 11 and
							11. besides the President pro Tem: who declared <hi rend="italic"
								>against</hi> the striking out; and the question upon simple leave
							to withdraw the Memorials was taken, and pass’d without opposition— Here
							the matter rested for that time; but the same Memorials had been
							presented by <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Quincy</persRef> to the House of Representatives, and
							had raised there a much more violent flame than in the Senate— There it
							resulted in votes of “return of the Memorials,” and of censure upon
							their being presented— Between 3 and 4 O’Clock the Senate adjourned for
							an hour— By <persRef ref="pickering-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Pickering’s</persRef> invitation I went and <pb n="232"
								type="ms"/>dined with him at his lodgings— The Senate met again
							between 4 and 5. and from that time untill about 10 at Night had little
							else to do, but to receive Bills from the House, or the issue of
							disagreements between the two Houses— On the Bills for the payment of
							witnesses upon <persRef ref="chase-samuel">S. Chase’s</persRef>
							Impeachment, and for continuing the 2 1/2 per Cent duty, being the
							Mediterranean fund, the House eventually receded, and yielded to the
							Senate— On the naval Peace Establishment Bill the Senate receded— An
							attempt was made to grant money from the contingent fund to the
							chaplain, and door-keepers boys, notwithstanding the law of this Session
							and the new Rule on the subject— This however failed. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> White and myself were appointed the
							Committee on the part of the Senate to inform the <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">President</persRef> that Congress were ready
							to adjourn— It was almost 10 at Night when we were informed that the
							House had appointed the Committee on their part— We went to meet them.
							They were Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							<persRef ref="randolph-thomas">T. M. Randolph</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="cutts-richard">Cutts</persRef>, and <persRef ref="early-peter"
								>Early</persRef>— We had to wait about half an hour for the
							President to sign a number of Bills— About a quarter after 10. we went
							to the President who was in the Committee Room— <persRef
								ref="white-samuel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> White</persRef>
							the Chairman, informed him that unless he had any further communications
							to make, the two Houses were about to adjourn— He answered that he had
							no further communications to make, and we returned. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> White made the Report to the Senate; and
							the <persRef ref="beckley-john">Clerk of the House</persRef> came with
							the usual message that the House were about to adjourn— While I was out
							on the Committee M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wright had offered a
							Resolution that every thing on the Journals relative to the memorials of
								Sam<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> G. Ogden and William S. Smith
							should be <hi rend="italic">expunged</hi> therefrom— This motion was now
							taken up— I said that at this hour I should not enter into a discussion
							upon the propriety of the motion, but only ask for the yeas and nays.—
							They were taken, and the vote to expunge pass’d—yeas 13. nays 8. only 21
							Members being present— Wright then called for the reading of the
							Journal; and when it came to the vote for expunging, insisted that this
							vote itself must not appear— That it must not be seen that such
							Memorials had ever been presented— Many other of the expungers were
							equally strenuous for this total suppression— And Smith of Maryland the
							President pro Tem: in the most peremptory manner decided that the
							expunging vote should not appear— I then very shortly pointed out the
							danger of such a Precedent; if a majority at any time could deface the
							Records of the body— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Pickering read the
							Article of the Constitution requiring that Journals should be kept, and
							that the yeas and nays when required by one fifth, should be entered on
							the Journals— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy read a Rule of the
							Senate that every <hi rend="italic">Vote</hi> of the Senate should be
							entered on the Journals— Wright still insisted that the expunging vote
							should not appear— The Article of the Constitution he said referred only
							to the Legislative proceedings of the Senate— Smith however the
							President pro Tem: could not hold out with Wright— He first
							staggered—said he was in doubt, and wished the sense of the Senate on
							the subject— And finally came round completely, and declared that it
							could not be helped—the vote must stand— Wright still resisted— Smith
							again declared it must be so—the vote must appear upon the Journal; and
							it would be very proper that it should appear— Upon which Wright
							declared himself perfectly satisfied— A motion then was made to adjourn
							without day— I suggested the propriety of passing the usual order to
							inform the House that we were about to adjourn— But it was too late—
							While we were debating on the expunging vote, the House had adjourned—
							We therefore adjourned also a few minutes before 11.— I rode part of the
							way home; and <persRef ref="baldwin-abraham">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Baldwin</persRef>, was lamenting with some others of
							the members, the <hi rend="italic">irregularity</hi>, of the expunging
							vote— His wish was that the Journals should have been <hi rend="italic"
								>amended</hi>; so as to read in a manner, which would not have
							contained the statement of the contents of the Memorials— It was about
							Midnight when I got home.</p>
