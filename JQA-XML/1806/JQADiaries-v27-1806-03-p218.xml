								<persRef ref="bradley-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

							Bradley is to meet with them this Evening, and see if they can agree
							upon any thing— The Bill for making Jersey a port of Delivery, and
							erecting a light-house on Fletcher’s Neck in Maine pass’d—after some
							discussion— The Bill for punishing the counterfeiting of Coins also
							pass’d. But words were introduced, as I have all along expected, exactly
							equivalent to the fourth Section of the Bill, which was struck out as
								<hi rend="italic">unconstitutional</hi>— <persRef
								ref="baldwin-abraham">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Baldwin</persRef> was the man, who devised this mode of veiling the
							violation of the Constitution, by the selection of words in which the
							breach was disguised— It pass’d by yeas and nays 19 to 9. And the Bill
							itself thus amended 22 to 4. This example proves to me what indeed I
							have often seen before—that Constitutional difficulties never will stand
							in the way of a majority— And that even in so select a Body as the
							Senate of the United States, a mere variation of phrase will contrive a
							loophole to creep from the most barefaced usurpation of power. <persRef

						<p><date>29. </date>The Senate was thinly attended; and did very little
							business, except referring to a select Committee the Appropriation Bill—
							Adjourned between 12. and 1. I went into the lobby of the House of
							Representatives, where I found them engaged on a Question to <hi
								rend="italic">reject</hi> the Georgia-Land Bill at the first
							reading— After a warm Speech of <persRef ref="randolph-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> John Randolph</persRef>, it was
							rejected 62 to 54.— I spent the remainder of the day at home reading and
							writing.</p>
