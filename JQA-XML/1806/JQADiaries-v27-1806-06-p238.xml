							the gentlemen of the philosophical Society met to take the observation
							of the Solar Eclipse— It commenced at 3 minutes 21 seconds past 10 in
							the morning.— At XI.22.38 the total obscurity commenced. At XI.27.9. The
							first ray of the Sun, <pb n="241" type="ms"/>blazed out from behind the
							moon. and at XII.48.1. the Eclipse ended. The total obscuration
							continued more than four minutes and a half— The sky during the whole
							time was unusually clear, and not a speck of cloud was visible on the
							horizon— At the commencement of the eclipse the thermometer in the shade
							stood at 68— It fell gradually, untill the end of the total obscurity,
							when it stood at 57.— There it remained stationary about a quarter of an
							hour—then began to rise, untill at the end of the eclipse it was at 67.
							and a few minutes after at 70— The fading of the Sun’s light, from its
							greatest splendour, untill its total extinction was peculiar, differing
							much from that of the usual declining day, on the approach of Evening—
							Six or eight Stars were visible, during a considerable part of the time.
							The planet Venus particularly appeared as large and as bright in the
							darkness, as it usually does in the Evening— The Colours of natural
							objects appeared to the eye with a tinge different from any thing I had
							ever seen. during the total concealment of the Sun, The Center of the
							Moon’s disk, appeared black as ebony; but the shade appeared gradually
							less black to the circumference, which was of a dusky brown— A feeble
							luminous circle, not equally light in every part surrounded the edge of
							the moon, and beyond that circle, a coruscation fainter and fainter shot
							forth in angular aspects extended to a distance equal to about the
							semidiameter of the moon; the western side of the hemisphere being that
							from which the moon advanced, was much darker than the Eastward on which
							part the sun’s rays were last shut in, and during the whole time the
							borders of the horizon were very luminous throughout their extent— The
							darkness was about equal to that of half an hour after Sun-set at this
							Season of the year— Or much like the darkness of midnight, which I have
							witness’d in June, at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg.— About
							fifteen seconds before the first returning Sun-beam, a line of deep
							crimson, appeared on the moon’s edge, on the limb, where the Sun was
							about to issue— But the most striking appearance was the first returning
							beam; it was about two seconds supportable to the naked eye, and in
							brightness far exceeded any thing I ever beheld— It was remarkable that
							for two or three minutes before the Sun’s disappearance, it could be
							looked at without the shelter of a glass; though it was so immediately
							intolerable on its return.— The effect of the momentary gloom was
							heightened by the contrasted splendor of the day, before and after. The
							Cattle, and poultry discovered the symptoms of Night, and followed their
							usual habits on its approach— The swallows appeared surprized, and flew
							with that wild irregularity, which is described as betokening the
							approach of an Earthquake.— The atmosphere had the chilness of Night but
							there was no fall of dew— Upon the whole the phenomenon was principally
							curious on account of its uncommonness— Having never occurred at this
							place since the settlement of the Country; and being not to happen again
							for several centuries— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bussey
							entertained us with a cold collation, between the first re-appearance of
							the Sun, and the end of the Eclipse— I dined at <persRef
