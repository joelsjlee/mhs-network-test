						<p><date>12. </date>Heard <persRef ref="harris-thaddeus">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Harris</persRef> of Dorchester— His
							morning text was from Proverbs XXIII.26. “My son give me thine heart”—
							The Sermon was very good— His Introduction was an Hypothesis—“If God
							should confer personally with us and <hi rend="italic">intreat</hi> us
							to do what is most beneficial to our own happiness—should not we be
							grateful—all duty—all obedience—all love?— Well! He <hi rend="italic"
								>has</hi> thus conferr’d with us; not personally; but in the
							Scriptures[”]— The <hi rend="italic">division</hi> was into two points—
							1. What is meant by giving the heart to God?—and 2. Inducements to
							comply with the request— Giving the heart, is that obedience which a
							grateful child, would pay to an indulgent parent— The inducements are 1.
							Bounden duty and 2. Highest Interest—this last subdivision led naturally
							to the conclusion which made an animated appeal to the
							feelings—particularly the selfish feelings— The style was perspicuous
							and plain—the delivery far above the common level—without <hi
								rend="italic">cant</hi>—and with due attention to the accent,
							emphasis and pause— But under the disadvantage of an unmelodious voice,
							and with some affectation of manner— There is a consciousness of genius,
							overrated or at least too apparent, and an anxiety to <hi rend="italic"
								>strike</hi>, which is manifest in every look and gesture of Harris—
							He seems in every sentence to call upon his hearer for admiration— To
							say, is not this ingenious—well arranged—well spoken? and sometimes—is
							not this <hi rend="italic">wonderful</hi>?— His afternoon Sermon appears
							to have been written solely for that purpose— His text was Genesis
							XXV.14. “And <persRef ref="mishma">Mishma</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="dumah">Dumah</persRef>, and <persRef ref="massa"
								>Massa</persRef>.”— They were three of the children of <persRef
								ref="ishmael">Ishmael</persRef>, which led him to an historical
							account of that personage, and of his descendants the Arabians—this
							formed the introduction— But the names are significant—<hi rend="italic"
								>Obedience</hi>—<hi rend="italic">Resignation</hi>—and <hi
								rend="italic">Reliance</hi>— The sermon therefore was a dissertation
							upon Christian names. Very short; and purposely shortened in the
							delivery— But its merit was by no means equal to its singularity— I
							spent part of the Evening, at <persRef key="adams-john">my
								fathers</persRef>— And afterwards read the Odyssey Book 14.</p>
