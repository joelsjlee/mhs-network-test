						<p><date>1. </date>Attended the Committee on the <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">President’s</persRef> Message at 10 this
							morning— The <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">Chairman’s</persRef> second
							Resolution was further discussed; and it soon appeared that <persRef
								ref="logan-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Logan</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="baldwin-abraham">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Baldwin</persRef>, were against it— They are for doing nothing— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Baldwin made one of his serpentine
							speeches in favour of temporizing policy— The War in Europe could not
							last long— The <persRef ref="pitt-william2"><hi rend="italic">good man
									at the head of the British Government</hi></persRef> could not
							live much longer— His Death would bring in an entire new set of men;
							with different principles; there was no appearance of any thing
							permanent in the present state of things; it would be sufficient for us
							to pass general Resolutions declaring our rights on this and the other
							objects of complaint that we have; without taking any further measures
							&amp;c— D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Logan was for asking the
							President to send an Envoy Extraordinary to negotiate— Perhaps <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Monroe</persRef>
							had irritated the British Government and aggravated their offences— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Monroe was known not to be friendly to
							England; he wanted to try the effect another Minister there— We had
							heard <persRef ref="merry-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Merry</persRef> tell <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Madison</persRef>, that before we
							went to War, we ought to be very sure that no other measure of a
							conciliatory nature remained— I objected to asking the President to send
							an Envoy Extraordinary, as too much dictating to him the mode of doing
							the business; but I took advantage of the D<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs:</hi> suggestion to propose my second Resolution; which seemed
							to be generally assented to.— In this state of things, three members
							having decisively pronounced against the chairman’s second Resolution; I
							might have thrown it out at once— But though not thinking it the best
							measure, I believe it better than none— <persRef ref="tracy-uriah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy</persRef> stated his objections
							against it strongly— I stated mine— Smith answered them as well as he
							could— <persRef ref="mitchill-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Mitchill</persRef> was decided for the Resolution as it stood—
								<persRef ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Anderson</persRef> proposed a sub-committee of three to attempt a
							modification of it— This was agreed to— Smith as Chairman, named me,
							Anderson and Mitchill as the Sub-committee— The large Committee then
							adjourned untill 10 on Monday Morning— The Sub-committee remained; and
							we agreed upon a modification of Smith’s Resolution, according to
							Anderson’s idea; and also to propose in substance my second Resolution—
							They then charged me to draw up the two to have them ready on Monday
							Morning, half an hour earlier than the meeting of the full Committee— We
							then parted and it was about 2— I went into the Secretary’s Office, and
							examined all the reports on the Navy-Pension fund— I had then some
							further conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy, who
							shewed me a Resolution he had drawn up, to be added as a fourth after my
							three; but he appeared unwilling to offer them to the Committee, and I
							therefore agreed to withhold from the Committee, my third Resolution,
							unless some occasion should in the course of discussion call for it; in
							which case he will also offer his, which is a general Resolution, that
							it is expedient to fortify our harbours, increase our naval force
							&amp;c. which I presume will never be adopted in Senate, if agreed to in
							Committee— I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> shew to the two members of the
							Sub-Committee my third Resolution, at which they were at first a little
							startled, but which before we parted they seemed to think better of,
							than I do myself.— It was past four O’Clock when I got home to dinner.—
							In the Evening I drew up the two Resolutions to be prepared for the
							consideration of the Sub-Committee— This subject is so important at a
							National concern that I state thus minutely my agency in it— I have
							given it much anxious thought, and observe its progress with all my
							attention— Having formed in my own mind an opinion of the course to be
							pursued, I have found none proposed by others which I could consider as
							equally eligible, and therefore I was compelled in Committee to deviate
							from the usual course of leaving every thing to the Chairman, and to
							propose my first Resolution as a substitute for his— A hint from D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Logan, destined for a very different
							purpose, led me to bring forward my second Resolution— The third I still
							reserve— As on this occasion the <hi rend="italic">conciliation</hi> of
							parties as much as possible, is in my view still more important than
							what the precise measures to be adopted may be, I have so far given up
							my <hi rend="italic">own</hi>
							<pb n="208" type="ms"/>own opinion as to accede to Smith’s
							non-importation project, as modified by M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Anderson— At present, if it does little good, it will in all probability
							do less harm— I hoped for support from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Tracy, or for some measure proposed by him, which I could heartily
							support; but this hope I must abandon— Tracy, with all his talents,
							which are very great, and all his virtues which are many, cannot divest
							himself enough of party feelings— He has been so ill-treated by the
							party of this Administration, and is so sore under the injuries he has
							received from them, that he can on no great occasion coalesce with them—
							In regard to my Resolutions he has so hesitated and wavered that if he
							finally gives them his vote it is all I can expect— His own proposition
							I think cannot be adopted; nor do I think it a very useful one <hi
								rend="italic">on this</hi> question— The result of all is, that in
							taking a lead, a man must rely <hi rend="italic">only upon himself</hi>—
							That in obtaining a lead, a man must calculate upon the opposition of
							his best friends, as much as upon that of his most determined
							adversaries— That the sterling weight of measures themselves, must force
							them down against the reluctance both of friends and foes— This is very
							decisively the case, when the character of a leader is to be acquired—
							When once obtained, then the assistance of friends and supporters offers
							itself— This is the third Session I have sat in Congress— I came in as a
							member in a very small minority; and during the two former Sessions,
							almost uniformly avoided to take a lead. Any other course would have
							been dishonest or ridiculous— On the very few and unimportant objects
							which I did undertake, I met at first with universal opposition— The
							last Session, my influence rose a little— At the present it has hitherto
							been apparently rising; though I have continued in the same system to
							avoid all appearance of an attempt to lead, untill this great National
							subject of deliberation arose— Even on this I took none of the usual
							means to be put upon the Committees relating to it— When on them, I came
							forward as late as possible— And I see that the advancement or
							declension of my influence will depend on my conduct throughout this
							affair more than on any other single subject— But the occasion calls for
							every exertion of my faculties to serve the public, and I can never
							cease to regret that those faculties are so feeble to meet such an
							emergency— I have set aside all party spirit, and I have devoted myself
							to honest and unwearied application upon the case. The gratification of
							my own Vanity or Ambition, by a display of influence would be a
							despicable motive, of which I am utterly unconscious— The chance of a
							possibility that I may render real service to my Country, is very small;
							yet small as it is, not to be abandoned in peevishness, or despair.</p>

						<p><date>3. </date>Attended the Sub-Committee this morning at 9. we agreed
							to report the two Resolutions as I had drawn them up to the large
							Committee— <persRef ref="tracy-uriah">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Tracy</persRef> called me out of the Committee-Room, and shewed me a
							new draught of the Resolutions including my three, his own one, and
							additional Resolutions for communicating them to the <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">President</persRef> and House of
							Representatives. They were all considerably varied in the phraseology,
							and every epithet betokening resentment was left out— I could not
							consider these alterations as improvements, but I told him he might move
							such amendments as he thought most adviseable, and I would acquiesce in
							them— On meeting the large Committee, the Sub-Committee reported the two
							new Resolutions— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy recurred back to
							the first Resolution <hi rend="italic">which had already pass’d</hi>,
							and moved a verbal amendment founded upon a punctilio of precision in
							the terms, which had arisen from an interlineation proposed by <persRef
								ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Anderson</persRef> to my first Resolution as it had originally
							stood— <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">Smith</persRef> the Chairman was
							delighted at this, because he found in it his revenge for the
							mortification he had sustained by the preference of my Resolution to his
							own— He laughed, and said he supposed other gentlemen would as readily
							resign their modes of expression as he had his— Anderson immediately
							observed that the inaccuracy, was occasioned by his interpolation; and I
							agreed to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy’s amendment though not
							without some manifestation of temper— Another of Tracy’s Amendments was
							this— I had used the word <hi rend="italic">capture</hi>
							<pb n="209" type="ms"/>in one Resolution, and <hi rend="italic"
								>seizure</hi> in another to express the same thing— He proposed to
							strike out the word capture, where I had used it, to introduce seizure—
							Now both the words are commonly used and understood in the same sense;
							but in rigorous criticism capture appeared to me the proper term— I
							agreed therefore to use that in both cases— I could not however forbear
							to feel this renewed discussion upon a Resolution already adopted, for
							the purpose of introducing such Amendments as these, more as
							hypercritical than friendly; and I felt it the more from the triumph it
							afforded Smith— I had used also the terms <hi rend="italic">wanton</hi>
							violation, and <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> encroachment— Tracy moved
							to strike out both the epithets, to which I agreed, observing at the
							same time that I should myself have preferred to retain them— <persRef
								ref="baldwin-abraham">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Baldwin</persRef> said the term wanton was not only offensive, and
							irritating; but would be denied in fact; as they were contended to be
							acts of absolute necessity— I replied with warmth that the term <hi
								rend="italic">wanton</hi> might with the strictest Justice be
							applied to the solemn mockery of <persRef ref="scott-william">Sir
								William Scott’s</persRef> decisions, contradictory to each other
							upon the same point— One day boasting of his judicial Independence, and
							the next declaring the text of the king’s Instructions to be his only
							guide— However I agreed to abandon the epithets though other members and
							particularly Smith were very desirous to retain them— In the midst of
							this discussion we were summoned to attend the Senate (which was in
							Session) and adjourned— In the course of the morning M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy came to me, and said he hoped this
							affair would not make any misunderstanding between us, and if it was
							disagreeable to me, he would not move another word of alteration; I told
							him by no means— That I had no particular attachment to my own forms of
							expression, and would cheerfully agree to all his proposed Amendments—
							This is true— I hope also that this circumstance will lead me to be
							still more solicitous for accuracy and precision than I ever have been.—
							I may be sure that no error in this respect will escape his penetration.
							In reflecting coolly on the day and its Events, I ought to thank him for
							his severity, and to be more correct another time. I ought also to be
							content that Smith should have the gratification of seeing my
							composition run the gauntlet as well as his own— In Senate— Memorials
							were presented, from Salem, by <persRef ref="mitchill-samuel">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Mitchill</persRef>; and from Boston
							by <persRef ref="pickering-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Pickering</persRef> and myself.— Referred to the Committee on the
							Baltimore and other memorials— D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Mitchill
							presented a memorial from New-York, respecting the <hi rend="italic"
								>Seamen’s fund</hi>. Referr’d to a select Committee of three; on
							which I was placed— The Secret Bill was taken up, and discussed on the
							final question untill 3 O’Clock, when the Senate adjourned without
							taking the question— <persRef ref="worthington-thomas"
								>Worthington</persRef>, <persRef ref="smith-john6">Smith</persRef>
							of Ohio, and <persRef ref="kitchell-aaron">Kitchel</persRef> spoke in
							its favour— <persRef ref="hillhouse-james">Hillhouse</persRef>, Tracy,
							and myself against it— I made a very incoherent speech; without order,
							and without self-collection— It was likewise obviously a very tedious
							one to all my hearers.— The <persRef ref="clinton-george"
								>Vice-President</persRef> by the way does not love long Speeches,
							and desired M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy that when we were
							about to make such we should give him notice; that he might take the
							opportunity to warm himself at the fire.— I rode to and from the
							Capitol— The morning was rainy; but it cleared away by noon— U.S.
							Supreme Court met this day.</p>

									>r:</hi> Logan</persRef>, moved an Amendment which was not

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tracy said he should hold himself at
							liberty to offer in Senate, the Resolution which he had proposed as a
							substitute for my second, in Committee— Smith told him he certainly
							might, but he hoped he would not— I was then requested by the Committee
							to draw up a fair copy of the Report as agreed upon, and present it
							to-morrow morning, to which I consented; and which I accordingly did,
							while the Senate was in Session— I saw <persRef ref="u">M<hi

								<persRef ref="dorr-john2;dorr-joseph2">Mess<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs:</hi> Dorr</persRef>, and answered their two last Letters—
							The day’s debate was chiefly confined to the bill for prohibiting <pb

								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Domingo. <persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard</persRef> moved a postponement
							of the bill, offering for consideration two Resolutions—requesting of
							the President, Treasury Documents to shew the amount of duties, and the
							value of this trade—and also a communication of the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">Secretary of State’s</persRef> Answer to the
							complaints of the French Government and Minister— This postponement was
							at first refused; and it was determined to proceed in the consideration
							of the bill— The Committee to whom it was referred at the second
							reading, had reported an entire new Bill, but their report was not made
							regularly conformable to the Rules of Order— They reported the Bill as
								<hi rend="italic">amended</hi>, without reporting that the whole
							substance of the original bill should be struck out— This gave rise to
							no small debate upon the question of order— It was however finally got
							over, by a member’s moving to strike out all but the enacting sentence
							of the original bill; which was done, and then the Amended Bill reported
							by the Committee was taken up. The first Section was agreed to— The
							second gave rise to a debate, upon which M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Bayard’s motion for postponement was renewed and carried. He then again
							offered his two Resolutions and the Senate adjourned— I pass’d the

								<persRef ref="tracy-uriah">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

							chiefly employed in discussing the two Resolutions offered by <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard</persRef>,
							both of which were negatived, by yeas and nays— He supported them with
							his usual Eloquence— But if Oratory be the Art of <hi rend="italic"
								>persuasion</hi>, he has some material defects in his practice— In
							copiousness both of language, and of thought he is truly admirable— His
							language is also generally elegant without being highly ornamented— But
							he is not always judicious in the choice of his arguments; he often
							dwells too long upon the weak, and not unfrequently maintains the
							obviously untenable— He wants correctness, because he wants application—
							His Genius is never at fault, but his Judgment is often on the wrong
							scent— Another and still more hurtful oratorical failing is the want of
							controul over his temper— The consciousness of his own powers, is not
							without some perceptible debasement of others— Impatient of
							contradiction from men of understanding inferior to his own, he arraigns
							their motives, and too clearly manifests his contempt for their
							characters.— His manner is always commanding, rather than conciliatory—
							This is a remarkable difference between his talent and Tracy’s— He this
							day in the debate on his second Resolution, charged his opposers with so
							much virulence, that several of them complained and retorted— He replied
							by asserting his right to make such reflections— The <persRef
								ref="clinton-george">Vice-President</persRef> said he should in
							future call Gentlemen to order, who indulged themselves in reflections
							upon motives.— After his Resolutions were rejected, Smith of Maryland
							offered a substitute for the second Section of the Committee’s bill;
							which is to be printed and taken up to-morrow— Smith and D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Mitchill, who at first vehemently opposed
							the introduction of the Bill, have become supporters of it, grounded on
							their fears of the resentment of France.— I took no part in this day’s
							debate; but drew up the first sketch of a Bill, to prevent the abuse of
							the privileges of foreign Ambassadors and Ministers, which I intend to
							propose. In the Evening, besides my usual occupations I consulted
								<persRef ref="vattel-emer">Vattel</persRef>, on this subject.</p>

								<persRef ref="bradley-abraham">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Bradley</persRef> moved to postpone the question untill Monday, on

							themselves purposely; not to vote on the question— <persRef

							this principle of carrying through the legislature measures by his
							personal or official influence— There is a certain proportion of the
							members in both houses, who on every occasion of emergency have no other
							enquiry, but what is the President’s wish— These of course always vote
							accordingly— Another part adhere to him in their votes, though strongly
							disapproving the measures for which they vote— A third float in
							uncertainty; now supporting one side of a question and now supporting
							the other; and eventually slinking away from the record of their votes—
							A fourth have the Spirit even to vote against the will of their leader;

						<p><date>8. </date>I attended the Committee on the Georgia-land petitions— I
							was at least two hours at the Capitol before I could get together four
							members of the Committee—<persRef ref="baldwin-abraham"
								>Baldwin</persRef>, <persRef ref="sumter-thomas3">Sumter</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="bradley-stephen">Bradley</persRef> with myself—
								<persRef ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Anderson</persRef> again failed to attend— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Bradley now moved that the chairman should write a note,
							calling upon the petitioners to state <hi rend="italic">in writing</hi>,
							their propositions for a compromise; and their powers with a <hi
								rend="italic">transcript</hi> of the deeds by which the titles were
							conveyed from the original grant to the right of their principals. As
							the accomplishment of this would inevitably have delayed the Committee
							several weeks, and as this was obviously Bradley’s purpose by it, I
							opposed it as much as I could— Bradley finally gave up the transcript,
							and altered it to a <hi rend="italic">deduction</hi> of the rights from
							the original grants to the present claimants— This was finally agreed to
							by the majority, in spite of my opposition— When these papers come they
							will in all probability furnish Bradley, some hook, for further
							suspension, or some pretext for arresting the subject short— It is
							clearly his real intention to prevent the discussion of the Subject in
							Senate, and of course the doing of any thing for the petitioners— His
							pretended purpose is to make a final settlement of the business now;
							that Congress may never hear of it again— Sumter is in favour of the
							petitioners, but not seeing through Bradley’s projects is always falling
							into his Snares— Baldwin is avowedly opposed to the claims, and of
							course favours every thing that can tend to defeat them; and Anderson
							who began by being very zealous for the petitioners has cooled down to
							such a degree, that he has already hinted to me, they must be abandoned,
							and has avoided for several of the last meetings to attend the Committee
							at all— Of course I have only to make myself easy upon the subject, with
							the confident assurance that nothing will be done— Bradley is a man of a
							marked character, and discovers it on all occasions— He is now
							open-mouthed against the two million-bill, (the secret bill) and says
							that he was never let into the real secret of the business, untill two
							days ago. That then he was informed <hi rend="italic">by M</hi><hi
								rend="superscript italic">r:</hi><hi rend="italic"> Anderson</hi>,
							that after <persRef ref="tallyrand-charles">Talleyrand</persRef> had
							declared so positively against our claims in the controversy with Spain,
							he had by an inofficial, unsigned note given <persRef
								ref="armstrong-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Armstrong</persRef> to understand that Spain was much in arrears in
							the subsidy due from her to France, and that if we would offer to pay
							them, she might be prevailed upon to cede us the Florida’s for the
							money— This note has been transmitted to <hi rend="italic">our</hi>
							<pb n="212" type="ms"/>Government, and is the whole foundation of the
								<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">President’s</persRef> policy with
							France and Spain— Thus while the public message at the commencement of
							the Session breathed nothing but force and almost recommended immediate
							War; the private whispers to friends were, for this money, and for
							authority as it is called to exchange land for land. Accordingly the
							House of Representatives have pass’d and communicated to the President,
							without asking the concurrence of the Senate two Resolutions,
							recommending to him to give land rather than money for land— Thus armed
							he is now prepared for a negotiation by which we may renounce all our
							claims upon the western boundary of Louisiana, and pay several millions
							to get the Florida’s— This is a great falling off from the tales with
							which we were soothed two years ago into the ratification of the
							Louisiana Treaty— Bradley says that Talleyrand treated our Ministers
								<persRef ref="livingston-robert">Livingston</persRef> and <persRef
								key="monroe-james">Monroe</persRef>, as <persRef ref="laban"><hi
									rend="italic">Laban</hi></persRef> treated <persRef ref="jacob"

							seven years for a wife, when he awoke in the morning, instead of
								<persRef ref="rachel">Rachel</persRef>, behold it was <hi
								rend="italic">Leah</hi>, and now this money must be given to patch
							up this blunder.— Poor Bradley however with all this slunk away
							yesterday at the instant when the question on the bill <hi
								rend="strikethrough">will be</hi> was taken— He says, he <hi
								rend="italic">thought</hi>, <persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard</persRef> was going to make
							another long speech against it; and that he went away, for fear of
							losing his dinner because it was so late. I suppose some of his friends
							have rallied him upon his retreat at the critical moment; by this
							attempt to apologize for it— A man’s character is often discoverable in
							his opinions as well as in his actions— Bradley says that <hi
								rend="italic">all</hi> the talents of a public minister consist in
							the decree to which he possesses the art of <hi rend="italic"
								>over-reaching</hi>.— The pains that M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Anderson has taken privately to raise jealousies against the secret
							bill, convince me that he too has been looking one way and rowing
							another— In the debates he has been the most zealous and active
							supporter of the bill; but besides this story which he told Bradley, and
							which made Bradley as he says averse to it, Anderson has told me several
							times that he wished the devil had the bill—that it had never been
							brought in—that I did not know by one half how bad it was, and that it
							was the most pernicious measure that ever M<hi rend="superscript"

							as I was certain he would never give cause for the exercise of the power
							I contemplated to vest in the <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
								>President</persRef>— He replied that his first remark had only been
								<hi rend="italic">par plaisanterie</hi>, and said that he perceived
							by my Bill I understood the usages of Europe as well as those of my own
							Country. Then by a natural transition, adverting to the Marquis’s letter
							to <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Madison</persRef>, he said that considered apart from its
							publication, which he did not attempt to defend, it did not appear to
							him that there was any thing in the Letter itself but what a Minister
							zealous in the cause of his Government, might be justified in saying— I
							told him there were besides the publication, and its manner, two other
							things in the Marquis’s conduct, which I thought far exceeded the rights
							of a foreign Minister, and which were extremely offensive to our
							Government and Nation. The one was the circular to the other foreign
							Ministers here, enclosing copies of his letter to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Madison; and the other was the manner in
							which the President’s name and official conduct were treated in the
							letter itself— I had seen in the public papers an attempt to justify the
							Marquis’s circular by the precedent of the reciprocal memorials of the
							French, English and Prussian Ministers at the Hague in 1786 and 1787.—
							This precedent I said was an aggravation of the outrage— For what was
							that case— In 1786 and 1787 the civil dissensions and internal party
							struggles in Holland had come almost to a civil War— In that situation
							three foreign powers, France, Britain and Prussia undertook to interfere
							and settle by concert among themselves the fate of Holland; and
							therefore their Ministers at the Hague communicated to each other their
							diplomatic communications with the Dutch Government, which was to
							receive the Law from them— Did the Marquis pretend, that he and the
							French and English Ministers, or any others here were by concert to give
							us the Law?— He interrupted me here, and said he had seen that attempt
							at a justification, but that it appeared to him there was no sort of
							analogy between the two cases, and that the precedent was not
							applicable— He also admitted that the use of the President’s name, and
							the direct reference to his Message were improper; but otherwise the
							contents of the Letter did not seem to him to transgress the bounds of a
							Ministers rights— I replied that I well knew what the rights and
							Independence of a Minister were, and with what freedom and boldness he
							must always be allowed to maintain the interests of his Sovereign. I
							would be the last man in the world to infringe those rights; but there
							were correlative duties, which a public Minister on his part was equally
							bound to observe, and if he violated them the Government to which he was
							address’d, must have the means of removing him— The President of the
							United States did not in most respects stand on the footing of an
							European Sovereign; but as to his Addresses to the Legislature on their
							assembling— Here the General interrupted me again; and said that in this
							respect, undoubtedly he was to be considered as precisely in the same
							situation— Well, said I, let me suppose the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor of France</persRef> had delivered a
							speech, or sent a Message to the Legislative Body; <pb n="215" type="ms"
							/>and a foreign Minister at Paris, should undertake to write and
							circulate such a comment upon it, as that of the Marquis in this
							case—how long would such a Minister be suffered to remain in France?— He
							smiled, and said, probably not long— But he said there had been many
							little irritating circumstances, which had provoked the Marquis— And for
							instance his letter had not been <hi rend="italic">answered</hi>— A
							foreign Minister might at least expect to have an Answer— I said that
							perhaps the Answer was withheld, because the character of the letter had
							forfeited the right to one— But said he I know your Government does not
							Answer—for they have not Answered me— I said that I did not mean to
							consider his case, as at-all similar to that of the Marquis— That he had
							spoken to our Government in terms very plain, and to say the least very
							energetic— But I had heard no complaint against him <hi rend="italic"
								>personally</hi> on this account; he had been understood as only
							discharging his duty; and had given no cause of offence— He concluded by
							observing that as the Marquis had in this instance been unfortunate, he
							had sympathized with him “Non ignara mali, miseris succurrere disco”—and
							therefore he had taken him with him to Baltimore— That he was sorry for
							him, as he was certainly a man of good understanding and fine parts— I
							told him, I was convinced of that; and it was an aggravation of his
							conduct; which I should more easily have excused, if I could have
							imputed it to ignorance or weakness— When a man of sense behaves in such
							a manner, it betrays a sentiment of contempt at the bottom of his Heart,
							which is more insupportable than the insults themselves— Here our
							conversation ended— The company were not entirely gone, untill after
							Midnight.</p>
