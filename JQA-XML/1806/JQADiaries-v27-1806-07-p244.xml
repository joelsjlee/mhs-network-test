						<p><date>11. </date>I enter this day upon my fortieth year.— And I this day

						<p><date>12. </date>Heard a Lecture this morning from <persRef
								ref="waterhouse-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Waterhouse</persRef>; and afterwards walked into Boston, with the
							intention of going out to Quincy, in the Stage. While in Boston, I
							nearly brought to a close, a transaction, which has been nearly two
							months in completing— <persRef ref="dexter-andrew">Andrew Dexter
								junior</persRef>, for a Company, who have some project on foot has
							purchased my house in Half-Court-Square— The terms were that they should
							give me fifteen thousand dollars, payable in instalments of five
							thousand dollars a year with interest; for which Dexter was to give me
							notes with two indorsers, and a mortgage of the place itself. I soon
							after agreed with <persRef ref="lowell-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> John Lowell</persRef> to purchase of him two houses
							built on one spot—in Nassau-Street; for which I was to give him the same
							sum, and payable at the same times, that I was to receive from Dexter—
							Finally M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lowell agreed to give me the
							conveyance of his houses completed, and to take the Securities, which I
							was to receive from Dexter, in payment; an arrangement more suitable to
							me, as it finished the whole business, without any necessity to me,
							either of giving, or receiving credit. Various circumstances had delayed
							the execution of the conveyances untill this day, though all the terms
							had been agreed upon some weeks since— Among the occasions of delay was,
							that I had been obliged to send to Washington, to get my deed to Dexter
							executed and acknowledged by my wife, for her renunciation of dower, and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lowell had also been obliged to send
							to Philadelphia to get a deed executed by <persRef ref="breck-samuel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Samuel Breck</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="breck-jane">his wife</persRef>, to complete a
							formality wanting in his title— This day, I executed the deed of my
							house in Half-Court-Square to Dexter— Dexter executed the mortgage, and
							gave the notes, endorsed by <persRef ref="tucker-alanson">Alanson
								Tucker</persRef>, to M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lowell (who had
							consented to take notes with one endorser) and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Lowell delivered the deed of his two houses in fee to me.
							We made a settlement also respecting the rents due— That from <persRef
								ref="delisle-caton">Delille</persRef> my tenant runs from 1. June at
							$900 a year. M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lowell’s houses are
							rented—one to <persRef ref="gardner-h">H. Gardner</persRef>, a quarter
							payable the 15<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of this month—and the
							other to <persRef ref="bradford-joseph">Joseph N. Bradford</persRef>,
							running from 17. June—at $500 a year each— We deducted then from the
							amount of Rents this day due on both M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Lowell’s houses, the amount of the rent this day due by Delille— I paid
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lowell the balance, and I am to
							receive the current rents on my purchase and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Lowell on his.— The deed of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Lowell to me had been duly signed and sealed, but not <hi rend="italic"
								>acknowledged</hi> before a Justice of Peace, by <persRef
								ref="amory-rebecca">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
								Lowell</persRef>— This formality is indeed very generally omitted in
							our conveyances here; but I always chuse to have it regularly done— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Lowell therefore took the deed with him
							to have the acknowledgement of his wife, taken upon it.— This business
							being thus far accomplished, I saw <persRef ref="jackson-henry2">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l:</hi> Jackson</persRef>, and agreed with
							him on the securities to be taken, for payment of the Judgment, which
							the Assignees of <persRef ref="bird-robert">Robert Bird</persRef> have
							against him— But not finding <persRef ref="hall-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Hall</persRef>, who is to draw the
							papers, was obliged to postpone it, for the present.— I dined at
								<persRef ref="whitcomb-tilly">Whitcomb’s</persRef>; and waited from
							4. O’Clock P.M. untill past 6. for the Quincy Stage to call for me. It
							went off however without me; and having but the alternative of returning
							to Cambridge, or walking to Quincy, I determined on the latter and
							walked out— I stop’d at <persRef ref="foster-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Foster’s</persRef> shop; and received
							the last dividend upon my Neponset Bridge Shares— From thence to
								<persRef key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> house, it took me
