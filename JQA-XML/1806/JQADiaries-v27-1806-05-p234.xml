						<p><date>19. </date>I intended to have gone into Boston this morning, but

							to my own house; unpacked one of the boxes of books which were put up
							the last Autumn, and took out some of the books which I wanted— I am
							very uneasy at the unsettled situation in which I still remain; and at
							the valuable time I am losing.— As I was returning home this evening I
