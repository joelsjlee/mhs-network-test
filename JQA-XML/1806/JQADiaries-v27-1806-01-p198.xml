							shall receive it at the Treasury, untill the question of his right shall
							be determined— I afterwards saw <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r:</hi> Key</persRef>, Captain Barney’s Counsel, and
							endeavoured to make some arrangement with him, so that the money may be
							paid over to Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Dorr, and he made <pb
								n="199" type="ms"/>me a proposal for that purpose which I am to
							communicate to them. The Senate was engaged upon business of no material
							consequence— Last Thursday <persRef ref="russell-gilbert2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Russell</persRef> of Boston requested
							me to present two petitions from the claimants to the Georgia Lands,
							which I accordingly did this day— <persRef ref="sumter-thomas3">General
								Sumpter</persRef> immediately afterwards presented a similar
							petition from some of the South-Carolina claimants— This subject has for
							several Sessions occasioned extremely violent debates in the House of
							Representatives— General Sumpter had had his petition in his pocket for
							a week without presenting it— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Russell
							wished that I should present his, immediately after that of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Sumpter; which I accordingly proposed to
							that Gentleman; but after some deliberation he finally express’d the
							wish that I should present mine first— The reason for all this timidity
							is because it is expected this subject will occasion as violent debates
							in Senate, as it has in the other house; which is very probable— On my
							presenting them <persRef ref="jackson-james2">Gen<hi rend="superscript"
									>l:</hi> Jackson</persRef> started up and commenced a violent
							invective against the claims, without any specific object— The petitions
							however lay on the table, and I gave notice that I should call them up
							at an early day— I feel very reluctant, at being thus engaged in an
							affair which has already occasioned so many unpleasant altercations; but
							as the agent of the petitioners has chosen to make his application to
							me; I could no more avoid it than any other part of my duty— I this day
							finished reading the fourth Volume of <persRef ref="marshall-john"
								>Marshall’s</persRef> life of <persRef ref="washington-george"
								>Washington</persRef>; which finishes with the War of our
							Independence— In the Evening I read also part of a pamphlet entitled War
							in disguise, recent from England, which <persRef ref="mitchill-samuel"

							to have been referred to a Select Committee; and then that the papers

							Jealousy would immediately be raised against doing any thing; and I

							struck every body as so mere a dead letter, that the D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> found himself reduced to account for its
							imbecility, which he did to me in this way— He told me that his only
							object was to have it in our power to tell the French Government that we
							had prohibited the trade, and that if the merchants would carry it on
							they must do it at their peril, as it would be out of our protection—
							His motion to refer part of the <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
								>President’s</persRef> Message was taken up, and he alledged as his
							motive that he had a memorial to present from the merchants of
							Philadelphia which he wished to have referr’d to the same Committee— As
							the multiplication of Committees upon one Subject has so manifest a
							tendency to produce disorder and confusion, I moved to amend the
							Resolution proposed by making the reference to the Committee on the
							New-York Memorial— This brought up <persRef ref="wright-robert"
								>Wright</persRef>, who soon work’d himself into one of his violent
							passions, and stormed at the indelicacy of a member’s moving for the
							reference of a paper to a Committee of which he himself was a member.
							(which be it noted is every day’s practice) He was for having a new
							Committee, and he hoped it would be of <hi rend="italic">seven</hi>
							members— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wrights Eloquence however
							producing little effect, <persRef ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Anderson</persRef> bethought himself
							of a new expedient— He said my motion was not in order— That a paper
							could not be referred to a Committee already appointed; he alledged in
							proof of this the 15<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> Rule for conducting
							business in the Senate, which says “All Committees shall be appointed by
							ballot, and a plurality of votes shall make a choice.”— And he appealed
							to the <persRef ref="clinton-george">President</persRef> to decide
							whether my motion was in order or not— Upon this appeal there could be
							no debate; and I was deprived of any opportunity, of replying either to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wright or M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Anderson— The President professed his ignorance of the
							practice in Senate; observed his decision on the meaning of the rule
							would depend on another question, which was, whether the paper moved to
							be referred to a Committee already raised, related to <hi rend="italic"
								>the same subject</hi> as that before them; and that on that ground
							he pronounced my motion to amend not in order, as there must be a new
							ballot— The rejection of my motion for an Amendment, prevents even an
							appearance of it upon <pb n="201" type="ms"/>the Journals— The question
							then on the reference of part of the President’s Speech, to a special
							Committee was taken by yeas and nays at the call of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wright, and I voted against the
							reference— It was however determined to refer it, to a Committee of
							Seven— On the return of the ballots, it appeared that the five members
							composing the Committee on the New-York Memorial, were again chosen; and
							two others added—D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Logan, and <persRef
								ref="baldwin-abraham">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Baldwin</persRef>— So that M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Wright
							still failed in his principal object, which was to get on the Committee
							himself.— But instead of D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Mitchill the
							Chairman of this Committee is <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Smith</persRef> of Maryland— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Logan then presented his memorial from
							the Philadelphia Merchants, and after it was read, moved its reference
							to the Committee just appointed on part of the President’s Message—
								<persRef ref="tracy-uriah">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Tracy</persRef> then objected that by the decision just made on the
								15<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> Rule, there must be a New
							Committee. The Vice-President began by saying that he thought there was
							a manifest distinction between the two cases, but concluded by again
							deciding that there must be a new ballot— The same members were again
							chosen, but the chairman was again different; being now M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Anderson— The result therefore is that we
							have three Committees on one and the same Subject— On this transaction I
							remark first the singular Effects of the Spirit of Party.— When the
							New-York Memorial was presented, Wright wanted it to lay over untill the
							next day, for the purpose of having the Committee-Men agreed upon out of
							doors, by the <hi rend="italic">party</hi>; but as he did not then carry
							his point, the next object was to get another Committee on the same
							subject— This the party had determined upon, and D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Logan’s motion to refer part of the President’s Speech was
							the means used to effect this purpose— But as the <hi rend="italic"
								>real</hi> motive could not be avowed, when the forcible objection
							to the multiplication of Committees on one subject was urged, the only
							refuge was to appeal to a construction of a Rule of Order, contrary to
							the uniform and invariable practice— This proved successful; but at the
							hazard of introducing inextricable confusion in the transaction of
							business. For D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Logan could not get the
							very paper upon which he founded his motion to refer the Message,
							referr’d to the same Committee. Secondly. The great importance of an
							intelligent and experienced man to Preside in the Senate of the United
							States— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Clinton is totally ignorant of
							all the most common forms of proceeding in Senate, and yet by the Rules
							he is to decide every question of order without debate, and without
							appeal— His judgment is neither quick nor strong, so that there is no
							more dependence upon the correctness of his determinations, from his
							understanding than from his experience.— As the only duty of a
							Vice-President under our Constitution is to preside in Senate, it ought
							to be considered what his qualifications for that office are, at his
							Election— In this respect a worse choice than M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> Clinton, could scarcely have been made. Thirdly the
							characters of men appear in their discourses as much as in their deeds;
							and in the same manner; not from the tenor of what they say, but from
							the inferences to be drawn from it— Anderson and Wright had the same <hi
								rend="italic">end</hi> in view, and their motive was the same—but
							neither could acknowledge it— Wright whose temper is violent, and who
							has no sense of decency or delicacy thinks of nothing better than to
							charge as indelicacy in me, what he has done hundreds of times himself,
							and what every member is accustomed to do, who acts on Committees
							at-all— Anderson recurs to stratagem and surprize— He insists upon a
							Rule of order, to decide the point; and by an absurd, twisting
							Construction of the Rule, obtains his purpose.— Fourthly, this affair
							has proved that the jealousy and acrimony of party is roused against us,
							and that we shall therefore henceforth experience the same exclusion of
							all effectual agency in measures, which we have felt in the former
							Sessions— I dined at <persRef ref="turreau-louis">General
								Turreau’s</persRef>, with a company of about 20 persons— <persRef
								ref="turreau-marie">Madame Turreau</persRef> was there; and the
								<persRef ref="casairujo-carlos">Marquis de Casa-Yrujo</persRef>, who
							had just arrived from Philadelphia. I came home early in the Evening;

							shifted his motion, to a motion for referring the Resolution to a
							Committee— His motive was thus by a side blow to put it out of the way;

							Bradley’s greatest powers extend no further than to such a trick as
							this— His motion was supported by <persRef ref="baldwin-abraham">M<hi

						<p><date>31. </date>On going up to the Capitol this morning I found there a
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Searle</persRef>; a
							young man from Providence who brought me a letter of Introduction from
								<persRef ref="barnes-david">Judge Barnes</persRef>— The Committee on

							first of <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">General Smith</persRef> the
							chairman’s Resolutions, and agreed to offer what I considered as a
							better substitute for it, I this morning offered the first of the
							Resolutions I drew up some days ago on the same Subject— The question
							was put on Smith’s Resolution, and mine; and determined by the Committee
							in favour of mine: four to three— On this occasion I could not but
							observe the workings of party Spirit, and of personal friendship on
							public measures— Smith’s Resolution was so very badly drawn, that I
							think there could be no reasonable question between the two. (Here
							however I am sensible, I am a very improper Judge) <persRef
								ref="logan-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Logan</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="baldwin-abraham">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Baldwin</persRef> declared in favour of Smith’s— Baldwin without
							assigning <hi rend="italic">any</hi> Reason— Logan, alledging that there
							would probably be a Congress of the Northern European powers, and an
							abstract proposition, would perhaps induce their co-operation sooner,
							than a specification of our particular Cause of Complaint— <persRef

								>Mitchell</persRef>, and <persRef ref="anderson-joseph"
								>Anderson</persRef>, the two last with extreme and undisguised
							reluctance, pronounced in favour of mine— Tracy, barely replied to
							Logan’s semblance of an Argument, which he blew away at a breath— The
							other two, after wavering long, and above all anxious for excusing their
							vote, to the chairman <hi rend="italic">hesitated</hi> the preference
							which they could not deny, untill the chairman inferred their vote,
							without compelling them to give it, and declared the decision in favour
							of my Resolution, with a slight <pb n="206" type="ms"/>Amendment
							suggested by M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Anderson, and to this
							decision they assented— The Chairman’s second Resolution was next taken
							up— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy declared himself very
							decidedly against it—said he believed it would be a pernicious and fatal
							measure, but refused to assign his reasons for this opinion— I express’d
							my opinion much more doubtfully— Rather inclining against it, as a
							measure which would do us as much harm as the adversary; but far from
							pledging myself to vote against it eventually— We came to no decision
							and adjourned untill to-morrow morning— In Senate, <persRef
								ref="wright-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Wright’s</persRef> bill was again called up, and he now moved to
							refer it to a select Committee of five; which was done— The bill for the
							relief of <persRef ref="harding-seth">Seth Harding</persRef>, was at my
							motion and <persRef ref="bradley-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bradley’s</persRef> consent postponed untill Monday.— As I was going
							up to the Capitol I met the <persRef ref="smith-robert">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef>, and made some enquiries of him relating to the
							Navy-Pension fund— He coincided perfectly in opinion with me, that this
							would be a compleat diversion, and misapplication of it; and told me
							that Bradley had asked him some questions about the fund—whether it was
							rich &amp;c— And he had answered “yes—but I hope you are not going to
							lay your unhallowed hands upon it.” On conversing with Bradley, he told
							me that the Secretary of the Navy, had declared himself unequivocally in
							favour of this provision— The Library Bill pass’d without a division—
							The Secret bill was taken up; and Bradley’s amendment debated— Taken by
							yeas and nays and carried against it 21. to 10.— Bradley was so much
							offended at this, that he broke out against the Bill itself; though he
							had originally declared he should vote for it whether his Amendment
							should be adopted or not— He now declared he would go home, and I think
							he will not vote on the bill at-all— I think this was his design in
							proposing the Amendment— He was afraid to vote either for or against <hi
								rend="strikethrough">it</hi> the bill; and took this mode of making
							a pretext to fly the vote— This is altogether in character, and I have
							often seen him do so before— <persRef ref="bayard-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Bayard</persRef> then proposed
							another Amendment, which he supported by a powerful speech.— No Answer
							was made, but on taking the yeas and nays, they were yeas 20. nays 10—
								D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Mitchill moved a postponement for a
							fortnight from next Monday—rejected— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Bayard moved a postponement indefinitely; and made one of his most
							eloquent appeals to the feelings and reason of the Senate—rejected
							without a word in reply— It was now half-past 3. O’Clock, and I moved an
							adjournment, as no discussion at-all had taken place on the bill itself.
							Rejected.— The determination appeared to be to pass the bill at all
							hazards— When lo! <persRef ref="adair-john">General Adair</persRef>
							declared he should vote against the bill, and in a very few words
							assigned his reasons.— <persRef ref="hillhouse-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Hillhouse</persRef> then rose to
							speak upon the bill, when they who had but an instant before so
							stubbornly rejected every thing but the final vote declared themselves
							willing to adjourn; and accordingly we did adjourn to Monday— Adair’s
							scruples are to be quieted. It was late; but I had a short conversation
							with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Tracy, to enquire what were his
							objections to my Resolutions— He did not particularly specify— I asked
							him if he had any thing to propose in their stead? He said arming and
							increasing the Navy— After some discussion he appeared again inclined to
							bring forward my Resolutions, and I asked him to draw up one upon his
							own ideas to add to mine—he said he would and we are to meet again in
							the morning— The crowd of business pressing upon us, occasions many
							remarks which might be useful, but which I have not time to record, and
							which will be lost— On these important questions, which we are now
							agitating, I feel a distressing consciousness of my own weakness of
							capacity, together with a profound and anxious wish for more powerful
							means— I lament the want of <hi rend="italic">genius</hi>, because I
							want a mighty Agent for the service of my Country— I pray for light from
							above, and hope there is neither presumption nor fanaticism in the
							prayer.— I pray for a sound head and a pure heart in deliberating upon
							points on which peace and War, are pledg’d; and I pray that I may never
							mistake the suggestions of personal Ambition or any other selfish
							passion for the dictates of patriotism— Feeble and insignificant as my
							influence upon the Counsels of the Nation is, I feel a load of
							responsibility weighing upon me to the utmost I can bear— Honest
							intention and sincerity must be my only substitute for more <pb n="207"
								type="ms"/>efficacious powers, and I hope I never shall suffer them
							to be overborne by any partial or dishonourable aim.— Rode with <persRef
