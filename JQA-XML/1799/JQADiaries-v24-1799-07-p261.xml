							she really was. She said it was impossible to give us more than one
							room, or more than two beds. Mamselle she said, (meaning Epps) must
							sleep in the same room with us, and lay upon straw— The <persRef
								ref="vonbiron-dorothea">Duchess of Courland</persRef> had stopped at
							the house, and made no difficulty to lay upon straw.— And she (the
							post-mistress) could surely not take the beds of her own people in the
							house, to accommodate us.— I desired her, by no means to give <pb
								n="263" type="ms"/>herself any trouble, and told her we would suit
							ourselves altogether with a single chamber and two beds— After which, of
							her own accord she gave a second room, and another bed, with straw for

							which in these countries is uncommon.</p>

							a mountain very long, and very steep, renders extremely tedious, and too
							dangerous, to remain in the carriage— Women are carried in armed chairs,
							by two men, like Sedans— The rest of us walked. The descent I suppose to
							be about three english miles long.— About two thirds of the way down,
							are the ruins of an old castle— The view from the mountain is grand and
							rugged, but you see no water. Töplitz is about three miles distant from
							the bottom of the hill— We arrived, about a quarter of an hour before
							seven in the evening, after a very fatiguing day.— We lodge at the sign
