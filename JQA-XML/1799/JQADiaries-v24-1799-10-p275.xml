							Königstein— Took four horses with our own carriage, and set out at 7. in
							the morning. Shortly before 11. we reached the bottom of the rock. By
							land, it is only three German miles distant from Dresden; and the road,
							being through Pirna is very good. We went over the whole fortress and
							saw the Arsenal, the Casemates built by the <persRef
								ref="frederickaugustus-i">present elector</persRef> to lodge the
							soldiers in time of War; the great tun, full of wine; containing as they
							told us 10,000 hogsheads— The famous Page’s bed; being a ledge not more
							than a foot wide upon the summit of the rock; from which the
							perpendicular descent is about 2000 feet: upon which a certain Page,
							named <persRef ref="vongrunau-robert">Robert von Grünau</persRef>, once
							being drunk laid himself down and went to sleep. He was saved by passing
							a band round him while he slept and drawing him into the window out of
							which he had crept to take his pleasant siesta— Had he waked of his own
							accord, he could not possibly have risen, and had he moved himself the
							space of two inches he must have gone over the ledge— This man, they
							told us lived to the age of 108 years, having escaped one other danger,
							nearly as great as that at this spot— A horse upon which he was riding,
							leapt with him from the bridge at Dresden into the Elbe.— Perhaps the
							greatest curiosity here however is the great well, dug through the rock,
							more than 1800 feet deep— A work of forty years. They sent down four
							lighted candles with one of the buckets to shew the depth more clearly.
							The buckets are drawn up and down, by a large wheel turned by four men,
							who are thus constantly employed in drawing water for all the purposes
							of the garrison.— This fortress is inaccessible excepting at one
							entrance which is sufficiently guarded by out-works, a draw bridge, a
							covered way, masked batteries, three gates, and every other proper
							precaution— A garrison of eight hundred men is sufficient to defend it,
							and it cannot contain more than 1800— During the seven years war, while
							the whole electorate was in the possession of the <persRef
								ref="frederick-ii">king of Prussia</persRef>, the <persRef
								ref="augustus-iii">Electors</persRef> family, will all the precious
							things he had at Dresden, were protected and preserved in this fortress;
							which Frederic never attacked.— At two in the afternoon, we returned to
							the inn, and dined, after which we came back to Dresden, and arrived, at
							about half past seven in the Evening.</p>
