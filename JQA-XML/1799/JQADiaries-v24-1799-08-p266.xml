                        <p><date>1. </date>I had been for several days, not altogether well—and rose
                            this morning with an unusual pain in my head, just over my eyes, which
                            felt as if they had been strained by too strong a light.— Yet I walked
                            with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
                                Adams</persRef> before breakfast, and afterwards at noon, an hour
                            alone. Upon returning home from this last walk I found myself very much
                            fatigued, with pains all round the loins, and in almost all my limbs. I
                            dined however, but with much less appetite than usual, and soon after
                            dinner, felt so feverish that I laid down on the bed, and slept an hour
                            or two— <persRef ref="talbot-charles">Lord Talbot</persRef> and <persRef

                            Lord Minto— They proceed on their journey early to-morrow morning.— I
                            rose to see them— But after they were gone, was obliged to go to bed
                            again— I thought I had taken a severe cold and needed a strong
                            perspiration—for which purpose I took a glass of hot wine and water— The
                                <persRef ref="ambrosi-wenzel">Doctor (Ambrozi)</persRef> happening
                            to call in the Evening, was of opinion from my symptoms that my
                            complaint will prove to be an Ague and fever, which I was very unwilling
                            to believe.</p>

                            the morning, that I thought myself entirely recovered— At about ten this
                            morning, the <persRef ref="ambrosi-wenzel">Doctor</persRef> called, and
                            observing that this was my bad day advised me to keep my bed; but I told
                            him, I believed the affair was quite over, and I should get up in the
                            course of an hour.— He said he wished I might not find myself mistaken,
                            and recommended to me, at least not to rise untill noon— My impatience
                            however could not wait quite so long— I rose at about eleven, but had
                            not been five minutes up before I found myself so weak and faint that I
                            was obliged to lye down again to recover myself— I did not however
                            return to bed, but walked about my chamber and sat upon the Sopha untill
                            about 6 in the Evening, with no small fever upon me all the time— I had
                            sent several times to see the Doctor, who was not at home— He came at
                            about 7. in the Evening, while I was in the height of my fever, but
                            observed that there was nothing now to be done, as the disease must take
                            its natural course.— I had nothing to do but to lye quiet, and drink
                            limonade.— For about three hours I continued in the heat of a furnace,
                            with every pulse in my body beating as if they would burst through, <pb
                                n="267" type="ms"/>and at about 11. at night the fever went off,
                            with a perspiration such as I never before experienced. Every pore in
                            me, seemed turned into a fountain, and all the linen around me, was as
                            if it had been dragged through a river.— I then changed it and passed
                            the night in my wife’s bed— <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine"
                                >She</persRef> got what rest she could <hi rend="italic">upon</hi>
                            mine— The violent perspiration was followed by another effect which
                            obliged me to rise.</p>

                            bed the whole day, drinking limonade, and taking every two hours a
                            powder consisting chiefly of Sal-Ammoniac.— At about 2. afternoon the
                            perspiration came on, and continued untill 8 in the Evening.— It was
                            very profuse almost the whole time; yet neither that nor the violence of
                            the fever, was in any degree comparable to the severity of the last
                            fit.— The effect which followed that, took place, in the midst of this
                            and was extremely troublesome.— At 8 in the Evening, I rose for about
                            half an hour, but found myself excessively weak, and soon returned to a
                            refreshed chamber, and a dry bed.</p>

                            Kloster Ossegg, a monastery about 6 miles distant from Töplitz— <persRef

                            belonging to Prague who lodge next door to us, and who have been
                            uncommonly civil to us. Being well acquainted with the prior of the
                            Monastery, they introduced us to him, and he shewed us all his
                            apartments and the garden in which however we found nothing very
                            remarkable— The situation and prospect are very fine. The convent is of
                            the Cistercian order, and was founded in the year 1196. The number of
                            the monks is twenty; besides the various officers of the institution,
                            who amount to about twenty more— The revenues of the prior are about
                            80,000 florins, or near 8000 pounds Sterling a year. Those of the monks
                            are comparatively very small— We were told, not more than three or four
                            hundred florins a year, for each one. In the apartments of the prior,
                            which are large and numerous, we saw some indifferent portraits, and
                            several old maps hung up— A small cabinet of minerals not much in order,
                            and of which the prior told us, he understood nothing—a barometer—an
                            harpsichord, and several volumes of music, particularly <persRef
                                ref="mozart-wolfgang">Mozart’s</persRef> works; but no library.— The
                            prior played us an air upon the harpsichord, and performed very well— He
                            is apparently a man of about fifty; tall and strong built, but not
                            large; his hair is just beginning to turn from black to grey. His
                            countenance is open and placid, his manners obliging, but without the
                            polish, which is acquired only by frequent intercourse with the world—
                            He has held his present station only a few months, and had been before,
                            one of the ordinary monks of the convent, with an income of two or three
                            hundred florins. In the garden, were various <pb n="270" type="ms"
                            />Cascades, and fountains, a pond, containing a number of small black
                            turtles, with a small island in the centre, on the top of which was a
                            small model of a fort, which they call the turtle’s fortress: and
                            another pond with a similar island in the centre, upon which were kept a
                            number of rabbits— Several small huts built of bark, and covered with
                            thatch, containing sofa’s, and turkish, resting beds; and two sets of
                            machines, for different sports requiring gentle exercise.— Some of the
                            water works were disposed so as to be suddenly played off, and caught us
                            in an unexpected shower— We had tea, with various kinds of fruit in a
                            summer house, at the bottom of the garden, from which we had a beautiful
                            prospect over all the plains, to the stupendous rock of Billin, and the
                            Millischauer mountain, one of the highest in Bohemia— Between 6 and 7.
                            o’clock we took our leave, and came through the church which is large,
                            and handsome, with some fine paintings in fresco upon the cieling— We
                            reached Töpliz again at about eight in the Evening.</p>

                                OKelly</persRef> to the ruins of the Castle upon the Geyersberg,
                            which we passed, on the road from Dresden. We dismounted, and with some
                            difficulty reached the spot upon which the Castle itself was built— It
                            must have been long in ruins; for within the walls, on a spot where one
                            of the apartments must have been, we saw the trunk of a tree, at least
                            12 inches in diameter; which has very recently been cut down. The
                            prospect is uncommonly beautiful— It was almost 2 afternoon when we
                            returned to Töplitz.— We had only time to dine, and at 4. set out, with
                            Baron Hildprandt, his <persRef ref="u">son</persRef> and <persRef

                                Adams</persRef>, went with Miss Hildprandt, in a chaise—the rest of
                            us, on a carriage of peculiar construction, such as I have seen no where
                            else but here— It is merely a long bench covered with cushion, upon
                            which the riders sit astride, one before the other; placed upon a floor
                            suspended upon springs, and running upon four low wheels— Being very
                            low, it is well adapted for safety in roads like those of this country,
                            and being perfectly open on all sides can intercept no part of the
                            charming prospects which are continually presenting themselves to the
                            view.— <hi rend="italic">Dux</hi> is nearly at the same distance from
                            Töplitz as Ossegg, and the road to it is for the greatest part of the
                            way, the same. Count Wallenstein, to whom Baron Hildprandt introduced
                            us, shewed us his stables, in which he has nearly an hundred horses;
                            some of them very good ones.— All his occupation, and all his amusement
                            is, attending to these horses; of which he carries on a trade.— He made
                            two of them perform some tricks, such as lying down, sitting upon their
                            hind legs &amp;c, which they executed very indifferently.— We walked in
                            the garden of the castle, which is spacious, and might easily be made
                            handsome, but is kept in very indifferent order— We did not see the
                            inside of the castle— Between 6 and 7. we returned to Teplitz.</p>
