				<dateline>Washington. Sunday 14. March 1847.<lb/>Posthumous Memoir</dateline>
						<p>On Friday the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of November 1846. being at <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my son’s</persRef> house
					in Mount Vernon street Boston, I rose as I had for many years accustomed to do
					between 4 and 5 o’clock in the morning, and went through the usual process of
					ablution and friction with a horse hair strap and mittens given me in the summer
					of 1843—and which from that time I had used from day to day—and after
					breakfasting with the family, I attempted to walk out with <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript"
						>r</hi> George Parkman</persRef> to visit the new establishment of the Medical
					college— I suddenly found myself unable to walk and my knees sinking under me—
					With the help of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman I staggered back to my Son’s
							house <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jacob Bigelow</persRef> my physician was called in. <persRef ref="u">D<hi
						rend="superscript">r</hi><space/><unclear>Jackson</unclear></persRef> accidentally was in consultation with him,
					and I was put to bed to which I was several days and nights confined, with a
					suspension of bodily powers, with little or no pain, and little exercise of
					intellect— From that hour I date my decease, and consider myself for every
					useful purpose to myself or to my fellow creatures dead—and hence I call this
					and what I may write here hereafter a posthumous Memoir.</p>
				<p>I was confined for several days, I know not how many to the bed; my sudden and
					extraordinary seizure was noticed in the Boston Newspapers of the following day—
					On Tuesday the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> my Son had left Boston with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> <persRef ref="adams-john2">my
						son John’s</persRef> widow <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary Catherine Adams</persRef> and her daughter Mary Louisa Adams—he went
					with them as far as Philadelphia and then returned to Boston where he found me
					ill in bed at his house— He had heard of my being taken ill, before he reached
					home, in the cars of the long Island Rail-road—</p>
						<p>On Sunday the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> who had arrived at Washington was
							informed of my sudden illness, by two Letters from <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
					Charles Adams</persRef> and by the newspaper paragraphs.— The next morning she left
							Washington accompanied as far as Baltimore by <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef>, and thence she
					proceeded alone by Railroad and Steam-boat alone, and reached Boston on Tuesday
					Evening the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> having made the passage from New York in
					the Steamer Atlantic, the last passage which she made before that in which she
					perished.</p>
				<p>From that time until the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February 1847. we lived at
					my Sons house N. 57. Mount Vernon Street Boston, and with his family— On the
					first of January 1847 I was first able to take a ride in a carriage of about an
					hour with my daughter M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Charles F. Adams, which ride was
					thence</p>

				<dateline>Saturday 20. March 1847. </dateline>
				<p>thenceforth daily repeated till the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of January when I
					made the experiment of walking in the Street in Boston— On the 24<hi rend="superscript"
						>th.</hi> and 31<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of January I attended public worship
					at the first Congregational Church in Boston— On the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
					February I walked to that Church morning and afternoon and partook of the
					communion administered by <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nathaniel L. Frothingham</persRef>. From
					my first confinement on the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of November I was attended
					night and day by a Nurse procured for me by <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob">Doctor Bigelow</persRef>—<persRef ref="fader-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript"
						>rs</hi> Fader</persRef>, who told me she was a native of Charleston South Carolina,
					daughter of an <persRef ref="u">Englishman named Craig</persRef> That she had been married and resided at
					Boston—and had now been twelve years a widow with two children, a <persRef ref="u">Son</persRef> and a
					<persRef ref="u">daughter</persRef>— She herself boarded at a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Spooner’s</persRef>— She slept
					part of the time in a truckle bed and part of the time on the carpet of the
					bed-chamber to which I was confined For at least two months from my first
					confinement I was obliged to call her up at least once every night in the middle
					of the Night— My sleep was variabe—some times quiet with little disturbance, but
					generally restless uneasy and feverish— My convalescence was slow—scarcely
					perceptible, but without any painfull attack, and without any substantial
					restoration of health— The shaking palsy continuing unabated, and becoming more
					aggravated—in proportion as I seemed to recover the use of my limbs—</p>
