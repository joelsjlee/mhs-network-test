						<p>A warm and trying Summer day. After a restless and sleepless night, I was
							deprived of my walk and the portion of time which I could devote to any
							occupation, was spent in reading newspapers, Articles in <persRef

								ref="beloe-william">Beloes’</persRef>

							Profane Historians seems rather a collector of Anecdotes than merely an
							Historian— A very small portion of the Anecdotes appear to have any
							foundation in fact, and they are all discredited by the perpetual
							occurence of the marvellous— There is also an inextricable confusion of
							names and the same persons, are mentioned by different names in
							Herodotus, <persRef ref="diodorusofsiculus">Diodorus Seculus</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="justinus">Justin</persRef> the Abbreviator of <persRef
								ref="trogus-gnaeus">Trogus Pompeius</persRef> whose work has
							perished, and the scriptures of the Old Testament. Chronology prior to
							the age of <persRef ref="alexanderthegreat">Alexander of
								Macedon</persRef> is an inextricable chaos— The writings of <persRef
								ref="david">David</persRef>, of <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon</persRef>, and of Homer about twelve hundred years before
							Christ, stand unaccountable monuments of Literature in a <pb n="145"

							of at least seven hundred years, of total barbarism. The Psalms of
							David, the Proverbs of Solomon, and the Illyad and Oddissy of Homer are
							phenomena in the History of literature hitherto unexplained. and in all
							probability so to remain notwithstanding the recent discovery of the
							secret of Hierogliphical writing. Had visits from <persRef
