							<persRef ref="palfrey-john">Palfrey</persRef>. Et id genus omne. The article was very abusive, threatening to

							and to send two thousand copies of the National Whig in which it
							appears, into each of the Districts of those gentlemen in order that

							Giddings stated that this Paper was established professing to be for the

							connected with certain members of the House— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Giddings in a summary manner justified himself for his votes, and
							disclaimed any intention to implicate the Whig Party in this infamous
							attempt to brow beat and intimidate the members of the Party. No reply
							was made, but it was manifest that this was the purpose of the
							establishment of the Daily National Whig— When I first came to the City,
							a man came to me proposing to me to subscribe for this Paper. I asked

						<p>In the House the Report of the Select Committee for the revisal of the
							Rules was the Special Order for debate and the usual effect of the
							appointment of such Committees was again exemplified that is to say it
							only made the subject of the rules more complicated than it was The
							first discussion was about what is called the hour Rule, that is the
							limitation of an hour for the time allowed to every member to speak upon
							any subject in Debate. The select Committee first proposed an extent of
							the limitation from an <pb n="238" type="ms"/>hour to an hour and a
							half, and secondly they proposed a substitute for the hour Rule allowing
							each member who proposes any measure another hour to close the Debate
							which of course establishes an inequality between the members some to be
							indulged with two hours and others to be confined to one. This
							introduced a long Debate, which was closed by a re adoption of the hour
							rule with the proviso that in closing debates every member shall be
							allowed five minutes to explain in Committee of the whole any Amendment
							he may offer—and by adopting a further Rule that members may address the
							House from the <persRef ref="campbell-thomas2">Clerks</persRef> Desk or from a place near the <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Speakers</persRef> Chair
							instead of from his own Seat. An additional Rule was adopted that except
							during the last ten days of the Session the Speaker shall not entertain
							a motion to suspend the Rules of the House except on Monday of every
							week, and except a motion for going into Committee of the whole on the
							state of the Union. Another Rule proposed was that when the Committee of
							the whole on the state of the Union, or a Committee of the whole House
							finds itself without a Quorum, the Chairman shall cause the Role of the
							House to be called, and thereupon the Committee shall rise and the
							Chairman shall Report the names of the absentees which shall be entered
							in the Journal— Other Rules were proposed and among the rest one that in
							addition to the other standing Committees of the House there shall be
							one called the Smithsonian Committee whose duty it shall be to
							superintend the affairs of the Smithsonian Institution. This again
							introduced a long Debate all which was closed by a Resolution offered by
							<persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles. J. Ingersoll</persRef> that <pb n="239" type="ms"/>the Rules of the House
							at the last Congress with the modifications of them, this day adopted be
							henceforth the Rules and regulations of this House during this Session
							of Congress. And so ends the undertaking to simplyfy and improve the
							Rules for this time— The House adjourned about three oclock.</p>
