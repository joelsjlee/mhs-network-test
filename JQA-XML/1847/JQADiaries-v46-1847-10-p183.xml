						<p>An uneasy comfortless night <persRef ref="lunt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lunt</persRef> administered the
							Communion and preached from Luke 13.23— “Then said one unto Him Lord are
							there few that be saved and He said unto them. 24. Strive to enter in at
							the straight gate for many I say unto you will seek to enter in and
							shall not be able”— It is remarkable that a direct answer to the
							question is evaded instead of it is an implied censure upon the question
							itself and a strong exhortation to the hearers instead of busying
							themselves with inquiries as to the number of those that should be saved
							to confine their attention to the means of securing their own Salvation.
							The Discourse was elaborate and impressive— That of the afternoon was by
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Simmons</persRef> from Matthew 11.11. [“]Verily I say
							unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a
							greater than <persRef ref="johnthebaptist">John the Baptist</persRef>, notwithstanding he that is least in the
							Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he”—an interesting Discourse upon the
							character of John the Baptist. There is a German Essayist by the name of
							<unclear>Fuster</unclear> who in a Review of the Gallery of Pictures at Dresden has
							selected an imaginary Portrait of John the Baptist, as the subject of a
							dissertation upon the character of this wonderful personage, which I
							think M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Simmons must have read, and from which he
							must have borrowed many ideas in portraying this forerunner of the
							Messiah, deserving of the profound meditation of every pious Christian.

						<p>I had a very indifferent nights rest and scarcely expect any other. I

							<persRef ref="lawrence-abbott">Abbott Lawrence</persRef> <persRef ref="bowditch-jonathan">J. Ingersoll Bowditch</persRef> and <persRef ref="peabody-francis">Francis Peabody</persRef> did pay the

							Court. In consequence of my own personal indisposition, of that of
							President Quincy suffering from inflammation of the eyes, of <persRef ref="everett-edward">President
							Everett</persRef> who was that day confined to his Bed by sickness and of a
							threatened storm in the morning, I was deterred from calling upon M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Quincy to proceed to Cambridge on that day as we
							had agreed. We were disappointed accordingly in attending with the other
							Members of the Committee and substituted a visit of this day, for our
							own satisfaction— We reached Cambridge at ten oclock and President
							Everett went with us to the Observatory, where we found the Observator
							William. Cranch. Bond. and his son and Assistant <persRef ref="bond-george">George. C. Bond</persRef>—but
							Professor Pierce was not there. The great <persRef ref="fraunhofer-joseph">Frauenhofer</persRef> Refractor a small

							There is however one large Transit Instrument to be constructed by <persRef ref="simms-william">Simms</persRef>
							at London which has not yet arrived and seems to have been too long

							that he concluded to make another. The sky though clear early this
							morning had clouded up before we reached the Observatory, and we could
							take no view through the principal Instrument About twelve oclock we
							returned to President Everetts and then home. I left M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Quincy at his house and reached my own before three <pb
								n="189" type="ms"/>oclock in time for dinner— In the Afternoon I
							took a solitary walk, and <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his Wife</persRef> were here in the Evening—
							<persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth Adams</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull</persRef> were also here— In our ride this morning,
							I had a conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Quincy in which, I
							suggested to him the expediency, of preparing a plan for organizing the
							Observatory with reference to its two distinct objects, first, as an
							Astronomical Observatory, for the assiduous cultivation of the Science
							of Astronomy, and Secondly, as a Branch of the Institution for Education
							of the youths of this Commonwealth— I thought it required a two fold
							organization having reference to both its objects one being the
							cultivation of the Science and the other the instruction of the Students
							at the University. M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Quincy concurred with me, in
							this view, and I intended to have conversed with the President, and him
							together, but we had not time sufficient for it— I spoke of it to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Everett, but the difficulty immediately occurred
							to him of the want of Funds. He said the University had already incurred
							an expense of thirty two thousand dollars in addition to the donations
							which had been applied to this object, and that no provision had yet
							been made for the support of an Observator. There is yet much to be done
							and little encouragement before this Institution can be made to answer
							its complicated purposes—</p>

							“Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of
							witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily
							beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.”
							From some of his preliminary remarks I expected that he was about to
							give us a funeral Discourse, but it did not appear to have reference to
							the decease of any individual, but considered all the persons with whom
							we had been acquainted who have gone to the World of Spirits as
							constituting this cloud of witnesses. M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Morison
							dined with us, and the text of his afternoon Discourse was from John
							4.32. “But he said unto them I have meat to eat, that ye know not of.” I

							seem that it was not enjoyed at least with equal clearness by Eve. He
							asserts the fact as a thing not before known to her and yet he reminds
							her that they have heard these Celestial voices from the “steep of
							echoing hill or thicket, singing their great Creator”— However it may
							have been with Adam. I believe it was but a delusive dream in <pb

							Spiritual Beings I cannot deny nor affirm—as a part of the Christian
							Religion it is a subject of belief, but not of proof and of the present

						<p>Another cold night— Thermometer said to have been in Boston as low as 12.
							Almost unexampled and I suffer with cold accordingly, but I nevertheless

							to him from a gentleman in England containing numerous anecdotes
							concerning many individuals of the emigrations succeeding that of
							<persRef ref="winthrop-john2">Governor Winthrop</persRef> in 1632. and 1634. I heard only a part of this paper
							which prolonged the Session of this day till it was past two oclock—
							Among the Members present were <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">Ex President Josiah Quincy</persRef> and <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">M<hi

							Frothingham’s</persRef> house where I found my wife already in the Carriage at the

							<persRef ref="adams-joseph">Lieut. Joseph. H. Adams</persRef> dined with us. and the former staid with us for

							suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and
							it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto
							them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and
							they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other
							tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance and there were dwelling at
							Jerusalem Jews, devout men out of every nation under Heaven now when
							this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded
							because that every man heard them speak in their own language, and they
							were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another, behold are not all
							these which speak Gallalaeans and how hear we every man in our own
							tongue wherein we were born Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites and the
							dwellers in Mesopotamia and in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia
							Frigia and Pamphilia, in Egypt and in the parts of Lybia about Cyrene
							and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes. Cretes and Arabians we do
							hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God. And they were
							all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this.”
