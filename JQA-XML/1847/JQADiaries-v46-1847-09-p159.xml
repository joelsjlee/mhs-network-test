                        <p>My night’s rest was divided into two parts, the first terminating just
                            before daylight and the second after sunrise, and I had strength this
                            morning to walk round the short Railway Square.— I answered the Letter
                            from <persRef ref="slade-william">William Slade</persRef>, though it
                            will not probably be to his satisfaction— His project is for the
                            improvement of popular Education a very excellent design, but in my
                            apprehension, there is but one improvement, for popular education,
                            desirable for the improvement of man and of his happiness upon Earth,
                            not I fear included, in the operations of M<hi rend="superscript"

                            yet undertaken and I fear will not be for many years, though I cannot
                            doubt, that it will be undertaken and accomplished at some future day— I
                            received also a Letter from <persRef ref="gassett-henry">M<hi

                            different from that which Christian hearers of the present day are
                            called to perform,— Into the historical portion of the text he did not
                            enter very deeply only mentioning that Nehemiah was Cup Bearer of

                            interesting period of the History of the Tribe of <persRef ref="judah"

                            from that of the Ten Tribes otherwise called the Samaritans. It would
                            require a deeper insight into the History of the two Kingdoms than was
                            taken by M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lunt. And among other things it
                            would require a development of the <pb n="162" type="ms"/>rivalship and
                            mutual hatred between the Kingdoms of Judah and of Samaria, to which
                            there is repeated allusion in the new Testament but no full explanation
                            of it given. The Kingdom of Judah was partially restored and the Temple
                            of Jerusalem reconstructed until finally destroyed by the Romans—the
                            Kingdom of Samaria was never restored nor is it known what became of the
                            remnant of the Children of Israel which had separated from the
                            Descendants of Judah— this part of the sacred History is left in great
                            obscurity and there have been Historical inquirers who pretend to
                            discover traces of that people among the Tribes of North American
                            Indians— M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lunts Afternoon Sermon was from
                            Phillippians 4.12. “I know how to abound”—which is only a part of the
                            verse, the whole of which is, “I know both how to be abased, and I know
                            how to abound, everywhere, and in all things, I am instructed, both to
                            be full, and to be hungry, both to abound, and to suffer need.” There
                            was nothing particularly remarkable in this Discourse. I received a

                            in my Carriage to the Church of the Mount Pleasant Congregational

                            the Delegates invited to the ceremony calling over by the <persRef

                            Church at Brookline acting as Scribe— The Churches invited were more
                            numerous than usual; and there were in attendance as many as forty
                            Pastors, each with one lay Delegate— When they were all called over D<hi

                            the ordination it was usual for the person to be ordained to produce
                            some testimonials of his <pb n="166" type="ms"/>qualifications for the
                            Office of the Ministry, but M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Alger
                            observing that he was known to many of the gentlemen in attendance, he
                            had not thought it necessary to obtain any testimonials to his
                            qualifications. No objection however was made to proceeding— D<hi
                                rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pierce then observed that it was also
                            usual, for the person about to be Ordained to give some account of his
                            opinions and the Doctrines of his Faith, and he enquired if any person
                            desired this of M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Alger. A motion was
                            accordingly made that he should be requested to give such an account. An
                            Amendment was proposed to the Motion to substitute the word required
                            instead of requested. And upon taking the vote the word requested was
                            retained— And upon the vote with the word requested the answers in the
                            affirmative and negative were so nearly equal that the moderator
                            declared he was unable to determine on which side the decision had been—
                            He then proposed that those who were for requesting the candidate, to
                            declare his opinions should show their sense by rising in their seats
                            whereupon twenty two members rose. after which the members against
                            making the request rose and they were nine in number. Whereupon D<hi
                                rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pierce declared the majority were in
                            favor of making the request which he accordingly did M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r.</hi> Alger then summed up his Faith in the
                            belief of the existence of a God, the immortality of the Soul, and the
                            responsibility of Man to his Maker in a future World. No further
                            inquiries were made and the vote was immediately taken to proceed to the
                            Ordination. They began with an Anthem, followed by an introductory
                            Prayer by the <persRef ref="huntington-frederick">Rev<hi

                            was then sung, and a Sermon was preached by the <persRef

                            “Who is sufficient for these things”—and his argument was that a
                            minister of the Gospel to be fitted for his Office, should be sufficient
                            for all things— The Sermon was succeeded by the Prayer of Ordination by

                            they closed. The Church was very crowded and the weather oppressively
                            warm. I had been part of the time apprehensive of fainting, but made out
                            to get through and immediately to return home, in the Carriage which

                        <p>I had been apprehensive that the fatigue of attending the Solemnities of
                            the Ordination at the Mount Pleasant Congregational Society at Roxbury
                            would have been too much for my feeble state of health, and would have
                            been followed by a distressed <pb n="168" type="ms"/>and unquiet night.
                            But in this I was favourably disappointed as I had a very quiet night

                            myself ignorant beyond all conception. Even of the difference between
                            flint glass and crown glass, and equally so, of that between Telescopes
                            constructed upon the principles of Catoptics and those of Dioptics <pb
                                n="169" type="ms"/>For the time and opportunity to study all this
                            the remainder of my life is not sufficient— The discoveries in practical
                            Astronomy commencing with that of the Planet Uranus have all been
                            dependent upon the improvement of the Instruments used for Astronomical
                            Observations, that is enlarging by Artificial means the power of the
                            Human eye, and if future discoveries, of the mechanism of the Universe
                            all depend upon the extent to which the power of vision in the bodily
                            frame of man may be enlarged. Of all the senses belonging to man it is
                            by the sight alone that he can form conceptions of the structure of the
                            Universe—from the other senses of Hearing, feeling, Smell, and taste, he
                            can receive no assistance to convey intelligence to the mind and it
                            would seem that his sight can be enlarged only by the means of
                            instruments of glass— Until the year 1785—all the researches of the
                            human mind in Astronomy had only discovered its own delusions respecting
                            the Solar system and its own errors in trusting for thousands of years
                            to the movements of the Heavenly bodies as they appear to the naked
                            eye—all totally different to the ostensible Reports of the daily changes

                            of his Afternoon Sermon was 1. Corinthians 7.31—[“]And they that use
                            this World, as not abusing it”— The Doctrine drawn from this Text was,
                            that this World was made for the use of man, but a Religion and morality
                            were given him to preserve him from abusing it— M<hi rend="superscript"

                            the labor of man. The text of the afternoon was from Hebrews 6.5. “The

                            in this Country as in any part of Europe— The greater number of them are

                            Congress— I was in favor of it myself and gave it what encouragement I
                            could— He bespoke my influence in favor of it still, and entered into
                            some details upon which I told him I could not as yet form any decided
                            opinion but which I should not be found disposed to meet with
                            unreasonable objections— He spent as much as two hours with me in
                            discussing his own peculiar views on the subject, but in favor of which
                            I could only promise a good will— I attended this Evening the Party

                            the Company, with a small portion of which I was personally acquainted;
                            among them some whom I have known from my earliest childhood— We came

                            [“]And he entered again into the Synagogue and there was a man there
                            which had a withered hand”— This was the occasion upon they watched
                            Jesus whether he would heal the man’s withered hand on the Sabbath
                            day—their purpose being to make it a charge against him He did heal the
                            man’s hand and the Pharisees took counsel with the Herodians how they
                            might destroy him. He had in defence of himself laid down as the real
                            law sanctifying, the Sabbath that the sabbath was made for man—and not
                            man for the Sabbath that it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath-day,
                            putting it to them in the form of a question which they dared not
                            answer— He recurred to the example of <persRef ref="david"
                                >David</persRef> whom he considered as justified in a double
                            violation of the Levitical Law, not only by eating to appease his hunger
                            but by taking the shewbread which none but the Priests were obliged to
                            eat. M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lunt did not much enlarge upon this
                            point of view but rather dilated by a description of the great power
                            conferred upon man by the exercise of the hand, and the great abridgment
                            of all the powers of man when deprived of the use of hand— The afternoon
                                <pb n="181" type="ms"/>text was from Matthew 13.18. “Hear ye
                            therefore the parable of the sower.” One of the many Discourses upon
