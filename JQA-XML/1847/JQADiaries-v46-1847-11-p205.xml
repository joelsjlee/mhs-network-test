						<p>I called at the Navy Department to see the <persRef ref="mason-john5">Secretary of the Navy</persRef> but he

							and left a Card for <persRef ref="douglas-stephen">Stephen. A. Douglass</persRef> Senator from the State of

							this Evening to view the moon through the Equatorial if the Sky should
							prove bright. At six oclock P.M. I went accordingly it being the ninth
							day of the Moon and the Sky sufficiently <pb n="214" type="ms"/>clear to
							look at the Moon, but thickning with haze till nothing distinct was to
							be seen and I came home before eight oclock. Lieut Maury promised to
							call on me the first clear Evening. But Astronomical Observation is
							always liable to disappointment from transient clouds— Lieut Maury told
							me that of seventeen Officers attached to the Observatory in 1846
							scarcely one was now left but another set had taken their places. The
							appearance of the Moon as viewed through eye pieces of different
							magnifying power differs totally from its aspect to the naked eye. The
							appearance of the Disk resembles on its surface much to that of a plum
							Cake crusted with sugar. with great and extraordinary irregularities on
							the surface and several <unclear>seeming</unclear> holes going into impenetrable
							darkness. There is nothing resembling water and nothing having an
							appearance of vegetation, the general impression that it gives is of
							lifeless barrenness—the question whether it has any atmosphere remains
							unsettled. <persRef ref="maury-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Maury</persRef> and several ladies and

						<p>Morning walk round 4 1/2 Street Church. I met <persRef ref="clingman-thomas">Thomas. L. Clingman</persRef> a Whig

							Congress <pb n="221" type="ms"/>who lost his election in the 29<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and is now returned again a member elect of the
								30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> I met also <persRef ref="u">Sargent</persRef> of Philadelphia— I had
							received a Letter from him soliciting my vote for him as Clerk of the
							House. I told him I should be glad to vote for him, but my vote was
							pledged. He thought circumstances might occur to modify my intentions,
							to which I assented but said that I never had approved the principle of
							turning out a competent incumbent of public Officers to substitute
							another on Party Principles— He said he knew that but <persRef ref="french-benjamin">French</persRef> himself had
							acted upon other principles— I told him I understood M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> French had been misrepresented on this subject—which French
							told me himself, and that he had been charged with dismissing Officers
							whom he had on the contrary, labored assiduously to retain. It is
							however very apparent that this election of all the Officers of the
							House will be carried by the screws of the Whig Party. I suppose they
							will be applied for <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Matthew St. Clair Clarke</persRef> and there is little chance
							therefore for M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Sargent. He walked with me to the
							door of my house, but declined to come in. I took a ride with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Grand Daughter</persRef> this Evening. We had no visitors— I received a Letter
							from <persRef ref="hill-gw">G. W. Hill</persRef> of Ashland Ohio full of political speculations to which
							he requests my answer. I began but did not finish a Letter to <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">Elisha
