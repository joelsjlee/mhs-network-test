                us to the observatory where we found the observer William Cranch Bond and his Son
                George C Bond—but the Perkins professor of mathematics &amp; astronomy was not
                there— The great Frauenhofer Refractor or equatorial was completely mounted on its
                stone pier, but not yet provided with a swinging chair for the observer— There is
                one making for him at present— There is also a large transit instrument to be
                received from Simmes at London, its object glass having proved defective, requiring
