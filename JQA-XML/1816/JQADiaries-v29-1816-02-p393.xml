							I walked with George, round through Gunnersbury Acton and Ealing; as we

								>Foster’s</persRef> fourth and last Essay, on the Causes which have

						<p><date>3. V:30. </date>The day was employed upon the Journal, and sufficed

								>We</persRef> took an early dinner, and went into Town, taking
								<persRef ref="adams-charles2;adams-john2;adams-george">our three

								Smith</persRef> was gone out— I left the Packets of desptaches and
							Letters for America, and took several Letters, which I found there upon
							the table for me— We went to the Sans Pareil Theatre in the Strand; and
							saw Love in a Vintage, a sort of Ballet— The Inscription, a Melo-drame
							in Rhyme, and The Witch and the Owl a Pantomime with a Harlequin, better
							than that which we saw on Monday, at Covent-Garden— The Theatre is small
							but handsome— The performances indifferent. The house was very thin. In

								<persRef ref="chad-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							East-Indies, on the expectation that the indirect trade in American
							Vessels, with India was stipulated for in the Commercial Convention of
							3. July 1815. But on the publication of the Convention, he had doubts,
							as there was a regulation of the British Government in India, in the
							year 1811. excluding all American Vessels, unless direct, from the
							United States— He therefore requests M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Beasley to apply to <persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Lord
								Bathurst’s</persRef> Office, for information, whether the two
							Vessels will be admitted, and to write to the Supercargoes at Cowes and
							at Leghorn, according to the answer he may receive. But M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Beasley, knowing the difficulty of
							obtaining the information from the British Government, applies for it to
							me— From <persRef ref="maury-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							finished— The most remarkable part of it was the performance of several
							airs upon the flute, by a boy named <persRef ref="u">Stebbing</persRef>,
							only four years old— We got home about half past twelve.— Visits from

						<p><date>9. VII:15. </date>On rising this Morning I found it impossible to

							above 0—equal to -11. of <persRef ref="reaumur-rene">Reaumur</persRef>—
							The sky was clear and during the day the Snow thawed in the Sun. I began
							reading the file of National Intelligencers yesterday received, and they
							absorbed the day until my walking hour before dinner. I went round
							through Hanwell and Ealing. I received yesterday a second Note from the
								<persRef ref="murray-charlotte2">Countess Dowager of

							complaints against two of his Captains, who arrived there last Summer,
							and who avoided consigning their Cargoes to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Montreal’s house.— Bussche’s Letter is also complaining— He
							says that his Westphalian Mission to Russia, has been the occasion of
							disgracing him in the mind of his Sovereign, the <persRef
								ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef> of England; that it has
							exposed him to many troubles and afflictions; and that he has written to
							the Hanoverian Minister here <persRef ref="munster-ernst">Count

							favour, and has referred him to my testimony, with regard to his real
							Sentiments while he was in Russia. He requests me to say of him what I

								ref="neumann-philipp">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Neumann</persRef> the Secretary of the Embassy was at home and I saw
							him— He shewed me the despatch from his Government to the Prince,
							respecting the ships at Venice, which they propose to sell to the
							American Government— And the list of the ships— I told him that I had
							already heard something upon the subject, from <persRef
								ref="bollmann-justus">D<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
								Bollmann</persRef>, to whom <persRef ref="metternick-klemons">Prince
								Metternich</persRef> had made the offer of the sale of three of

							Bollmann was now in America, and in answer to the Communications made
							through him, I had been instructed to say that they were received with
							pleasure by the Government of the United States, who would be happy to
							cultivate the most friendly relations with Austria. That the proposals
							would be considered with attention, and the views of the American
							Government concerning them be made known hereafter. I told Neumann that
							I had only Bollmann’s verbal authority, for what Prince Metternich had
							said to him <pb n="396" type="ms"/>and he had told me the Prince had
							made it as a confidential proposal, and requested that it might be kept
							secret— Neumann looked over his despatch again, and told me that it was
							so— He had not observed it before, but he now perceived that secrecy was
							enjoined. I desired him to write to his Government, and ask them to fix
							the prices at which they would dispose of the Ships— He promised to send
							me a copy of the proposals as they were, in German, and I asked him to
							send a French or English Translation with the original— I told him that
							I wished to be presented to the <persRef
								ref="johnarchdukeaustria;louisarchdukeaustria">Archdukes John and
								Lewis</persRef>, who are now here, particularly as I had received an
							invitation from the Lord Mayor, to dine on the 19<hi rend="superscript"

							mentioned that I had been acquainted at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Petersburg with <persRef ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Julien</persRef> who accompanies
							them. He sent to their house which is only a few doors from the
							Ambassador’s, to enquire if they or Count S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
							Julien were at home; but they were gone out. He said he would inform me
							by a Note, a day or two before hand, when they would receive me, and
							whether in full dress or otherwise— I told him that when they first
							arrived I had heard, I time had been appointed at which the other
							foreign Ministers were presented to them; but I was then confined to my
							house by illness, and had besides received no notice of the
							presentation— Probably because I was not in town— He said a notification
							had certainly been sent to me, but I have no doubt he was mistaken. He
							said the dinner at the Mansion house would be a dinner of parade. From
							him I went to the Bookseller, <persRef ref="booth-john"
								>Booth’s</persRef> and took a Catalogue and some Books— Thence to
							the Westminster Library, Jermyn Street; where I left <persRef
								ref="foster-john3">Foster’s</persRef> Essays, and took the last
							year’s Monthly Reviews. Then I called at <persRef ref="apthorp-g">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							G. W. Apthorp’s</persRef> lodgings in the Strand, but he was not at home. It was
							three O’Clock by the time when I reached my Office— I ordered the
							Coachman to leave the Stables at 5 O’Clock, and overtake me on the
							Brentford Road— I made up for the <persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary

								ref="price-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stephen
								Price</persRef>; who is to go next Monday for Liverpool to embark

							Gentleman and <persRef ref="u">his brother</persRef> to come out and
							dine with us to-morrow; but they are both engaged. M<hi

							salary. He had no order upon any person here to receive it— And he has
							no arrangement with the Government, with respect to the time from which
							it is to commence— He says he does not intend to stay here long, as he
							can do much better at New-York, by his Profession— I gave him an order
							upon the <persRef ref="baringbrothers">Brothers Baring &amp; C<hi

							Quarter’s Salary. It was half past four when I left the Office, and the

								<persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cooke</persRef> had

							stopped only a few minutes— He told me that he should publish to-morrow,
							a statement of facts, relative to the order which he received about a

							nothing to complain of in the conduct of this Government—<persRef
								ref="jenkinson-robert">Liverpool</persRef> and Castlereagh had both
							behaved very handsomely to him. But the jealousy and hatred of the
							French Government towards every thing English was inconceivable. He said
							there would immediately be published a Volume of Letters written in
							Paris by <persRef ref="hobhouse-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hobhouse</persRef> which would give a very accurate account of the
							state of things in France— I then told him that I had called upon his

							person, by the name of <persRef ref="dana-william">William Pulteney
								Dana</persRef>— Perhaps he, himself could— He said yes— He was a
							kinsman of their family— Son of <persRef ref="dana-edmund3"
								>Clergyman</persRef> in Shropshire— But what was the object of my
							enquiry? He hoped he had not been doing any mischief— No certainly—no
							mischief— But he had been some years since in America; had married
							there; and left a <persRef ref="dana-ann">daughter</persRef>, now about
							eleven years old, who had not heard from him for several years, and in
							behalf of whom I was requested to make these enquiries— He said that he
							or his brother could in the course of a day or two give me all the
							information that could be desired. I gave him <persRef
								ref="galloway-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Galloway’s</persRef> Letter, observing that I had no personal
							acquaintance with that Gentleman, some of whose observations I thought
							might as well have been omitted— But he would excuse them in
							consideration of the main object, which was to serve the young Lady.— He
							said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dana was a very Strange,
							eccentric and obstinate man. That he had given a great deal of trouble
							to the family; who had never been able to do any thing with him; and
							that he was very poor— He promised to return me M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Galloway’s Letter in a day or two, with a Note of all the

							change some books for <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi

							Agent’s in Bond Street, and enquired the Rent of a House in Grosvenor

							Guineas— It was too much, and I declined taking a ticket to see the
							house—the man said there was a very good house in Devonshire Street to
							let for 650 Guineas. I told him I did not wish to exceed 400— Perhaps
							you may find such a house, said he, in Gloucester Place, <pb n="398"
								type="ms"/>or in Baker Street. I then went and paid a visit to
								<persRef ref="bourke-edmund">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="bourke-maria">his Lady</persRef>, would go to the
								<persRef ref="wood-matthew">Lord Mayor’s</persRef> dinner next
							Monday— He said no— And he doubted whether he should go himself— Nothing
							could be more disagreeable then those parties— It was a mere scramble.—
							He had been the year before last, at the dinner on Lord Mayor’s day, and
							was fully determined never to go there again— The foreign Ministers were
							not treated with common civility— They were seated at a third Table;
							below the subalterns of the Public-Offices. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bourke shewed me his collection of Miniature Pictures of all
							the kings to whom he has been accredited, and from whom he received them
							as presents— He said they had almost all been dethroned. They were the

							present <persRef ref="ferdinand-i">king of Naples</persRef> the last and
							present <persRef ref="gustav-iv;charles-xiii">kings of Sweden</persRef>,
							and of <persRef ref="bonaparte-joseph;ferdinand-vii">Spain</persRef>.
							and the present, or rather late <persRef ref="george-ii">king of
								Great-Britain</persRef>— He spoke particularly of Ferdinand, the
							present king of Spain, and said that strange as his conduct appeared, he
							was very much beloved in Spain— He said that some time ago, he, and
							Fernan-Nuñez had to sign a Treaty— And it was a long time before Fernan
							Nuñez would sign it in French— He said they had abolished the French
							language in Spain; and finally agreed to sign it in French, only because
							Bourke offered him as the alternative to sign it, both in Spanish and
							Danish, or in Latin— From M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourke’s I went
							and called at <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="wood-maria">Lady Mayoress</persRef>, to the <persRef
								ref="johnarchdukeaustria">Archdukes John</persRef> and <persRef

							of State— The <persRef ref="esterhazy-paul">Austrian

								ref="freire-cipriano">Portugal</persRef>, <persRef

							rest of the company, consisted of <persRef
								ref="byng-george;byng-frances">Lord and Lady Torrington</persRef>,
							and the Aldermen and other City Officers; their wives and daughters.
							About sixty sat down to table. <persRef ref="braham-john">M<hi

							and <persRef ref="perry-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Perry</persRef>, Editor of the Morning Chronicle, I suppose to
							publish an account of the Entertainment— The dinner was good— The wines
							generally indifferent. Several singular City usages were observed— The
							preliminary to the drinking of the Toasts was by two large gold or gilt
							cups being brought, and the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress drank from them
							to the health of all their company, a clerk or Steward behind the Lord
							mayor, addressing by name all the principal guests, and announcing <pb
								n="400" type="ms"/>that the Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress drank
							to them all, in “loving Cups.”— The same Cups were then passed round, to
							all the company, and every guest in turn drank from them— Two Basons and
							Ewers were afterwards brought, and passed round in the same way to all
							the company— Rose-water was poured into the Bason from year; and every
							guest in turn, after the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress, dipped a corner
							of his napkin into the bason, and wiped his lips— Then came the toasts,
							the paper of which was given to the Duke of Kent, who arranged their
							order— The <persRef ref="george-iii">King</persRef>—the <persRef
								ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef>—The <persRef
								ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef> and Royal Family—The <persRef
								ref="francis-i">Emperor of Austria</persRef>. The Archdukes John and
							Lewis, successively—The Duke of Kent—The <persRef ref="alexander-i"
								>Emperor of Russia</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="frederick-william-iii">king of Prussia</persRef> whose
							Ministers were not present. (This toast was given by Prince Esterhazy,
							the Austrian Ambassador.) The <persRef ref="maximilian-i">king of
								Bavaria</persRef>—the <persRef ref="frederick-i-wurttemburg">King of
								Wurtemberg</persRef>; the <persRef ref="john-vi">Prince Regent of
								Portugal</persRef>, and the United States of America— At these
							toasts, all except the first, there were cheers of three times three.—
							After the first Braham sung God save the King.— And after the Queen and
							Royal family, another Song— For this time Rule Britannia was omitted. At
							the four or five first toasts, the Steward behind the Lord Mayor,
							repeated the call of names of the guests, and announced the toast— The
							Ladies then retired; after which the Lord Mayor announced some of the
							toasts and the Duke of Kent the others. When the Archduke John was
							given, he gave in return the Lord Mayor, and the City of London; the
							Archduke Louis, (by Prince Esterhazy) the Duke of York and the British
							Army— The Duke of Kent gave the Lady Mayoress— The Bavarian Minister, in
							return for his king’s health, the British Nation, which assists all
							Nations. The Wurtemberg Minister, permanency to the general Peace—the
							Portuguese Minister, the <persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of
								Wellington</persRef> and the British Army in Portugal— The Duke of
							Kent gave the United States of America, and perpetuity to the Friendship
							between Great-Britain and them. on which addressing the Lord Mayor, I
							said that sensibly affected as I was by the honour done by his Royal
							Highness to my Country by the toast he had given, it was impossible for
							me to do more than to echo the sentiment he had expressed— I would ask
							leave therefore to offer in a two fold manner, the earnest wish I
							entertained—that between the antient and the new hemisphere there may
							henceforth be no division other than that of the ocean; and that the
							harmony between Great-Britain and the United States may be as lasting as
							the language and the principles common to both. This was very well
							received, and the company immediately afterwards rose in good humour
							from table. The company passed then into the Egyptian Hall, where there
							was a Ball; of four or five hundred persons— I met a <persRef
								ref="sharp-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sharp</persRef>,
							whom I had seen last Summer at <persRef ref="grey-charles">Earl
								Grey’s</persRef>, and who now told me that he had just obtained a
							Seat in Parliament. I had some conversation with him, and with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Perry; It was about two in the Morning
							when I left the Mansion House— There was an important debate in both
							Houses of Parliament, this Evening; upon the Treaties—which was the
							cause why all the Ministers of State, and almost all the members of both
							houses were absent— I stopped at Craven Street, to take the things I had
							left there; and it was half past three in the morning when I reached
							home— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> was up, waiting for me— She had sent an

						<p><date>24. VI:15. </date>Immediately after Breakfast, I went into London,
							and went with <persRef ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> to Freemason’s Hall, and attended the publick
							exhibition of a <persRef ref="matheson-john">M<hi rend="superscript"

								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							<persRef ref="u">Service</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
								>Studley</persRef> were desirous of introducing in America. We found
							Studley there. The meeting was not very fully attended; nor by persons
							apparently of much note. There were a number of boys and girls from ten
							to fifteen years of age, stationed in little boxes on both sides of and
							maintaining a sort of forensic dispute upon the question, of preference
							between Public and Private Education. They all spoke exactly alike; with
							the same tone, and the same gestures— The debate was all obviously
							written by one hand—in a mean, but pedantic Style— The common-place
							arguments on this hacknied topic were adduced, leaving the scale of
							course to preponderate in favour of the Public side. The manner of the
							Speaking was in many respects very good—there was no monotony in the
							delivery of any one Speaker, but they were speaking machines all cast in
							one mould— Their pronunciation was all in the lowest vulgarity of the
							Cockney Style, turning every v <pb n="402" type="ms"/>into a w, dropping
							the aspirate where it should be used, and using it where it should be
							dropped, and crowding together the syllables so as to suppress the
							utterance of more than half the vowels— After taxing my patience for
							about an hour, I left the Hall, with the disputants still in the midst
							of the discussion, and one of the girls, holding forth upon the
							Advantages of Public lower Private-Education. There were specimens of
							Penmanship hung round the room, which gave me no better opinion of M<hi

							gave me of his Rhetoric— I called at the Stationer <persRef ref="u"

							in Charing-Cross; where I took the Annual Register’s for 1812. 13. and

								Connell</persRef> came in— Soon afterwards, and while he was there a

								ref="swett-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Swett’s</persRef>
							lodgings, N. 15. Bucklersbury. He came down to the Carriage— I left with

							of Epping, New-Hampshire, with <persRef ref="chalmers-george"
								>Chalmers’s</persRef> political Annals of the Colonies, which at his

								Oliver</persRef> of Baltimore, who has just returned from his tour
							to Ireland— He gave me a slip from an American Newspaper, containing an

							the House of Representatives of the United States— I enquired of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r:</hi> Alexander Baring, whether they had any
							advices from the Treasury Department since I had seen him— He said they
							had none— He spoke of the Bill for establishing a Bank, and doubted
							whether it would succeed. There was such great care taken of the Public
							interest, in the Bill, that there was nothing left, as inducement to
							Subscribers— There was too much controul over the Bank given to the
							Government, and there was a special provision made for the manner in
							which Specie payments might be suspended which had not a good
							appearance. I mentioned to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baring the
							Orders which I had lately given to the Consuls, upon their House, to
							defray the expence at London and Liverpool of relieving and sending home
							destitute American Seamen; and told him of the drafts which I expected

							Petersburg, and for which I should in that case be obliged to give

							the close of the year were not quite made up; as soon as they should be,
							they would send them to me. We had some Conversation upon the topics now
							in discussion in Parliament of which he is a member— I took instead of a
							draft £500 in Bank Bills, and signed triplicate receipts for it,
							chargeable upon the diplomatic fund— From M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Baring’s I walked back to Craven Street where I found <persRef

								ref="bourne-sylvanus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bourne</persRef> the Consul at Amsterdam was so ill, that he would

							secret Missions—to France, to Spain—to any where— He was going down into
							the City, and I took him with me, as far, as opposite to the Mansion
							House when he left me— But I see he means to try another siege, for he

							Company, and other Gentlemen. <persRef ref="sharp-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sharp</persRef> was likewise there.
							The Company consisted of about fifty persons, nearly half of whom were
							Ladies— I was the only foreign Minister, and I believe the only
							foreigner present— Lord Holland apologized for not having returned my
							visit, but I told him I resided out of town— He recollected having seen
							me in 1800 at Dresden, which he said he supposed I had forgotten, though
							I certainly had not— The Prime Warden told me that the Company of
							Fishmongers would themselves give a dinner before long at their Hall, to
							which they should invite me— The dinner this day, was much like that to
							the <persRef ref="johnarchdukeaustria;louisarchdukeaustria"
								>Archdukes</persRef>; though not quite so formal— The loving Cups,
							and the Rosewater passed round in the same manner after dinner, and the
							toasts were announced in the same manner.— The American Minister was
							given next after the Duke’s of Kent and Sussex; and my own toast at the
							former dinner was repeated verbatim, by the Duke of Kent— In thanking
							the Lord Mayor for the honour done me by the toast, as well as by his
							friendly invitation to this social meeting, I reminded him of the
							observation made by a distinguished and ingenious traveller in the
							United States; a foreigner. He had remarked that from the moment when an
							Englishman landed in the United States, he still found himself at home;
							while a foreigner of every other Nation, whatever length of time he
							resided in America, still felt himself a stranger— It was my earnest
							wish that the first part of this observation might ever prove to be
							true, and I would add the hope that it might also prove reciprocal— I
							would say therefore, may every Briton who sets his foot in America, and
							every American who visits England, still find himself at home— This was
							very well received; though not so remarkably well, as my former toast;
							perhaps because according to the regular etiquette of these symposiacs
							my toast this time ought to have been, the Lord Mayor, and the City of
							London— The Duke of Kent when toasted gave the <persRef ref="wood-maria"
								>Lady Mayoress</persRef>— The Duke of Sussex, <persRef ref="u">Miss
								Wood</persRef>. The Marquis of Lansdowne, Lord Holland, and Lord
							Erskine, Sir Edward Hamilton, the Prime Warden, and the Company of
							Fishmongers, were all toasted, and the Lords and Gentlemen, all returned
							thanks with short Speeches. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sharp told me
							that he had not yet taken his seat in Parliament, because the Writ was
							not returned. He also told me that my father had sent him a copy of my
							Lectures. The Duke of <pb n="404" type="ms"/>Sussex was in fine Spirits,
							and recollected many circumstances which had occurred while we were at
							Berlin. He frequently mingled the Political topics of the day in his
							Conversation, and pronounced his decided opposition to the continuance
							of the property tax and to the proposed large military Establishment. He
							offered himself to present any petition against the property tax to the
							house of Peers, and almost canvassed to be made a member of the
							Fishmongers Company— All the noblemen present are members (honorary) of
							the company; and so are the <persRef ref="williamfrederick">Duke of
								Gloucester</persRef>, and <persRef ref="jervis-john">Earl S<hi
									rend="superscript">t:</hi> Vincents</persRef>. both of whom had
							been invited to the dinner, but sent excuses, the Duke having lost a
							near Relation, and Lord S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Vincent had met
							with some accident— The Duke of Kent was more reserved than his brother
							and talked no Politics at all. He told however some humorous anecdotes
							about the Duke of Sussex, and said that he had been intended first for
							the Navy, and afterwards for the Church. He was to have been Bishop of
							Durham; but they set him to write a Sermon, to see what his disposition
							for the Church was, and instead of a Sermon, he produced a composition
							of a very different kind— The duke of Kent appealed to him to say
							himself if it was not so— He answered that he had certainly no vocation
							for the Church. He said to me that he prided himself especially upon the
							stability of his Sentiments, and asked me, if I did not find him
							precisely the same man, that I had known him at Berlin sixteen years
							ago. I assured him that I was very confident his name would never appear
							in the Dictionnaire des Girouettes— The Duke holds forth, a little too
							much of his opposition; and he appears too much occupied with himself.
							He said he heard they had been caricaturing him— He had not seen the
							Caricature, but he was told they had represented him standing on the
							tomb of <persRef ref="charles-i">Charles the first</persRef>, singing
							Psalms— The last part he had no particular predilection for; but he
							broadly hinted that he did not disapprove the execution of Charles the
							first.— One of his toasts was, may our family never forget the
							principles which placed us in the Situation which we hold in this
							Country; which of course was received with great applause— Lord Holland
							was toasted, as the nephew of <persRef ref="fox-charles">Charles
								Fox</persRef>, and Lord Erskine, with Trial by Jury— Lord Holland is
							yet a popular champion, but Erskine has become a pliable Courtier; he
							answered feebly the toast to him, and his answer was received with faint
							applause. Lord Holland said that as the nephew of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fox, there was no merit in him for
							adhering to his principles—but it would make him doubly contemptible if
							he should abandon them—which was received with high approbation— As soon
							as the Duke of Sussex withdrew, I left the Mansion House; and after
							calling at Craven Street, reached home about half past one in the
							Morning.</p>

							although the Petitions against it have at length become numerous, and
							from important bodies, there is a coldness and languor in the
							proceedings of the opposition to it, which indicate something hollow.
							The Ministers are pushed very hard upon it just at this time; but they
							appear inflexible in the determination to carry it. There is likewise
							much clamour about the supposed distress of the Country, and most
							especially of the farmers; but the complaints deal much in generalities—
							And there are strong facts indicating on the contrary a great general
