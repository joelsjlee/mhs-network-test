						<p><date>1. VII. </date>I wrote a note to <persRef ref="delreal-jose">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> del Real</persRef>, proposing to
							receive him at 3. O’Clock this day at Craven Street. Walked in to London
							in two hours and 31 minutes, leaving orders for the Carriage to come
							with <persRef key="adams-george">George</persRef>, and to be at the
							Office, at a quarter past six. On arriving in town, I found a Letter,
							(printed) from <persRef ref="freeling-francis">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Francis Freeling</persRef>, Secretary of the
							Post-Office, returning me two Letters which had been sent to the foreign
							Post-Office, without payment of the Postage. One of them was to <persRef
								ref="harris-levett">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef>
							at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg, which had been opened;
							the other was to <persRef ref="simpson-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Simpson</persRef> the Consul at Morocco, which having been sent at
							the same time, under the same Seal, and superscribed in the same hand
								(<persRef ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith’s</persRef>) was by special favour sent back with the Seal
							unbroken— The omission to pay the Postage, had been an accidental
							inattention. This is the second time that such an accident has happened,
							and it has been fortunate that the Letters opened were of no importance—
							A Letter from <persRef ref="henrynodinandco">Henry Nodin and C<hi
									rend="superscript">o.</hi></persRef> requesting a Passport from
							me, for a <persRef ref="baxter-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Richard Baxter</persRef>, a British Subject, to go to the United
							States— I desired M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith to inform the
							person applying in this case, that no Passport was necessary or proper
							for me to give to a British Subject.— From the frequency of such
							applications to me, I incline strongly to the belief that they do at the
							Alien-Office, make use of their powers over aliens, to obstruct the
							departure of British Subjects, by suffering them at least to believe,
							that they must have Passports to go to America— A Letter from <persRef
								ref="woolsey-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. M.
								Woolsey</persRef> at Liverpool, complaining that an entry had been
							refused by the <persRef ref="swainson-john">Collector of the
								Customs</persRef> there, to certain tobacco, because the <persRef
								ref="gibbons-james">Collector at Richmond</persRef> had certified
							that the Master of the vessel in which it was ship, had been <hi
								rend="italic">qualified</hi>, to the Manifest; instead of saying
							that he had been <hi rend="italic">sworn</hi> to it. The Act of
							Parliament requiring that the Manifest should be sworn to, at the place
							of shipment. The Master had taken an Oath, before a Magistrate at
							Liverpool, that he had <pb n="438" type="ms"/>sworn to his Manifest, at
							Richmond; not withstanding which, the Collector at Liverpool, refused to
							allow the entry of the tobacco. I immediately addressed a Note to
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, on the
							subject, and answered M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woolsey’s Letter.—
							It was only a quarter before seven, when the Carriage with George
							arrived, and I was afraid of being belated at the dinner— Just then came
							in a Frenchman named <persRef ref="u">Thibert</persRef>, who is about
							publishing a new French Grammar, and has made repeated applications to
							obtain my subscription or patronage, which I have as often declined;
							having been surfeited with new Systems of French Grammar— He enquired
							for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith—who was gone out to dinner— I
							left him with George to wait for Smith—dressed and went immediately to
								S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> James’s Palace, to the <persRef
								ref="william">Duke of Clarence’s</persRef> Apartments; and dined
							with the <persRef ref="leopold2">Prince of Saxe-Coburg</persRef>. 30
							[symbols] All the foreign Ambassadors and Ministers were there— The
								<persRef ref="venables-edward">Archbishop of York</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="howley-william">Bishop of London</persRef>; <persRef
								ref="cholmondeley-george">Marquis of Cholmondeley</persRef> the Lord
							Steward, <persRef ref="beresford-george">Lord George
							Beresford</persRef>, <persRef ref="chester-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi> Chester</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="u">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Hardenbrock</persRef>, the
							Prince’s Cavaller, or Gentleman— The Prince is a tall, well formed,
							handsome man, modest and reserved in his deportment, wearing as easily
							as could be expected the new and extraordinary fortune that has befallen
							him.— The transition from the condition of a third Son, to a petty
							German Prince, whose whole dominions scarcely surpass the extent of an
							English manor; and from the rank of a Captain of Cavalry in the Russian
							service, to the office of husband to the presumptive heiress of the
							British Realms, is one of those vicissitudes in human life, which every
							head would not be of strength to bear— The Prince has nothing of
							arrogance in his manner— He shews nothing of an elated Spirit— But there
							is a point of view from which a proud Spirit, with a delicate sense of
							honour must perceive something to discolour at least in part the
							flattering complexion of his present state— There is an apparent
							consciousness of this nature in his manners, which though different from
							the perfect ease of greatness familiar with itself, is neither unnatural
							nor absolutely unbecoming. He was polite and attentive to all his
							company, and especially to the German Ministers, of whom there were six
							present. He spoke a few words to me in English; enquired how long I had
							been in this Country, and observed that he spoke English very
							imperfectly himself, but hoped to acquire it soon— There was a crowd of
							People collected in Stable yard, before the windows of the chamber in
							which the Company were received before dinner.— They shouted
							occasionally to make him shew himself, and he went out once or twice on
							the balcony to be seen; stood two or three minutes and then came in
							again. I was luckily not the latest person that arrived; <persRef
								ref="vonberoldingen-joseph">Count Beroldingen</persRef> the Minister
							of Wurtemberg came a few minutes after me— The dinner was then
							immediately announced— There was turtle Soup, Venison and Strawberries;
							with other dishes more in Season— The wines, were merely good. I sat
							between the Danish Minister <persRef ref="bourke-edmund">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourke</persRef>, and the Archbishop
							of York, whom I found very ready in conversation, and very agreeable. He
							mentioned several particulars of the present situation of the <persRef
								ref="george-iii">king</persRef>; being one of the <persRef
								ref="charlotte2">Queen’s</persRef> Council, for the guardianship of
							his Person— He has been for nearly five years confined to two or three
							Chambers in Windsor Castle— His bodily health is good— His appetite
							regular, and the Archbishop says he considers him, as the best life, of
							his age in the kingdom. He is blind, but immediately recognizes by the
							voice every person whom he has known. His principal amusement is music—
							Playing upon a bad Piano, which he has in one of his chambers. He is
							attentive to the neatness of his person, to great excess— He had for
							sometime a long white beard, but is now regularly shaved— The Archbishop
							spoke slightingly of the form of Prayer, now used in the Churches for
							the king’s recovery, which he said you must read almost through before
							you could discover what it was about. But he said when it had been drawn
							up and prescribed by the <persRef ref="mannerssutton-charles">Archbishop
								of Canterbury</persRef>, it had been expected that the king’s
							illness would last only a few weeks— The prayer is indeed neither sense
							nor grammar— Nor can any one discover from it, what it is about— It
							implores that God would restore the king to his family and his
							People—and then puts the case whether this great calamity, with which we
							are afflicted shall be removed or still suspended over us— The
							Archbishop spoke of the Society for the propagation of the gospel, and
							of the Bible Society— Of his Office as Archbishop, and his Office as
							Lord High Almoner, in which capacity, and not in the other, he is to be
							present at the marriage to-morrow— He told us that the sum which he has
							to distribute as Lord High Almoner, is about £2400 a year; two thirds of
							which was distributed in small pensions to poor widows; which he had
							limited to the widows of Officers in the army or navy or of Clergymen—
							The rest was given out in silver pieces of one, two three and four penny
							silver pieces, which were coined at the mint for that single purpose— He
							shewed us several of the four penny pieces which he had in his pocket—
							The dinner was of about two hours duration, and the company returned to
							the Drawing Room to Coffee for about a Quarter of an hour. And all
							retired at once before ten O’Clock— I went to Craven-Street, changed my
							Dress; and then called at <persRef ref="saunders-prince">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanders’s</persRef> lodgings for
							George— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanders came out and urged me so
							strongly to go in and join his party for a short time that I could not
							refuse— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith was there, a company of
							seven or eight young men: part of them at Cards, and the rest in
							Conversation— Between eleven and twelve, a handsome Supper was served—
							It was near one in the morning when we came away, and between two and
							three when we reached home— We came back by Acton road.</p>

						<p><date>2. IX. </date>Marriage of the <persRef ref="charlotte">Princess

							could write nothing but an answer to the invitation from the
							Fishmonger’s Company to dine with them at their Hall on the 23<hi
								rend="superscript">d</hi> of this month— At 3 in the afternoon I

								Adams</persRef>, <persRef key="adams-george">George</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="hauel-lucy">Lucy</persRef> overtook me, a mile beyond

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> King’s</persRef> Lodgings at N. 60 Conduit Street— I
							walked down to Craven-Street, to enquire if we could have lodgings there
							for the Night; but <persRef ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Smith</persRef> was not there— I returned to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> King’s, where we dined— And at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> King’s
							invitation we accepted a lodging there. Just at eight o’Clock we went to
							Carleton House, which we reached without difficulty; although the
							Streets from Picadilly, and particularly Pall-Mall, were thronged with
							immense Crowds of People— The company to be present at the nuptial
							Ceremony were collecting until about nine O’Clock in an Apartment called
							the crimson Room. There were perhaps two hundred persons present— The
							Royal Family—the Cabinet Ministers, the Foreign Ambassadors and
							Ministers—The Household Officers—and all their Ladies—The <persRef
								ref="mannerssutton-charles">Archbishops of Canterbury</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="venables-edward">York</persRef>—And the <persRef
								ref="howley-william">Bishops of London</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="fisher-john">Salisbury</persRef>— About nine the <persRef
									ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef> and <persRef ref="augustasophia;elizabeth;sophia;mary2">Princesses</persRef> came in—followed by
							the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef>, and soon
							afterwards by the parties to be married— The Service was read remarkably
							well, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the responses were very
							distinctly and audibly made by the <persRef ref="leopold2"
								>Prince</persRef> and Princess— After the Ceremony they both kneeled
							to the Prince Regent, and to the Queen— They immediately afterwards went
							away, in a Travelling Chariot, to the <persRef ref="frederickaugustus"
								>Duke of York’s</persRef> Country Seat at Oatlands; about twenty
							miles from London, where they are to pass a week or ten days. The Queen
							and the rest of the company remained.— And about an hour after the
							ceremony was over the Queen and the Prince Regent walked <pb n="439"
								type="ms"/>round the Circle, after which the Queen retired, to a
							party at Cards in another Apartment.— There were refreshments served at
							a Side Board.— Cold Sandwiches—Wedding Cake—Limonade,
							Orange-water—Wines, and Ardent Spirits— <persRef
								ref="esterhazy-nicholas">Prince Esterhazy</persRef> the father took
							with some effort of complacency, a glass of Cherry-Brandy. The Dukes of
							York, <persRef ref="william">Clarence</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="edward">Kent</persRef> were there; the <persRef ref="frederica"
								>Duchess of York</persRef>—the <persRef ref="augustasophia"

						<p><date>3. VIII:30. </date>We had just breakfasted, when <persRef

							him, from her Captain, <persRef ref="u">Fitzgerald</persRef>, to justify

								<persRef ref="georgeandjamesabelandco">George and James

							written to me before. One from <persRef ref="boyd-george">M<hi

							concerning which he wishes me to make enquiries— And one from <persRef
								ref="fox-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fox</persRef>, the
							Consul at Falmouth, relating to the Ship Baltimore and her Seamen. I
							walked immediately down to the Office in Craven Street; and soon after
							came in a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>who arrived yesterday
							from New-York— He brought me three despatches from the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef>— Two of March 9.
							respecting the William and Mary, taken at Cadix, about which I have
							already been much occupied; and respecting another Mary and Cargo, taken
							and condemned in the Island of Jamaica— And one of 19. March.
							instructing me to apply to this Government, for permission to export
							Rollers for the use of the Mint of the United States. There was also a
							file of National Intelligencers from the beginning of the year, to the
								19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March—and an enclosed Letter
							from <persRef ref="nicholas-wilson">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wilson Cary Nicholas</persRef>, the Governor of Virginia, requesting
							me to enquire, and let him know upon what terms, a civil Engineer,
							capable of designing and superintending improvements of rivers, roads
							and Canals, could be engaged to go to Virginia, to prosecute works of
							that kind, which the Legislature of that Commonwealth at their late
							Session, have provided funds, for commencing and carrying on— I enquired

								ref="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef>
							and his family had arrived in the United States, before he sailed— He

								<persRef ref="wellesleypole-katherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs:</hi> Wellesley-Pole</persRef>, <persRef ref="bagot-mary"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bagot’s</persRef> Mother, who
							was extremely anxious at not having heard of her arrival— She had
							earnestly desired me, if I should hear of their arrival, to give her
							notice of it; which I had promised; and assured her it should be within
							ten days; and I hoped within three— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> came with the Carriage at two O’Clock— We went
							immediately to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Wellesley-Pole’s house—
							She was just gone out to see her daughter, <persRef ref="somerset-emily"
								>Lady Fitzroy Somerset</persRef>— We left cards, and I directed her
							Servant who came to the door, to inform her that I had called to tell
							her of the safe arrival of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot and his
							family at Washington— 1 [symbols] We then went, and had our names
							written at Camelford House, for the <persRef ref="leopold2;charlotte"
								>Prince and Princess of Saxe-Coburg</persRef>, at Buckingham House
							for the <persRef ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef>; and at Carleton House
							for the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef>— It was for
							this formality that we had remained in town over Night. <persRef
								ref="chester-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chester</persRef> had told me that it would be a proper mark of
							attention. As I went into the Antichamber at Carleton House to write our
							names, I found <persRef ref="walpole-horatio">Lord Walpole</persRef>
							there upon the same business. I had not seen him since I left S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg— I spoke to him, and as he
							appeared not to recognize me, mentioned my name— He said without moving
							a muscle of his face—“you’ve grown fatter”; and having written his name,
							went out, without making me any salutation— As he had been introduced to
							me at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg, at his own request
							while our two Countries were at War; and as he had always been very
							civil, and sociable when we met there, I was surprized at his conduct
							now; and know not how to account for it, unless from a remnant of ill
							humour, from certain mortifications, which he experienced at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg after I came away, before the
							close of our War. <persRef ref="harris-levett">Harris</persRef> often
							wrote me that Lord Walpole was extremely discourteous to him, and this
							sulky insolence may be a sequel of the same pettish temper— We returned
							to Craven Street; and just as we were leaving it to return home,
								<persRef ref="king-eliza">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								King</persRef> called, with an acquaintance of hers, a <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Porter</persRef>, a Scotch
							Lady; to pay M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams a visit. She stayed
							only a few minutes, and invited us to dine with her next Thursday. We
							then came home, by the way of Brook Green where there has been these
							three days a Fair—the remnant of which only we saw; and to disadvantage,
							as there was a cold rain almost the whole day— I had seen the
							preparations for this Fair, and crowds of People going to it, and many
							May-day Garlands when I walked into London, the day before Yesterday.—
							We reached home just before dinner time; and I found a Note from
								<persRef ref="waddington-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S.
								F. Waddington</persRef>; with a hint of information, and a promise
							of more in future— An invitation from <persRef

								Lieven</persRef>
							<pb n="440" type="ms"/>to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and me,
							to dine with them next Tuesday: and one from the Countess, to attend her

							Tuesday with <persRef ref="bourke-edmund;bourke-maria">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Bourke</persRef>— There was also a Letter from <persRef

							enclosing one from a <persRef ref="delacroix-irenee">Major General
								Irenée Amelot de la Croix, Baron Van den Boegard</persRef>, from

							a sprinkling of rain nearly half the way— I found there several
							visitors, and a large budget of Letters— <persRef ref="paterson-m">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M. C. Paterson</persRef> of New-York,
							brought me a Letter of Recommendation from <persRef ref="u">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mason</persRef> of New-York, whom I
							saw once, several years ago, at Boston— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Paterson came from America, with <persRef ref="smith-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> J. A. Smith</persRef>, and has been
							spending the Winter at Edinburgh The <persRef
								ref="white-john4;white-henry2">two M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

							followed a few minutes after, by <persRef ref="delreal-jose">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> del Real</persRef>, and his
							interpreter. After waiting until they were gone, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith had taken off Paterson, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> del Real informed me that he had written
							several Letters and Memorials to Lord Castlereagh, to which he had
							received no answer— That he was desirous of obtaining an interview with
							him, to request an answer; that he might know upon what to rely, in
							relation to his official situation— He rather intimated than positively
							expressed the wish that I would introduce him to Lord Castlereagh; and
							asked if I could indicate any means by which he could obtain access to
							him— I told him that I was fully disposed to render him any service in
							my power; but he would recollect the conversation which had lately
							passed between us; in which we had agreed in opinion, that any
							extraordinary interest, shewn on the part of the United States towards
							the South-Americans, would unavoidably indispose in the same degree the
							British Government against them— The policy of the British Government
							hitherto decisively is not to acknowledge the Independence of the South
							Americans— Knowing this, I had neither officially nor individually such
							a state of personal Relations with Lord Castlereagh, as would warrant me
							in assuming the Liberty of introducing del Real to him; nor was it in my
							power to point out to him any other channel, through which he might
							obtain such an Introduction— I knew of no more favourable prospect, of
							success than by a <pb n="441" type="ms"/>Note to Lord Castlereagh,
							explicitly asking for an Audience or an answer.— He said that he was
							unwilling to push on to extremities at once. That soon after his arrival
							here, he had seen <persRef ref="vansittart-nicholas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Vansittart</persRef> the Chancellor of
							the Exchequer, who had then made no difficulty to receive him— He had
							told him that the British Government had ordered their naval Commanders
							to respect the flag of the South-Americans. Their vessels would be
							admitted into the British Ports, and the commerce of British subjects
							with them would be allowed— But that their Government could not be
							acknowledged— I told him that he must expect to find the British
							Government just at this time colder and more averse to an acknowledgment
							than they were— The fall of Carthagena, and the late successes of the
							royal party in Mexico, and in Peru, had very much shaken the opinions of
							People in Europe, generally as to the final success of the Insurgents.
							Perhaps the impression of those Events had been much greater than was
							warranted by their importance— I knew that such had been the effect of
							similar events, during the War of our Revolution. I believed he would
							find it better to wait until some more favourable turn to the
							Independent cause should take place, than to press for an answer now. He
							acquiesced in this opinion and left me— The Letters were—from <persRef

								>all the family</persRef> with me— The <persRef
								ref="nicholas-caroline;nicholas-charlotte;nicholas-ellen">three

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas</persRef> had been invited by
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams, and were inclined to go— They
							went with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and our sons John &amp;
							Charles in the Carriage— We dined at 3. O’Clock, and George and I went
							in the Stage from Brentford to London. Walked from Piccadilly to Craven
							Street, and thence with <persRef ref="smith-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> to Covent-Garden— The
							Plays were the Merchant of Venice, in which Bibby performed the part of
								<persRef ref="shylock">Shylock</persRef>; and Love à la Mode, in
							which he was <persRef ref="sirarchymacsarcasm">Sir Archy
								M’Sarcasm</persRef>.— Between the two was a stupid occasional
							Pageant, called the Royal Nuptials, or the Masque of Hymen, in honour as
							the Bills announced of the late joyful occasion— The house was very
							thin; and even at the half-play did not nearly fill up— This was the
							most unequivocal proof of poor Bibby’s failure of success,
							notwithstanding all the exertions of his friends King and <persRef
								ref="delafield-john2">Delafield</persRef>, aided by all our
							countenance which to be sure scarcely filled a single Box— The
							performances went off heavily— Bibby is in truth what they call here, a
							respectable performer— But there is no striking or extraordinary merit
							in him. He has little experience of the Stage, and might perhaps improve
							into a great actor, which now he is not— He made great efforts; even too
							great, particularly in Shylock, for he overstrained his voice, and made
							himself hoarse. But he failed in the general effect; and although there
							were few particular passages in which his action or delivery could be
							censured, yet he certainly did not give the perfect image of the Jew’s
							Passions or of his humour. His Sir Archy was a repetition of his
								<persRef ref="sirpertinaxmacsycophant">Sir Pertinax</persRef>,
							though his Scotch was more intelligible this time— He was applauded in
							both parts enough and more than enough— There was always, a slight, but
							portentous hissing heard amidst the clapping by which it was
							overpowered— He was supported by the other performers, as well as could
							be expected under the discouragement of a half empty house— The Irish
							personage in the Man of the World was the most indifferent character— I
							had as little amusement this Evening, as on the first Night of Bibby’s
							performance— They were both Evening’s of anxiety and concern for a young
							Man, who I was convinced from the beginning had undertaken more than he
							could go through. The <persRef ref="white-john4;white-henry2">two M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> White’s</persRef> and another young
							American, were in our box, and in the course of the Evening, M<hi

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William Vaughan</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>

							told me, he had received Letters from <persRef ref="shaler-william">M<hi

							Algiers, from <persRef ref="shaw-john">Commodore Shaw</persRef>, and
							from <persRef ref="mccall-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Call</persRef>, Consul at Barcelona, from which it appears that
							our Peace with Algiers has turned out as might have been expected— We
							have been made the dupes of the Barbarians, and must fight it over with
							them again— Shaler has made a temporary arrangement, by which the
								<persRef ref="agha-omar">Dey</persRef> has agreed to wait for the
							final determination of the <persRef ref="madison-james">President of the
								United States</persRef>, upon his new demands— Commodore Shaw says
							that he has a force sufficient to protect our Commerce in the
							Mediterranean— Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Aspinwall thought it
							might be best not to publish these papers, as they might have the effect
							of raising the price of insurance— I could not form an opinion without
							seeing the Letters which he promised to send me to-morrow. The Play was
							over about Midnight.— The Ladies with my sons John and Charles, returned
							home; and George and I went and lodged at Craven Street— I received
							there a Letter from <persRef ref="ingraham-nathaniel2">M<hi

								>Smith</persRef> to make out the original Note to be sent. I went to
							London in the Curricle, after an early Breakfast alone, and at eleven
							O’Clock was at Lord Castlereagh’s door— I was shewn into the anti-room,
							and within five minutes, <persRef ref="dundas-robert">Lord
								Melville</persRef>, the first Lord of the Admiralty came in. He told
							me that they had not yet received any despatches from <persRef
								ref="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef>—
							Not even of his arrival at Washington.— But they had Letters from the
								<persRef ref="jackson-samuel">Captain</persRef> of the Niger; from
							Bermuda; to which Island she proceeded after having landed M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot and his family at Annapolis— I said
							to Lord Melville in the tone between jest and earnest that I heard
								<persRef ref="pellew-edward">Lord Exmouth</persRef> had been making
							Peace for Naples and Sardinia, and a quarrel for us, with the <persRef
								ref="agha-omar">Dey of Algiers</persRef>— He said that was the
							subject upon which Lord Castlereagh had requested to see me this
							Morning. They had no intention to make a quarrel between us and Algiers;
							and hoped no such consequence would follow— I replied that if it should,
							the quarrel would I hope be rather useful to us than otherwise; and My
							Lord, said I, if we had only for three years, one third of your naval
							force, I assure you, that the Christian world should never more hear of
							tribute, ransom or Slavery to the African Barbarians— Just then the
							servant came, and ushered us in to Lord Castlereagh’s cabinet. He began
							immediately upon the subject, and told me that he had asked this
							interview for the purpose of communicating to me <hi rend="italic"
								>confidentially</hi> their Instructions to Lord Exmouth and his
							proceedings under them, with a view to satisfy the Government of the
							United States that the conduct of the British Government in these
							transactions had been fair and honourable; and that although there was
							one Article of the Treaty between the United States and Algiers, which
							Great-Britain considered as objectionable it had not been at-all noticed
							or referred to in Lord Exmouth’s Negotiation— He then read to me two
							papers and gave me to peruse three others, serving to elucidate all the
							proceedings of this Government in this affair. They were 1. A Letter
							from himself to <persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Earle Bathurst</persRef>,
							directing by an order of the Cabinet Council, that Instructions from the
							Lords of the Admiralty should be sent to Lord Exmouth to go and notify
							to the Barbary Powers, the dispositions by which the allied European
							Sovereigns have placed the Ionian Islands under the protection of Great
							Britain; to obtain the acknowledgment of these dispositions; and at the
							same time to negotiate a Peace between the Barbary Powers and the
							kingdoms of the two Sicilies and of Sardinia. The motives alledged for
							this measure are, the obligations of Great-Britain to extend to the
							Ionian Islands since they have been made a part of the British
							dominions, the same privileges enjoyed in the Mediterranean seas, by
							other British subjects—the general indignation arising throughout
							Europe, against the mode of warfare practised by the Barbary States
							against Christians; and the urgent applications of the king’s two
							intimate allies the <persRef ref="ferdinand-i">kings of Naples</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="victoremmanuel">Sardinia</persRef>; more particularly
							a very recent one from the latter of these Sovereigns, through his
							Minister at this Court, for the interposition of Great-Britain to effect
							this Peace in respect to his dominions— It is observed that by the
							annexation of Genoa to the Sardinian Dominions the importance to them of
							a Peace with the Barbary States had increased. That the object of that
							annexation having been to strengthen the barrier on the side of Italy
							against France, it would be more consonant with that policy that all the
							resources of Sardinia should be applied to its military power by Land,
							than that any part of them should be diverted to the purpose of making
							it a naval power— That while the Island of Malta had been possessed by
							the knights of that order, they had been at perpetual war with the
							Barbary Powers, and had thereby afforded considerable protection to the
							Commerce of the Mediterranean States against their Cruizers. And as
							Great-Britain now possessed Malta, although she was not obliged to take
							upon her the duty of protecting all the Christian flags, the revenues of
							the Order, not having been transferred to her, yet it was proper she
							should exercise her influence of protection to a certain extent. 24
							[symbols] Lord Exmouth was therefore to be instructed to go to Algiers,
							Tunis and Tripoli; and to perswade their Governments to make a Peace
							with Naples and Sardinia, upon the footing of that with Portugal. He was
							to agree that the same rate of ransom as had heretofore been paid for
							prisoners, Subjects of those Powers, should be paid for those he should
							find there in captivity. And that the usual presents in money should
							hereafter be paid for them. He was to resist &amp; reject all demands
							for contributions of naval or military Stores, and to require the
							release without ransom, of all prisoners, natives of the Ionian Islands.
							But although he was to refuse any stipulated compensation for their
							deliverance, he was authorized <pb n="444" type="ms"/>to give it to be
							understood that a suitable present would be made for them. He was also
							to admonish the Regencies of the rising indignation of Europe against
							their mode of warfare; and to advise them to abandon it, and to resort
							to more creditable resources for the support of their Governments. At
							the same time he was to assure them of the friendly disposition of
							Great-Britain towards them, and that she would not support any Christian
							State in any unjust claim or pretension against them— He was in the
							first instance to urge all this in an amicable manner; but was
							explicitly authorised to use force if necessary— 2. A second Letter from
							Lord Castlereagh to Earle Bathurst dated 13. March. stating that the
							Treaty between the United States of America and Algiers, concluded on
							the 30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June 1815. and ratified at
							Washington, on the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of December last,
							had engaged the attention of His Majesty’s Government That the 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article in particular, would in the case
							of a future War between Great-Britain, and the United-States, be
							incompatible with the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> Articles of the Treaty of 1698. between
							Great-Britain and Algiers, which had been recognized and renewed in all
							the subsequent Treaties between them. That it might not for this reason
							be necessary to require the abrogation of the Treaty, between the United
							States and Algiers, but that Lord Exmouth should be instructed formally
							to protest against the Application of that Article of the Treaty, to
							Great-Britain in the case of any future hostilities between this Country
							and the United States. 3. A Report from Lord Exmouth, dated 17. April at
							Tunis, to the Lords of the Admiralty, of his Execution of the first
							Instructions at Algiers and at Tunis. He states that he had not received
							the second Instructions (those relative to the Treaty between the United
							States and Algiers) until after he had left Algiers, and that he should
							therefore execute them upon his return. 4. A Summary Statement of the
							Terms upon which the Peace was concluded, both at Algiers, and at Tunis,
							for Sardinia and for Naples. The Ransom for the Sardinian Prisoners was
							500 dollars for each man, and for the Neapolitans 1000. The Consular and
							other Presents in future to be as <hi rend="italic">usual</hi>
							heretofore, but only in money. The Ionian Islanders to be restored
							without ransom. 5. A Declaration by <persRef ref="mahmudibnmuhammad"
								>Mahmoud Bashaw</persRef>, Bey of Tunis, addressed to Lord Exmouth,
							and promising, in Consideration of the anxious desire manifested by His
							Royal Highness the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef> of
							England, to put an end to the Slavery of Christians, and to prove his
							esteem for the <hi rend="italic">European</hi> Powers, and his pacific
							disposition, that in case of War with any of <hi rend="italic">the
								said</hi> Powers, the prisoners shall not be reduced to Slavery; but
							treated as Prisoners of War, and at the end of the War exchanged and
							sent home— After thanking Lord Castlereagh for the communication of
							these Documents, the purport of which I assured him I should immediately
							report to the Government of the United States, I told him that as the
							Instructions to Lord Exmouth had positively forbidden him to stipulate
							for any future contributions to the Barbarians in naval or military
							Stores, I hoped that in the next arrangement, which Great-Britain should
							make with them for her friends she would proceed one step further and
							prohibit the payment to them of money, which was equivalent to, and
							would procure them all. And as the Prince Regent’s anxiety to put an end
							to Christian Slavery had obtained a Declaration from the Bay of Tunis,
							that he would no longer reduce Christian Prisoners to Slavery, the same
							influence would here after be exerted, effectually to abolish that
							practice on the part of all the Barbary Powers, and especially Algiers.
							That it was worthy of Great-Britain, to take the lead in the abolition
							of this species of Slavery, as she had done with regard to that of the
							Africans. That she was perfectly able to accomplish it alone, and in
							that case would enjoy all the credit and glory of having effected it.
							But if she preferred to have the co-operation of others, I was confident
							she might rely upon that of the United States, to the full proportion of
							their Power, and that I thought her having succeeded to the possession
							of the Island of Malta really did impose upon her the obligation of
							affording to the Christian Commerce, at least all the protection that it
							could derive from the perpetual War between that order and the Infidels.
							Lord Castlereagh declared that it was the earnest wish of the British
							Government, that all the Barbary Powers should abandon altogether this
							mode of warfare; but he thought that mild and moderate measures, and
							persuasion would be better calculated to produce this effect than force.
							He seemed even to consider that this payment of money to them would have
							the tendency of relaxing them into good humour, and incline them to
							compliance with the wish that they would make no more Slaves to be
							ransomed. He said that although Great-Britain possessed the Island of
							Malta, she had none of the Revenues, which had been assigned by all the
							principal States of Europe to the Order. That Great-Britain with all her
							exertions had not been able to obtain the abolition of the African
							Slave-trade by Spain and Portugal, and as she would not have felt
							justified in resorting to War, to compel them to it, so she could not
							make War upon the Barbary States to force them to renounce the practice
							of making Slaves of Christians, so long as they never applied it to her
							Subjects, or had given her any cause of offence. It was for other Powers
							to vindicate and maintain the Liberties of their own People; and besides
							the Northern Maritime States France, Spain and all those who had
							possessions on the Mediterranean had as strong an obligation to put down
							the scandal of Christian Slavery, as Great-Britain. She had for herself
							no complaint against the Barbary States to make— She had often found
							them useful friends; and especially during the late War in the
							Peninsula, which it would have been impossible for her to have carried
							through successfully without the supplies <pb n="445" type="ms"/>which
							her troops had received from the coast of Barbary—from which they had
							almost all their fresh provisions. Great-Britain however had no interest
							or desire to countenance or encourage the Wars of the Barbary States
							against the other navigating European Powers. She had no unworthy policy
							of securing by such means an exclusive privilege to her own flag, of
							securely navigating in the Mediterranean Seas— But she did not think
							that the obligation of putting an end to the depredations of the Barbary
							States was incumbent upon her alone; and if it was to be effected, she
							thought the best mode of accomplishing it would be by convincing them
							that it would be better for their own interest to resort to other, and
							more honest sources of Prosperity.— I observed that as to the manner of
							accomplishing the object, if Great-Britain would undertake it, that must
							be at her own option. There could not be supposed any necessity for her
							resorting to the use of force.— The intimation of her will, and the
							exhibition of her means of enforcement, would infallibly be as
							efficacious upon the Dey of Algiers, as the Prince Regent’s wish had
							been upon the Bey of Tunis. As to the assistance which had been derived
							from supplies of Provisions to the British Troops in Spain, the interest
							of the Seller was doubtless the motive for that, and it could lay no
							claim to the merit of an obligation. If however, Great-Britain should
							not incline to assume the task of putting an end to Barbary Piracy, if
							she would leave them in our hands, I believed we should be able to give
							a good account of them. The experience of the last year had proved that
							they were not very formidable antagonists upon the Ocean, and if we had
							to deal with them alone; I had no doubt that our navy would be competent
							to the protection of our Commerce against them. I was not informed what
							the precise point of difference between Algiers and us now was; but as
							to the conflicting Articles of the two Treaties there could be no
							difficulty in an arrangement between the two Governments concerning it—
							He replied that we might depend upon meeting no molestation, in our
							operations, against Algiers, on the part of Great-Britain— He thought
							that the place itself could not be attacked with any prospect of
							success— There had been of late years a change in the system of Algerine
							warfare, which had been to their own disadvantage. Formerly they had
							been accustomed to send out small gallies, and xebecs, and gunboats for
							shallow waters, which cost nothing, and against which it was scarcely
							possible to protect commercial vessels, especially during certain
							Seasons of the year. Of late they had undertaken to maintain a sort of
							Navy— Large, expensive frigates, with which they had effected their
							descents on the Coasts of Italy and Sardinia, and carried off whole
							villages. But such vessels were not so well adapted to the annoyance of
							Commerce as those which they had formerly employed— The large ships
							could be out only part of the year, and then they could neither fight,
							nor navigate them well.— Defence against them would not be difficult;
							but it was Lord Exmouth’s opinion, that if they should resort again to
							their old system, there could be no effectual protection for merchant
							vessels against them through all Seasons— This was the substance of the
							Conversation, in which Lord Melville took none, or scarcely any
							part—appearing merely to assent to the observations of Lord
							Castlereagh.— Before leaving them I mentioned to Lord Castlereagh, the
							not that I addressed to him the first of this month, concerning, the
							American vessel refused entry at Liverpool, because the <persRef
								ref="gibbons-james">Collector</persRef> at Richmond certified that
							the master had been <hi rend="italic">qualified</hi>, instead, of saying
								<hi rend="italic">sworn</hi>, to manifest of tobacco: I told him
							that in some parts of the United States, I knew the term qualified was
							used, and received as equivalent to sworn— Lord Melville said that
							sometimes it was so used in this Country— Lord Castlereagh had not seen,
							or had forgotten, my Note; but he promised to enquire after it. I also
							told Lord Castlereagh that I had received Instructions to ask for a
							permission to export Rollers, for the use of the Mint of the United
							States— He said there could be no difficulty in that; but Lord Melville
							remarked that the prohibition was by Act of Parliament. Lord Castlereagh
							asked me to write him a note about it— I had ordered the Coachman to
							come with the Curricle for me to Craven Street at five O’Clock— I walked
							from Lord Castlereagh’s to my Office, and there found <persRef
								ref="paterson-m">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M. C.
								Paterson</persRef> with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith. I also
							received there a Letter from <persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi

							to him from <persRef ref="shaler-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							and <persRef ref="mccall-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Call</persRef>, the navy Agent, and Consul at Barcelona, relating
							to our new troubles with Algiers. Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
							Aspinwall has doubts as to the expediency of publishing the information
							they contain and asks my opinion of it— He sends me likewise a Letter
							from <persRef ref="erving-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> G. W.
								Erving</persRef> at Havre dated the 5<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi>
							of this month— Bound to Paris, and as Minister Plenipotentiary of the
							United States to Spain. He sailed from New-York the 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April, and gives me the recent news
							from America— At half past three O’Clock, I left the Office, and walked
							home in two hours and twenty Minutes, the shortest time I have ever
							taken for it and walking the whole way at the rate of four miles an
							hour— My usual rate of walking is 3 1/2 miles an hour— I was twice
							overtaken with heavy showers of hail, Sleet, and Snow—the first in Hyde
							Park, and the second at Turnham Green.— The last soaked me through and
							through, so that on reaching home I was obliged to change my clothing— I
							had also blistered one of my feet— <persRef key="adams-george"
								>George</persRef> went this Evening to Church at Brentford.— I also
							received at the Office, a printed notification from the Lord
							Chamberlain’s Office, of a Court Mourning of three <pb n="446" type="ms"
							/>weeks, for the late <persRef ref="marialudovika">Empress of

								Adams</persRef> to London; took up at Craven-Street <persRef
								ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. A.
								Smith</persRef>, and attended the Meeting of the British and foreign
							School-Society, 1 [symbols] at the London Tavern, Bishopsgate Street.
							The Meeting was appointed for twelve O’Clock, the Chair to be taken
							precisely at One— It was near one when we arrived— They were waiting for
							the <persRef ref="edward">Duke of Kent</persRef> who was to preside. The
								<persRef ref="wood-matthew">Lord Mayor</persRef> was there, but he
							was engaged to go with an address from the Common Council, to the
								<persRef ref="leopold2">Prince of Saxe-Coburg</persRef>, and the
								<persRef ref="charlotte">Princess Charlotte</persRef>— It was agreed
							therefore, that the Lord Mayor should take the Chair to open the
							Meeting, and immediately resign it to <persRef ref="bligh-john">Lord
								Darnley</persRef>, who should preside until the Duke should come—
							All this was arranged in the Committee Room, into which I was
							introduced, and where I knew not a Soul excepting the Lord Mayor.— I
							followed the Company into the Hall which was crowded with a numerous
							auditory, and took my seat upon the Platform— The Lord Mayor opened the
							meeting; apologized that he was obliged to go to change his dress and go
							in the old State waggon to Camelford House; but said that he would leave
							the <persRef ref="wood-maria">Lady Mayoress</persRef> to supply his
							place, and Lord Darnley would take the Chair until the Duke of Kent
							should come. Lord Darnley accordingly took the Chair for a few minutes
							until the Duke arrived. He apologized for being late, and said that his
							Carriage had been detained 25 minutes, at a place in the city where the
							Street had been so obstructed by other Carriages &amp; waggons that he
							could not get along— The Report of the Treasurer of the Society was then
							read; and immediately afterwards a written motion was put into my hand
							with a request that I would move it— It was marked N. 1.—His Excellency
							the American Ambassador will move—That the “Report which has now been
							read be received and adopted, and that it be printed under the direction
							of the Committee—To be seconded by—[”] I had suspected that they would
							call upon me, for some address, motion or speech; but not that I should
							have been summoned out the very first; and I was not a little
							embarrassed what to say— The Duke of Kent however in calling upon me to
							make the motion, relieved me from much of my aukwardness; by observing
							that the Report just read had been very long, that the time remaining to
							transact the business to be done was short; and that he requested all
							those who proposed to address the Company to be as brief in their
							remarks as possible— I said—“Mindful of that admonition which has just
							been so properly given by His Royal Highness the illustrious chairman of
							this Meeting, I shall not a waste a moment of your time, in commenting
							upon the Report which you have just heard— I am sensible that no
							encomium of mine can add grace or dignity to that Spirit of benevolence,
							which walks abroad, communicating wisdom and virtue (for Education in
							wisdom and virtue) wherever it goes— To enlarge upon it, would in me be
							presumption; for I am well assured that I could utter nothing in its
							praise, which has not already been anticipated in every bosom of those
							whom I have now the honour to address— One remark only I may be
							permitted to make, in reference to that passage of the Report, in which
							honourable notice is taken of my native Country, for the ardour and zeal
							with which it promotes, and encourages Institutions devoted to the
							purposes of Education— It would certainly not become me to question the
							accuracy of this compliment, or to detract from the merit which may be
							ascribed to my Country for it. I shall only say that it would be utterly
							impossible for a Nation descended from British Ancestry, to be
							neglectful of the Education of their Children—” I then made the motion,
							which was seconded, and adopted. A number of other motions were
							successively made, and passed; and the meeting was addressed in
							Speeches; by Lord Darnley; the <persRef ref="hill-rowland">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d:</hi> Rowland Hill</persRef>, a Methodist
							Clergyman—the <persRef ref="lindsay-james">Rev<hi rend="superscript"

							dissenting Minister, <persRef ref="schwabe-c">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Schwabe</persRef> the foreign Secretary of the Society,
							and some others. From their Speeches I collected that this Institution
							is viewed with Jealousy by the Established Church; and that their favour
							is confined to a rival institution, where the benefits of Education are
							bestowed only upon Children bred upon the principles of the
							Establishment.— <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count Lieven</persRef>
							the Russian Ambassador was to have been present but sent an excuse— But
							there was present a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Balk-Oleff</persRef>, who is going out as Minister from the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor of Russia</persRef> to Brazil, who was
							requested to make one of the motions, and who made it by proxy— A
							gentleman spoke for him, and expressed for him his regret that his
							acquaintance with the English language was not sufficient to enable him
							to speak in public himself. The last vote; being N. 9. was to have been
							moved by some other person; but from what cause I know not, they brought
							it to me. It was thus—N. 9. . . . will move . . . That the thanks of
							this Meeting be presented to His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent, for
							his unremitting exertion, in the cause of this Institution, and for his
							able conduct in presiding at this Meeting—to be seconded by— But I did
							not wait for a second— I said, Ladies and Gentlemen— The motion which I
							have now to present to you, is one, which I have as high and sincere
							pride and gratification in being permitted to make, as I am sure you
							will unanimously take in adopting it— I then read the motion and put the
							question upon which the whole auditory rose and held up their hands— The
							Duke answered the vote by an Address, in which he declared his warm
							attachment to the Institution, and his good wishes for its success— His
							satisfaction at the crowded and respectable appearance of the Meeting,
							which he had appointed to be held there, in the <hi rend="italic"
								>East</hi> part of Town, from a conviction that a most liberal
							collection for the benevolent purposes of the Society would be made
							there— He felt the greater satisfaction too at the respectability of the
							meeting, as this was the last time he should have the opportunity of
							giving his attendance on the like occasion for several, he could not say
							how many years— He was shortly to leave the Country, to reside some
							years upon the Continent— And when the objects for which he should thus
							absent himself should be accomplished, he now pledged himself to give
							one thousand guineas to this Institution— If he had not given them
							before, it was not because the will, but because the means had been
							wanting.— It gave him peculiar satisfaction <pb n="447" type="ms"/>that
							the motion of thanks to him had been made by the Minister of the United
							States, a Country in the neighbourhood of which he had several years
							resided, which had his best wishes for its prosperity; and the
							unfortunate differences with which had always given him great pain and
							concern.— He concluded by appealing to the liberality of the meeting to
							contribute to the funds of the Society, and observed that the Lady
							Mayoress, and <persRef ref="bligh-elizabeth">Lady Darnley</persRef>
							would hold the plates at the door— The meeting then dissolved, and we
							took <persRef ref="vaughan-barbara">Miss B. Vaughan</persRef> home, to
								<persRef ref="vaughan-william">her brother’s</persRef> house N. 1.
							Dunster Court, Mincing Lane— A house, where I have known him, and
							experienced his hospitable friendship from November 1783— We returned
							thence to Craven-Street; and the Carriage requiring some repairs, dined
							there— I had written last Friday a Note to <persRef
								ref="couling-william">William Couling</persRef>, asking him to call
							this day at my Office, he accordingly came— I read to him the Letter,
							from the <persRef ref="nicholas-wilson">Governor of Virginia</persRef>,
							enquiring upon what terms a civil engineer could be procured to be
							employed under the directions of the Legislature of that State— I told
							Couling, I had thought he was exactly the person they wanted, and that
							their business was exactly what he wanted; and asked him if he would
							undertake it, and upon what terms— He said it was exactly what he
							wanted; and in a very few days he would state to me the terms upon which
							he would go, though he was willing to leave them to the liberality of
							the Governor of Virginia— He said he would also bring me a statement of
							the works in which he had been engaged; and some samples of his drawings
							and Surveys— I also received a Letter from <persRef

							where the Queen was, were thrown open, for the foreign Ambassadors, and
							Ministers; and we were among the first that passed— The Queen was
							sitting in a chair— The <persRef ref="augustasophia">Princesses

								<persRef ref="mary2">Mary</persRef>, the <persRef ref="charlotte"

							full dresses and of Ladies in their hoops were obliged to stand for
							hours, on the green, in front of the Palace, before they could get

							J. A. Smith, as the Secretary of the American Legation; and M<hi

								<persRef ref="stewart-amelia">Lady Castlereagh</persRef>, who
							invited him to her evening parties on Saturdays after the Opera— She
							told me she had mentioned them to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams;
							but supposed it might be inconvenient to us, to come in, so far from the

							the <persRef ref="chateaubriand-francois">Vicomte de

								ref="louis-xviii">king of France</persRef> should be requested to
							instruct his Ambassadors at the different Courts of Europe, to propose
							that they should all unite in the endeavour to prevail upon the Barbary
							Powers, to abolish their practice of making slaves of Christians.— I
							enquired if any proposal of that sort had been made by the <persRef
								ref="eustache-rene">French Ambassador</persRef> here— He said there
							had not; and with a sneering smile, added that he thought it was only a
							project of <persRef ref="smith-william10">Sir Sidney Smith’s,</persRef>
							which would not meet with much encouragement— We came away just before
							the Drawing-Room closed. It was with the utmost difficulty that we made
							our way down the Stair-case; and at the door we were stopped to make way
							for the Princess Charlotte and her husband; and after them, for the
								<persRef ref="frederica">Duchess of York</persRef> to go. We reached

									>r</hi> Baring</persRef> told me that he had received the

							the Counting house of <persRef ref="glennieandson">A. Glennie, Son and
									C<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi></persRef> where I saw <persRef
								ref="fry-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fry</persRef>. I
							spoke to him of the claim in behalf of <persRef ref="kempton-moses">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Kempton</persRef> of Philadelphia; and
							enquired what they wished me to do in it— He said the case was now
							before a judicial Court here upon the appeal— They did not wish for my
							interposition at present; but will give me notice, whenever they shall
							think it may be of service— I also mentioned to him the case of the
							Seamen of the Baltimore; and urged the necessity that their wages should
							be paid; to prevent their becoming a burden upon the public— But he said
							the Agents of the owners, at Liverpool had already advanced upon the
							ship, more money than she was worth—the owners themselves were not
							responsible persons, and the seamen had forfeited their wages by
							deserting the ship.— The agents, W. and Ja<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>
							Brown <pb n="450" type="ms"/>would not allow the payment of a penny to
							them— I next went to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S. Williams’s in

						<p><date>21. VI: </date>The continual employment and dissipation of the two
							last months has been such that my journal has been unavoidably running
							again in arrears—day has encroached upon day, until it has now amounted
							within two or three days of a full Month— To preserve the chain of
							Events, I have been obliged to resort to the expedient of keeping a
							separate minute; containing an abstract; allotting one line for every
							day— For a man much overplied with business, this is the best method
							perhaps of keeping a diary; and it is too probable I shall soon be able
							to keep no other— From this index, I began this Morning the Journal of
							the 24<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of April, from which time the
							arrears are, if possible to be redeemed— Answered also the Letter which
							I received on the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> instant from
								<persRef ref="erving-george">G. W. Erving</persRef>.— Had a visit
							with a subscription paper, from the organist of Ealing Church; and
								<persRef ref="couling-william">W. Couling</persRef> came out from
							London, and brought for my inspection several Plans, and drawings done
							by him and a statement of the principal works upon which he has been
							employed. He has not yet settled in his mind the terms, upon which he
							would wish to be engaged— Said he had sometimes received two guineas a
							day; but that he could not expect so much for a constancy. I asked him
							whether he would be satisfied with £500 a year— He said perfectly— I
							told him he might then propose it— But at all Events I wished him to
							draw up his proposals in writing, so that I may be enabled to answer the
							Letter from the <persRef ref="nicholas-wilson">Governor of
								Virginia</persRef>— I walked before dinner to Brentford and Ealing—
							By the Evening’s Post I received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="murray-charles">Charles Murray</persRef> Secretary to the
							Society of Friends of Foreigners in Distress, enclosing a ticket for
							their anniversary dinner, at the City of London Tavern, Bishopsgate
							Street, on Wednesday the 5<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of June.
							Between eight and nine O’Clock in the Evening, we were walking in the
							Gardens when <persRef ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J.
								A. Smith</persRef> arrived with a Card of invitation from the
								<persRef ref="seymourconway-francis">Lord Chamberlain</persRef>, to
							the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent’s</persRef> Dress Party, this
							Evening, at nine O’Clock, to have the honour of meeting the <persRef
								ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef>. the Card was to me only, (not to
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef>,) and had been left at the Office in
							Craven Street, about seven O’Clock this Evening— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Smith immediately brought it out himself, on horseback— He
							stopped only a few minutes and returned to town— I dressed with all
							possible expedition, but on my way to town recollected the absolute
							necessity of going to complete my toilet, at Craven Street. I reached
							Carlton House, about half past eleven, and found some of the company
							going away— The Queen, with the Prince Regent, and the <persRef ref="augustasophia;elizabeth;sophia;mary2">Princesses</persRef> had
							been round the circle about ten O’Clock; I did not see the Queen at-all—
							The Prince Regent came into the Hall again— I was seen by him, and he
							bowed, but did not speak to me— The <persRef ref="freire-cipriano"
								>Portuguese Minister</persRef> had received his Card, at two O’Clock
							this afternoon— The <persRef ref="pfeffel-christian">Bavarian</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="vonberoldingen-joseph">Wurtemberg Ministers</persRef>,
							at seven this Evening— The <persRef ref="vonjacobikloest-konstans"
								>Prussian</persRef>, <persRef ref="vonrehausen-gotthard"
								>Swedish</persRef> and <persRef ref="dejust-william">Saxon</persRef>
							Ministers were not there— Among the company I met there was <persRef
								ref="robinson-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> F.
								Robinson</persRef>, the Vice-President of the Board of Trade; I
							spoke to him of the several objects relative to the execution of the
							Convention of Commerce of 3. July 1815.— He asked me to send him a
							written minute of them; and promised to do every thing in his power for
							the arrangement of them all to my satisfaction— I spoke also to <persRef
								ref="wellesleypole-katherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Wellesley Pole</persRef>, who told me that she had received budgets
							of Letters from <persRef ref="bagot-mary">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Bagot</persRef>— She was very much gratified with her
							reception, and there was not a word of truth in the Story told in some
							of the Newspapers, about the Salute’s having been refused to the
							frigate. On the contrary the frigate’s Salute of 13 guns had been
							returned with 18. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bagot had seen
								<persRef ref="madison-dolley">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

							Aspinwall disputes all these demands, but sends the accounts to ask my

							passed <pb n="451" type="ms"/>by me, just before I came to Hyde-Park
							Corner, and neither the Coachman nor either of the footmen perceived me,
							although they passed me, almost within Call.— I walked therefore the

								ref="kellerman-o">O. C. Kellermann</persRef>, dated at Copenhagen,
							4. May, and proposing that the United States, should purchase from the
							Government of Denmark the Nicobar Islands in the East-Indies— He

							explain to me, why it ought to be secret— <persRef ref="couling-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Couling</persRef> called at the
							Office; I had advised him the day when he was at Ealing, to go to the
							United States immediately; and there to make his own bargain with the
								<persRef ref="nicholas-wilson">Governor of Virginia</persRef>. He
							had then appeared much inclined to take that course; but this day he
							thinks it will be better for him to wait for a reply from America, and
							to settle his affairs in this Country, before he goes. I asked him
							therefore to write me a Letter stating the terms on which he is willing
							to engage, in the service of the state of Virginia, and promised to
							forward it to Governor Nicholas— From his Conversation this day, I found
							that he had among his projects contemplated a removal to Russia, as well
							as to the United States, and had been to some Correspondence with the
							Russian Consul <persRef ref="dubachevsky-andrei">Dubachefsky</persRef>,
							respecting the execution of that part of his plan.— I had a visit also
							from <persRef ref="saunders-prince">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Prince Sanders</persRef>, whom I met just as I was going to dinner—
							I dined at Fishmongers Hall, at the Anniversary dinner of that Company.
							Before dinner we witnessed the swearing in of the <persRef ref="edward"
								>Duke’s of Kent</persRef> and <persRef ref="augustusfrederick"
								>Sussex</persRef> as Members of the Company. The <persRef
								ref="williamfrederick">Duke of Gloucester</persRef> was already a

								ref="pettyfitzmaurice-henry">Marquis of Lansdowne</persRef>, the
								<persRef ref="bligh-john">Earl of Darnley</persRef> and his Son,
								<persRef ref="bligh-edward">Lord Clifton</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="fox-henry">Lords Holland</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="erskine-thomas">Erskine</persRef>— The Prime Warden of the
							Company, <persRef ref="brickwood-nathaniel">Nathanael Brickwood Esq<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi></persRef> presided at the table—the
								<persRef ref="wood-maria">Lady Mayoress</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wood-maria2;wood-catharine">two Miss Wood’s</persRef> her
							daughters, <persRef ref="u;u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> and Miss
								Brickwood</persRef>, and a large number of Ladies were there. I was
							the only foreign Minister; and I believe the only foreigner present. The
								<persRef ref="wood-matthew">Lord Mayor</persRef> and Lady Mayoress
							sat, at the right and left hand of the Prime-Warden, at the Right of the
							Lord Mayor, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brickwood the Duke of Kent,
							the Duke of Gloucester, Miss Wood, myself, Miss Brickwood, Lord Erskine,
							&amp;c— At the left of the Lady Mayoress, the Duke of Sussex, the
							younger Miss Wood, the Marquis of Lansdowne, Lord Holland &amp;c. The
							process after dinner, was the same as at all these great Entertainments—
							Non Nobis Domine was sung instead of saying grace— Then came the
							toasts—the <persRef ref="george-iii">King</persRef> in respectful
							silence— The other toasts with three times three.— The <persRef
								ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef>; the <persRef
								ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef> and Royal Family— The <persRef
								ref="charlotte">Princess Charlotte</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="leopold2">Prince of Saxe-Coburg</persRef>— Then the Lord
							Mayor—the Dukes of Kent Sussex and Gloucester successively—then, the
							American Minister, and perpetual peace and friendship between Great
							Britain and the United States—then, the Marquis of Lansdowne, Lord
							Erskine and trial by Jury, Lord Holland, and the Earl of Darnley. The
							Prime Warden, the Wardens of the company &amp;c— As usual every person
							present who was toasted returned thanks by a Speech. This part of the
							ceremony, always excessively irksome to me, was peculiarly so this day—
							I said—[“]M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Prime Warden, Gentlemen,
							Wardens of the Fishmongers Company, Ladies and Gentlemen; I beg leave to
							return my thanks, as well for the distinguished honour that is done me
							by this notice; as for that of having been permitted to participate in
							the festivities of this entertainment on this auspicious occasion. From
							my earliest infancy I had always been accustomed to hear the City of
							London celebrated for the liberality of its principles; nor is this the
							first day, upon which I have heard the praises of the Company before
							which I stand as being among the liberal, distinguished for its
							liberality. Since my residence in this Country, I have had ample
							opportunities to experience in my own person the truth of that which I
							had before heard, and to say with one of our ingenious Poets, “I thought
							so once, but now I know it.” Sir, I have been very recently informed of
							the arrival in the United States, of a Minister from the British
							Government accredited to that of my Country. It will be his Duty to
							support the interests of his Countrymen, and the rights of his
							Sovereign, in the United States, as it is my duty to support the
							interests of my fellow-Citizens, and the rights of my Sovereign here—
							But there is one duty common to us, both— It is in my estimation by far
							the most important, of those with which I am charged, and I am perswaded
							that he will consider it as among the most important of those incumbent
							upon him— It is the duty of contributing the utmost in our power, to
							make these two Great Nations better known and better friends to each
							other— The duty of softening the asperities, of cultivating and
							multiplying all the harmonies between them. I will only add the wish
							that he may have equal reason to be gratified with the reception and
							treatment which he will meet in that Country, as I have to feel myself
							honoured and gratified by that which I have experienced in this.”— This
							speech was well received, and something complimentary to the
							United-States was said in the speeches of the Royal Dukes, and of almost
							all the noblemen who were toasted— The Ladies left the table about ten
							O’Clock— It was near twelve when the rest of the Company rose, and there
							was still to be a concert in the Hall above— The band of instrumental
							performers was numerous and excellent, and there were several fine
							voices among the singers— <pb n="452" type="ms"/>They performed and sung
							at intervals, while the company were at table.— Lord Erskine told me
							that he was determined to pay a visit to the United States, and he
							promised again to send me his Speech upon the Orders in Council— Lord
							Holland told me that the Fishmongers were the only whig company in the
							City, and had uniformly been so. The Prime-Warden in his Speech observed
							that the king’s father <persRef ref="fredericklewis">Prince Frederick of
								Wales</persRef> had been a member of the Company— Lord Holland
							invited me to dine with him at Holland-House next Sunday week; and said
							he would send me a Card. I got home at two in the Morning.</p>

							all in a file, and all endorsed copies to be sent to <persRef

							Great-Queen Street, with the Society for the encouragement of Arts,

								<persRef ref="murray-john5">Duke of Athol</persRef>, <persRef

								ref="levesongower-george">Marquis of Stafford</persRef>, <persRef

								Curwen</persRef> a Member of Parliament, and a distinguished
							agriculturist were of the company— The only other foreign Minister was
							the <persRef ref="freire-cipriano">Chevalier de Freire</persRef>. The
							Duke of Sussex introduced me to <persRef ref="penn-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Penn</persRef>, who told me that
							he was in correspondence with <persRef key="adams-john">my

							there. There were about two hundred persons at the dinner, principally
							artists— Part of the entertainment was some very fine roast beef, fatted
							upon an experimental plan by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curwen— A
							printed account of the experiment was also circulated round the table.
							After dinner, and non nobis sung, the usual toasts were drank, with the
							usual cheering of three times three.— Among them the Duke of Sussex
							gave, the Ministers of Portugal and of the United States of America;
							which he accompanied with a speech, complimentary to our Country and
							personally to us, particularly dwelling upon the pleasure with which he
							recollected his former acquaintance with me, upon what he termed neutral
							ground, at Berlin— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Freire simply returned
							thanks— I added that on this as upon all other occasions, I naturally
							must cast a reflective look to my own Country— Though not yet competent
							to equal the perfection in the Arts for which Great-Britain was so
							eminently distinguished, she was competent to admire, and might at a
							future day be competent to emulate them— In the mean time she must be
							content to follow her Parent, non passibus aequis, and if hereafter she
							could rivalize her in the works of art, I prayed that that and the
							emulation of good offices might be the only rivalry between the two
							Countries— Then apologizing to the Duke, for addressing the company
							instead of him, I said that it had been my good fortune, little less
							than twenty years ago, to meet his Royal Highness, on what he was
							pleased to term neutral ground. I needed not to say that I considered it
							as one of the happiest Circumstances of my life; but I could nor forbear
							or deny myself the gratification of remarking that from that moment I
							had entertained for his Royal Highness, the same Sentiments which the
							Company I had now the honour of addressing had so signally manifested by
							placing him in that Chair— The Duke of Athol, Marquis of Stafford, Lord
							Dundas, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curwen and <persRef
								ref="taylor-charles">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor</persRef>
							the Secretary of the Society were all successively toasted, and returned
							thanks by Speeches— There were songs, serious and jocund; and between
							nine and ten O’Clock the Company broke up. I went with J. A. Smith to
							Drury-Lane Theatre; but we could not find M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> King and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Adams—they were just gone; having seen Deaf and Dumb, and
							Midas. We saw the Magpie and the Maid; from the French Melo-drame of La
							Pie Voleuse. It was past Midnight when the Play finished— I went to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> King’s lodgings where I found my wife. We
							took leave of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> King, who go for Paris, the day after to-morrow; and when
							we came to our house at Ealing, it was three O’Clock in the Morning, and
