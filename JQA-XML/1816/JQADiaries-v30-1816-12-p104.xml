							without him was not any thing made, that was made.” It was intended for

							impossible this world should have existed from eternity, for this among

							overflowing with population, or entirely depopulated. This is a sample

						<p><date>3. VII:30. </date>I received this morning a Letter from <persRef

							Committee to attend and assist at a General Meeting of the Society at
							Freemason’s Hall, on Thursday the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							this Month at 12 O’Clock, the <persRef ref="augustusfrederick">Duke of

							answer to <persRef ref="millar-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Millar</persRef>, Queen Street, Bloomsbury. Also a Letter from
								<persRef ref="grubb-james">Grubb</persRef>, mentioning the box
							addressed to me, arrived from S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg
							in the Ship Holderness and offering his services to procure it for me. I
							answered Grubb’s Letter, and taking <persRef ref="giusta-antoine"
								>Antoine</persRef> with me to town sent him with it. I found at the
							office in Craven Street <persRef ref="winthrop-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Winthrop</persRef> of Boston, who
							gave me Letters from <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> and
							from <persRef ref="waterhouse-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Waterhouse</persRef>; both dated in February. That from my father
							was only an introduction. Winthrop has been several months in Holland,
							and has arrived only within these few days in London— There were
							likewise three American Sailors, applying for relief, refused them by
							the Consul. I told them to call again at the Consul’s to-morrow, and
							wrote a Letter to <persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Aspinwall</persRef>, urging him
							again, under the special circumstances of the present times, to relax
							from the rules of refusing relief to all who come from another
							Consulate, or who have been in the British Service— Besides these there
							was a Letter from <persRef ref="holmes-james">James Holmes</persRef>
							formerly the American Consul at Newry; enclosing again his and <persRef
								ref="davenport-thomas">Vice-Consul at Londonderry’s</persRef>
							Accounts for relief furnished to destitute American Seamen sworn to, but
							without vouchers; and with a copy of a Letter from <persRef
								ref="pleasonton-stephen">B. Pleasonton</persRef>, of the Department
							of State, to Holmes’s <pb n="105" type="ms"/>Correspondent at New-York,
							referring him to me for the settlement of his Account. A long Letter
							from <persRef ref="page-w">W. H. G. Page</persRef> upon <persRef
								ref="cooke-george">Cook’s</persRef> Affairs; with copies of a
							Correspondence between him Page and <persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Earl
								Bathurst</persRef>; in which Page asks for official papers,
							necessary for the trial of Cook’s action against <persRef
								ref="maxwell-charles">Maxwell</persRef>; before the Court of Law.
							Bathurst declines furnishing the papers, and Page writes asking me to
							apply for them ministerially— Then a Letter from <persRef
								ref="brewer-nathaniel">Nathaniel Brewer</persRef>, stating that he
							was on board an American vessel that foundered at Sea; lost all his
							papers, credits &amp;c. wants money and will give a bill upon <persRef
								ref="mason-john">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> John

							and several others, all written in 1814. and accidentally saved, as
							vouchers of his credit. I left word with <persRef ref="smith-john"
								>Smith</persRef>, that the man being totally unknown to me, and
							having severely suffered by listening to such Stories I was sorry I must
							refer him to the persons upon whom his credits were drawn which he had
							lost. As they must have as much reason as I, and probably more to credit
							the vouchers he produces— Antoine came back at five. It was too late for
							the Custom-House. He brought me a reply from Grubb, who will attend to
							the business to-morrow— A Letter from Aspinwall, about the restriction
							of Passengers to unoccupied Tonnage; and the news that <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Von Harten</persRef> died the
							day before Yesterday. My time had been so much absorbed that I could not

						<p><date>4. VII:15. </date>Passed a sleepless Night. Received this Morning a
							Letter from the Bavarian Minister, <persRef ref="pfeffel-christian">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pfeffel</persRef> containing enquiries
							about a German named <persRef ref="u">Plattner</persRef> who says I
							dissuaded him from going to America. Also a Letter from <persRef
								ref="vonharten-gerhard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Von

								wife</persRef>, communicating the death of <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Von Harten</persRef>— Walk to Hanwell
							and Ealing. <persRef ref="page-w">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. H.
								G. Page</persRef> was here, entertaining me an hour and a half with
							the cause of <persRef ref="cooke-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								G. Cooke</persRef> which is to come on for trial in the Court of
							King’s Bench this week. <persRef ref="u">Major Appleton</persRef> whom
							he summoned from Guernsey is here. But Page supposes he will admit the
							fact of having destroyed Cook’s factory, alledge in justification that
							it was by orders from his superior Officer, but that he has not the
							orders here; or that they are confidential and he cannot produce them.
							Page therefore wrote to <persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Earl
								Bathurst</persRef>, requesting him to furnish copies of the orders
							issued from his Office as Secretary of State to <persRef
								ref="maxwell-charles">Governor Maxwell</persRef>. But Lord Bathurst
							has declined furnishing the copies, on the ground that the Government
							does not think proper to interfere with the Evidence. In point of fact
							Page says, the Government have made Maxwell’s cause their own. They have
							determined to defend him; insomuch that the Attorney General, whom Page
							had retained for Cook, now is with drawn, and declines taking part in
							the cause. It has been decided in a late Cause against the <persRef
								ref="hamilton-william4">Governor of Heligoland</persRef>, that the
							Secretaries of State are not amenable to the Court for the production of
							their official archives or papers of Office; and Page’s Solicitor and
							Counsel are apprehensive that by this suppression of the Evidence which
							is in the possession of this Government, but which they will not
							produce, Cook must become nonsuit, and having once lost hold of Maxwell,
							may never be able to come at him again, as he is now in the West Indies.
							Page therefore wished me to apply to Lord Bathurst, demanding that the
							Orders to Maxwell should be produced— I told him that this was a point
							involving the principles of internal Administration of the Country. I
							could not as a foreign Minister demand that a high Officer of State
							should produce for a Court of Justice within the Country, which he had
							already declined to furnish, under an established, and settled rule of
							Office— I must presume that the judicial Court, would be independent of
							Executive influence; and that an Officer, alledged Orders, for doing
							that which in itself was an outrage to the person and property of an
							individual, the Court would compel him to produce his orders. I could
							not conceive that the Court would nonsuit Cook for not producing papers
							which it was impossible for him to obtain, or that they would let an
							Officer who alledged orders for his justification, without producing
							them— I thought I could not with propriety make this demand of Lord
							Bathurst—that if I should make it, it would not only be refused, but the
							demand would probably give Offence to this Government, and might perhaps
							not be approved by my own. That I regretted it much, as it would have
							given me pleasure to have afforded any assistance in my power to the
							Cause of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook. Page said he was perfectly
							satisfied with the reasons I had given him, and hoped to avail himself
							of the suggestion I had given him, that the necessity of producing the
							orders should be put upon the other party. He said he had <persRef
								ref="gurney-william">Gurney</persRef> the short hand writer engaged
							to take down the trial, and he had told <persRef ref="hamilton-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton</persRef> the Under
							Secretary of the State in the foreign Department <pb n="106" type="ms"
							/>that if for the want of evidence, in the possession of His Majesty’s
							Ministers but which they would not suffer to be produced, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook should be obliged to become nonsuit
							and should lose his cause, there would be only one resource left for
							him— A true and faithful statement of his whole case should be printed,
							and a copy of it should be delivered to every member of both houses of
							the British Parliament, and to every member of both houses of the
							American Congress. And he had added that although he well knew a Nation
							could not go to War, for the wrongs of one individual, yet when the next
							war between Great-Britain and the United States, from whatever Cause
							should take place, and the Peace should come to be negotiated, he hoped
							Cook’s case would then be brought forward to be negotiated, though it
							might be at the distance of twenty years— After Page went away, I walked
							to Hanwell and Ealing; and in the Evening turned over the Remembrancer
							for the year 1779. where I found many reminiscences of things once
							interesting, but which now seem but the incoherent fragments of a
							dream.</p>

							thinks it probable no appointment will be made until the new President

							generally understood that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe will
							offer the Office of Secretary of State to me. He wishes therefore to
							bespeak my influence in his favour after my return to the United States
							which he is convinced will be next Spring— He says he was promised the
							Office of Navy Agent at Boston; three or four years ago: and that it was
							given by <persRef ref="hamilton-paul">Paul Hamilton</persRef>, then
							Secretary of the Navy, and through the influence of the Member of
							Congress <persRef ref="seaver-ebenezer">Seaver</persRef>, to a man named
								<persRef ref="binney-amos">Amos Binney</persRef>, who had no claim

							Monroe— <persRef ref="boyd-george">Boyd</persRef> had indeed told me
							that there was some talk of that kind at Washington; but I consider it
							all, as the mere gossiping, speculative distribution of public offices,
							which is always going on in the United States. Winthrop was about two
							hours here; and walked round the garden with me. He then returned to
							Brentford, to be taken up by a party with whom he had come out from
							London, and who were to dine at Twickenham.— I received this Morning
							Letters—from <persRef ref="smith-john">J. A. Smith</persRef>, with

								Laurance</persRef> a Merchant residing in London: Smith had opened

							do nothing.— Copies of the Papers of the case, are enclosed with the

							yesterday promised him to meet him this day at my Office, at 3.
							O’Clock.— But Pfeffel did not come. Plettner waited for him until past
							four and then went away. He appeared to be much distressed, and wanted
							to go to America, or any where for subsistence. An American named
								<persRef ref="u">Dunkin</persRef> came and took a Passport for

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parry</persRef> came to enquire

							transmitted to <persRef ref="barney-joshua">Commodore Barney</persRef>—
							There was none— Parry said he had finally determined to go to America,
							and should embark in the Venus, a vessel that is to sail for New-York
							about the last of January— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laurance
							called about the case of the Ship Hope, and I promised to address to
							Lord Castlereagh, a Note concerning it. Laurance said he had applied for
							the interposition of the <persRef ref="delosrios-carlos">Spanish
								Ambassador</persRef>, who had refused it, on the ground that at the
							time when the capture was made, Buenos Ayres was a Colony in rebellion
							against Spain; and if it had not been, the Hope could not have been
							there— He had also applied to the agent of the Buenos Ayres Government
							here; but he told him that he was not recognized at this Court, and that
							no representation from him could have any effect— I wrote to G. Boyd at
							Paris, and left the Packets for him and Harris to be forwarded by Smith—
							We left the Office at five, and came home in a Storm of wind and rain.
							Brought out with me <persRef ref="byron-george">Lord Byron’s</persRef>
							third Canto of Child Harold, which I read after dinner.— He is perhaps
							the most fashionable Poet of the Age, but his poetry is not made I
							think, of lasting materials— The subject of this Poem allows him to be
							as desultory as he pleases. So it treats of himself, his daughter, the
							battle of Waterloo, <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
							>Napoleon</persRef>, <persRef ref="howard-frederick">Major
								Howard</persRef>, Ehrenbreitstein, <persRef ref="marceau-francois"

								ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire</persRef>, and a <persRef
								ref="clairmont-claire">Lady in England</persRef> whom Lord Byron
							loves, but who is not his wife— The train of thought is original, wild,
							romantic, and bordering on distraction. The versification singular but
							habitually running the sense from line to line; to the utter
							discomfiture of Harmony.— The sentiment sometimes tender, but always
							with a mixture of gloom and fierceness— The best Stanza’s in this Canto,
							are those upon Napoleon.</p>

							between breakfast and my walking hour— There was a storm of wind and

							during the war, and his character with regard to personal courage were
							such that he ought not to be continued in the service. This opinion

							had called upon Scott to say whether he had expressed it, and Scott had
							been obliged to avow that he had. It was the general opinion of the

						<p><date>23. VI: </date><persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> at 32 and rising to a thaw. By the second
							Post, after twelve at Noon, I received a Note from <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> dated on
							Saturday and requesting me to call on him at eleven O’Clock this
							Morning. I immediately went into London, and at three O’Clock when I
							reached his house found him still at home. He told me that as he was
							going out of town for two or three days, he had sent for me to tell me
							that he had not forgotten the promise that he had made me before he went
							to Ireland that the subject of my Note of 27. September, proposing the
							Negotiation of a Commercial Treaty, should be taken up by this
							Government immediately after his return— That it had been taken up. Two
							Cabinet Councils had already been held upon it; and as it embraced a
							variety of important objects, as soon as they could be sufficiently
							matured for instructions to given him under which he could discuss them
							with me, I should hear from him again— I said, if the general
							determination had been taken to enter upon the Negotiation, there could
							be no objection to taking time for arranging particulars. He replied
							that his present purpose was merely to assure me, that he was mindful of
							his promise, and that the Government were earnestly engaged in the
							consideration of the proposal— He then enquired if I had any late
							accounts from the other side of the water, and what had been the state
							of our Harvest. I told him I was informed that the Indian Corn, had
							almost universally failed; and in a very great degree. The other grains
							had suffered little; but as in all the Eastern, and even in some of the
							Southern States, that article formed the principal ingredient in the
							bread of the most numerous class of our population, a scanty harvest of
							it, would necessarily affect the consumption and the price of the other
							materials for bread— He said their harvest here had been partially bad;
							there would turn out to be enough for the consumption of the People; but
							he was very much afraid that would not be the case in the interior of
							Germany; where he heard the distress was very great. I said I heard the
							Harvest in France was also very bad— He said it was so in some parts of
							France, and good in others; but the vines had universally and entirely
							failed— In Ireland, the harvest was worse than here, and at one moment
							they had been much alarmed for the crop of potatoes, the article which
							formed the whole subsistence of the great majority of their population.
							There had been a severe frost which it had been apprehended had cut them
							off to an alarming degree; but fortunately the frost had been preceded
							by a deep fall of Snow, which had prevented it from penetrating deep
							into the ground and had saved the potatoes— From this topic he passed
							immediately to that of the Slave trade, which he said was now carrying
							on to a very great extent and in a shocking manner— That a great number
							of vessels for it, had been fitted out in our Southern States; and that
							the barbarities of the trade were even more atrocious than they had been
							before the abolition of it had been attempted. The vessels sailed under
							the flags of the Nations which still allowed the trade, Spain and
							Portugal; they were very small and sailed like lightening.— One vessel
							of 120 tons taken by <persRef ref="yeo-james">Sir James Yeo</persRef>,
							had six hundred Slaves on board. She had been out three days and there
							were thirty of them already dead. These vessels escape capture, by the
							rapidity of their operations. They have agents on the slave Coast, who
							purchase and collect the slaves together on the shore. The vessels
							occasionally approach, until they see on the shore the flag flying which
							is the signal that the Agents are ready with the slaves— Then they go
							and take them on board, and disappear again in the course of a very few
							hours— If on approaching the land they do not see the flag, they
							immediately go off again and remain some time out of sight of land. The
							slaves when taken are carried to Brezil, the Coast of South America, and
							the Havanna. Neither Spain nor Portugal, even if they favoured the total
							abolition of the traffic have a force adequate to the suppression of it,
							as thus practiced— For an extent of a thousand miles on the Coast of
							Africa, Portugal has not more than two armed vessels, and for another
							thousand Miles on the Coast of South America perhaps two more— It is
							impossible they should be adequate to put down a traffic thus carried
							on; what he, Lord Castlereagh had thought of, and believed would be
							ultimately necessary was, that the Nations which were agreed upon the
							abolition, should authorize, the capture of the slave trading vessels,
							by the armed force of other Nations, but <pb n="113" type="ms"/>that the
							trial should be by Commissioners, not exclusively of the capturing
							Nation— That each of the Powers for instance should appoint one
							“Commissaire Juge,” and that whenever a capture was made, it should be
							tried by the Commissary-judge of the capturing Nation, and the one of
							the Nation under whose flag, the Slave-trading vessel should be taken.
							And if they could not agree, then to call in the Commissaire-juge of a
							third and indifferent party to decide. This had been the course adopted,
							with regard to the claims of the subjects of the several powers, upon
							France, under the Treaties of Paris. There was a French
							Comissaire-juge—one of the claimant’s Nation; and if they could not
							agree, the Commissaire-juge of a third party was added to come to the
							decision— It was found that the business was thus done without
							difficulty or inconvenience— Lord Castlereagh did not say it was his
							intention to propose that the United-States should take part in this
							system, and have their Commissaire-juge among the rest; so that I heard
							all his observations on the subject without thinking it necessary to
							make any reply— What led to his speaking about the slave trade was my
							congratulating him on the result of <persRef ref="pellew-edward">Lord
								Exmouth’s</persRef> expedition against Algiers— I said that the
							United States had still an arrangement to make, of their relations with
							Algiers: that <persRef ref="shaler-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Shaler</persRef> and <persRef ref="chauncey-isaac"
								>Commodore Chauncey</persRef> were the Commissioners appointed for
							that purpose, and that I had been informed by the <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef>, that their
							Instructions authorised them, in the renewal of the Treaty to consent to
							a modification of the Articles, which had been objected to by this
							Country, so that they should not be taken as applicable contrary to the
							engagements of previous Treaties between Great-Britain and Algiers— I
							had been highly gratified that the success of Lord Exmouth’s attack had
							been such as I had anticipated, and as the system of Barbary warfare
							appeared to be now broken down, I hoped it would never again be suffered
							to revive— He said that the success had been equal to their most
							sangwine expectations— That when Lord Exmouth was first sent there
							measures of hostility had not been authorised, owing to the
							considerations which he had mentioned to me at the time— Afterwards,
							when they had ceased to operate, the expedition had been undertaken with
							a full knowledge of its difficulties and hazards. Lord Exmouth himself
							had been asked whether it could be attempted with a prospect of success;
							and had answered that it might be done. He had told them how it could be
							done, and precisely as he had effected it—by running his ship, close in
							to the shore, directly opposite to the battery, and see which would hold
							out longest, the stone or the wood— It had happily proved a successful
							experiment, and it might be hoped would lead to the breaking up of
							Christian Slavery in Africa.— He wished there were a prospect equally
							fair of breaking up the African Slave-trade; and then he proceeded to
							the remarks just noted— I asked him if he had any late despatches from
								<persRef ref="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bagot</persRef>. He said, to some time in October when he was about
							returning to Washington. There had been some discussion between him and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe about the fisheries; but
							nothing definitively adjusted— I observed to him that there were several
							objects relating to individual interests, upon which I had
							representations to make to him, and should shortly address him in
							writing— In one of them the United States themselves had an interest— I
							spoke of a number of Custom-house, revenue-bonds executed by Citizens of
							the United-States, which had been taken by the British at Moose-Island
							in July 1814. These bonds had been carried to Halifax, and not only
							condemned as prize, but some or all of them had been put in suit; one of
							the obligors had been arrested and held to bail, before the judge of the
							Admiralty Court at Halifax; who had pronounced a decree against him—
							There was an appeal in his behalf now pending in the high Court of
							appeals here. The other obligors being in the United-States, the process
							of the Admiralty Court at Halifax could not reach them— But living on
							the borders of the British Province their affairs occasionally called
							them there; but could not step over the boundary so long as this
							sentence should be hanging over them— The United States had proceeded,
							and recovered the monies due upon these bonds from the obligors. I
							understood it was the opinion of most respectable lawyers here, that the
							sentence of the Admiralty Court at Halifax could not be supported; and
							it was desirable if possible to have the case taken out, and settled,
							without waiting for a formal decision of the high Court of appeals—
							Another case was that of the William and Mary, a vessel taken at Cadix,
							within the Spanish Jurisdiction, and condemned by the Vice-Admiralty
							Court at Gibraltar— It was also pending in the high Court of Appeals.
							The <persRef ref="delosrios-carlos">Spanish Ambassador</persRef> had
							already presented to him Lord Castlereagh two Notes, claiming the
							restitution of this property, on the ground of the Jurisdiction. There
							was no doubt that the claim of Spanish Jurisdiction was valid— The
							evidence in support of it was clear and complete, and the persons
							interested in the property, wished the case to be taken out of Court,
							and settled. <pb n="114" type="ms"/>A third case was that of a vessel
							called the Hope, fitted out at New York, and despatched on a Voyage of
							discovery in the year 1812. just before the Commencement of the late
							War. She had a special Passport from the Government of the United
							States, and particular Letters of recommendation from the foreign
							Ministers then residing in the United States, among which was one from

								Foster</persRef> the British Minister.— She was taken, by boats from
							a British armed vessel in the harbour of Buenos Ayres, within neutral
							jurisdiction— In this case however the Spanish Ambassador declined
							interfering in behalf of the jurisdiction, upon the ground that Buenos
							Ayres was then in a state of revolt against the authority of Spain, and
							that by the Laws of Spain neither the capturing nor the captured vessel
							had any right or business to be there— Lord Castlereagh said that if all
							the British Ships that had been there were to be made answerable for it
							Spain would have work enough upon her hands— I replied that this was the
							reason alledged by the Spanish Ambassador for refusing to interpose on
							account of the jurisdiction: but the capture had certainly been made
							within the neutral boundary; and the voyage was one of that description
							which by the usages of civilized Nations is allowed to be unmolested in
							time of War. The parties interested in this vessel were also desirous
							that the case should be taken out of the Admiralty Court and settled
							ministerially. We are very much in the habit, said Lord Castlereagh, of
							referring such cases to the kings Advocate for a Report, and if you will
							write a line to me about them, I will see that they shall be attended
							to— Hereupon I took my leave, and he said he was going into the Country
							this Evening. I went to Craven Street— <persRef ref="smith-john"
								>Smith</persRef> was out, but came in a few minutes afterwards. He
							had just been to see <persRef ref="everett-alexander;everett-lucretia"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> A. H. Everett</persRef> who arrived last Evening from
							Boston— I paid visits to <persRef ref="boyd-john3">General
								Boyd</persRef> and <persRef ref="storer-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Storer</persRef>, at <persRef
								ref="brunet-louis">Brunet’s</persRef> Hotel and to <persRef
								ref="forbes-john">J. M. Forbes</persRef>, next door to it, in
							Leicester Square— They were all out. I left cards of invitation for them
							to dine with us on Wednesday. I next went to 45 Dover Street Piccadilly,
							where I found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Everett— He gave me several Packets of despatches and
							Letters with which he had been charged for me. Everett returned from
							Amsterdam to Boston last Summer for the purpose of being married to Miss
							Lucretia Peabody of Exeter, and has now come back with her. They sailed
							from Boston the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last Month in the
							Galen, and had a passage of twenty-two days to Dover, where they landed.
							Everett has despatches for S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg,
							and was instructed to carry them there as a special Messenger— But
							hearing that the affair of <persRef ref="kosloff-nicholas"
								>Kosloff</persRef>, the Russian Consul at Philadelphia, had been
							settled to the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef>
							Satisfaction, he thinks it will not be necessary for him to proceed. I
							invited them to dine with us on Wednesday, but they had just before
							accepted an invitation from <persRef ref="williams-samuel2">S.
								Williams</persRef>— I returned to Craven Street, where I found
								<persRef ref="u">Parry</persRef>, the man who is going with his
							family to America— He now lives at Feversham in Kent, and he gives a
							gloomy picture of the situation of the Country. He had scarcely left the
							Office when a man came in who did not give his name, but said he had
							heard the American Government were giving encouragement to Cotton
							manufactures; and he came in behalf of a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Marshall</persRef> a Cotton Printer,
							and perhaps the most skilful man of the trade in all England; who was
							very desirous of going to America, and forming an establishment of that
							Nature there. I told him that the American Government gave no direct
							encouragement to any kind of manufactures: they took no part in such
							establishments; but they were bottomed altogether upon private
							enterprize. The only aid they received from the Government was by the
							means of duties upon articles of foreign manufacture which stood in
							competition with them, and I ought to add that by my late accounts from
							the United States, the present would be a very unfavourable moment for
							the establishment of such a manufacture, as those already existing there
							were now suffering very severely, by the competition of the imported
							British Manufactures which were also selling at a heavy loss to the
							importers of them. He said he was aware there had been losses on
							Articles of Cotton manufacture sent to America; but he had supposed that
							was owing entirely to the inferior quality of the goods. That many of
							the manufacturers had certainly got into the habit of sending out
							Articles of such wretched quality that it was no wonder they met with
							losses upon the sales. I said that was not the only causes of those
							losses; but the market had been overstocked, and in consequence of it
							the manufacturers of the Country were suffering as well as the
							importers. He thanked me for the information and left me. I had thus
							been detained at the Office till six-O’Clock, and it was almost eight
							when I reached home. After dinner I opened the packets which had been
							delivered to me by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett— There was one
							of Letters from <persRef ref="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef> to 26.
								Nov<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> The rest were despatches from the
							Secretary of State— Two of 14. and two of 16. November, with voluminous
							copies of Papers—upon the <pb n="115" type="ms"/>affair of Kosloff— A
							correspondence between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot, upon the subject of armaments on
							the Canadian Lakes— The report of the Court of Inquiry on the rencounter
							between the Peacock, and the Nautilus, an armed vessel belonging to the
							British East-India Company in the Straits of Sunda in June 1815: and
							papers relating to <persRef ref="u">Crosby’s</persRef> claim, with the
							National Intelligencer from 2 to 14. November. I was employed after
							dinner in reading the papers relative to Kosloff.</p>

						<p><date>24— VI: </date>I intended to have gone to London this Morning; but

							to <persRef ref="franklin-william">W. T. Franklin</persRef>, thanking
							him for the copy that he has sent me of his <persRef

							While taking my usual daily walk, I called at <persRef
								ref="nicholas-george2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nicholas’s</persRef>, and settled with him the bill for the last
							half-year’s schooling of <persRef
								ref="adams-george;adams-john2;adams-charles2">my three
								Sons</persRef>— He told me I had been the first last Summer; and was
							again the first now— It is one of the terms of admittance at his School,
							that three Months notice shall be given before taking a scholar away, or
							ten-guineas to be paid. I told the Doctor it was not improbable, I might
							return to American in the Spring, in which case I should take all my
							family with me; I wished him therefore to take it as notice now; that I
							should take my Sons from school, if I should leave this Country. He said
							that under my particular Circumstances, he should not take advantage of
							any shortness of notice; and he had seen in the newspapers, that I was
							to be the Secretary of State, under the next President— I told him that
							Newspaper authority for anticipated appointments in America, was not to
							be relied upon, but various circumstances might bring me to the
							determination of going home the next year— As the Doctor was at dinner
							when I called, I did not detain him; but pursued my walk round by
							Gunnersbury, with George, whom I had met at <persRef ref="u">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Goodenough’s</persRef> corner, and who
							turned and walked with me. I had received this Morning, a Letter from
								<persRef ref="everett-alexander">A. H. Everett</persRef> written
							yesterday before I had called upon him, to inform me of his arrival and
							having despatches for me; a Note from <persRef ref="u">General

							a note from <persRef ref="burdett-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> William Jones Burdett</persRef>, inviting me to dine

								ref="addams-richard">Addams</persRef>, with their account against

							claim before the Lords of the Treasury, for a vessel called the Lion,
							and Cargo; the Agency for which is transferred to them, from the house
							of <persRef ref="glennieandson">Alexander Glennie and Son</persRef>,
							which has failed— A Letter from <persRef ref="smith-john">J. A.
								Smith</persRef>, mentioning that the <persRef
								ref="vaughan-rebecca;vaughan-sarah">Miss Vaughan’s</persRef> had
							called to invite us, to dine with them next Thursday to meet M<hi

									rend="superscript">rs.</hi> A. H. Everett</persRef>; and a
							Letter from <persRef ref="bourne-sylvanus">S. Bourne</persRef> at
							Amsterdam, mentioning that he has heard I am to be Secretary of State,
							and asking for a place in that Department— In September 1815. I received
							a Letter from <persRef ref="spafford-horatio">H. G. Spafford</persRef>
							of the State of New-York, dated 8. August 1815. in which he says he had
							been the preceding Winter at Washington, where the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">President</persRef> had told him they were
							intending to reserve for me the best Office in the gift of
							Administration, as long as possible without injury to the public
							service. As this referred to a period previous to my appointment for the
							mission to England, I did not understand what was meant by it; but
							supposed it was an intention contingent upon my return home immediately
							after the Peace of Ghent.— After this, the first intimation that I had
							on this subject was from <persRef ref="boyd-george">G. Boyd</persRef>,
							who when last here told me there was a talk about the Offices at
							Washington, that the place of Secretary of State, would be offered to
							me, by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe.— The next was from
								<persRef ref="winthrop-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Winthrop</persRef> on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this
							Month. Since then it has been announced in all the Newspapers here, as
							extracted from American Newspapers, that it is settled— I am to be
							recalled, and to be Secretary of State— Lastly <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef> in her Letter of 26.
							November last, mentions a message from the President, by the <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-benjamin">Secretary of the Navy</persRef>, that
							if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> A. returned, that Office would be
							offered to him— Spafford’s Letter had entirely escaped my recollection
							until within these few days. I had no expectation or belief that the
							Office would be offered to me, until the receipt of my Mother’s Letter;
							and now I consider it still as a matter of great uncertainty. The
							question whether I ought to accept the place if it should be offered is
							not without difficulties in my Mind— A doubt of my competency for it, is
							very sincerely entertained, and ought perhaps to be decisive. At all
							Events, if I could be rationally justified in accepting it, if offered,
							I perceive no propriety in taking any step whatever to seek it. The
							person who is to nominate for the Office <pb n="116" type="ms"/>will be
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, and from him I have received
							no such intimation— Nor any from the present President, with an express
							authority to ask me for an answer— If M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe’s real intention be to propose to me the acceptance of the
							Office, I think it but consistent with what is due to my own character,
							as well as conformable to my own doubts whether I am fitted to discharge
							the heavy and laborious duties of the Office, to wait for a direct
							communication from him, signifying his intention, before I take any
							step, on the presumption that it will be carried into effect— I employed
							the Evening in reading the National Intelligencer’s received by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett. I wrote a Note to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Burdett, accepting his invitation to
							dinner on Saturday; but <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef> declined that of the Miss Vaughan’s for Thursday;
							they having removed to Clapham Common distant at least twelve Miles from
							our house; a distance which she thinks too great for going to a dinner
							at this Season of the year.</p>

						<p><date>28. IV: </date>It is not my will, that is thus capricious, in
							varying the hour of my rising; but the accident, which causes me to
							awake at such different hours. As I awoke this morning, I heard a
							repeated crowing of the Cock; from which I concluded that the day was
							dawning, and that of course it must be between six and seven O’Clock— It
							was really more than two hours before day. <persRef
								ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="marcellus">Marcellus</persRef> in Hamlet tells us “Some
							say that ever ’gainst that season comes, Wherein our Saviours birth is
							celebrated, The bird of dawning singeth all night long.” I believe there
							is some foundation for this remark; and I believe the cause to be, not
							precisely as Marcellus suggests that the Nights are then more wholesome,
							or the time more gracious than any other, but that the Nights are too
							long, for the repose which the Nature of the bird requires; that he
							awakes long before day and crows to cheer his ennui. So it was at least
							this Morning, which was clear and bright. I observed the Stars about
							half an hour; saw the Constellations of Virgo and Libra, very distinctly
							from my Cabinet windows, and discerned the crow, and many of the Stars
							of Hydra. Saw Jupiter rise; and expected to have seen Antares, but the
							day came on before he rose. I was steadily engaged upon my Journal till
							breakfast. Received Letters from <persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Aspinwall</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="smith-john">J. A. Smith</persRef>. The Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l:</hi> complains that he has not yet received
							from the Lords of the Treasury the permission for the Samoset, and that
							she is lying at Gravesend at a heavy expence. He asks also an order upon
							the <persRef ref="baringbrothers">Brothers Baring and C<hi
									rend="superscript">o.</hi></persRef> for £1050 to pay for this
							vessel, and another for the current expences of the Office of £500.
							Smith’s Letter says that he had advised the young man, who brought
								Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Aspinwall’s Letter to the Office
							to go himself and enquire at the Treasury about the permission for the
							Samoset— That he had accordingly been, and was told that it would be
							immediately attended to; but had been neglected, not being supposed of
							immediate urgency— I went into London with <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, who had been to <persRef
								ref="nicholas-george2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nicholas’s</persRef>. The Doctor he said was very suddenly seized
							last Evening, with the Gout in his stomach, was very dangerously ill,
							all Night, and not expected to live through the day. We called at the
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg Hotel, Dover Street,
							Piccadilly, to see <persRef ref="everett-alexander;everett-lucretia"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript"

								>t.</hi> James’s Street, where we went and found them. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett that on reading over the copies of
							the despatches which he had been instructed to carry to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg, I thought it would be most
							expedient for him to go there, notwithstanding the accounts received
							from thence, that the affair of the Russian Consul at Philadelphia,
								<persRef ref="kosloff-nicholas">Kosloff</persRef> had been settled

							part of it, marked with the greatest Moderation. Lord Cochrane, who is a
							man of serious deportment, and grave, but not unsocial manners told me
							that people were entertaining great expectations from the Meeting of
							Parliament, which would be disappointed. There would be some warm
							debates in the early part of the Session, but they would result in
							nothing. This has invariably been my own opinion— It was past eleven
							when we returned to Craven Street, where I waited about half an hour
							longer till George came from the theatre. We got home about half past
							one in the Morning. The Evening and Night were as stormy as the morning

							reads with great propriety, and perfectly understands the rules of

							the Church of England, which excludes all impassioned eloquence from the

								<persRef ref="romayne-james">Major James T. B. Romayne</persRef>— I

									>Thomas’s</persRef> Hotel, Berkeley-Square to see <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">Hughes</persRef>— He had
							removed to N. 10. Conduit Street— I went there, but he was not at his

							him— I called next at the Westminster Library in Jermyn Street, and left
							there the Reviews that I had taken out many Months since. At
							Craven-Street I found a Note from <persRef ref="fox-henry">Lord

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Winthrop</persRef> came in, and
							renewed his solicitations for my influence to obtain for him the Office

								ref="forbes-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. M.
								Forbes</persRef>, who has been afflicted both with the Gout and

							the house of <persRef ref="greglindsayandco">Greg Lindsay and C<hi
									rend="superscript">o.</hi></persRef> came to speak of the case
							of the Nanina, and brought a Letter from <persRef ref="murray-james"
								>James B. Murray</persRef> of New-York to <persRef ref="smith-john"
								>J. A. Smith</persRef> concerning it— The Nanina, was taken during
							the late war, by a British armed vessel, while her <persRef
								ref="barnard-charles">Captain</persRef> and crew were in the act of
							saving the people of a British vessel shipwrecked, on a desert island
							upon the Eastern Coast of South-America. The Captain and people of the
							Nanina, in return for their humanity and kindness to British Subjects,
							endured much harsh treatment and ill-usage after their capture— The
							vessel was carried to Rio Janeyro, where after a long detention, the
							British Admiral commanding there, offered to deliver her up to the
							Captain, which offer was accepted. But the Admiral afterwards annexed to
							it a Condition, that the Captain should give a written renunciation of
							all further claim upon the Captors. This he declined, <pb n="119"
								type="ms"/>in consequence of which, the Nanina was condemned as
							prize of War, by a vice-admiralty Court, and sold for a song. An appeal
							from the sentence of Condemnation was prosecuted and is now pending
							before the High Court of Appeals. Having been instructed by the
							Secretary of State, to support the claims of the proprietors of the
							Nanina, ministerially I addressed on the 10<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of June last a Note to <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert"
								>Lord Castlereagh</persRef> in their behalf, which he answered on
							the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of that Month, by a refusal to
							interfere in the case, referring to the rigorous right of War, and to
							the refusal of the Captain to take back his vessel, without reserving a
							further claim for costs and damages— A copy of my Note and of Lord
							Castlereagh’s answer, were sent last Summer to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Murray; but from his Letter to Smith it is very doubtful
							whether he has received it, for he still urges most earnestly that I
							should apply to the British Government, and supposes it impossible that
							they should shut their eyes to the justice of his claim. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Walker now came to ask my advice, upon a
							proposal made by the Captors to relinquish to the owners of the Nanina
							the net proceeds of the sale, and have the cause dismissed from the
							Court— He said if it was pushed on to trial the Condemnation must be
							confirmed— He supposed the proposal made by the Captors was to save
							themselves the expences of the Appeal, which would absorb all the
							proceeds, or leave a mere trifle not worth being distributed among them—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walker and his house thought nothing
							better for the owners could be done than to accept the proposal; but the
							amount of the proceeds will not exceed £400 Sterling, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Murray’s claim being for upwards of £6000.
							they had thought it necessary to ask my advice before they concluded
							what to do. I told him I thought it best to save from the wreck what
							they could. That by the positive refusal of this Government to
							interfere, for the owners, they were left at the mercy of the captors,
							and I believed nothing better could be done or expected than to accept
							their proposal. He said the house thought so too; and <persRef
								ref="palmer-charles">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Palmer</persRef>, a member of Parliament, had offered to present the
							case to the attention of the House of Commons, which might still be
							done, though he did not expect to any good purpose— <persRef
								ref="joy-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joy</persRef> came
							next, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walker left the Office—
								<persRef ref="boyd-john3">General Boyd</persRef> with <persRef
								ref="storer-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Storer</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="rotch-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="macrea-william">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								M’Rae</persRef>, and <persRef ref="thayer-sylvanus">Major
								Thayer</persRef> were, at present— He thought in France— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Birkbeck is a very intelligent English
							farmer; and has published a tour in France which he made in the Summer
							of 1814. But he has the project of removing with his family to settle in
							the United States. The account that he gives of the state of the Country
							is as dark and gloomy as those which come in all other directions. He
							says that notwithstanding the great increase in the price of grain and
							flour since last Winter the agricultural state of the kingdom is worse
							than it was then. But he admits that the appretiation of Bank-Notes to
							be of equal value with gold and silver is unaccountable to him; and
							contrary to all his prognostications— And his explanations, how in the
							midst of all the cries of distress the Revenue continues to be nearly as
							productive as ever are not quite satisfactory— These visitors detained
							us at the Office, until past five, and it was half past seven when we
							got home— There was a packet of National Intelligencers from 16 to 28
							November, received last Night from Liverpool— Bed between nine and
							ten.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> The latter half of this Month I
							have usually risen by Candle-light; but with great irregularity between
							four and nearly nine O’Clock, forming an average of half past six: the

							since that was completed, to the Journal itself. The hours between

						<p>The review of the year while it brings again motives of boundless
