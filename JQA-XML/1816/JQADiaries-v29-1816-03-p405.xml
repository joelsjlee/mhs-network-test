						<p><date>1. VII:15. </date>I wrote this morning a short despatch to the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef>, to enclose
							copies of two Notes, received from <persRef ref="vonberoldingen-joseph"
								>Count Beroldingen</persRef> the Minister of Wurttemberg; and the
							papers sent with them. The first of these Notes I received in January,
							and the second last Tuesday Night, on my return from London. The latter
							enclosed a Letter from the <persRef ref="frederick-i-wurttemburg">king
								of Wurttemberg</persRef>, addressed to the United States of America,
							and contained an autographical Communication of the Marriage of his Son
							the <persRef ref="frederickwilhelmkarl">Crown Prince of
								Wurttemberg</persRef>, with the <persRef ref="catherinepavlovna"
								>Grand Duchess Catherine</persRef> of Russia. I enclosed the King’s
							Letter with the despatch— I also answered the Count’s last Note.
								<persRef ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> made copies of the other Papers to be sent. After
							breakfast we went into London. I stopped at <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh’s</persRef> and he
							received me. He apologized for not having yet answered my late Notes, as
							having been unwell, and much pressed with business in Parliament. I told
							him there was but one of them which required immediate attention, and
							that was the one relating to the Discrimination between British, and
							American Vessels in Ireland. Since my last Note to him on that subject,
							I had received a new statement from Ireland, upon a representation from
							several Masters of American Vessels now at Londonderry, waiting for a
							decision of this Government; and who, if that should be against them,
							would be obliged to go away in ballast, or to come to this Country for
							freight. He enquired how it was in America, with regard to the Execution
							of the Convention of 3. July last; and mentioned the account he had seen
							in the Newspapers, that the Bill for carrying it into effect, passed by
							the house of Representatives had been rejected by the Senate. I told him
							that I had received no Communication from the Government on the subject;
							but the Convention having been ratified, was by the Constitution of the
							United States the Supreme Law of the Land; and the introduction and the
							failure of the Bill in question could only proceed, as indeed it was
							stated in the newspapers, from a difference of opinion between the two
							houses, as to the mode of giving effects to the Convention— He asked if
							in the mean time the Convention was actually carried into effect; and if
							so from what time the execution had commenced. I said I had no doubt it
							was in full execution; for as it was the Law of the Land, the extra
							duties upon British Vessels could not be levied in contravention to it.
							As to the time when it had commenced, I could not say.— The purport of
							the Convention was, that when ratified, it should be binding upon the
							parties, for four years from the time of the signature. This variation
							from the usual term of Commencement, the exchange of the Ratifications,
							had been introduced at the desire of the <persRef
								ref="adams-william;goulburn-henry;robinson-frederick">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>; and I had some conversation concerning
							it, soon after the conclusion of the Convention; first transiently with
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson, who had been one of the
							British Plenipotentiaries, and afterwards with the <persRef
								ref="jenkinson-robert">Earl of Liverpool</persRef>. For some time
							after the signature, an extra duty upon Cotton imported in American
							Vessels had been levied. An order of Council had then issued placing the
							Vessels of the two Nations on the same footing. My own opinion had been
							that the Convention was binding on both parties from the day of the
							signature; and that whatever duties contrary to it had been levied must
							be refunded. I had communicated all these Circumstances to the American
							Government, and had received for answer, that the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">President</persRef> had not issued a
							Proclamation, corresponding to the Order in Council; because the Order
							had never been communicated, and because it did not extend to Tonnage
							duties— That the Convention would be ratified, and after that, if there
							was any diversity of opinion as to the time of its commencement, it
							might be arranged by a mutual understanding between the two Governments—
							But then, said Lord Castlereagh, there is yet something to be done to
							carry the Convention into effect, and I will ask M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Robinson to appoint some time when I will ask you to see
							him, and come to some arrangement about it— Particularly as there would
							be a great inconvenience in refunding duties already collected— In the
							mean time we will endeavour to settle this matter in Ireland, without
							touching upon the question as to the right— Either by enlarging the
							privilege of American Vessels, to take a number of Passengers in equal
							proportion with British Vessels, or by reducing the numbers that British
							Vessels may take, to the same proportion, to which American Vessels are
							restricted. I said that in either case, we should be satisfied; but it
							was necessary the vessels of the two Countries should be placed on the
							same footing— Particularly as I was now given to understand that the
							discrimination extended to the amount of the Cargo, as well, as to the
							number of the Passengers— It was by an Act of Parliament described to me
							as being known by the name of the Passengers Act; but I had not seen it;
							and knew not when it had past; or what were more particularly its
							provisions. With regard to the extra-duties levied at the Trinity-House,
							Lord Castlereagh said it was not in the power of the Government to
							remove them— They had been laid for the maintenance of Light-Houses: the
							Trinity House was specially privileged to collect them, and they were
							not considered as among the duties and charges contemplated by the
							Convention. I told him that as we had similar charges for the
							maintenance of Light-Houses, the principal object must be to have a
							decision; as the principle must of course be reciprocal. I then observed
							that it was announced in the Newspapers that the <persRef
								ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef> would hold a Drawing-Room next
							Thursday; and I had thought it probable her Majesty might fix that time
							to grant me an Audience— She had appointed a time for that purpose, at
							the last <pb n="406" type="ms"/>Drawing Room which she held, in the
							Autumn; upon the arrival of the <persRef
								ref="johnarchdukeaustria;louisarchdukeaustria">Austrian
								Archdukes</persRef>— I was then confined to my house by illness, and
							could not avail myself of Her Majesty’s Condescencion. I wished also to
							know whether <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> would be received by
							the Queen at the same time, and as she must ask the favour of <persRef
								ref="stewart-amelia">Lady Castlereagh</persRef> to present her, she
							wished to know when it would be convenient to her Ladyship to see her—
							He said, he believed the paragraph in the Newspaper was a mistake— That
							the Queen would hold no Drawing-Room next week; nor until after the
								<persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent’s</persRef> return to town.
							That he hoped the Prince would return next week. He was entirely
							recovered from the Gout; but still had a weakness in the joints, which
							made it difficult for him to stand— But whenever the Queen should hold
							her Drawing-Room, I should have notice. Lady Castlereagh was usually at
							home every Morning, until 2. O’Clock, and would be glad to see M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams, whenever it should suit her
							convenience— I told Lord Castlereagh that I had a Commission for a
							Consul to present, which I should take to the foreign-office; and that I
							had received the Copies of the papers for which I had applied to him— I
							asked him what fees were to be paid for them, and he referred me to
								<persRef ref="hamilton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hamilton</persRef>— He said he had been for some days unwell with an
							influenza that was going about; and the house of Commons was no place
							for recovering from such a complaint. He was however now much better and
							hoped to get out again by next Monday From Lord Castlereaghs I went to
							the Office in Craven-Street; and soon afterwards <persRef
								ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef> came in. He informed me
							that he intended to leave town next Sunday, to visit Scotland, and to be
							at Liverpool, to embark for the United States, by the 20<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of this Month; unless his impatience
							should grow upon him and hasten still more his departure— A War between
							the United States and Spain appears inevitable; and the General hastens
							home, to have his share in the Service— He says he was told yesterday,
							by six or seven members of Parliament, that if we should not undertake
							any thing against the Island of Cuba, nor endeavour to obtain any
							exclusive privileges from the South-Americans, the Ministers here could
							not engage this Nation in a War against us, for the sake of Spain— Would
							that the experiment may not be tried— After General Scott took leave, I
							went down to the Foreign-Office, and enquired, for <persRef
								ref="cooke-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cooke</persRef>
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton, the Under Secretaries of
							State. Neither of them was there, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cooke has been for some days unwell. I saw <persRef ref="bidwell-thomas"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bidwell</persRef> the Chief
							Clerk, gave him <persRef ref="ingraham-nathaniel2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingraham’s</persRef> Commission, and
							enquired for that of <persRef ref="luke-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Luke</persRef>— Bidwell knew nothing about it; and after
							sending to another part of the Office to enquire, and waiting some time
							without receiving an Answer, he told me he supposed the exequatur was
							not ready, owing to the Prince Regents illness. After returning to
							Craven-Street, I went to the Morning Chronicle-Office, and to the shop,
							where <persRef ref="cobbett-william">Cobbett’s</persRef> Register is
							published to procure the papers for the last six weeks, to send to
								<persRef ref="jackson-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jackson</persRef> at Paris— I could procure only three odd numbers
							of Cobbett; and none of the Morning Chronicle. The tax of four pence
							Sterling upon every Newspapers, prevents the Editors from printing any
							supernumerary Sheets— I took this day’s Chronicle, and left it with the
							odd sheets of Cobbett to be sent by <persRef ref="gallaudet-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallaudet</persRef>— This Gentleman is
							desirous of obtaining through the medium of the <persRef
								ref="bourke-edmund">Danish Minister</persRef> or otherwise, a
							publication of a <persRef ref="castberg-peter">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Castberg</persRef>, employed by the Danish Government to
							travel for information relative to the Institutions, for instructing the
							deaf and dumb— I wrote a Note to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourke,
							enquiring if he could put me in the way of procuring that publication—
							The Carriage came as I had ordered it at five O Clock; but <persRef
								ref="brant-richard">Richard</persRef> brought with him a man named
								<persRef ref="martin-robert2">Robert Martin</persRef>, whom he
							recommended to be footman in his place— He detained me some time to make
							enquiries concerning him; and it was thus near 7 O’Clock when I got
							home— No Evening after dinner— <persRef key="adams-george"
								>George</persRef> had been at home from Noon— <persRef

							one from <persRef ref="wilberforce-william">M<hi rend="superscript"

							have now however no alternative but to take him; for <persRef
								ref="brant-richard">Richard Brant</persRef> left me this Morning—

							with the Account that the Captain and Crew, nineteen men, of the
							American Ship Baltimore, had arrived there in a Packet, having abandoned

								>Planta</persRef>, and five or six others whom I did not know. The
							invitation was for a quarter before seven— I went at seven, and was the
							first there. We sat down to table at Eight and rose about ten. I sat
							between Fernan-Nuñez and Freire—Spain and Portugal. The Spanish
							Ambassador spoke to me, of the Accounts in the Newspapers of this day,
							that <persRef ref="onis-luis">Don Onis</persRef> had left finally
							Washington, and that an immediate War, between the United States and
							Spain was expected, and he expressed great surprize at them— I regretted
							the Circumstance very much and deprecated a War— He said he thought the
							American Government should not suffer any assistance to be given to the
							South American insurgents; nor admit the vessels bearing their flag into
							our Ports— For since the insurgent chief <persRef ref="morelos-jose"
								>Morales</persRef> had been taken, and since Carthagena had
							surrendered they had no Government— They were mere robbers and Pirates.
							They could have no flag.— I told him that was a thing of which the
							American Government could not make themselves the judges— They had
							issued a Proclamation forbidding the Citizens of the United States from
							giving aid to the South American Insurgents, but they could not prevent
							individuals from going out of the U.S. They had no walled frontier
							towns, and scarcely any army. As to prohibiting all commerce with the
							South-Americans, and excluding their flag, it was not to be expected of
							any Government. He knew, and I knew, that it had been refused by the
							British Government, the close ally of Spain—(he nodded assent) and the
							American Government had done every thing for Spain on this occasion that
							Great-Britain had done— And if the Chevalier Onis had left Washington
							for that cause, I did not see but that he, Fernan-Nuñez, must go away
							from London, for the same reason. He laughed and said it was not his
							affair.— But he added that lately he had reason to be satisfied with
							what he had obtained here, against the South-Americans— It is an order
							in Council, prohibiting the exportation to them of arms and ammunition—
							He asked me if I had been acquainted with the <persRef
								ref="bardaji-eusebio">Chevalier Bardaxi</persRef> at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg.— I had, an enquired where he
							now was— He said, at Madrid; not in public Office; but holding still
							that of Minister in Russia— He said Bardaxi had been a very ardent
							Patriot, and apparently a warm admirer of the Constitution made by the
							Cortes; but that had not been his real sentiment— It was only because
							the Constitution had been drawn up by his intimate friend, who had
							prevailed upon him to support it with his influence. I asked him if
							there was any truth in the report, that <persRef ref="charles-iv">king
								Charles the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi></persRef> was about
							returning to Spain— He said No. That the report had arisen, because four
							frigates had sailed from Cadix, upon some expedition; and it was thought
							they were gone to take him, and his wife; who were at Rome— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Freire told me that he had been acquainted
							with my father, and very intimate in the family, when they were here
							from 1785 to 1788 and lived in Grosvenor Square— And he spoke with much
							gratitude of the treatment he had met with in America, while he was
							Minister there, which was during the Presidency of <persRef
								key="adams-john">my father</persRef>. Lord Mulgrave introduced me to
							the Earl of Cassilis, who told me that <persRef ref="kennedy-robert">his
								brother</persRef> owned a valuable estate in the City of New-York.—
								<persRef ref="kennedy-anne">His mother</persRef> it appears was a
							native of New-York— I spoke to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton,
							the Under Secretary of State, about the copies of <persRef
								ref="dobbs-arthur">Governor Dobbs’s</persRef> Commission and
							Instructions, and asked him what fees were to be paid for them— He said
							none— The demands for fees in their public offices he said, were not
							very systematic— There were certain specified papers for which fees were
							prescribed, such as for instance the exequatur upon Consul’s
							Commissions; but none were allowed for copies of public papers of any
							kind— He asked me if I had received the answer with respect to the
							discrimination upon American and British Shipping, in the Irish Ports— I
							said I had not— He said it was then owing altogether owing to the
							Indisposition of <persRef ref="cooke-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Cooke</persRef>, (the other Under-Secretary of State in
							the foreign Department.) That the vessels of the two Nations would
							undoubtedly be put on the same footing, perhaps by increasing the
							restrictions on British vessels, with regard to Passengers, as a check
							upon emigration. I spoke to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton of
							the Petition from Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Drayton to the Lords
							of the Treasury, of which I told him the substance and asked him if I
							could send it to him— He said he would take charge of it, and if it went
							from the foreign Department to the Treasury it would be immediately
							referred to the proper officer, and perhaps obtain a speedier answer.
							While I was in Conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton
							the Carriage came, and I was obliged to leave him— It was about half
							past twelve at Night when we reached home— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Adams was and had been very unwell the whole day, and after

							Braham, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Salmon, and Barnett were the

							left M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams &amp; George at Craven
							Street, and went to the very small party at the <persRef
								ref="pettyfitzmaurice-louisa">Marchioness Dowager of
								Lansdowne’s</persRef>. It was a Ball, and the two Drawing Rooms,
							were so crowded with company that there was scarcely room for dancing or
							even for moving in them— I made my bow to her Ladyship, whom I found out
							as well as I could for I saw nobody whom I knew to introduce me; but she
							said how do ye do, and I passed on— When I went in, the <persRef
								ref="ernest-augustus">Duke of Cumberland</persRef> was conversing
							with her— The only dancing was the Valse. There were three times more
							Ladies than Gentlemen present, and one of the young Ladies said to a

							only persons whom I knew, were the <persRef ref="fane-john">Earl of

							and <persRef ref="bourke-maria">his Lady</persRef>, <persRef

							attached to the Embassy here, the <persRef ref="pfeffel-christian"
								>Bavarian</persRef> and <persRef ref="vonberoldingen-joseph"
								>Wurtemberg Ministers</persRef>, and the Austrian Secretary of
							Embassy <persRef ref="neumann-philipp">Neumann</persRef>. I expected to
							have met there the <persRef ref="pettyfitzmaurice-henry">Marquis of

							I had some conversation with Lord Westmorland, about the large military
							establishment, and the Property tax, which now form the principal
							subjects of the discussions in Parliament— He said the Military
							Establishment was very large, but not greater than upon considering the
							details was found indispensably necessary. And yet among other things,
							they were charged with the intention of going to War with America,
							because with a frontier he supposed of 1200 miles there they had two or
							three thousand men more than formerly. I said laughingly, that I hoped
							the charge was not true; that they did not intend going to War with us—
							He protested to me with the utmost solemnity that they had not the most
							distant intention of going to War with any Nation, and most especially
							not with us. He said that before, when the War with us, had been only
							one more enemy added to those with whom they were already engaged, they
							had not felt it so much. But after they had made Peace with France, then
							it was that they found the American War excessively burdensome— And now,
							what could they possibly get, by a War with America? I told him,
							certainly nothing which could compensate for the cost of obtaining it;
							and I was happy to find that he thought so— I asked him how he thought
							the Property tax would go? He spoke of it doubtfully, and rather
							unfavourably of the tax— I told him, I had thought the Ministers
							intended to lose it in the house of Commons. He did not deny it, and
							expressed his expectation that they would not have to debate upon it in
							the house of Peers.— He asked me about the state of our affairs with
							Spain, and whether we were likely to have a War, with that Country— I
							said I hoped not, but I had no official Account, of the Spanish
							Minister’s having left Washington as was stated in the newspapers— He
							asked if I knew whether the foreign Department here had received any
							official intelligence of it— I did not know— It was about one in the
							morning when I left the house of the Marchioness; and went to Craven
							Street where, I took up M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and
							George. We then returned home, and it was past three in the Morning when
							we reached our own house— There had been at the Office in Craven Street,
							a Frenchman named <persRef ref="u">Thibert</persRef>, the author of a
							French and English Grammar which he is about to publish, and wishes to
							introduce into the United States under my Patronage— I desired <persRef

							tell him that <persRef ref="dufief-nicolas">Dufief</persRef> was

							House, between Acton and Gunnersbury I saw two women, one of them with a

							My attention was caught by hearing the woman with the child say, “Yes
							there is, as there is a God in Heaven! . . . There is a man there with a
							hat on— She then shrieked; and the other woman screamed, and immediately
							two men, and two women ran out from the yard of a house opposite— The
							man in the house had perceived the woman as she first spoke; immediately
							jumped out of a back window, and ran off towards Acton— There was no
							enclosure round the house, and only a gate opening from the road to it—
							The two men from the opposite house ran after him, but he had too much
							the start of them— A woman from a chamber window of the opposite house
							said she had seen the man go into the house—that he was a genteel fellow
							and wore a blue Coat. The woman with the Child it appeared lived in the
							house, which is scarcely bigger than a Porter’s lodge; she had gone out
							leaving no person in the house, and this man was a thief, who thus at
							noon day went in to rob the house. The woman was ready to faint and they
							took her into the opposite house— She said it was the second time this
							had happened: The man would have escaped but just after he had got off,
							there came up a man in a light cart with a horse, who immediately turned
							round, and raced back by the road to catch him at Acton— I then
							proceeded on my walk home and after passing Gunnersbury the man in the
							Cart passed me, again, returning, and told me he had caught the thief,
							and that several things belonging to the house had been found upon him.
							As I pursued my way home I met a boy of 13 or 14. standing beside a

							had an old bag with some copper pence and half-pence in it, instead of a

							ascertain and write to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams to inform
							her to-morrow— We returned to Craven-Street, where I left M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams, and went down to the foreign
							Office I enquired for <persRef ref="cooke-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook</persRef>, but he was not there—
							I saw <persRef ref="hamilton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hamilton</persRef>, and asked him whether the discrimination between
							British and American Vessells in Ireland was yet removed— He said not
							yet— But Lord Castlereagh had spoken to him about it again this
							Morning.— It would certainly be done, but the business in Parliament,
							and especially the pressure about the Property tax, had so absorbed all
							the time lately that they could do nothing else— I mentioned that I had
							seen by the Newspapers that <persRef ref="robinson-frederick">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson</persRef> was introducing a
							Bill into the House of Commons, for carrying into execution the
							Convention of 3 July 1815. and I had wished to ascertain if this Irish
							affair had been provided for in that Bill. He said he did not know but
							advised me to see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson, whom he
							thought I should find at the Board of Trade.— I enquired if he had
							received the tin Cylinder box for me, from Hamburg, containing <persRef
								ref="bode-johann">Bode’s</persRef> Astronomical Charts; but he had
							not— I asked him if he thought the Property tax would be carried in the
							House of Commons— He said it would be hard run, and spoke doubtingly— I
							hinted that I thought the Ministers intended to lose it, but he said Oh!
							No! it was a measure of too much importance for that— I saw at the
							foreign Office, <persRef ref="vonjacobikloest-konstans">Baron
								Jacobi</persRef> and <persRef ref="bourke-edmund">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourke</persRef>, the Prussian and
							Danish Ministers.— I called at the Board of Trade, saw M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson, and enquired of him whether the
							Irish Discrimination was abolished by his Bill— He said no; and entered
							upon an argument to shew that it was not within the objects and purview
							of the Convention— I told him there had been some discussion upon the
							Question, in writing, between Lord Castlereagh, and myself, and that
							although his Lordship maintained as he did that it was not strictly
							within the purpose of the Convention; yet I had understood him as
							promising that the question as to the right would be waived, and the
							discrimination in fact done away— That the Ships of the two Nations
							should be placed at all events on the same footing— He said, if so he
							would see and consult with the Irish Government, whether it could be
							introduced into his Bill, or must be done by a separate act. Indeed when
							the Convention was signed he had not been aware that this discrimination
							existed, and he thought its policy rested upon another motive— It
							restricted the number of Passengers, perhaps with a view to the comfort
							of the Passengers themselves, and from a supposition that they might
							suffer in health from being too much crowded.— I said I could scarcely
							think that was the motive—because the difference between the
							restrictions upon British and Americans was too great— That upon the
							British vessels was amply sufficient to ensure the health and comfort of
							the Passengers; and it was besides the Interest of the Captains who took
							Passengers, to make their accommodations healthy and comfortable— That
							Lord Castlereagh had supposed a different motive for the
							restriction—namely as an indirect check upon emigration— He had
							therefore told me that perhaps the equalization would be effected, not
							by diminishing the restriction upon American Vessels; but by increasing
							that upon the British. I had told him that this Government must
							exclusively judge of that— We could not interfere with any regulations
							of theirs the sole object of which might be to controul emigration; but
							we asked that they should be the same, upon the shipping of both
							Nations— In this case, the difference operated upon the Cargoes of the
							ships which carried Passengers, and thus I thought brought the point
							within the very Letter of the Convention— Provisions were among the
							principal Articles of exportation from Ireland; and they must
							necessarily form a considerable part of the Cargo, of a vessel carrying
							two or three hundred Passengers. A limitation of the number of
							Passengers, would also be a limitation upon the quantity of Provisions
							to be taken for their consumption, upon the Passage, and the whole
							together would produce the same effect as a prohibitory duty— He thought
							it could hardly be considered in that light, but said however that if
							Lord Castlereagh had engaged that the difference should be done away, he
							would see that it should be accomplished in one way or the other— I
							asked him if his Bill provided for the equalization <pb n="413"
								type="ms"/>of the Tonnage duties?— He said No. That the only
							discrimination of Tonnage duties between British and foreign shipping
							was made in favour of certain chartered Corporations—for instance the
							Trinity House— For light money, and some other charges of that kind,
							Parliament could not take these away; but the mode of carrying the
							Convention in this respect into execution would be by observing in
							favour of American vessels, a regulation already established and
							practised for Portuguese Vessels, which are entitled by Treaty to the
							same Privileges— That is to levy the extra-duties, but to have them
							returned by allowance at the Custom-House— He recollected that at one of
							the Meetings for the Negotiation of the Treaty he had mentioned this to
							the <persRef ref="gallatin-albert;clay-henry">American
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>— He said it had been expected when we
							signed the Treaty that a Proclamation of the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">President of the United States</persRef> founded
							upon the Act of Congress of the preceding Session would have removed the
							discriminating duties independently of the ratification of the
							Convention.— I told him that the reasons assigned to me by the American
								<persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef>, why such a
							Proclamation had not issued were, that the order in Council of August
							had not been officially communicated either to me, or through <persRef
								ref="baker-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>
							to the American Government—and that it had made no mention of Tonnage
							Duties. It had therefore been thought best to wait till the Ratification
							of the Convention, and afterwards to come to an Understanding about the
							time, when it should begin to operate— My own opinion was, and I had
							expressed it to my own Government as well as to <persRef
								ref="jenkinson-robert">Lords Liverpool</persRef> and Castlereagh,
							that the Convention took effect from the day of the signature, and that
							all extra duties contrary to it, levied after that time, must be
							refunded by both Governments— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson
							questioned this, but upon reflection said he thought its effect would be
							in favour of Great-Britain which I admitted. He said the omission to
							communicate officially the Order in Council had certainly been wrong;
							but the neglect was not in his department— Nor was that even relating to
							the tonnage duties; for an official notice that the allowance for them
							was to be made had been sent to the Treasury, and he had been surprized
							to find, upon being informed of my late application upon the subject,
							that the Treasury had not acted upon it— He had lately been there, and
							shewed them this notice, sent to them at the time; but they could give
							no account why it had not been acted upon; though they admitted that it
							had not— He would see however that it should be properly attended to in
							future— On leaving M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson I returned to
							Craven Street, where I found a Frenchman, who came to enquire whether
							his brother, a military Officer, could if he should go to America,
							obtain a Commission in the American Army— I could give him no
							encouragement— Our Coachman had barely time to go and change his horses;
							and as the roads were very heavy, it was almost eight O’Clock when we
							got home.</p>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Von Harten</persRef>— By the

								<persRef key="adams-thomas">brother</persRef> at Quincy; and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams had one from <persRef
								ref="welsh-harriet">Miss Harriet Welsh</persRef>, of 19. February—
							My Mother had been upwards of a Month very dangerously ill, and there is
							an anxiety of encouragement in her own Letter, and in those that came
							with it, which rather increase than diminish my alarm. They deeply
							affected my Spirits— The Letters from my brother also gave occasion to
							some reflections not altogether pleasing; though of a different nature.—
							They engaged me the whole Evening— <persRef ref="smith-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> also sent me out a
							Letter from <persRef ref="lock-hugh">Hugh Lock</persRef> the man of the

							if he brought me a certificate from them that the charges were proper

							but being persuaded he did not shew them my Letter, I determined to see
							them before I pay the Bill. I received from them last Night a Letter,
							enclosing Papers and asking my advice concerning an American Vessel, the
							Sabine, captured by the English in East-Florida, within the Spanish
							Territorial Jurisdiction—concerning which they as the Agents of the
							American owners <pb n="414" type="ms"/>have written to <persRef

								State</persRef>, and soon after Nine this Morning left home with
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and went into London. We
							stopped at Craven Street— We had expected there would have been a Letter
							of notice from <persRef ref="stewart-amelia">Lady Castlereagh</persRef>,
							to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams or from <persRef
								ref="chester-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chester</persRef> to me, but there was none— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs:</hi> Adams went to <persRef ref="king-eliza">M<hi

							Street to dress— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hartshorn</persRef> an American called for a Passport, which was
							given him. He mentioned having once dined with me several years ago, at
								<persRef ref="amory-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T. C.
								Amory’s</persRef> in Boston— While he was at the office I received a
							Note from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester, the assistant Master
							of the Ceremonies, by his Servant, enquiring whether I had received a
							note which he had written me yesterday, and whether he might expect me
							at half past three O’Clock to go to my Audience of the <persRef
								ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef>.— I knew not what this could mean.
							The Drawing Room was appointed for two O’Clock, and I saw my Audience
							was to be after it; but knew not whether it was understood that M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams was to be presented at the Drawing
							Room, or to wait for Another— I apologized to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hartshorn for leaving him, and walked to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester’s House 68 South Audley Street. I
							had not received his Note written yesterday; but found that although I
							was to have my Audience, after the Drawing Room, and could of course not
							appear at it, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams was still to be
							presented at it. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester had proposed to
							me to call upon him and go at half past three, to spare me the trouble
							of waiting there until the Drawing Room should be over; but as in that
							case M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams would have been obliged to
							go alone, would be a stranger there, and might miss of meeting Lady
							Castlereagh, I concluded to go with her and wait; M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester agreed to go with us— I went to
								<persRef ref="king-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								King’s</persRef> at Conduit Street, and informed her of this
							arrangement— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Von-Harten</persRef>, <persRef ref="morrison-jane">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Morison</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="u">Miss Carnell</persRef> were there, to see her dressed. I
							then took a Hackney Coach to go to Craven Street, but met my own
							Carriage on the way. Went in it— Dressed at Craven Street— Returned to
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> King’s and took up M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams— Called and took up M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester at his house, and at a few minutes
							after two were at Buckingham house— <persRef
								ref="bathurst-henry;bathurst-georgina">Earl and Countess
								Bathurst</persRef> arrived just at the same time that we did. There
							is a special entrance into the Park, reserved for certain privileged
							persons, among whom are the foreign Ministers, and for which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester gave us a ticket. The convenience
							of it is to avoid the crowd, and waiting. It is the entrance by
							Constitution Hill, at Hyde Park Corner— There is also a Hall, adjoining
							that where the Drawing Room is held, where only the privileged persons
							are admitted, and their presentations are before those of the Crowd of
							nobility and gentry of the Country. These are kept in a Hall below— Lady
							Castlereagh did not arrive until after the first part of the
							presentations was over so that to avoid the Crowd, Countess Bathurst
							presented M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams— When the crowd from
							below were shewn up into the Hall, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Chester shewed me in to that which they had left, and I waited there
							until the Drawing Room was over. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams
							after having been presented met <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert"
								>Lord</persRef> and Lady Castlereagh, as they were just going in—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester told us that Lady Castlereagh
							was noted for always coming too late— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Adams returned then to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> King’s, and sent
							back the Carriage for me— I waited in the Hall below until past four
							O’Clock— While I was there, the <persRef
								ref="frederickaugustus;frederica">Duke and Duchess of
							York</persRef>, passed through it, going by a private passage, to the
							drawing-room, and the <persRef ref="augustusfrederick">Duke of
								Sussex</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="williamfrederick;mary2"
								>Duke, and Princess Sophia of Gloucester</persRef>, in coming from
							it. The Duke of Sussex stopped and spoke to me— He talked of the victory
							gained by the fall of the property tax, and remarked to me that he was
							in a court dress, not a military uniform, because in time of Peace it
							was proper to lay that aside. After changing his Dress in a next Room he
							said “You are going to have your Audience, and must wait some time. I am
							going to dine with about five hundred Jews.” I laughed and said “I see
							your Royal Highness is of all Religions.”— “Yes![”] said he; at least
							for tolerating them all— And for supporting the Ministers of the
							established Religion, in such a manner, as should not alienate from them
							the affection of their flocks— He said he was also going to a Ball at
							the <persRef ref="wood-matthew">Lord Mayor’s</persRef>— Part of the time
							while I was waiting, <persRef ref="vonberoldingen-joseph">Count
								Beroldingen</persRef>, the Minister from the king of Wurtemberg was
							also there. He had a letter from the <persRef
								ref="frederick-i-wurttemburg">king</persRef> to the <persRef
								ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef>, and another to Queen,
							announcing the Marriage of the <persRef ref="frederickwilhelmkarl">Crown
								Prince of Wurtemberg</persRef> his Son, with the <persRef
								ref="catherinepavlovna">Grand Duchess Catherine</persRef> of Russia,
							Dowager of the <persRef ref="peter-friedrich">Prince of
								Oldenburg</persRef>. These Letters were to be delivered in private
							Audiences, but the question of etiquette was, whether the Queen could
							receive the one addressed to her, before that to the Prince Regent had
							been delivered to him— The Count had asked the question, and was kept
							waiting for the answer until I returned from my Audience— He was then
							told that the Queen could not receive the Letter in private Audience,
							until after the Prince Regent should have received his— But that if he
							the Count preferred it, he might send the Letter for the Queen to the
								<persRef ref="seymourconway-francis">Lord Chamberlain</persRef>— He
							chose to deliver it in private Audience, but was somewhat mortified at
							the manner in which he was treated, and told me that they did not
							understand here, their own rules of etiquette.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Chester accompanied and conducted me to the Queen’s Cabinet.
							The <persRef ref="douglas-george">Earl of Morton</persRef>, her
							Majesty’s Lord Chamberlain introduced me— The Queen was standing about
							the middle of the Chamber. Just behind her at her right hand stood the
								<persRef ref="augustasophia">Princess Augusta</persRef>, at her left
							the Princess Mary—further back several Ladies in waiting, and the
								<persRef ref="edward">Duke of Kent</persRef> in Military Uniform.
								<pb n="415" type="ms"/>I had been repeatedly told and particularly
							by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester this Morning, that the Queen
							always expected on these occasions to be addressed in a set Speech— I
							said thus—“Madam! The <persRef ref="madison-james">President of the
								United States</persRef> having accredited me to His Royal Highness
							the Prince Regent, I have been ambitious of the honour of being admitted
							to your Majesty’s presence, to assure you of the respect entertained by
							the Government of the United States for your Majesty’s person— When upon
							a former occasion Your Majesty was pleased to appoint a time for that
							purpose, I was confined by illness; a circumstance with which I hope
							Your Majesty was made acquainted. I am now happy to be able to avail
							myself of your Majesty’s permission; and pray you to accept the
							assurance of the veneration uniformly felt by the American Government
							for your Majesty’s Character. The political Relations between the two
							Countries have been subject to the versatility which attends all human
							affairs. Causes of dissension, and even of enmity have sometimes
							unfortunately arisen between them— These are now removed— It is hoped
							and most earnestly desired <unclear>by my</unclear> Country, that they may be permanently
							removed. But the reverence commanded by your Majesty’s virtues, is
							subject to no such change— It has been invariably entertained by my
							Government, under every variety of Circumstance, and I can express no
							wish more propitious to the happiness of both Countries, than that the
							friendship and harmony between them, may hereafter be equally lasting,
							and unalterable.” The Queen answered that she was much obliged to the
							American Government for the sentiments I had expressed in their home,
							and with respect to myself, she had much regretted the illness that I
							mentioned— She asked me several questions concerning it—what it had
							been?—how long I had been confined with it? whether I was perfectly
							recovered? whether it had been the effect of the climate? all which I
							answered as briefly as possible— She enquired also concerning the
							climate of my own Country, and I told her how much milder and more
							pleasant I found that of England, than the one from which I had last
							come, which was Russia— She asked me whether I was related to the
								<persRef key="adams-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Adams</persRef> who had been formerly the Minister to this Country,
							and appeared surprized when I answered that I was his Son— She forgot
							that I had given her the same answer to the same question twenty years
							ago; and had apparently no recollection that I had ever been presented
							to her before— She now dismissed me, and I withdrew with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester— The Carriage had returned— I took
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester home, and then went to Stable
							yard, and wrote my name in the books, at the Residences of the Duke of
							York and his Duchess, of the <persRef
								ref="ernest-augustus;frederica-sophia">Duke and Duchess of
								Cumberland</persRef>, and of the <persRef ref="william">Duke of
								Clarence</persRef>— Thence I returned to Craven Street, signed the
							note to Lord Castlereagh, of which <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Le Soeuf</persRef> the young Man,
							hired by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith as a Clerk, had made out a
							copy, since the morning; and then went to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> King’s for M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and
								<persRef ref="hauel-lucy">Lucy</persRef>. <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bibby</persRef> was there— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> King and <persRef ref="francis-john">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis</persRef> soon afterwards came
							in— It was near six when we set out to return home— On our way, we
							called at the Duke of Gloucester’s where I wrote my name on his book,
							and at the Apartments of the Duke of Kent and of the Duke of Sussex, at
							Kensington Palace. It was about eight when we reached home, and there I
							found the Note from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester, which he had
							written at my Office yesterday, and sent by the Post; but which arrived
							here after we were gone, this Morning.</p>

								>Secretary of State</persRef>, to enclose a copy of the Note to
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, which
							was sent last Evening. I was obliged to go early into London, and for
							the first time since the Winter went in the Curricle, and by the Acton
							and Bayswater Road; as this led me to the upper extremity of London, I
							stopped at <persRef ref="delreal-jose">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Del-Real’s</persRef> lodgings, but he was not at home— I then went
							down by the City Road, and passing through Finsbury Square, stopped to
							see <persRef ref="williams-samuel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S.
								Williams</persRef>— I requested him to purchase for me a thousand
							French 20 frank pieces, or Portuguese Gold to about the same amount, on
							the supposition that gold will be worth more here within a year or two
							than it is now— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams appeared to be
							doubtful whether it would. The Exchanges are now all so much in favour
							of this Country that the price of gold scarcely exceeds its standard
							value at the Mint— I next went to the Counting house of <persRef
								ref="glennieandson">Glennie, Son and C<hi rend="superscript"
								>o.</hi></persRef> and there dismissed the Coachman with orders to
							come for me to the Office in Craven Street at 5. O’Clock. I saw <persRef
								ref="glennie-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Glennie jun<hi
									rend="superscript">r:</hi></persRef> and <persRef
								ref="fry-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fry</persRef>—
							Mentioned to them the Letter I had received from them concerning the
							case of the Sabine, and enquired what they wished me to do— They wanted
							to obtain from the <persRef ref="delosrios-carlos">Spanish
								Ambassador</persRef>, an authority to enter at the Court of
							Admiralty an appeal of Jurisdiction— I promised to write to him for that
							purpose. I enquired if they had received from S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t:</hi> Andero, the Evidence, concerning the case of <persRef
								ref="karthaus-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Karthaus’s</persRef> vessel, which they had written for— They had
							received an answer, but not the evidence, which they however still
							expected to obtain— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fry doubted whether
							any restitution or indemnity could be obtained from the British
							Government in this case; because at the time of the capture of the
							vessel, S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Andero was itself in the
							military Possession of the British, and the Spanish Government there was
							superseded— I asked whether they had received any remittances from the
							Navy Department for the payment of <persRef ref="mccall-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Call’s</persRef> bills? Oh! Yes!
							they had received a remittance of £20,000 Sterling. They should
							therefore repay to <persRef ref="baringbrothers">Mess<hi
									rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Baring</persRef> their advances, and
							have a balance of about £6000 subject to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							M’Call’s further Bills, of which they had already written to give him
							notice— They also informed me that <persRef ref="chauncey-isaac"
								>Commodore Chauncey</persRef> was coming out to take the Command of
							the Squadron in the Mediterranean— I shewed them <persRef
								ref="lock-hugh">Lock’s</persRef> Bill, and asked if they had
							certified it to be proper and customary. Fry said he had. <pb n="416"
								type="ms"/>I asked him whether Lock, had, with his Bill, shewn him
							also, my Letter objecting against it, of which I gave him a copy to
							read. He said No— Lock had shewn him nothing but his Bill— He, Fry had
							told Lock that the charge of five guineas for agency had been too much;
							that a guinea, or a guinea and a half was enough. But Lock told him that
							he never had had so much trouble with any thing in his life. Lock had
							been several years a Clerk in their Counting House; he was a very good
							young Man, and <persRef ref="u">his father</persRef> was a Custom-house
							Officer— They always found it useful to be well with those People at the
							Custom-House— They had for example some time ago shipped all the baggage
							of <persRef ref="laval-jean">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Laval</persRef> for S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Petersburg, and
							it would have been very inconvenient to have had all the trunks and
							boxes opened— By the good will of the Officers they let them all pass—
							So he had given him this Certificate— But if I would leave the Bill with
							him, he would settle it with Lock for me. I left it accordingly and then
							called at the Counting House of the Brothers Baring— They shewed me a
							Letter from the Secretary of State directing them to pay <persRef
								ref="erving-george">G. W. Erving’s</persRef> Salary as Minister to
							Spain, with arrears from August 1814. and a Letter from G. W. Erving, 9.
								Feb<hi rend="superscript">y:</hi> at Boston, requesting Letters for
							him to be sent to <persRef ref="hottinguer-jean">Hottinguer</persRef> at
							Paris— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baring shewed me also a Letter to
							them from <persRef ref="crowninshield-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crowninshield</persRef> Secretary of the Navy,
							requesting them to undertake the Navy Agency, to pay the Bills of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Call, and of Commodore Chauncey, and to
							make advances occasionally for the Department if it should be
							necessary—declaring at the same time the determination to close the
							Accounts with the former Agents (the Glennie’s.) M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Baring said they had answered that they should very readily
							undertake the agency, and only requested that the Credits given upon
							them should be as specific as possible. I asked, if the Glennie’s had
							informed them that they had received remittances to repay their advances
							for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Call’s Bills— He said they had not—
							I desired him, if they should not in the course of a week or ten days
							give that notice, to let me know, and I would write to them about it—
							From M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baring’s I went to <persRef
								ref="smithpayneandsmith">Smith, Payne, and Smith</persRef> Bankers,
							and received payment of <persRef ref="ludlow-gulian">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ludlow’s</persRef> Bill on <persRef
								ref="minetsandstride">Minet and Stride</persRef>, and then walked to
							the Office in Craven Street, where I found M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Del Real, and his interpreters— He enquired if I had any
							knowledge of the arrival at Washington of a <persRef ref="qual-peter"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter Qual</persRef>, as Deputy
							from the Government of New Grenada. I told him I had heard generally
							that there were at Washington deputies from the South American
							Provinces, but not particularly the name of that person. He said he knew
							of his arrival at New-York; but had not heard from him at Washington. He
							then enquired what foundation there was for the rumour generally
							circulating here, of a rupture between the United States and Spain. I
							knew nothing further than had appeared in the English Newspapers. I had
							heard of a Correspondence in December and January, between the Secretary
							of State, and the Spanish Minister <persRef ref="onis-luis"
								>Onis</persRef>, which had been communicated by the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">President</persRef> to Congress, and the
							supposed substance of which had been published here. I had heard that
							the Correspondence itself had been published in some Newspaper here, but
							I had not seen it. Further, it had been said that about the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of last Month M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Onis had left Washington, and that all communication between
							him and the American Government had been broken off— Later Accounts,
							equally unauthenticated, contradicted this last Circumstance, but
							repeated that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis had left Washington
							much dissatisfied. It was impossible for me to say what the real State
							of the Relations between the U.S. and Spain were, but as to the Question
							of Peace or War, I was persuaded it would depend upon Spain herself. If
							the demands of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Onis had been such as they
							were represented, the American Government neither would nor could comply
							with them— The present course of Spanish policy was incomprehensible. If
							such demands were made, it could not be but with a knowledge, that they
							must and would be refused. In ordinary cases, the very making of such
							demands would imply a settled determination of the Power advancing them
							to follow up the refusal of them by immediate War. If such was the
							intention of Spain, the United States would have no alternative left but
							to defend themselves. But they had no desire for a War with Spain. As to
							the South American Provinces struggling for their Independence, the
							general Sentiment in the United States was certainly in their favour.
							But the Policy of the Government, a Policy dictated equally by their
							duty to their own Country, by their state of amity with Spain, and by
							their good-will to the South-Americans themselves, was a strict and
							impartial neutrality between them and Spain. I said by their good will
							for the South Americans themselves, because the neutrality of the United
							States, was more advantageous to them by securing to them also the
							neutrality of Great-Britain, than any support which the U.S could give
							them, by declaring in their favour and making Common Cause with them,
							the effect of which probably would be to make Great Britain declare
							against both. He was aware that the popular feeling in this Country was
							now favourable to the South Americans— More so than the dispositions of
							the present Ministry. They complied so far with the prevailing opinion
							as to observe a neutrality. But the same popular Sentiment here, he knew
							was very strong against the North-Americans, and if the United States
							were openly to join the Cause of South-America, and consequently be
							engaged in a War with Spain, the British People would immediately
							consider them as the Principals in the contest: all their Jealousies,
							and national antipathies, would be enlisted against the Common American
							Cause, and as they are even now tormented with an uneasy hankering for
							War, which they think would relieve them from their embarrassments,
							their Ministers would take advantage of these Passions, and engage this
							Nation upon the side of Spain, merely because the United States would be
							on the other side.— He said he was perfectly convinced of the Justice of
							these Observations— I asked him, if he had any knowledge of an Order <pb
								n="417" type="ms"/>in Council, lately issued here, prohibiting all
							British Subjects from supplying arms, ammunition and warlike Stores to
							the South-Americans. He said he had not. That the professed system of
							this Government had always been and continued to be neutrality. That
							they allowed a free intercourse between Jamaica, and the South American
							Continent; and had given orders to their Admirals on that Station not to
							molest the Independent flag, and had refused to deliver up vessels

						<p><date>24. VI: </date>Wrote before Breakfast part of a long Letter to
								<persRef key="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef>. Went to Church— So
							did <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef>. Prayers were read by a Stranger for
							the fourth Sunday in Lent; and <persRef ref="milman-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Milman</persRef> read another Sermon,
							upon Isaiah IX.6. being the fourth on the same Text— His Subject this
							day, was upon the words “the Everlasting Father[”]; but the whole of
							this text far transcends M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Milman’s powers.
							The translation of this text in the English Bible differs very
							materially from that in the German Bible, and from those in both my
							French Bibles— The Latin Vulgate has it Parvulus enim Natus est nobis,
							et filius datus est nobis, et factus est principatus super humerum ejus;
							et vocabitur nomen ejus, Admirabilis, Consiliarius, Deus, fortis, pater
							futuri saeculi, princeps pacis. Here the term Mighty, is a separate, and
							Distinct epithet from that of God, and instead of the everlasting
							father, it is the father of the future age. Luther’s Bible instead of
							God, translates it <hi rend="italic">Held</hi> (Hero), and the Geneva
							Bible gives the word Dieu, in Italics, and for the term itself gives <hi
								rend="italic">Fort</hi> (Strong) I have not <persRef
								ref="lowth-robert">Lowth’s</persRef> Isaiah to consult, and am not
							hebraist enough to understand the original— But from all these
							variations in the translations I infer that the term God, as used in
							this text is not unequivocal— That it is not Jehovah; nor any of the
							names given in the Old Testament to the Supreme Creator, but rather an
							attribute, usually applied to him— If so it is not one of the texts
							adducible to support the Divinity of Christ, and all M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Milman’s scaffolding upon that part of his
							Discourse, falls to the ground— A similar observation applies to this
							term everlasting father— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Milman aukwardly
							and feebly stated that the expressions here do not mean God the father,
							which as the translation stands they certainly appear to import— But if
							they were as in the Latin—the father of the future age; there could be
							no misunderstanding about them. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Milman’s
							discourse consisted chiefly of a parallel between the characteristics of
							a natural father and the spiritual paternity of Christ— Once in that
							train the Sermon was just as long as he chose to make it— But it natural
							ran out into Common Place— After Church we paid visits at <persRef
								ref="nicholas-george2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nicholas’s</persRef> where we met several other visitors, and at
								<persRef ref="morrison-alexander">Major Morison’s</persRef>, where
							we found nobody at home— We saw and spoke however to the Major, in his
							yard— I came home and wrote in this Journal until five; but without
							redeeming even an entire day— Short walk before dinner; and a few pages
							of <persRef ref="depradt-dominique">De Pradt</persRef> in the

							and continued in the endeavour to retrieve my arrears— Finished the

							and Ealing— The Evening Post, which always arrives while we are at

							with stealing from a wreck; and a Letter from a man who wants me to
							appoint him their Attorney. This Evening I finished reading the <persRef
								ref="depradt-dominique">Abbe de Pradt’s</persRef> Book upon the
							Congress of Vienna— A Book of great pretensions and little merit— The
							author was an Archbishop and Ambassador of <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon’s</persRef> making. His aumonier,
							and an officer of the Legion of Honour After his fall, he betrayed and
							libelled him, as he does in this book; he is a conspicuous personage in
							the Dictionnaire des Girouettes. It is impossible to say what the object
							of this Work is; but he praises and blames the Congress in his own way,
							which is different from that of every body else— There is in it, as in
							many of the French writers since the Revolution, a deficiency of moral
							principle betraying itself in every page— A political system is
							substituted in its stead as the basis of all reasoning and thus measures
							are urged or deprecated, not according to their bearing upon right or
							wrong, but according to their influence and tendency, in relation to the
							political system— If there is any settled design of this Book, it is to
							excite the fear and jealousy of all Europe, against Russia— As to
							England he is in character—Janus-faced— In one passage sounding the
							alarm against her, and in another paying her parasitical Court. But
							towards Russia, he is all bitterness, and his most aggravated charge
							against the Congress is for having suffered Russia to acquire a foot of
							Territory South of the Vistula.— This is the perpetual burden of his
							lamentation— As if the Vistula would have been a wall of adamant; an
							insurmuntable barrier for Europe, against the modern Tartars— It was
							according to him perfectly proper for Sweden to rob Denmark of Norway;
							and for Prussia to be pampered with Saxony, because this strengthened
							the barrier of Europe against Russia— The great fault of the Congress
							was in not giving all Saxony to Prussia— This Sacrifice of all
							consideration of Right and Wrong to State Policy, always disgusts me— If
							Saxony can properly be swallowed by Prussia; why should not Prussia be
							swallowed by Russia, in its turn— If the weaker must be given as food to
							strengthen the weak, why should not both be given to gorge the appetite
							of the strong. As to the barrier of the Vistula, it is as if one should
							undertake to stop the falls of Niagara with a wisp of Straw.— The ci
							devant Archbishop, complains of the Congress too for not restoring the
							Roman Catholic Clergy to affluence and dignity— He wants to see Cardinal
							Prime Minsters again, and yet he gives shrewd hints about the Spirit of
							the age, and holds the doctrine of legitimacy, to be not altogether
							tenable— He blames the Belgic Clergy too, for their opposition to the
							New Constitution of the Low Country— I could not comprehend this until I
							found by reference to the weather cock Register, that the Abbé has a
							pension of 12000 francs from the <persRef ref="william-i">king of the
								Netherlands</persRef>, as a fiche de consolation, for the loss of
							his Archbishoprick of Mecklin.</p>
