							making out the first fair Copy, I came to a passage, where the first

						<p><date>4. VII: </date>A Stormy day again. The two <persRef
								ref="bollman-unknown;bollmann-unknown2">Miss Bollmann’s</persRef>
							came out from London, to attend the Ball at Ealing on the occasion of
							the <persRef ref="edward">Duke of Kent’s</persRef> Birth-day. <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								ref="smith-john">J. A. Smith</persRef> also came out. He brought me
							a Note from <persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Earl Bathurst</persRef>, in
							reply to mine of 25 October to him. A persevering refusal to allow
							destitute American Seamen, shipped by the Consul in American Vessels to
							be excepted from the limitation of the number of Passengers; to one
							person for every five Tons of the Vessel’s burthen— A flat denial that
							the Commissioners of the Customs had limited the number to the
							unoccupied Tonnage; and a promise that the extra duties levied on
							indirect voyages of American Vessels, and extra-pilotage at Liverpool
							shall be returned— Smith brought also a Letter from <persRef
								ref="couling-william">W. Couling</persRef> at Carmarthen. He had
							sent out two Letters from <persRef ref="erving-george">G. W.
								Erving</persRef> at Madrid, of 30. Sept<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> and 7. Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> which I received
							by the Post, while we were at dinner.— My Answer to Erving’s Letter of
							26. Aug<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> was not despatched— I walked about
							an hour before dinner, to Brentford. This Morning when I rose, I had
							written a fair Copy of the Lines on Temperance. While walking and
							meditating for a subject the thought occurred of writing some Stanza’s
							upon Justice.— During the walk I prepared two Stanza’s, of ten lines
							each; in the measure of those on Fortitude.— They came with much
							difficulty, and I wrote them immediately after my return home. At half
							past eight my wife, with <persRef ref="nicholas-ellen">Ellen
								Nicholas</persRef>, and the two Miss Bollmann’s, went to the Ball at
							the New-Inn; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith, <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef> and I followed them soon after—
							There were 162 persons present— The Ball was opened by <persRef
								ref="wetherall-frederick">General Wetherall</persRef> and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Adams— There were nothing danced but
							English Country-dances— There were two sets of dancers each of twenty
							one or twenty-two Couples. The Ball-room was new, and although so long
							since finished, that there had been talk of having Balls in it at Easter
							time, the walls were damp. It was too small for the numbers of the
							company, and for ventilation had windows only at the two opposite ends.
							The company was collected from the families of the neighbourhood— Among
							them was <persRef ref="u">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Stapleton</persRef>, whom I had met last November at <persRef
								ref="copland-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Copland’s</persRef>, and who went with <persRef ref="bagot-charles"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef> to America— He
							went to Charleston South Carolina, from whence he has been about two
							Months returned— The heat in the Ball-room was oppressive until the
							windows at one end of the Hall were opened from the top. But this
							produced a noxious draft of cold and excessively damp air, to which all
							the dancers were exposed— My wife danced almost the whole Evening, and
							before supper was announced, appeared so much fatigued that I was
							alarmed lest she should be ill and gave her a caution— Supper was served
							in the rooms below, about one O’Clock— It was just over, and a single
							toast, the Duke of Kent’s health had been drank, when my wife found
							herself so unwell that she was obliged to leave the table— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Copland led her into the adjoining Card
							room, and we immediately returned home. Ellen Nicholas and the Miss
							Bollmann’s went with us. We left Smith and George, who with the rest of
							the Company returned to the Ball Room, and renewed the dancing till <pb
								n="95" type="ms"/>past four O’Clock— It was after two when we got
							home. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams was so unwell that she just
							escaped a fainting fit— But being put immediately to bed was immediately
							much relieved. I left the young Ladies and retired to bed at three— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith had also brought out a Card of
							invitation from the <persRef ref="wood-matthew">Lord Mayor Elect
								(Wood)</persRef> and the Sheriffs, to the Dinner at Guildhall next
							Saturday, being Lord Mayor’s day; with a request to address the Answer
							to the City Remembrancer at Guildhall. I received a similar invitation
							last year, but was prevented by illness from attending at the
							dinner.</p>

							gave me two copies of the Monthly Repository of Theology and General

							also called upon me with written proposals to be transmitted to the

						<p><date>8. VII:15. </date><persRef ref="u">Jefferson</persRef> sent a man
							here this Morning with the engraved plates that I had ordered, and he
							made a second attempt to impose upon me, but this time did not succeed.
								<persRef ref="micklam-james">Micklam the Taylor</persRef> was here,
							and this Evening sent us as a present, a brace of Moor fowls from
							Scotland. There was a sharp frost last Night and all this day was very
							cold. Much of my time was wasted I scarcely know how. The day was fine;
							and I walked to Ealing, Acton Gunnersbury and Brentford. In the lane
							from Gunnersbury down to the Brentford road, I saw a man, decently
							dressed, lying stretched upon the ground by the side of the Road; his
							face downward, and apparently asleep or dead— There was in the adjoining
							field a man trimming the hedge, of whom I enquired whether he knew any
							thing of this person— He said he had found him lying there; had
							attempted to raise him up, but could not get him to speak. I asked him
							if the man was in liquor— He did not know— I requested him to come and
							repeat the attempt to raise him up. I then spoke to him and he answered—
							Said he was not in liquor; but had a bad leg, had walked from near
							Windsor going to Lambeth to try and get into the Hospital, for which he
							had a Certificate from a physician. He had found himself faint and laid
							down there. I asked him if he was in want— He said he had eaten nothing
							for two days. By this time two other persons had come up. I gave him a
							shilling and advised him to stop at the public house at Turnham Green,
							and take some nourishment— The number of these wretched Objects that I
							meet in my daily walks is distressing. Many of them beg— They are often
							insolent, and sometimes exhibit figures that seem prepared for any
							thing— It is not a Month since a man was found dead, lying in a field by
							the side of the road, between <persRef ref="dumouriez-charles"
								>Dumouriez’s</persRef> house and <persRef ref="u">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Goodenough’s</persRef>. Not a day
							passes but we have beggars come to the house; each with a different
							hideous tale of Misery— The extremes of opulence and of want are more
							remarkable and more constantly obvious in this Country than in any other
							that I ever saw— This evening’s Post brought Letters to 1. October, from
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>, and me; with several
							for <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="nicholas-caroline">Caroline Nicholas</persRef> returned home—
							The Evening was so cold that I could not write in my room below. I read
							the first Act of the Tragedy of Bertram, or the Castle of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Aldobrand; but my wife was very unwell
							with one of her sick head-aches, and was obliged to retire, early to
							bed— I wrote this Morning the tenth Stanza of my lines upon Justice, and
							after my walk the eleventh and twelfth, with which they finish— Thought
							for another Subject but without success— Copied off about thirty lines
							for my Epistle.</p>

						<p><date>9. IV:30. </date>Being roused at that hour, for a particular
							object, I rose immediately for the day, and wrote a couple of hours
							before daylight; by which means I had finished before Breakfast all the
							journalizing of the day. Immediately after Breakfast, I went into
							London. I found at the Office in Craven Street one of the black Seamen
							whom I had recommended to <persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Aspinwall</persRef>— I told him the
							reasons assigned by the Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> for refusing
							him the customary allowance to distressed American Seamen. He said that
							the reason of his not having gone in the Cartel when the Passage was
							offered him, was that the notice given him to go was so short, that he
							had not time to go for his Clothes; which he had since then been obliged
							to sell. But he <pb n="97" type="ms"/>said that those who had gone in
							the Cartel, had been sold into bondage in South-Carolina, after they
							arrived, in America; until they should have paid for their passages.
							This was evidently a tale trumped up, and I told him I could do no more
							for him. His name is <persRef ref="prince-melvin">Melvin
								Prince</persRef>— This was <persRef ref="wood-matthew">Lord
								Mayor’s</persRef> day. According to the annual custom, he came in
							procession by water from Blackfriars Bridge to Westminster Hall, where
							he was formally presented to the Barons of the Exchequer. He returned
							from Westminster-Hall, by land, through the Streets—a measure which
							annoyed and alarmed the Ministers so much, that <persRef
								ref="addington-henry2">Lord Sidmouth</persRef>, the Secretary of
							State for the home department, wrote him a Letter to dissuade him from
							it; but without success. I waited in Craven Street, until the Procession
							passed by it in the Strand and then joined in it. The crowd of People
							throughout the way was as great as the Streets could hold. The horses
							had been taken out of the Lord Mayor’s and the <persRef ref="wood-maria"
								>Lady Mayoress’s</persRef> Coaches, opposite the Horse-Guards, and
							they were drawn from thence to Guildhall by the People. The invitation
							for the dinner had been for four O’Clock. And the Procession arrived
							there just at that hour; but the Company were assembling until six— None
							of the Cabinet Ministers were there; nor any of the chief judges of the
							king’s Courts— But the Puisné judges of the king’s Bench, Common Pleas
							and Exchequer were almost all there. Sir William Scott the judge of the
							Admiralty Court was peculiarly polite and attentive to me— No other
							foreign Minister was there, which made my situation somewhat auward. At
							first the Company were received in the Council chamber, but soon after
							passed into the Court of King’s Bench where the Lady Mayoress sat in
							State, full dressed and hooped to receive them— About six they all
							repaired to the great Hall, where tables were laid for upwards of one
							thousand persons, and all, except the Company of the Lord Mayor’s own
							table were already seated. My card was in a Plate at the Right hand of
							the Lord Mayor, but after the Members of both Houses of Parliament. This
							is the rule at the City Feasts, and is the reason why the foreign
							Ministers scarcely ever attend at them. <persRef ref="scott-william">Sir
								William Scott</persRef> several times hinted to me before dinner,
							that I should have higher precedence, but I was not disposed to dispute
							about the place assigned to me. I sat next to <persRef
								ref="bennet-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bennett</persRef>
							(Henry Grey) a member of Parliament for Shrewsbury, and second Son of
							the <persRef ref="bennett-charles3">Earl of Tancarville</persRef> His
							elder brother <persRef ref="bennett-charles2">Lord Ossulston</persRef>
							was also present— Also the <persRef ref="capel-george">Earl of
								Essex</persRef>, <persRef ref="bromley-henry">Lord
								Montford</persRef>, <persRef ref="romilly-samuel">Sir Samuel
								Romilly</persRef>, the Attorney General, <persRef

								ref="cartwright-john">Major Cartwright</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="reeves-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Reeves</persRef>—
							The <persRef ref="augustusfrederick">Duke of Sussex</persRef> would have
							attended, but the <persRef ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef> sent him
							yesterday a message positively enjoining him, not to go; on account of
							the death of the <persRef ref="frederick-i-wurttemburg">king of
								Wurtemberg</persRef>, who married the <persRef ref="charlotte"
								>Princess Royal</persRef> of England. The Lord and Lady Mayoress sat
							as usual side by side— The Earl of Essex at the Lord Mayor’s right hand,
							and Sir Robert Wilson at the Lady Mayoress’s left— A part of the
							procession upon Lord Mayor’s day consists of three persons clad in
							complete antient armour; one of which is the armour of <persRef
								ref="edwardofwoodstock">Edward the Black Prince</persRef>; from the
							Tower— These persons are called antient knights; after all the Company
							were seated they took their places in three Niches in the wall behind
							the Lord Mayors table; one at each corner and one in the centre, where
							they stood and sat during the whole dinner— They were Soldiers of the
							Life guards, and some of the most athletic men that could be selected;
							but the armour was so oppressive to them that two of them were obliged
							to have their helmets taken off; and they were saved from fainting only
							by a succession of glasses of Port wine which were administered to them.
							After dinner the usual loving Cup was passed round, and then the
							ordinary toasts. After the range of the Royal family was gone through,
							the Lord Mayor gave the Earl of Essex and the House of Peers, in return
							for which the Earl gave the Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress— The Lord
							Mayor after making some question who was the oldest member of the house
							of Commons (who was said to be M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. Smith)
							said he must settle himself the question, and gave M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Grey Bennett and the House of Commons. At
							the same time observing that the City of London was grateful to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bennett, for the very great and important
							service he had rendered, by the Report to the House of Commons, at the
							last Session of Parliament, of the Committee of which he was chairman,
							upon the Police of the Metropolis. There was a flourish of Trumpets from
							the head of the Hall, answered by one from the bottom (as there had been
							at the giving of every toast) for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bennett
							to answer; but he declined; pleading the example of the Earl of Essex,
							who had answered only by toasting the Lord Mayor, and Lady Mayoress— But
							the Lord Mayor himself in returning his thanks had made a speech,
							expressing his gratitude to his fellow Citizens for his re-election. He
							said he felt a double weight of responsibility arising from this second
							election; and a double anxiety, not merely that of discharging <pb
								n="98" type="ms"/>the duties of his Office, but that of justifying
							by extraordinary exertions, the extraordinary Confidence which had been
							manifested to him— He promised that nothing on his part should be
							wanting to fulfil the expectations of the Public— He retained all his
							political opinions; but he should continue to set politics entirely
							aside in the performance of his duty; without connecting himself with
							any political party, or turning to the right hand or the left. None of
							his Majesty’s Ministers had thought fit to honour him with their Company
							either at this Entertainment, or on the same occasion last year. He knew
							not what the motives of their absence were; but he found a consolation
							for it in the high respectability of the Company present. Immediately
							after M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bennett had declined answering, the
							Lord Mayor gave the American Minister—upon which I returned thanks in
							very few words; observing that having frequently received the same
							honour from him before, I could only repeat the same acknowledgments— I
							would add only one remark; that Gratitude was a sentiment addicted to
							repetition, as had been most strikingly illustrated by his fellow
							citizens of London, in the repetition of his name at the late Election.
							In return for the honour of his toast I begged leave to propose that of
							“Prosperity to the City of London,” which was drank with three times
							three— The company was however so large, and the noise in the hall so
							great, that very few could hear a word of what was said— The Attorney
							General, Sir William Scott, the Judges, <persRef ref="erskine-thomas"
								>Lord Erskine</persRef>, the City Members of Parliament (for whom
								<persRef ref="atkins-john">Alderman Atkins</persRef> answered) the
							Sheriffs and the Board of Aldermen were toasted. Lord Erskine answered;
							but though near him I could hear nothing that he said. About nine
							O’Clock, the Lady Mayoress and other Ladies retired into the Court of
							King’s Bench, And half an hour afterwards the Lord Mayor and his party
							followed them— There had been for upwards of an hour, an unceasing
							stream of Ladies and gentlemen passing round the tables and looking at
							the Company. The hall was lighted with Gaz— Its principal ornaments are
							Monuments to the <persRef ref="pitt-william">Earl of Chatham</persRef>;
							to his Son <persRef ref="pitt-william2">William Pitt</persRef>; opposite
							to each other, and one to <persRef ref="nelson-horatio">Lord
								Nelson</persRef> at the bottom of the Hall— Bennett told me that
							they came very near throwing down the Monument of Pitt a few days ago;
							and he should not be at all surprized if within a year from this time it
							should be removed— He said he heartily wished it was thrown down— He
							also told me that the inscription upon the Monument to Chatham was
							written by <persRef ref="burke-edmund">Burke</persRef>, and was
							admirable— That of Pitt’s was by <persRef ref="canning-george"
								>Canning</persRef>, in a very bad taste; and that of Nelson’s by
								<persRef ref="sheridan-richard">Sheridan</persRef>, and the worst of
							all.— I followed the Lord Mayor in to the Court of King’s Bench where
							there was a very large collection of Ladies. The Ball was opened by a
							Minuet danced by <persRef ref="camac-john">Co<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Camac</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="u">Miss Wood</persRef>, immediately after which I came away— On
							crossing the Hall to come out <persRef ref="thorpe-alfred">Alfred
								Thorpe</persRef> stopped me to enquire after <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef>. There were yet a
							large portion of the Company seated at the tables— Sir Robert Wilson
							passed by as I was standing there, and was greeted by a universal shout
							of applause— I left the Hall about ten O’Clock, and reached home just at
							midnight. I was labouring during the whole of both my rides in and out
							of town, to write some Stanza’s upon Prudence, to complete the Cardinal
							Virtues; but I effected only one Stanza, and part of a second.</p>

						<p><date>13. VII: </date>I had a very indifferent Night’s rest, and woke at
							least three hours before day.— Finished the additional Stanza, to the
							lines upon Prudence and with it the first draft of my Verses upon the
							Cardinal Virtues—Temperance, Prudence, Fortitude, and Justice. I called
							the lines upon Fortitude, an Ode; and those upon Justice might perhaps
							properly be styled a Hymn— But those upon Temperance and Prudence are
							merely Stanza’s— The Ode, or Hymn which is only a religious Ode implies
							a high degree of Poetical inspiration; an impetuosity of sentiment and
							fire of expression for which my Genius is not suited— When the idea
							occurred to me of writing verses on the four Cardinal virtues, I
							intended to address them to my Son <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef>, in the hope that however feeble they might be as
							Poetry, they would have a good influence, as moral Instruction. In
							reflecting upon the Subject I immediately perceived that its four
							divisions should not be treated with the same Style, nor in the same
							measure. That Justice and Fortitude required the grandeur and sublimity
							of the greater Ode, while Temperance and Prudence were more adapted to
							the easy elegance and simplicity of the lesser. I have varied them
							accordingly; and have only to regret the conviction upon my own mind,
							that the execution has fallen so infinitely short of my own general
							conceptions. The Stanza’s upon Prudence, the last written, are the only
							ones addressed immediately to George. They must all be revised— This
							subject being dismissed from my mind, I began to think of some lines for
								<persRef ref="nicholas-ellen">Ellen Nicholas’s</persRef> birth-day,
							which she has requested of me, and which I have promised her— I prepared
							before and while I was rising, one Stanza of eight lines, and half of a

							wrote Letters to <persRef ref="boyd-george">G. Boyd</persRef> at
							Washington and <persRef ref="barron-william">W. A. Barron</persRef> at
							New-York— Answers which have been some time lingering— Walked through
							Brentford round by Osterley Park to the Uxbridge Road and returned by
							the way of Hanwell; two hours and a half. I was composing lines to
							Charlotte Nicholas, in return for her present, which I wrote immediately
							after returning home, and copied off to send to her by George, to-morrow
							Morning. After dinner I copied about fifty lines of the Epistle to
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef>; and read to the
							Ladies four of <persRef ref="pope-alexander">Pope’s</persRef> Moral

							concerning you.” The doctrine was in some respects very comprehensive
							and in others extremely contracted. All Classes of his hearers were
							exhorted to give thanks Great and Small—Rich and Poor—Prosperous and
							afflicted; Righteous and Sinners— But the motives for their thanksgiving
							were not of the universal kind;—but, because they were not savages;
							because they were not heathens or Mahometans— Because they were not
							Roman Catholics, of the Greek Church or Presbyterians—but because they
							belonged to the Church of England, for Religion, and because they were
							Britons for Government— He did not ask them to give thanks because they
							dwelt in the Parish of Ealing, and enjoyed the blessing of hearing him
							preach, but that was the tenour of his argument— It is good in every
							thing to give thanks; but not like the pharisee; because he was not like
							other men— I have heard of a preacher who called upon his hearers to
							adore the wonderful goodness of God, in ordering it so that great Rivers
							should always flow by the side of great Cities. <persRef ref="shylock"

						<p><date>19. VII. </date>There was this Morning between the hours of 8 and

								ref="deriquet-georges">Count George de Caraman</persRef>; who comes

								ref="davy-william">W. Davy</persRef> the Consul at Kingston upon
							Hull, complaining that the extra-duties upon foreign Vessels, continue
							to be levied upon American Vessels at that Port, notwithstanding the
							Commercial Convention of 3. July 1815— The weather prevented me from
							going into London early, and it was near four O’Clock when I got to the
							Office at Craven Street.— I directed the Coachman to proceed directly
							from the stables at five, and overtake me on the way home. I found at

								Feltham</persRef> with whom Boyd is contracting for various articles
							to be used in rebuilding the Capitol and President’s house at
							Washington. Boyd had referred him to me, as a warrant for his authority,
							which I accordingly attested— There were applications in behalf of
							several American Sailors, rejected by the <persRef
								ref="aspinwall-thomas">Consul</persRef>, but whom I could only refer
							back to him— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith asked my permission to
							remove the Office into Norfolk Street, to which I consented. I left with

								<persRef ref="mowry-jabez">J. Mowry</persRef> and from Mowry to the
								<persRef ref="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef>, respecting

							Old Broad Street. and requested Smith to call on him to-morrow and

							Turnpikes, and at 7 we reached Boston-House— We had a game of Cards in
							the Evening. While riding into Town I finished reading the <persRef
								ref="selkirk-thomas">Earl of Selkirk’s</persRef> View of the
