							when she dined here about taking him— Last Evening I received a Letter

							to take him to Paris, paying his expences for his services, but not to
							engage him afterwards— Pio is very anxious to go, but not without having
							a place secured when there— I sent him this morning with a Letter to
							Captain Stuart to ascertain his intentions— We had visits from <persRef

						<p><date>2. V:30. </date>Answered the Letter from <persRef

							after having postponed it for sometime in expectation of having his
							Letter which I gave to <persRef ref="kinnaird-charles">Lord
								Kinnaird</persRef> returned to me— I think it best however to delay
							no longer— Received a Letter of 29. March from <persRef
								ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef> at Liverpool, and one
							of the 30<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> from <persRef ref="maury-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury</persRef>— The General had
							received my despatches, and the Packet for <persRef ref="ludlow-gulian"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ludlow</persRef> at New-York,
							and promises to dispose of them as I requested in my Letter— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury’s Letter says the General sailed on
							the 29<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> in the Franklin for Baltimore.—
							Went into London with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef>— Called at <persRef
								ref="munster-ernst">Count Munster’s</persRef> house 21. Piccadilly,
							to see and converse with him, at the request of <persRef
								ref="bussche-calmor">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bussche-Hünnefeldt</persRef>, but the Count was not at home— Went to
							the Office at Craven Street, and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams
							went to visit <persRef ref="king-eliza">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								King</persRef> and <persRef ref="bourke-maria">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bourke</persRef>, the <persRef
								ref="bourke-edmund">Danish Minister’s</persRef> Lady.— At the Office
							I found a Letter from <persRef ref="vonrehausen-gotthard">Baron
								Rehausen</persRef>, the Swedish Minister, recommending to me a Swede
							named <persRef ref="hammelin-charles">Charles Hammelin</persRef> late a
							subaltern officer in the Swedish service, who was sentenced to be shot
							for rashness in sacrificing lives by defending an untenable Post. He was
							pardoned, but dismissed from the service, and wishes to go to America,
							to enter the Service of the United States— The man came, himself, and
							appeared to be in great distress— But he understands not a word of
							English and scarcely a word of French. I told him that though very
							desirous to serve him, I could not see the smallest prospect of his
							obtaining a Commission in America— He went apparently much disappointed.
							There was also a Petition from <persRef ref="webb-william">William
								Webb</persRef>, stating himself to be a native American Sailor, and
							a convict on board of a hulk at Woolwich; sentenced to seven years
							transportation, for stealing some fowls worth half a guinea; but he says
							he bought them— He prays me to interpose with the British Government to
							obtain his pardon, and then to send him to America— Also a Letter from
								<persRef ref="stewart-josephus">Captain Stuart</persRef> requesting
							a French Passport which was sent him. <persRef ref="bennett-charles"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bennet</persRef> of Alexandria
							came, and mentioned that he expected to go in about a fortnight to
							France previous to returning to America. I enquired of him what his
							prospects were, with regard to his petition to the Lords of the Treasury
							for indemnity, on account of the plunder of Alexandria, by the British
							frigates in 1814— He said they gave him fair words, and that they had
							now referred the memorial to <persRef ref="gordon-james">Captain
								Gordon</persRef> (the pillager) to report upon the facts— He
							evidently yet flatters himself that he will get something— <persRef
								ref="caldecott-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Caldecott</persRef> came at three O’Clock the time I had appointed—
							He is a Surgeon, Apothecary and Man midwife,—who wishes to remove with a
								<persRef ref="caldecott-mary">wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="caldecott-alphonso;caldecott-christina;caldecott-timothy;caldecott-mary2;caldecott-charles2"
								>five children</persRef> to America— He came for advice and
							information, what his prospects of thriving by his profession would be—
							I gave him all the information that I could, and particularly urged him
							not to form sangwine expectations of success, if he should go—and
							reminded him how much the medical department was already crowded in
							America— He asked if there would be any chance of his obtaining
							employment in that line in the American army or navy.— I told him none
							during the Peace, and probably none even in case of War, which would
							comfortably maintain himself, a wife, and five children. I referred him
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bennet who was present, and whose
							opinions were not more favourable to the prosecution of the project than
							mine— He said he would reflect further upon the subject, and if he
							should finally conclude to go, he would apply to me again. He asked me,
							if I would give him in case he should go a letter of recommendation, to
							some person who might advise him, and I promised to give him a Letter
							for <persRef ref="mitchill-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mitchill</persRef> at New-York. When he and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bennet were gone I wrote a Note <persRef
								ref="hamilton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hamilton</persRef>, the Under Secretary of State, enclosing to him
							Webb’s petition, requesting a decision of this Government upon it— I
							took it with me, down to the foreign Office, to leave it there in case I
							had not found him— But he was there, and received me.— I gave him the
							Note, and Petition, which he finally took, though in the first instance
							he wished me to take it back and address it to <persRef ref="beckett-j"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beckett</persRef> the
							Under-Secretary in the Home Department— But I told him I had in this
							instance followed precisely the course recommended to me on a former and
							exactly similar case, by <persRef ref="morier-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Morier</persRef>— I enquired also of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton, whether foreign Consuls
							residing here enjoyed any exemption from the payment of taxes— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury had written to me, requesting this
							information— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton told me they were
							not entitled to any such exemption. <persRef ref="lieven-christopher"
								>Count Lieven</persRef> the Russian Ambassador sent in his name, and
							I immediately came away, and returned to Craven <pb n="421" type="ms"
							/>Street— Left <persRef ref="bode-johann">Bode’s</persRef> Uranographia
							to be bound— Settled the Account of <persRef ref="u">Williams</persRef>
							the Stationer, and took with me the Book of minutes of Office charges—
							It was about seven when we reached home, and I found an answer from
							Captain Stuart to the answer I had written him relating to <persRef
								ref="pio-peter">Pio</persRef>.</p>

						<p><date>4. VI: </date>Wrote a short despatch to the <persRef

							Breakfast went with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> into London. After
							leaving her at <persRef ref="king-eliza">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								Hammelin</persRef>, the Swede who had been recommended to me, by
								<persRef ref="vonrehausen-gotthard">Baron Rehausen</persRef>, came

								Ingraham</persRef>, Vice Consul at Bristol, who asks my advice in

							I dressed, went again to Conduit Street, where I took up M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Adams, and we went to the <persRef
								ref="charlotte2">Queen’s</persRef> Drawing-Room at Buckingham House.
							It was announced for two O’Clock, and precisely at that hour the
							Drawing-Room commenced— The forms of this presentation are different
							from those of the Circles on the Continent, and of those held by the
								<persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef> at the Levees— The
							Queen does not go round the Circle. She takes a stand, before a Sopha—
							The persons attending the Drawing Room, go in from the adjoining Hall;
							go up to her and are spoken to her in succession, after which they pass
							onto the Princesses and Princes who stand at her right hand, each of
							whom speaks a few words, and then the person files off by another door,
							and goes down Stairs to go away. Privileged persons however, among whom
							are the foreign Ministers, may remain in the Drawing Room, after having
							been presented— All the foreign Ambassadors and Ministers were there,
							excepting <persRef ref="vonjacobikloest-konstans">Baron
							Jacobi</persRef>. I spoke to <persRef ref="munster-ernst">Count
								Munster</persRef> the Hanoverian Minister, about my old friend
								<persRef ref="bussche-calmor">Bussche</persRef>, and bore testimony
							to the Sentiments he had always avowed to me. He said he had already
							taken some steps in Bussche’s favour, but there were reports in
							circulation much to his disadvantage— Especially of his having been too
							intimate with <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Caulaincourt</persRef>, and even to have served him as a
							spy— I told him I was convinced Bussche never did act, and never would
							have acted as a Spy— That he was by his situation placed in a state of
							necessary intimacy with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Caulaincourt, but
							that he always spoke to me of it, as a situation which he had been
							forced to accept, and that it had been invariably repugnant to his own
							feelings and inclinations— I mentioned that I had spoken upon this
							Subject to <persRef ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Julien</persRef>, while he was here
							with the <persRef ref="johnarchdukeaustria;louisarchdukeaustria"
								>Archdukes</persRef>, and had entreated him if he should see Count
							Munster, to bear his testimony concerning Baron Bussche; and he had
							assured me that he would testify to the same facts as myself— The Count
							proposed to call upon me to converse further with me on this matter, but
							I observed to him that I resided out of town, and that I would call
							again upon him, to give him any more particular statement that he might
							desire— I spoke to <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count
								Lieven</persRef>, concerning my Letter of recall from the Court of
							Russia— He said that at the time when I had given him notice, last
							Summer that I had it, he had immediately written to take the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor’s</persRef> orders concerning it— That
								<persRef ref="nesselrode-karl">Count Nesselrode</persRef>, had
							replied it would be best to wait until the Emperor’s return to S<hi
								rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg, to make the official
							arrangements suitable to the occasion, and for transmitting to him the
							customary present to be given me, on his receiving from me the Letter,
							which he expected now to be very shortly authorized to do— I told him I
							was sorry there had been any delay on that account. That by the
							Constitution of the United States, their Ministers abroad were not
							permitted to accept Presents, from foreign Sovereigns, and that I had
							made this fully known to <persRef ref="rumiantsev-nikolai">Count
								Romanzoff</persRef> while I was in Russia, and when he was
							Chancellor; I regretted not having thought of it when I informed him
							last Summer that I had the Letter of Recall; but it was only because the
							idea had not at-all occurred to me, that any offer of a Present would be
							made.— The Count asked me, whether my distance from town was such that
							he could without indiscretion invite me to his house, to which I could
							only answer how much I was obliged to him— For one of my strongest
							reasons for remaining out of town, is to escape from the frequency of
							invitations at late hours, which consume so much precious time, and with
							the perpetually mortifying consciousness of inability to return the
							civility in the same manner. When the Drawing Room opened, the Corps
							Diplomatique, <pb n="422" type="ms"/>first entered it, and went up and
							paid their Respects to the Queen. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams
							went with <persRef ref="ruffo-maria">Princess Castel-Cicala</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="bourke-maria">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
								Bourke</persRef>; the Ambassadors and Ministers afterwards
							succeeded, and <persRef ref="esterhazy-paul">Prince Esterhazy</persRef>,
							presented <persRef ref="esterhazy-nicholas">his father</persRef>—
								<persRef ref="chester-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chester</persRef> accompanied me, as it was my first presentation at
							the Drawing Room, and after the Queen had spoken to me, he presented me
							to the <persRef ref="elizabeth">Princesses Elizabeth</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="mary2">Mary</persRef>, to the <persRef
								ref="williamfrederick">Duke of Gloucester</persRef>, and his Sister
							the <persRef ref="sophiamatilda">Princess Sophia</persRef>— The Queen
							and Princesses Elizabeth and Mary, have a topic to speak to me about—My
							health—the Climate, and my residence in Russia— The Princess Sophia of
							Gloucester told me she was glad to see an American Minister here again,
							and she hoped we should long continue friends. I thanked her for the
							wish, and said it was the first duty of my station and the first
							inclination of my heart to promote the friendship between the Nations—
							The Duke of Gloucester said he was happy to renew the acquaintance he
							had made with me last Summer at <persRef ref="grey-charles">Earl
								Grey’s</persRef>— The <persRef ref="edward">Dukes of Kent</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="augustusfrederick">Sussex</persRef>, also spoke to me;
							the latter came late, because he said he thought proper to take his
							time. The <persRef ref="william">Duke of Clarence</persRef> was there,
							but I had not the opportunity of speaking to him. After passing through
							all the presentations we stood and saw the succession of others pass
							through theirs for about an hour. The Duke of Sussex and <persRef
								ref="graves-thomas2">Lord Graves</persRef> came up and conversed
							with my wife, with whom they remembered their antient acquaintance at
							Berlin. We left the Drawing Room between three and four O’Clock—went and
							left M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams at M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs:</hi> King’s, and returned to Craven Street, where I changed my
							Dress— Amused myself with reading Boston Newspapers, and last Sundays
							Examiner, until seven O’Clock, and then went and dined with the <persRef
								ref="fane-john">Earl of Westmorland</persRef> in Grosvenor Square.
							The company was small; only thirteen persons, all Men, and of whom I was
							acquainted only with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourke, <persRef
								ref="vonberoldingen-joseph">Count Beroldingen</persRef> and the
							Under Secretary of State, <persRef ref="hamilton-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton</persRef>— There was a
								<persRef ref="flower-charles">Sir Charles Flower</persRef>, who has
							been Lord Mayor of London, a <persRef ref="lowther-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowther</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lowther-william">his Son</persRef>, and others whose names I
							could not catch. One Gentleman came from the House of Commons, where he
							had left them debating upon an insult suffered by <persRef
								ref="wentworthfitzwilliam-charles">Lord Milton</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="capel-george">Lord Essex</persRef> this Morning, as
							they were riding in an open Carriage in Pall-Mall. They were stopped by
							a Soldier, and not suffered to proceed. The Soldier struck the horses,
							with his Sabre, and threatened to cut down Lord Milton himself, if he
							attempted to proceed— The member had come away preferring the dinner to
							the debate— Lord Westmorland shewed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bourke and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton as Connoisseurs three
							old pictures which were offered to him to purchase, and which those
							Gentlemen assured him were not worth half a crown a piece. Yet one of
							them was professed by a sketch by <persRef ref="rubens-peter"
								>Rubens</persRef>— The meeting of <persRef ref="jacob"
								>Jacob</persRef> and <persRef ref="esau">Esau</persRef>. The dinner
							party was pleasant— They spoke of a Company of French Players now
							performing here to which some of them were going this Evening— And of
							certain Subscription Balls, at seven shillings a head; under the
							direction of <persRef ref="stewart-amelia">Lady Castlereagh</persRef>,
							and other persons of rank— Select to the last degree, and to which I was
							told we could be admitted by applying to Lady Castlereagh— I left Lord
							Westmorland’s shortly after ten O’Clock, and went for M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							King’s where she had dined. Found there <persRef
								ref="white-john4;white-henry2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry White</persRef>, who have
							lately returned from France and Holland— We got home just at
							Midnight.</p>

						<p><date>8. VI:15. </date>Answered <persRef ref="couling-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Couling’s</persRef> Letter, and
							appointed this afternoon, four O’Clock to see him, at Craven Street.
							Began likewise a despatch to the <persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary
								of State</persRef>; N. 39— After Breakfast I went into London, in
							the Curricle—called upon <persRef ref="munster-ernst">Count
								Munster</persRef>, the Hanoverian Minister at his house and he
							received me. I shewed him the Letter I had received, from <persRef
								ref="bussche-calmor">Baron Bussche Hunnefeldt</persRef>, and
							repeated the information, I had given him at the Drawing Room,
							concerning Bussche’s conduct and Sentiments, so far as they were known
							to me, while we were at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg
							together. I also told him I had requested <persRef
								ref="saintjulien-johann">Count S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Julien</persRef> to speak to him, when he was here, and to bear his
							testimony to the same points; trusting that he knew still more M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bussche’s conduct there than I did, as
							having been more intimate with him. Munster said that S<hi
								rend="superscript">t</hi> Julien, had in fact spoken to him, and
							given the same account that I did. That he, Munster had spoken to the
								<persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef> in Bussche’s
							favour— That the Prince had increased the Pension which Bussche enjoyed,
							and he would certainly not be molested— But as for his being employed
							again, that must be out of the question.— He was glad that my testimony
							and Count S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Julien’s went so strongly to
							exculpate Bussche, because he had been charged by some Russian
							Gentlemen, with having not only been very intimate with <persRef
								ref="caulaincourt-armand">Caulaincourt</persRef>, but with having
							even served him as a Spy. That he Munster had asked Bussche himself,
							whether he had not been excluded from <persRef ref="orlov-alexey">Count
								Orloff’s</persRef> house, and that Bussche had not been able to deny
							it— I said that Bussche’s situation at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
							Petersburg, which he had invariably stated to me to have been
							involuntary, and forced upon him, had however necessarily placed him in
							great intimacy with the French Ambassador; but I did not believe he had
							ever served him as a Spy; or that he was capable of serving any man in
							such a capacity— I had always considered him as a man of strict, and
							delicate honour— As to the Russian Nobility, at the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor Alexander’s</persRef> Court, for two years
							after I went there, they were to a man, at least as subservient to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Caulaincourt as ever Bussche was— As to
							Count Orloff, I had never heard, and did not believe that he had any
							particular reason to complain of Bussche— But Orloff had at one time
							fallen into disgrace with the Emperor, and went into a sort of exile.
							After his return, he gave as I had heard, notice generally, that he
							would receive none of the foreign Ministers, and no persons belonging to
							their Legations, at his house; because he attributed the Emperor’s
							displeasure, to something which had been reported by some person
							belonging to the foreign missions who frequented his house— But I had
							never heard that he had attributed it to Bussche, and I knew that his
							exclusion had not been confined to him— I had been myself, for a year
							and a half in strong opposition to the French Ambassador, and had
							witnessed the singular fact of three Ministers, almost under his
							direction, yet by their personal inclinations most decidedly against the
							French System— They were <persRef ref="schenck-hans">Count
								Schenk</persRef> from Wurtemberg—<persRef ref="pardo-benito">General
								Pardo</persRef>, Minister from <persRef ref="bonaparte-joseph"
								>Joseph</persRef>, as king of Spain; and Bussche, who was the
							Minister from Westphalia— <persRef ref="bray-francois">De
							Bray</persRef>, the Bavarian Minister, though a Frenchman born, had come
							off the best, and even now retained his place— The Count said that as to
							De Bray, he had always considered him as belonging to the French system,
							and so considered him now— But with regard to Bussche, it was not what
							he had done in Russia that had most injured him, but his conduct since
							his return. The acceptance of office under the French while they had
							been in possession of Hanover, had not been considered by the king or
							the Prince Regent as an Offence— On the contrary, it had been
							recommended that well disposed persons should take any of the
							subordinate Offices, in order that they might not fall into worse hands—
							An exception had been made, only to those who had taken Oaths, contrary
							to their duties of Allegiance. Bussche’s Mission to Russia, therefore
							would not have been objected against him; but it had been thought
							extraordinary that afterwards, when all Germany rose in the struggle to
							recover their Independence, and every German was shewing his devotion to
							the cause, Bussche alone, or with only one other person should have
							taken the time to go off, and follow the ragged Court of that <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-jerome2">Jerome</persRef> in to France— He had done
							another foolish thing— He had married a French woman; a reader
							(lectrice) to Jerome’s <persRef ref="catharinafrederica">Queen of
								Westphalia</persRef>; a woman of very indifferent character; of whom
							Bussche was now, he believed, heartily tired, and who made him very
							miserable. I told the Count that with regard to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bussche’s conduct, since he left S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t</hi> Petersburg, I could bear no testimony; I knew nothing of it;
							and had never before heard that he was married.— I could speak for him,
							only as to the time when his Russia— I was sorry if he had made a bad
							marriage; and could not judge how far his obligations may have justified
							his going away with Jerome; which had also been unknown to me— The Count
							concluded by saying he was obliged to me for the kindness I had in this
							instance shewn to one of his Countrymen; who was also one of his
							Relations.— I then went to the Office in Craven Street, but <persRef
								ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> was
							not there— I proceeded down into the City— First to the Counting house
							of the <persRef ref="baringbrothers">Brothers Baring and C<hi
									rend="superscript">o.</hi></persRef> but <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander
								Baring</persRef> was not there. He was in the Country, and not to
							return till to-morrow— I took a check for £500. They told me that the
							house of <persRef ref="glennieandson">Glennie Son and C<hi
									rend="superscript">o.</hi></persRef> had given them notice of
							the remittances they had received from the Navy Department, and when the
							Bills become payable they <pb n="424" type="ms"/>would settle with the
							Baring’s the account, for their advances upon <persRef
								ref="mccall-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Call’s</persRef> Bills— My next visit was to the Counting house of
							the Glennie’s, where I saw <persRef ref="glennie-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Glennie</persRef> the Son and <persRef
								ref="fry-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fry</persRef>— I
							paid them <persRef ref="lock-hugh">Hugh Lock’s</persRef> Bill, which
							they had settled with him, and sent me his receipt— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fry, entertained me with melancholy
							prophecies of great and numerous approaching failures in America; he
							says there will be enormous, overwhelming losses upon all the late
							commercial speculations from America, to every part of Europe and to
							India—and that indeed that he shall be afraid to hear from “The
							States.”— He says also that the repeal of the discriminating duties,
							according to the commercial Convention, though it appears upon paper to
							be fair, will operate entirely against America. That the American
							vessels cannot stand a competition for freight with the Scotch— That the
							Scotch can navigate their vessels at half the expence, and feed their
							Sailors at half the cost— I asked him how the Speculations upon British
							Manufactures to America, now answered— He said he did not know— They did
							not meddle with the dry goods line— Young Glennie said they had declined
							executing many orders that they had received to purchase Goods—knowing
							that if they should send them they would sell to a loss— Thence I went
							to Finsbury Square, and after stopping at <persRef
								ref="lackington-george">Lackington’s</persRef> to enquire after
							Books for <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef>, called upon
								<persRef ref="williams-samuel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Williams</persRef>. Gave him the check that I had received at
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Baring’s— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams was unwell— He had not executed
							the Commission I gave him when I last called upon him, and by his advice
							I agreed to defer it for the present— Returning from M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams’s, I left the Curricle, near
							Smithfield Market, ordering the Coachman, to come for me to the Office
							at five O’Clock— It was then past four— I walked immediately to Craven
							Street, where I found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Couling— He is a
							Land surveyor and Draftsman, with a small property, and wishes to go to
							America— But he was desirous of being certain before he should undertake
							the Voyage, of meeting with professional employment in America— I told
							him that I had generally no doubt that he would, but could give him no
							specific assurance of immediate employment by the Government or
							otherwise— I offered him however, if he could wait some Months, to write
							to America, and make enquiries, upon which he might have more certainty
							with regard to his Prospects— He said he would call again in the course
							of a few days, and in the mean time form his determination whether to go
							immediately, or to wait for further information. The Coachman came for
							me at five— I had just before received a Note from <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, requesting me
							to call upon him at his house, in S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							James’s Square at 1/2 past eleven O’Clock, to-morrow, or Wednesday
							Morning— I reached home, about seven in the Evening.</p>

								ref="dickason-thomas2;u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dickason</persRef>, and as <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> could not conveniently go into town this Morning, I
							concluded to go in alone, to see <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef>, and afterwards to wait for her arrival— I
							breakfasted early, and at half past nine walked from home, intending to
							get into any Stage Coach, having room, that might overtake me on the
							road— There were two that passed me in Brentford but they were full of
							Schoolboys, going home for the Easter Holidays. I walked nearly to the
							fourth Milestone, when a Pulham Stage came up, empty, and I got in— Two
							other persons came in at Hammersmith, and amused me by their
							Conversation about the news and Politics of the day, Bible Societies,
							Saving Banks, <persRef ref="leopold2">Prince Coburg</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="charlotte">Princess Charlotte</persRef>, Church
							Wardens, Overseers of the Poor, Tythes in kind, and agricultural
							distress— I alighted at the top of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							James’s Street, in Piccadilly, and walked to Lord Castlereagh’s House,
							where I came at precisely half past eleven— The Servants told me had not
							yet come down (from bed) and shewed me into the Parlour, where I found
								<persRef ref="planta-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Planta</persRef>, writing. He sent for a couple of the morning
							Newspapers, and after I had waited about half an hour Lord Castlereagh
							came down, and I was shewed into his Cabinet— He apologized for being so
							late, saying he had never known a Session of Parliament when there had
							been so much of a Spirit for detailed debate— That from the Commencement
							of the Session until this day, the House of Commons had been sitting at
							an average of eight hours every day, and that last Night again they had
							not adjourned until about two O’Clock in the Morning— He then proceeded
							to say that the first subject upon which he wished to speak to me,
							related to a Note that I had sent him concerning a Memorial to the Lords
							of the Treasury from a man named <persRef ref="cooke-george">George
								Cook</persRef>—an American—and he wished to know precisely what the
							object of the Note was— I said I had never seen M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cook, and knew nothing of his case, but what was set forth
							in his Memorial to the Lords of the Treasury, a copy of which had been
							communicated to me, by a <persRef ref="page-w">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Page</persRef>, his agent, and likewise Agent to several
							Spanish Subjects who had made complaints similar to that of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook— The only ground upon which I had
							interfered in behalf of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook was that he
							was a Citizen of the United States, and as such entitled to all the
							assistance, that in my official capacity I could give him— The only
							thing that I had been requested by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Page
							to ask for him, and which I had asked by my Note, was a <hi
								rend="italic">speedy</hi> decision—and presuming that I might speak
							in perfect Confidence to him Lord Castlereagh, upon the subject, I would
							state to him the reason why the necessity that this decision should be
							speedy, had been alledged, to me by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Page—
							Lord Castlereagh said that he wished me to speak, in perfect Confidence,
							and that whatever was said between us on the subject should be private—
							I then said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook’s memorial alledged
							a claim to be indemnified, for great wrongs suffered by him, in the form
							of judicial and executive proceedings by the Judge and Governor of a
							British Settlement in Africa— That the <persRef ref="maxwell-charles"
								>Governor</persRef> of that Settlement Was nowhere; but he had
							received another appointment to some foreign Colonial Establishment, and
							might be expected from day to day, to embark for his new destination— It
							was the intention of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Page as Cook’s
							agent, in case the decision of the Lords of the Treasury upon the
							Memorial should not be satisfactory to him to prosecute this Governor
							(Maxwell) in the proper Court of Law; and he was anxious not to lose the
							opportunity of arresting his person. <pb n="425" type="ms"/>This was the
							motive upon which I had addressed to his Lordship the note concerning
							Cook— It was altogether distinct from the merits of the case—of which of
							course I could not judge.— I had only asked for a decision— Lord
							Castlereagh said, the fact was that this M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cook had been one of the greatest and most notorious offenders against
							the Laws of the United States relative to the Slave-trade, as well as
							against those of Great-Britain— But the proceedings against him had been
							illegal, because his establishment had been upon the Rio Pongus, not
							within the territorial Jurisdiction of Great Britain— If he had been
							taken at Sea, his trial and condemnation would have been perfectly legal
							and regular, but he had been taken out of the British Jurisdiction. The
							sentence of the Court that condemned him could not therefore be
							maintained, and that was the reason why it had been remitted here by a
							pardon— He then read me a Letter from <persRef ref="goulburn-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Goulburn</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="cooke-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook</persRef> the
							Under-Secretary of State, in which he gives him the same account of <hi
								rend="italic">his namesake</hi>— I repeated to Lord Castlereagh that
							I could not judge of the merits of the case. Cook’s Memorial stated a
							case of great hardship, and very severe treatment— He denied altogether
							having had any concern in the slave-trade, and averred that his
							establishment was of a commerce altogether different— He complained also
							of great partiality and oppression upon his trial; of not having been
							allowed to make his defence, or to produce the Evidence in his favour—
							But I was not competent to retry the cause— He must find his remedy in
							the Government, or in the Laws of England— Lord Castlereagh said, they
							would then determine whether the Government itself would make him
							indemnity—or whether they would leave him to his remedy by suit in the
							Courts of Law, against the individuals— He next referred to the Notes I
							had sent him, concerning the fisheries, and the armaments on the Lakes—
							He said the British Government was ready to make a Proposition to avoid
							all collisions, in the fisheries, and they were willing to meet the
							proposal of the American Government, that there might be no unnecessary
							naval force upon the Lakes in active service, or in Commission, so that
							there should be nothing like an appearance of a dispute which side
							should have the strongest force there— The armed vessels might be laid
							up, as they called it here, in ordinary,— It was in short the
							disposition of the British Government fully to meet the proposition made
							to them; and the only armed force which they should want to have in
							service, might be vessels for conveying troops occasionally from one
							Station to another.— He asked if I had Instructions from the American
							Government, or a Power, upon which I could conclude any thing upon these
							Subjects. I told him that I had not— I had transmitted the papers that
							had passed here concerning the fisheries— My first Note to <persRef
								ref="bathurst-henry">Lord Bathurst</persRef> and his answer, the
							last Autumn— I was expecting Instructions, in reply to them, every day
							and every hour— As to the armaments on the Lakes it being mutually
							understood that no new armaments are to take place on either side, and
							that orders shall accordingly be given, there will be ample time to
							concert between the two Governments, the details of a specific Article,
							for the future—which might be signed either here or at Washington. As
							however the Instructions which I am expecting may very possibly give me
							no new Power, but consist only of observations upon the papers that I
							had forwarded it would save time and perhaps be most advisable to have
							the proposal made immediately to the Government of the United States,
							and through the <persRef ref="bagot-charles">British Minister</persRef>
							there.— He said, as the fishing Season was now approaching, it would he
							believed be best to send the Instructions and Power to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot, and then the Instructions to the
							naval Officers on the American Coast, might be given accordingly— I then
							asked him if any thing had been done upon my last Note to him, enclosing
							copies of the correspondence between <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Governor
								Cass</persRef> of the Michigan Territory, and <persRef
								ref="james-reginald">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								James</persRef>— Lord Castlereagh appeared not to understand me, and
							had evidently not read, or retained no sort of recollection of the
							correspondence or of my remarks upon it. Whether this ignorance was real
							or assumed, I could not positively determine, but I believe he had never
							even read my Note— I recapitulated to him all the material facts, and
							urged to him the great danger that such transactions should lead to
							actual hostilities between the bordering authorities. He assured me that
							very strong Instructions should be sent out to secure due respect to the
							American Jurisdiction, and at the same time, an opportunity might be
							given to the Officers complained of to offer an explanation of their
							proceedings— I then enquired whether any thing had been done with regard
							to the discrimination in the Irish Ports— He said that Orders had been
							sent to Ireland, which would remove the discrimination— Without
							admitting the right, they would put away the cause of complaint— But he
							could not tell whether it would be by increasing the restriction on one
							side, or by diminishing it on the other— I repeated that as to the
							ground of our claim, we must leave that choice to their operation; but I
							believed if they should subject the ships of both Nations to the
							restriction of one passenger to every five tons, the effect would be
							equivalent to a prohibition of trade between the United States, and
							Ireland— He asked how? I said that it would be equivalent to a
							prohibition of exports from Ireland to America— Passengers, and the
							Cargo, required to carry them constituted the only exports from Ireland
							to America— Provisions, were among the principal exports of Ireland—
							Forty Passengers for a Vessel of two hundred Tons, could not be
							equivalent to a freight— There were now nearly <pb n="426" type="ms"/>a
							hundred American Vessels, in the Ports of Ireland, waiting for this
							decision, and I supposed if it should be to allow only one Passenger,
							for every five tons, they would all be obliged to come away in ballast—
							The servant had been in and announced <persRef ref="halford-henry">Sir
								Henry Halford</persRef>.— I took my leave and went to Craven Street—
							There came soon a native of the Havanna, who had already been at the
							Office to get his Passport, for himself and his wife, together with
							another for a companion of his, also with his wife, endorsed to go to
							the United States. They had both been Officers, in the Spanish American
							Regiment, in the French army; their Passports were from the Commissaire
							des Guerres at Bayonne, to travel by Land to Calais and come to England
							to return to their Country. He said the <persRef ref="delosrios-carlos"
								>Spanish Ambassador</persRef> had refused to endorse their papers,
							and they could not go home, because they had taken the French side in
							the War— They proposed to go to New-York, and hoped to establish
							themselves there, or perhaps at New-Orleans. I endorsed their Passports,
							good to go to the United States— There came then a Sailor, who wanted a
							certificate of his being an American, to, sell his Pension here and go
							to the United States— But his Speech was Irish, and he had no proof; so
							I was obliged to send him away. I walked out, and purchased Books, shoes
							and gloves— Returned to the Office— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Adams came at half past five, and we went and dined with M<hi

							to the Letters which I have forwarded from Parry to him— Parry strongly
							inclines to go immediately to America, and is in Treaty with a Captain

							get away before the troublous times come on, which he foresees in this
							Country.— His foresight is always gloomy— He will call again to let me
							know his determination, whether to go immediately, or to wait for

							came with <persRef ref="king-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi></persRef> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> King just at
							six O’Clock— I had been doubtful whether to go in full Court dress, or
							in frock—an accident determined me to go in Full-dress, which I found
							was right. We reached the Mansion-House at a quarter-past-six, but it
							was too late— Six was the hour appointed; and the company were actually
							sitting down to table, when we arrived. The Seats at the <persRef
								ref="wood-matthew">Lord Mayor’s</persRef> Table were therefore all
							occupied, and it was with the utmost difficulty, that we obtained Seats
							at the side Table, at the head of which sat the Sheriff <persRef
								ref="bell-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef>—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King could not get a Seat, and was

							members of the House of Commons were of the company— The only foreign
							Minister present besides myself was the <persRef ref="freire-cipriano"
								>Chevalier de Freire</persRef>, the Portuguese Minister. The dinner
							was managed much like those on the two former occasions
								<unclear>at</unclear> which I have attended in the same place. The
							men, of official character were all in full Court Dresses, and the
								<persRef ref="wood-maria">Lady Mayoress</persRef> wore the Court
							hoop. The same toasts, and the same order of them were given— But the
							golden loving Cups, and the basons of Rose-water were not passed round—
							The <persRef ref="george-iii">King</persRef>, the <persRef
								ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef>, the <persRef
								ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef> and Family—the <persRef
								ref="charlotte">Princess Charlotte</persRef> and a happy Union—were
							successively toasted— The first in silence, and each of the rest with
							the Cheers of three times three Huzza’s. Then came, the Duke’s of Kent
							and Sussex—then the <persRef ref="john-vi">Prince Regent of
								Portugal</persRef>, and then the <persRef ref="madison-james"
								>President of the United States</persRef>— The Healths of the Duke’s
							of Kent and Sussex were drank after an introductory Speech to each of
							them by the Lord Mayor— He complimented the Duke of Kent upon his great
							regard and attention to all the benevolent and charitable Institutions
							in the City— The Duke answered by a very short and handsomely delivered
							speech, declaring that in his regard for benevolent Institutions, he
							only followed the liberal example which was invariably set by the
							Citizens of London; whose welfare, and the prosperity of which
							Institutions, whether present or absent, he should always have at heart.
							In introducing the Duke of Sussex’s health, the Lord Mayor, said that
							owing to this Royal Duke’s inform state of health, he had not so much
							patronized the City Institutions, and particularly had not so much
							frequented the Churches; but he would propose His Royal Highnesses
							Health, with thanks for his great and Patriotic exertions in support of
							the Liberties of the People. The Duke with much good humour, and with a
							laughing air of high Indignation at the charge of not sufficiently
							frequenting the churches, said it was a challenge from the Lord Mayor,
							which he accepted— And he begged it to be understood that while he, was
							an invariable friend to religious Liberty, and an enemy to all
							persecution, he was deeply convinced of the superior excellence of the
							Church of England, and unalterably attached to its establishment. But he
							added, if his friend’s toast had done him wrong on one side, it had more
							than made him amends on the other; by complimenting him on his exertions
							in the cause of those principles which had seated his family in the
							station which they hold in this Country; he had gratified the wish which
							would always inspire his conduct; and which uniformly actuated him in
							that branch of the Legislature in which he was <pb n="428" type="ms"
							/>honoured with a seat— He had lately had the satisfaction of presenting
							to that house a Petition drawn up and agreed upon in this Hall and was
							happy that the measure against which it remonstrated had been abandoned—
							He regretted that he saw so few of his Majesty’s Ministers here present;
							as he should have been desirous of offering them his thanks for the
							attention which they had shewn to the wishes and remonstrances of the
							People. The Duke’s speech was longer than that of his brother; but he is
							not quite so fluent. The next Toast was the Prince Regent of Portugal,
							for which the Chevalier de Freire returned thanks in a very few words,
							spoken in so low a tone, that I could not hear him. The Lord Mayor next
							gave The President of the United States— Upon which I rose from my Seat,
							and said—[“]My Lord!— I pray your Lordship to accept my hearty thanks,
							for the honour which you have done my Country, in drinking the health of
							its chief Magistrate.— I receive it as an earnest of Peace Harmony and
							Friendship between the two Countries.— To promote the Peace, Harmony and
							Friendship between Great-Britain and the United States is the first duty
							of my Station— It is the first wish of my Heart— It is my first prayer
							to God!— I hope it will not be deemed unsuitable on this occasion to
							recur to considerations of a religious Nature— In ordinary cases and at
							ordinary times, it may be proper, and sufficient, for Britons, and for
							Americans to say to themselves, it is our interest, on both sides to
							live in Peace, Harmony, and Friendship together— But, My Lord, the Event
							which was yesterday commemorated by religious Solemnities, and which is
							this day commemorated at this Table in the convivial and loving Cups of
							your Lord and Ladyship, is the most important event that ever occurred
							upon this globe— It is an event in which we are all interested—a pledge
							to us all, of immortality. It is the warrant to us all of another State
							of existence, where all is Peace, Harmony and Friendship— May it ever
							have its proper influence on the minds of your Lordships Countrymen and
							of mine! May it ever remind them of a higher motive than any possible
							temporal interest, to Peace, Harmony and Friendship! In return for your
							Lordship’s obliging toast; I beg leave to drink, “all religious
							blessings, and all temporal prosperity to the Metropolis of the British
							Empire, and its chief Magistrate.”— Immediately after this toast, the
							Lady Mayoress and all the other Ladies left the Hall, and the Duke of
							Sussex after an introductory Speech proposed the health of the Lord
							Mayor— In returning thanks the Lord Mayor adverted to his situation, and
							to the earnestness of his endeavours to give satisfaction to all his
							fellow-Citizens, during the year of his Mayoralty— He said that he had
							particularly felt his duty to discard the influence of all political
							opinions in the faithful and impartial discharge of his official
							functions. He had his political opinions; they were earnest and decided.
							They had grown up with him, and he should abide by them to the last hour
							of his life. But he had never suffered them in the slightest degree to
							intrude upon his Execution of the Office of chief Magistrate, and his
							highest Ambition was to go through that Career, doing equal Justice to
							all, without distinction of Party or of Profession— This Speech was
							received with much approbation and applause— After this the healths of
							the Bishop of London, and of Chester were drank; and to the latter, with
							thanks for the excellent Sermon he had given this morning at Christ’s
							Hospital— The Bishops severally returned thanks adding a few words
							expressing their attachment to the City and its charitable
							Institutions.— Lord Erskine was next toasted with trial by Jury; and he
							made a very animated speech in returning thanks.— He declared how much
							he felt himself gratified and honoured by the connection of his name
							with that popular institution.— He said that in looking round the table
							there was scarcely a face but was familiar to him from the recollection
							of his having at some time or other addressed almost every one of them,
							in the character of a Juror. It was his highest glory to reflect upon
							his exertions in support of that popular branch of the Constitution; as
							he was fully convinced that in proportion to the respect and veneration
							in which it was held, would be the security and durability of all the
							other branches. It might be supposed and he doubted not that many
							persons had thought it was presumption in him to have adopted the words
							“Trial by Jury,” as the motto to his arms— As if he had meant to boast
							of having any peculiar merit in his zeal for that Institution— But it
							was no such thing— When by the gracious favour of His Majesty, he had
							been introduced into that Branch of the Legislature, where he now held a
							seat; he had determined to give a lesson to the Young men who should
							come after him—and by incorporating those words in the heraldic
							distinction, connected with his new Station, he resolved that whenever
							they should see his Carriage drive up to the House of Lords, they might
							also see that that was the way to get there. This Speech was received
							with acclamations of applause— Lord Kinnaird’s turn came next; and he
							returned thanks in a few words, very handsomely delivered, and which
							were much applauded.— His Brother Douglas Kinnaird, next to whom I was
							then sitting, said to me it was a thousand pities, that he was not at
							this time in Parliament. His observations were of the popular cast; and
							he said that there was nothing more suitable to the dignity of a British
							nobleman, than a liberal intercourse with the Citizens of London— The
							Lord Mayor next gave the Members in Parliament from the City— Alderman
							Sir William Curtis was the only one of them present, and he returned
							thanks for the whole— He apologized for his insufficiency, and regretted
							that none of his Colleagues more able than himself to address the
							Company were present to assume the task— He complimented the Lord Mayor,
							upon his faithful, able and impartial discharge of the duties of his
							Office as chief Magistrate; and this testimony he the more cordially
							gave, because upon general politics it was well known, and God knew that
							they did most materially differ, and had long and often differed from
							each other— Yet however great those differences had been, and however
							earnestly he had always maintained and should maintain the opinions
							which in his Conscience he thought right he was thoroughly convinced
							that in the ultimate results they were agreed. <pb n="429" type="ms"
							/>Their motives and intentions were the same— The last time he had been
							in that Hall, it was a meeting, which by its numbers, the weight of
							character, the ability, and virtues of the characters composing it, was
							not to be paralleled in the world— A Petition had then been drawn up and
							agreed to by them, which he had the honour to present to the house of
							Commons— The effect of it had been seen by the Event; and he thanked
							God, that Madam Property Tax had been put to rest— The Alderman sat down
							with a mixture of applause and of a low murmuring disapprobation— One
							Voice from a crowd of persons between and around the tables, spoke, just
							as he was closing, and said—“Aye! very well <hi rend="italic">for
								that</hi>!—good <hi rend="italic">for that</hi>![”]— The lord Mayor
							immediately proceeded to the next toast; which was The House of
							Commons—thanks to them for all their exertions in the cause of the
							People; and particularly for their recent decision! Two members of the
							House successively rose and returned thanks for this toast— First Sir
							Gilbert Heathcote, who fully concurred in the Sentiments of the Toast,
							and expressed his hopes that the House would always shew itself equally
							careful of the interests of the People, and equally ready to yield to
							their wishes— And secondly Sir Thomas Acland, who said he felt himself
							called upon to express his feelings with regard to both parts of the
							toast. He was grateful to the generous and magnificent hospitality of
							which he was now partaking. It was the first occasion of the kind, at
							which he had ever been present, and from what he had seen and shared of
							it, he readily believed that upon no other occasion of the same kind had
							it been more worthy of this great and noble City— The commendation
							bestowed on the House of Commons in the toast, was two fold—for their
							general attention to the interests of the People; and for their
							particular decision upon a late occasion— To the latter part of this
							tribute of thanks he must avow that he had for his personal share no
							claim whatever; He had voted for the property tax; from a consciencious
							conviction that it was a measure calculated to support the best
							interests of this Country. Of that act he was not ashamed, nor would it
							become him in any manner to disown it— But for the more general
							compliment of thanks to the House for their regard to the interests of
							the People, he could cheerfully accept his part, and so far as an
							earnest and ardent devotion to their interests and their welfare could
							go, he would not yield his claim to zeal and good intentions, equal to
							those of any other person whomsoever— This speech was also very well
							received— The last toast given was “the wooden walls of Old England,”
							with the Air of Rule Britannia, by the Band; and for which Sir Joseph
							Yorke returned thanks in a few words; regretting that this task had not
							fallen to a person more accustomed to speaking before a Public Assembly—
							The company then rose from Table— There had been during the dinner an
							allegorical Silk Flag, wove by the Spitalfield weavers, as a specimen of
							their skill, exhibited and displayed in the centre of the Hall—by
							permission of the Lord Mayor— The object appeared to be to excite the
							patriotic spirit, in favour of the drooping national manufacture; but it
							was not much admired, and the work was said to be very indifferent— As
							we rose from table, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lytleton whom I had
							seen at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Petersburg recognized and spoke
							to me.— Lord Erskine asked me if I had ever seen his Speech in the House
							of Lords upon the orders in Council— I told him I had seen it only as it
							had appeared in the Newspapers— He said it had been taken in short hand
							by his friend <persRef ref="perry-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Perry</persRef>, and published in a pamphlet.— He would give me one
							of them—and would come out and see me at my house— I asked him after
								<persRef ref="erskine-david">his Son</persRef>; who had been
							Minister in America— He said he resided at Brighton, and <persRef
								ref="erskine-frances">his wife</persRef> had just brought him her
							eleventh child.— He said what a pity and a shame it was that they had
							refused to ratify his arrangement, and recalled him— I said he had been
							one of the best friends to both Countries that had ever been concerned
							in their Affairs; and I was very sure if his bargain had been confirmed,
							and he not recalled, No war between the two Countries would ever have
							taken place— . . . Damn them! said he . . . and now that <persRef
								ref="canning-george">Canning</persRef> is coming back again . . .
							and coming into Office again!— I said he had a little too much wit, for
							a Minister of State. . . Oh! said he— He is utterly and totally unfit
							for the Office. . . Here I parted from his Lordship, and made my way as
							well as I could to the dancing Hall up Stairs—to which the Lady Mayoress
							had repaired, and where the Ball was to be opened. The crowd was so
							excessive that it was with the most extreme difficulty that I reached
							the Hall and the end of it, where the Lady Mayoress was seated in State
							under a Canopy. The Ball was to have been opened according to the usual
							form by a minuet, which Lord Kinnaird was to dance with the Lord Mayor’s
							daughter, <persRef ref="u">Miss Wood</persRef>— But Lord Kinnaird had
							got lost in the crowd, and had not found his way to the Hall— The crowd
							was increasing, and encroaching constantly upon the small space left for
							dancing the Minuet— The Duke of Sussex offered himself as a volunteer to
							dance the minuet, and actually danced it with great elegance, though he
							said he had not danced before, since he was at Berlin, and remarked to
							me that he had forgotten to put on his hat— He introduced me to his Son,
							by the name of <persRef ref="deste-augustus">Captain d’Este</persRef>—
							The Duke said he believed I had seen him at Berlin; but in that he was
							mistaken— The Captain laughed and said, that I had certainly not seen
							him then bearing the same name. He was then a boy only seven or eight
							years old— He is now a young man of four or five and twenty, certainly
							more than six feet high, and rather stout in his proportions— After the
							minuet there was an attempt <pb n="430" type="ms"/>to dance a
							Country-dance, but it was impossible for more than four or five couple
							to stand up, and the crowd soon pressed upon them so that they could not
							proceed. The heat was scarcely less oppressive; several Ladies fainted,
							and the Lady Mayoress sat in state with her smelling bottle constantly
							at her nostrils to keep herself from fainting— The Lord Mayor, one of
							the Aldermen, and the <persRef ref="silvester-john">Recorder</persRef>
							successively addressed the Crowd, intreating them not to press forward,
							but to withdraw into the other Halls— The Lord Mayor threatened even to
							call in Constables to clear the Hall— It was all in vain. The Lady
							Mayoress was obliged finally to leave the Hall. Of which the Recorder
							gave notice to the company, saying she would be glad to meet them in the
							Egyptian Hall— It was with the utmost difficulty that room was made for
							her to go out; and she was followed by so many of the Ladies, that in
							the course of a quarter of an hour the crowd thinned off leaving space
							enough to pass to and fro. On getting out of the Hall I found M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and Mrs King, seated on a window
							bench in the entry. There I stood some time with them; when the Lord
							Mayor and Lady Mayoress passed by, and invited us to walk round with
							them— We followed them down Stairs, and round through the Egyptian Hall
							where we lost them again in the crowd— The dinner tables were yet
							standing, and covered with people standing on them— We were obliged to
							pass over them to get out of the Hall— Along the two sides of this Hall,
							were a number of Busts, forming a singular Collection— The King, the
							Prince Regent, <persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="franklin-benjamin">Franklin</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Buonaparte</persRef> between <persRef
								ref="wellington-arthur">Wellington</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="vonblucher-gebhard">Blucher</persRef>— After returning to the
							window where we had left M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> King we waited
							there about half an hour— Several American Gentlemen of our acquaintance
							came up— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. A. Smith</persRef>, who gave

								>rs</hi> Adams and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> King, in M<hi

							to S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Paul’s Church-Yard, where with M<hi

							stopped at Craven-Street and took up <persRef ref="hauel-lucy">Lucy

								ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef> recommending him to me,
							for Passports to go to America. Gen<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Mina,
							had been twice at the Office, and not finding me requests me to appoint

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Moses</persRef>, enclosing some
							New-York Newspapers, and a Report of <persRef ref="dallas-alexander"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dallas</persRef>, the Secretary

							found <persRef ref="delafield-john2;u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>

								<persRef ref="tallmadge-frederick">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bibby</persRef> of New-York,
							made his first appearance on the London Theatre, in the part of <persRef
								ref="sirpertinaxmacsycophant">Sir Pertinax MacSycophant</persRef>.
							He performed the part altogether very well, but in the third Act, there
							was a storm raised against him in the Galleries, under which I was
							afraid he would have sunk— The Scotch accent in which this part is to be
							delivered deviates so much from the ordinary pronunciation of English,
							that it was impossible to understand three fourths of what he said— The
							Play itself is a very poor one, having nothing attractive about it, but
							as a bitter and illiberal Satire upon the Scotch character, Bibby
							underwent the trial of the tempest with great composure, and was
							supported by Counter-cheering from the Boxes and Pitt—with which he
							succeeded in getting tolerably through— He will make what they call here
							a very respectable actor, but I think cannot maintain himself for the
							performance of first rate Parts. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King and
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Delafield have taken a great interest
							in his favour, and I felt so much for him throughout the whole Play,
							that it was any thing, rather than Amusement— The Comedy was succeeded
							by a farce, performed for the first Time, called Who wants a wife, or
							the Law of the land, a miserably dull and tedious piece of Pageantry,
							not worth seeing, and the whole closed with the exhibition of Rope
							Dancing, by <persRef ref="lalanne-marguerite">Madame Sacchi</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="u">her two Brothers</persRef>. They danced together on
							three tight ropes extended by the side of each other, and afterwards she
							ran up the Rope, from the Stage to the Upper Gallery, and walked it down
							again— Between eleven and twelve the Play was over, and we returned
							home— Got to our own house between one and two in the Morning.</p>

							in the highest degree delighted with his new connection there, with
								<persRef ref="christophe-henri">king Henry (Christophe)</persRef> of
							whom he spoke in high terms of praise and admiration; but he was very
							reserved, with me, in speaking of his own present Mission, and of his
							future views— He gave me to understand however that his mission had
							reference to religious affairs— That King Henry was determined to admit
							no more Roman Catholic<hi rend="strikethrough">s</hi> Priests into the
							Country; but that his intention was to introduce religious worship there
							according to the rites of the Church of England.— Sanders says that King
							Henry was displeased with the State Coach that was built in this Country
							and sent out to him— It was too tawdry for him; and he sent word to the
							maker, that he supposed he had taken him for a king of Congo, who was to
							be caught with show.— Sanders was just going away, when M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Joy came in with the boys from their tour
							to Hampton Court.— He then stopped an hour longer, and returned to town
							with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joy— He had also persuaded me to

								<persRef ref="u">Captain Bronson</persRef> of the New Packet who is

							destined for India, for which they cannot obtain a clearance, and

							they made, to the Directors of the East-India Company, and to the Board

								<persRef ref="planta-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Planta</persRef>, when I could find his Lordship at home— He said
							not before next Wednesday, as he had been dining with the <persRef

							the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> mentioning that he had received
							and forwarded by the Mail Coach, a third despatch for me from the
								<persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef>. I walked
							from home, directing the Coachman to follow me with the Curricle in an
							hour— I walked to Hyde-Park Corner; in two hours and a quarter, and
							waited there about five minutes before the Curricle overtook me. I then
							went to the Prince of Wales Hotel, Leicester-Place <pb n="433" type="ms"
								/><persRef ref="mina-martin">General Mina’s</persRef> lodgings; but
							he was already out, and on proceeding to the Office in Craven-Street I
							found him there— He wished for a Passport to go to the United States— He
							has a permission from the Alien-Office to reside here as a foreigner;
							and I offered to endorse that, as good to go to the United States— But
							he said he was proscribed, in his own Country. The <persRef
								ref="delosrios-carlos">Spanish Ambassador</persRef> here, would not
							dare to give him a Passport, even if he were disposed so to do, and he
							was afraid, I should endorse the Alien-Office Permission, they would not
							only refuse to give him a Passport to go to America upon it, but that it
							might deprive him of the means of obtaining a Passport in another way.
							He asked me if I could not give him a Passport of my own, and make it
							out in the name of his Mother, which it was very customary in Spain for
							persons to assume— I told him that as a general rule, I gave my own
							Passports, only to Citizens of the United States; and I endorsed the
							Passports of foreigners from their own Ministers when they were going to
							America.— When they could not obtain passports from their own Ministers;
							if they had permissions from the Alien-Office to reside here; I would
							endorse them as good to go to America, and had done so in several cases.
							I considered every person as having a right to go from this Country to
							the United States, whom the Laws of this Country did not restrain, and
							if my Passport for that effect was required, I would give it in any form
							that would be accepted. I would leave it therefore at his own option,
							whether to take my endorsement upon his licence from the alien Office;
							or an original Passport from me. He said he would in the first instance
							try the endorsement; and if that should not succeed, he would ask me for
							an original Passport. And he had the same requests to make for several
							of his Officers who are with him— I promised him the same for his
							Officers, as for himself— There was also at the Office a M<hi

								ref="georgeandjamesabelandco">G. &amp; J. Abel and C<hi
									rend="superscript">o.</hi></persRef> to speak upon the subject

							every day of delay expensive, and they wished for an answer as soon as
							possible. I told him I had already made enquiry to see <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> about it, and
							would lose no time, in endeavouring to see him— And that I would give
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Abel notice of the answer as
							soon as I should receive it— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Oliver</persRef> was likewise at the Office, and said

							the nomination of <persRef ref="pinkney-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pinkney</persRef> as Minister to Russia, but refused

							Russia— He said he believed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pinkney had
							relied upon having a present from the Merchants, who were interested in
							the claims upon the Government of Naples; if he should succeed in
							obtaining indemnity for their losses— I considered it as a very

							the fears of the present Neapolitan Government might be wrought upon, to
							grant compensation for the spoliations of <persRef ref="joachim-i"

							forwarded from Liverpool by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury were at

							His Royal Highness the Prince Regent to invite the American Minister and
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams to Carlton House on Thursday
							next the second of May at Eight or between eight and nine of the

							this day; and with a note— The Company will be in full dress, but the

							the direction upon the other to answer on a particular day, seems
							intended to balance the courtesy of inviting by an assumption of
							authority in demanding the answer— It was between one and two in the
							morning when we got home. 23 [symbols]</p>

							O’Clock at <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord

							James’s Square— The <persRef ref="freire-cipriano">Chevalier de
								Freire</persRef> the Portuguese Minister was there before me, and
							had a short interview with his Lordship— <persRef ref="fagel-henry"
								>Baron Fagel</persRef> the Dutch Ambassador came in while I was

								ref="georgeandjamesabelandco">Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
								George and James Abel &amp; C<hi rend="superscript"
								>o.</hi></persRef> which I read to him; with the copies of the
							Answers they had received from the India house, and the Board of
							Controul. Lord Castlereagh asked me to send him copies of these papers,
							and said the matter should be arranged, as soon as possible— He also
							desired me, if I could conveniently, to call upon <persRef
								ref="robinson-frederick">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Robinson</persRef> the Vice-President of the Board of Trade, and to
							converse with him on the subject. I went to the Office in Craven-Street,
							and thence walked with M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams to N. 60.
							Conduit Street; <persRef ref="king-eliza">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> King’s</persRef> lodgings, where I left her— Thence I
							went to the Board of Trade; and obtained an interview with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson— He at first sent me word that he
							was engaged with a person by an appointment; and would be glad if I
							could call again to-morrow morning. But being informed that I would not
							detain him more than five minutes and that I had called upon him at the
							request of Lord Castlereagh, he received me— I read to him the Letter
							from the Abel’s and its enclosures, from which it appeared that a
							Clearance cannot be obtained for an American Vessel, from London to any
							of the British Ports in India— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson
							at first said that the Convention of 3<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi>
							July last could not be understood to authorize that— I said that if such
							a Construction should be given to it as would exclude our vessels from
							that advantage, it would certainly be altogether different from what I
							and my Colleagues expected at the Negotiation and conclusion of the
							Convention— He said there was not in the terms of the Convention, any
							explicit allowance of an indirect trade from the United States to the
							British Possessions in India— It was not however his intention to deny
							that it was understood when the Convention was concluded, that American
							Vessels might go <pb n="436" type="ms"/>indirectly, through other
							Countries to British Ports in India, but surely that could not mean to
							give them the privelege of clearing from the Ports of England itself, to
							go there— He remembered we had urged the indirect voyages through
							South-America, and that we ought to be placed on as favourable a footing
							as other Nations; none of which could clear out for British India from
							this Country. I admitted in reply that the indirect trade to India was
								<hi rend="italic">not</hi> given in express words by the Convention—
							But a general trade was given, without restriction upon the outward
							voyage— The homeward trade was restricted to the direct voyage to the
							United States.— 25 [symbols] The restriction being expressed in the one
							case its omission in the other obviously implied that it was not to
							operate. I was confident there had been a judicial decision in this
							Country upon the corresponding Article in the Treaty of 1794. to that
							effect. But he perfectly well knew, and now candidly admitted that it
							was on all sides understood at the negotiation of the Convention that it
							contained the indirect trade to India for American vessels; it was even
							explicitly recognized in the Notes of the <persRef
								ref="goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef> during the discussion— And I had
							observed in a printed account of the Debates in Parliament on the
							passage of the Bill which he had introduced, for carrying the Convention
							into effect, that a question had been put to him by some member upon
							this very point; to which he was stated to have answered that the
							Convention did allow an indirect American trade to India, but restricted
							the return voyage to the United States. He neither explicitly admitted
							nor denied that such a question had been put to him, and that he had
							given this answer— It seemed as if he had been since told that he had
							conceded too much by that acknowledgment— That the express words of the
							Convention did not give the indirect trade, and that an effort has been
							making, to narrow the Construction of the Article so as to exclude us at
							least from trading to India through England— I told him that if the
							Clearance from British Ports should continue to be denied, it would
							produce one of two effects— It would either in a very great degree
							defeat the indirect trade which the Convention was intended to contain;
							or it would merely operate to put American vessels to some additional
							trouble and expence, and some change of Custom-house forms— All the
							important commerce of the world centered so much in Great-Britain, that
							we could not have any indirect trade to India, of any importance, which
							would not bring our Vessels going thither to England on their way. If
							Clearances from England for India should be effectually prevented; the
							trade itself would be good for Nothing— But as it was admitted American
							Vessels might clear out from any other Country, for India, what other
							effect would the denial to clear them from British Ports have than to
							compel them to clear out for intermediate Ports, there to take fresh
							Clearances for their ultimate destination— Indeed I could not see how
							the Clearances from England could be denied while the indirect trade
							through other Countries was admitted to be granted. It was not given in
							express terms I admitted— It was given by obvious and just inference he
							admitted— But if the inference was just, as it respected a trade through
							other Countries, it was just for a trade through England. Granting that
							a question might be made whether the indirect trade was stipulated
							at-all, it would apply to all other Countries as well as to England—
							There was no special exception of England, nor was there any argument
							which would warrant the refusal of clearances from English, Ports, but
							that which would annihilate the indirect trade altogether— I had seen
							Lord Castlereagh and shewn him these papers this Morning, and had
							understood from him that this matter would be satisfactorily arranged;
							and it was at his Lordship’s request that I had called to have this
							Conversation with him on the subject— He said I might rely upon his
							disposition to give the fullest effect, and most faithful execution to
							the Convention. He would see and converse with Lord Castlereagh
							concerning it this day; as he should meet him in the house of Commons;
							and he would do every thing in his power for our accommodation— On
							returning to the Office, I had copies immediately made out of the Letter
							from G and J. Abel and C<hi rend="superscript">o:</hi> and the enclosed
							papers, and sent them with a Note to Lord Castlereagh. <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dorsey</persRef>, who brought me
							a Letter last Summer from <persRef ref="hellen-walter">M<hi

								ref="tarbell-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tarbell</persRef>, who has just returned with <persRef
								ref="tarbell-lucy">his wife</persRef> from France called at the
							Office— I invited them both to dine with us to-morrow— But M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dorsey was engaged; and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Tarbell apologized. M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tarbell being unwell, and not able to go
							out— I received a Letter from <persRef ref="maury-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury</persRef>. At 4 O’Clock I left
							the Office to walk part of the way home— Opposite Carleton House, there
							was a great crowd of People collected in Pall Mall— It was to see the
								<persRef ref="leopold2">Prince of Cobourg</persRef> who this day
							came in state, into London.— We had met the royal Carriages going out to
								<persRef ref="banks-joseph">Sir Joseph Banks’s</persRef> seat at
							Hounslow Heath, to take him up— He came this Morning from Windsor, 26
							[symbols] and after visiting the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince
								Regent</persRef> at Carlton House he took his residence until the
							marriage, at the <persRef ref="william">Duke of Clarence’s</persRef>
							apartments in S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> James’s Palace— There had
							also just been presented an address from the City of London to the
							Prince Regent, of Congratulation upon the Peace— I had met the
							procession of the Sheriffs Carriages, on their return, in Charing
							Cross.— At the corner of the new Street opening from Pall-Mall opposite
							to Carlton-House, I met the <persRef ref="proby-john">Earl of
								Carysfort</persRef>, and stood with him nearly half an hour in
							Conversation. I had seen his name in the Newspapers as having been
							present at the dinner on Saturday at Somerset-House, but did not see him
							there— He told me that he had been to look at the Pictures, but did not
							stay to the dinner; being quite an invalid, with his asthma— He said
								<persRef ref="proby-elizabeth">Lady Carysfort</persRef> was also
							unwell, confined to her chamber— That they had been only a few days in
							town and should not stay long; as he had let his house in Berkeley
							Square— We had some loose political conversation, in which he said he
							was now of the opposition; but he was disposed to be very candid towards
							the Ministers. He disapproved their large military establishment, but he
							knew they must gradually reduce it, and the reduction must require
							considerable time, to be effected with convenience— I said I thought it
							must end by a partition of France; and he expressed a wish that it
							might— He said there would be a falling off of the Revenue here,
							particularly in the proceeds of the assessed taxes, which I very much
							doubt— After leaving Lord Carysfort, I walked to the fifth milestone,
							near which I was overtaken by the Carriage with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Adams— We were at home about seven, and I received a Letter
							from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury. In the Conversation <pb
								n="437" type="ms"/>this morning with Lord Castlereagh, I began by
							shewing him the Letter of Instructions from the <persRef
								key="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef> to me, of 27. Feb<hi
								rend="superscript">y.</hi> directing me to consider it as an
							authority and instruction to negotiate a Convention respecting the
							fisheries. After perusing it he asked me, if a new Power had been sent
							to me. I told him there had not. But I was authorized to shew him that
							Letter, which my Government had undoubtedly considered as containing a
							Power sufficient for the purpose. He said that conformably to the
							agreement at our interview on the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							instant he had already sent out authority and instructions to <persRef
								ref="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef>
							for this Negotiation, which it would be more convenient to have
							conducted at Washington, because he was authorized also to give
							instructions to the British Commanders on the Coast, according to the
							result of the discussions. I replied that it would be personally more
							agreeable to me, and I presumed more convenient to my own Government to
							have the arrangement made at Washington. As however this authority had
							been transmitted to me, it was my duty to lay it before him, and to act
							upon it, if this Government should be so disposed— He said he thought it
							would only make the subject more complicated, without bringing it nearer
							to any result, and I readily acquiesced in this opinion. He said nothing
							of the nature of the proposition which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bagot is authorized to make.</p>
