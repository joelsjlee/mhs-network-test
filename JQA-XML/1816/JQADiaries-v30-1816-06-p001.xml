						<p><date>VI:15.</date> My hour of rising— The morning was employed in
							finishing my despatch N. 46, to the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>Secretary of State</persRef>— Then upon my Journal, which has
							involuntarily and insensibly run into arrears of more than three weeks.
							My Sons <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> and <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came home from School. I
							walked with <persRef key="adams-george">George</persRef> across the
							fields to the Uxbridge Road—then over Hanwell Common and through a
							footpath to Ealing Church and home. By the Evening post, I received a
							Note from <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>,
							informing me that orders have been given to the Commissioners of the
							Customs and Excise for the Admission to Entry of the American Brig
							William and Cargo, on the same terms as if the Manifest had been
							regular— The <persRef ref="swainson-john">Collector of the Customs at
								Liverpool</persRef> had refused to admit this vessel to entry,
							because the Certificate of the <persRef ref="gibbons-james">Collector at
								Richmond</persRef>, Virginia, upon the Manifest of Tobacco, was that
							the Captain had been <hi rend="italic">qualified</hi> to it. The Act of
							Parliament required that the Manifest should have been sworn to; and it
							had been sworn to. But the Collector at Liverpool refused to receive the
							word qualified, as equivalent to sworn. My note to Lord Castlereagh
							about it was sent the first of last Month.— Received also a Letter from
								<persRef ref="couling-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								William Couling</persRef>, who is much alarmed with the fear of
							losing his prospect of being employed as a civil engineer, by the
								<persRef ref="nicholas-wilson">Governor of Virginia</persRef>— He is
							afraid that the proposals which he gave me yesterday will be objected
							to, and prevent his obtaining the employment— He wishes them to be
							destroyed, and leave his compensation to what the Governor of Virginia
							himself shall judge proper. He likewise lets me into some unpleasant
							family Secrets of which he had not apprized me before.— This Evening I
							finished reading <persRef ref="scott-walter">Walter Scott’s</persRef>
							new Novel, the Antiquary. It is full of the same beauties and defects as
							Waverly and Guy Mannering; but is altogether the least excellent of the
							three. The fable is not well constructed—the incidents are too
							improbable and romantic. The character’s like all those of Scott’s
							drawing are moral giants, larger than the real life of nature— The
							picture of manners, and the free use of the Scottish dialect are much as
							in the two preceding works— The Antiquary, <persRef ref="edieochiltree"
								>Edie Ochiltree</persRef> the beggar, and old <persRef
								ref="oldelspeth">Elspeth</persRef> are characters deeply
							interesting— The fishwoman <persRef ref="elspethmucklebackit"
								>Mucklebackit</persRef>, the Post-mistress, Mailsetter, and the
							Innkeeper<space/>are subaltern characters well delineated— The rest have not
							much to recommend them.— Here as in the other instances there is too
							much countenance given to superstition— The Style is generally
							beautiful; the language full of force and energy; but as in all Scott’s
							prose writings occasionally quaint, and pedantic. It is remarkable that
							with his talent at drawing and colouring character, as well as of
							varying and enlivening dialogue, this author has never written for the
							Stage.</p>

						<p><date>2. VI:30. </date>This Morning I wrote <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> a Note, asking a
							permission from this Government for the exportation of rollers, and any
							Other Articles which may be wanted for the use of the Mint of the United

								ref="adams-charles2;adams-john2;adams-george">my three
								Sons</persRef>. <persRef ref="nicholas-george2">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas</persRef> read the Church
							Service for Whitsunday, including the Creed of <persRef
								ref="stathanasius">S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Athanasius</persRef>— <persRef ref="milman-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Millman</persRef> preached from 1.
							Corinthians XII—10.11. “To another divers kinds of tongues; to another
							the interpretations of tongues. But all these worketh that one and the
							self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.” I know
							not whether it be his fault or mine, but I can never give attention to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Millman’s Sermons— They are at once
							flashy and flat. I can hardly sit and hear them— Notice was given again
							that he had applied to be ordained as a Priest by the <persRef
								ref="legge-edward">Bishop of Oxford</persRef> on Trinity Sunday;
							that is next Sunday. There was also notice that to-morrow and the next
							day were to be kept as Holidays, and there would be religious service at
							the Church.— <persRef ref="bourke-edmund">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bourke</persRef> the Danish Minister and <persRef ref="bourke-maria"
								>his Lady</persRef> came out and paid us a morning visit— Three of
							the Schoolmates of our Sons, <persRef ref="chichester-james"
								>Chichester</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">two Drury’s</persRef>
							came and dined with them. I dined with <persRef ref="fox-henry">Lord
								Holland</persRef>, at Holland House, his Country Seat. It is about
							midway between the Brentford and Acton roads, and the entrance gate is
							at the side of the Kensington Turnpike— A very large Brick House, built
							in the Gothic Style, and four or five hundred years old. The library is
							in a central Hall which extends through the whole breadth of the house
							nearly two hundred feet long, but not more than thirty wide. The company
							were, <persRef ref="lieven-christopher;lieven-dorothea">Count and
								Countess Lieven</persRef>, with whom there came a young English
								Lady—<persRef ref="vonberoldingen-joseph">Count
								Beroldingen</persRef> the Minister from the king of Wurtemberg—the
								<persRef ref="villiers-george2;villiers-frances">Earl and Countess
								of Jersey</persRef>, the <persRef ref="gordonlennox-charles">Earl of
								March</persRef>, eldest Son of the <persRef ref="lennox-charles"
								>Duke of Richmond</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="levesongower-granville;levesongower-harriet">Lord and Lady
								Granville</persRef>, <persRef ref="mackintosh-james">Sir James
								M’Intosh</persRef>, and some other Gentlemen—eighteen sat down to
							table— The dinner was elegant; the wines choice; the dessert excellent,
							and might have seemed to me better; but that Madame Bourke an
							accomplished epicure had forewarned me that Lord Holland had the best
							Confectioner in London. The tone of Society was easy and agreeable—
								<persRef ref="fox-elizabeth">Lady Holland</persRef>, was perfectly
							well bred; and by several unaffected marks of maternal attachment to her
							Son, <persRef ref="fox-henry2">Henry</persRef>, a boy about twelve years
							of age who was present, bespoke a favourable opinion of her domestic
							character.— Lord Holland introduced the Earl of Jersey to me, at his
							request.— I sat between Count Lieven and Sir James M’Intosh at dinner,
							and had much Conversation with the latter, I had much also with Lord
							Holland after dinner, and was pleased with every part of the
							Conversation except my own— I offended Count and Countess Lieven, by
							bluntly saying, that I had never known such a thing as hot weather in
							Russia— I said two or three silly things to Sir James M’Intosh, and was
							altogether stiff and dull, beyond my usual measure— I asked Sir James
							M’Intosh if he was engaged upon a History of England— He told me he
							was—from the Revolution of 1688. He asked me, if I thought <persRef
								ref="franklin-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Franklin</persRef> had been sincere in the professions which he made
							here that he lamented the Revolution which was to separate the Colonies
							from Great Britain. which he said he did, the day before he last left
							London; even to tears— I told him I did not believe D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Franklin wished for the Revolution— Nor
								<persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>— He asked me
							if any of the leading men had— I said, perhaps <persRef key="adams-john"
								>my father</persRef>—<persRef ref="adams-samuel">Samuel
								Adams</persRef>—and <persRef ref="otis-james">James Otis</persRef>.—
							He asked me if we had any popular writers in America— I said none— Any
							good History of the Revolution? I mentioned <persRef
								ref="gordon-william">Gordon</persRef>, <persRef ref="ramsay-david"
									>Ramsey</persRef>, and <persRef ref="marshall-john"
								>Marshall’s</persRef> life of Washington. He said he had met in
							India, several masters of American Merchant Vessels; particularly from
							Salem; and found from them that America had two strong characters of
							English descent. A multitude of Newspapers and Stage Coaches— He also
							told me that he had last year introduced <persRef ref="scott-walter"
								>Walter Scott</persRef> to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>—the first of his
							admirers that he had ever seen from Kentucky. He spoke of Scott’s three
							Novels, as admirable delineations of Scottish Manners and of characters—
							The construction of the Stories, to which I objected, he said was good
							for nothing— I thought there was in the last of the three no new picture
							of manners peculiarly Scottish. That is nothing which had not already
							been painted in Waverly and Guy Mannering. He mentioned the Antiquary
							himself.— I said the character was well drawn; but I did not perceive it
							to be peculiarly National. He said there was its pedantry; altogether
							Scotch— He was himself a Scotchman, and he understood that whatever
							contest there might be about other qualities, the palm of Pedantry was
							universally awarded to his Country. I observed, that there must be
							something very powerful in the principle of legitimacy, which made the
							Scotch nobility and gentry now proud of their rebellions in favour of
							the Stuart’s, and instanced the late addresses to <persRef
								ref="louis-xviii">Louis 18</persRef> in presenting him the Gaelic
							Ossian, and to the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef>,
							also in Gaelic.— He said there was a sort of concession—“even in their
								<hi rend="italic">errors</hi>”— I told him that I had great
							admiration for the principle of legitimacy, but I hoped he would give it
							the finishing stroke in his History— It was to me, like <persRef
								ref="augustuscaesar">Octavius</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="cicero-marcus">Cicero</persRef>—ornandus and tollendus— He said
							he should certainly not think it laudandus— It was merely the fashion of
							the day— <persRef ref="hume-david">Hume</persRef> himself, in speaking
							of this principle <pb n="3" type="ms"/>said it was admirable; inferior
							only to the more exalted principle of the rights of the People. <persRef
								ref="hoadly-benjamin">Hoadley</persRef> was made a Bishop in the
							reign of <persRef ref="george-ii">George the second</persRef>; and
								<persRef ref="horsley-samuel">Horsley</persRef>, who somewhere
							called Hoadley the Republican Bishop, was made a Bishop in the reign of
								<persRef ref="george-iii">George the third</persRef>—the first for
							preaching against the principle of legitimacy, and the second for
							preaching in favour of them— My conversation after dinner with Lord
							Holland, turned much on a comparison between the political Institutions
							of this Country, and of the United States. He enquired about our forms
							of Representation, of which I gave him an account; and told him that the
							result of them was that the very great proportion of our public men were
							lawyers— He said it was precisely the same here— The theory of their
							Representation in the House of Commons was bad, but perhaps no theory
							could produce a more perfect practical Representation of all Classes and
							interests of the community— Even the close boroughs, often served to
							bring in able and useful men, who by a more correct theory would find
							themselves excluded— Men of property could always make their way into
							Parliament by their wealth—men of family; such a man as the Earl of
							March, might go into the house of Commons for a few years in youth; to
							get experience of public business, and employ time to useful purpose;
							and there was no man of real talents who in one way or another could
							fail of obtaining sooner or later, admission into Parliament— But a
							great proportion of the House of Commons were lawyers; and most of the
							business of the house was done by them— In the house of Lords, all that
							was of any use was done by Lawyers. The great practical use of the House
							of Lords, was to be a check upon mischief that might be done by the
							Commons— Many Bill pass through that house, without sufficient
							Consideration— The <persRef ref="scott-john2">Chancellor</persRef> is
							under a sort of personal responsibility to examine, and stop them— His
							character depends upon it— He is at the head of the Nobility of the
							Country, and all that <hi rend="italic">fudge</hi>; and his
							Consideration depends upon his keeping this vigilant eye over the
							proceedings of the Commons— All the ordinary business of the house
							therefore rest upon a lawyer— Lord Holland observed that from what he
							had heard, the most defective part of our Institutions in America was
							the judiciary; which I admitted— Count and Countess Lieven went away
							immediately after dinner. The Countess had an Evening party at her own
							house, to which we were invited— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> was to come
							with the Carriage for me, about eleven, and I had specially directed the
							servants to send me in word when the Carriage came— But this was
							neglected, until I had stood waiting until past Midnight. There still
							remained there The Earl and Countess of Jersey, Lord and Lady Granville,
							and Sir James Macintosh, who sat round the fire in the Library
							conversing upon the Methodists, <persRef ref="foster-john3">Foster’s</persRef> Essays, the Church, the
							Athanasian Creed, and other miscellaneous subjects— Sir James Macintosh
							and Lady Granville had been this morning to Church, where Sir James said
							they had heard a mild and moderate Sermon; . . . But, said I by way of
							atonement for his moderation he gave you the Athanasian Creed. . . Sir
							James said yes—to be sure— . . . they had that.— Lord Holland said there
							were many Church Clergymen, who at their peril took it upon them to <hi
								rend="strikethrough">omit it</hi> omit reading it; and that the
								<persRef ref="fitzroy-augustus">Duke of Grafton</persRef> always got
							up and went out of Church, when it was begun to be read— Lady Jersey
							said she wished she could go to a Methodist chapel, without being
							known.— About half past twelve a Servant came, and told me that my
							Carriage was at the door; and on going down I found M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams had been waiting there ever since
							eleven— I had been all the same time waiting for the Carriage, and had
							thoughtlessly neglected to enquire of the Servants if it had come— It
							was too late to go to Countess Lieven’s, and we returned home; which we
							reached soon after one in the Morning.</p>

							French Consuls were also there— I sat at table, between Lord de
							Dunstanville and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dubatchefsky; whom I met
							at <persRef ref="colombi-maria">Countess Colombi’s</persRef> at dinner
							in the Summer of 1813. and had not since seen. <persRef
								ref="perkins-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S. G.
								Perkins</persRef> of Boston was likewise of the Company. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Villiers recognized and spoke to me,
							having been present when I had my first Audience of the <persRef
								ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef>— I had seen him before that, when
							we were presented to the <persRef ref="louis-xviii">">king of
								France</persRef> at the Thuileries, in February 1815. I did not then
							know him; nor his name until this day. He told me that <persRef
								ref="bagot-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bagot</persRef>,
							the wife of the <persRef ref="bagot-charles">British Minister</persRef>
							in the United States was his niece, and I find that he married <persRef
								ref="wellesleypole-katherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Wellesley-Pole’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="villiers-maria">Sister</persRef>.— He spoke highly both of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Bagot, and told me that they were much pleased with their reception in
							America. Count Lieven and Prince Esterhazy, before dinner hinted to the
							Duke of Kent, that if their Sovereigns should be toasted or themselves
							they could not make speeches— He said laughing that if they would tell
							him in three words what to say he would speak for them— But that I could
							speak English very fluently, and I must speak for them all— The hour
							appointed for the dinner was precisely half past five O’Clock, and the
							company actually sat down about six— The dinner was good, and the
							toasting began early— The <persRef ref="george-iii">king</persRef>, in
							respectful silence— The Prince Regent, Protector, and the Queen,
							Protectress of the Society each as well as the following toasts with
							three times three— The <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor of
								Russia</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="frederick-william-iii">King
								of Prussia</persRef> were drank successively as Protectors, the Duke
							of <pb n="5" type="ms"/>Kent, introducing their healths with an
							appropriate eulogium, in each case, and especially reminding the
							company, of the urbanity and affability displayed by those Sovereigns
							when they dined with the Society at their anniversary two years ago. The
							Duke also returned the thanks of Count Lieven for the toast; and also
							for the Prussian Minister, when the king was toasted. <persRef
								ref="vonjacobikloest-konstans">Baron Jacobi</persRef> was not
							present— The next toast was the <persRef ref="francis-i">Emperor of
								Austria</persRef>; upon which the Duke, for Prince Esterhazy,
							addressed the Company; assuring them that although the Emperor was not
							yet one of the Protectors of the Society, it was only because he had
							been prevented from executing his intention of coming to this Country
							with the other Sovereigns two years ago. But that he the Prince should
							write an account of this meeting, and had no doubt he should receive
							authority to subscribe for the Emperor as one of the Protectors— The
							Duke next toasted his royal Sisters, the <persRef
								ref="augustasophia;elizabeth;sophia;mary2">Princesses</persRef>,
							patronesses of the Society; with an apology for his egotism, and an
							affectionate panegyric upon the benevolence of their dispositions.— The
								<persRef ref="charlotte">Princess Charlotte</persRef> and the
								<persRef ref="leopold2">Prince of Coburg</persRef> were drank, with
							the same marks of enthusiasm in her favour which I have witnessed on
							many late occasions.— The Duke of Kent’s own health was then proposed by
							Lord de Dunstanville, one of the Vice Presidents and Stewards of the
							day, who introduced it with some complimentary remarks— The Duke
							returned thanks, with assurance, of his attachment to the Society and
							its objects, and with allusions to his intention of shortly leaving the
							Country for some years. The Duke of York and the Army, the <persRef ref="william">Duke of
							Clarence</persRef> and the Navy; and the Duke of Gloucester, the first Patron of
							the Society were toasted successively; after which the Duke of Kent
							gave, the Foreign Ambassadors and Ministers present, prefacing it with
							remarks upon his personal satisfaction, at seeing so large a number of
							them, Ministers of Peace, from Countries with whom this Nation but a few
							years since, had unfortunate differences— The Hall he said in this
							respect, exhibited a contrast, most auspicious to this Country to the
							aspect which it would have had, only four years since— The Duke then,
							with the assent and request of all the Ambassadors present, called upon
							me to answer the toast; which I did nearly to this
							effect—“Gentlemen,—Deeply sensible as I am, to the honour done me, by my
							illustrious and excellent colleagues, in calling upon me to make our
							common acknowledgments for that which you have done us in the toast just
							given by His Royal Highness from the Chair, I feel myself no less at a
							loss for words than they can be, suitably to make this return for your
							goodness to them and to me— For although I am indebted for this
							distinguished charge, to the accidental advantage of speaking the same
							language as most of you; yet I must intreat your indulgence when I say
							that expressions suitable to convey the sense of their gratitude and
							mine, are at this moment as little at my command as at their’s. If,
							Gentlemen, it were the highest honour of this Institution, that it has
							for its Protectress, Her Majesty, the Queen Consort of this Realm, a
							Princess, who throughout life, has been by her private and domestic
							virtues, a model for her sex, as by her civic virtues she is an ornament
							to her exalted station— That it has for its Protectors, His Royal
							Highness the Prince Regent, the acting Sovereign of this Great Empire;
							and joined with him, a second Alexander, more glorious than the
							first—glorious, not by the conquest of the Earth, but by saving the
							Earth from Conquest; and a Frederick-William, glorious by having
							redeemed his kingdom and his Country, as by fire, entire and unimpaired,
							from the furnace of adversity— That to these, you have had this day, the
							promised expectation of shortly adding the name of their brother in arms
							and in virtue; His Majesty the Emperor of Austria.— That among the names
							of your Patrons and Patronesses, you reckon those of many Princes and
							Princesses, of the most resplendent lines in Europe— That you have the
							happiness of seeing in that Chair, a Prince of the illustrious House of
							Brunswick, to whose personal character beneficence is so congenial, that
							wherever it forms the basis of association, there, he seems naturally
							called to preside— If, I say, Gentlemen, these were your highest
							honours, well might my honourable Colleagues, well at least might I find
							my powers of language exhausted, in attempting to convey to you the
							sentiments which would animate us, in hearing our names thus associated
							with such great and glorious names— But, Gentlemen, these are not your
							highest honours— Proud as you have reason to be of these high
							distinctions, your highest honour in my estimation, and I will presume
							to say in that of those noble persons who have permitted me to address
							you in their names, is the principle of your association— That principle
							which has connected all those great and glorious names with your
							Society, and with your exertions.— Gentlemen, the sublime language of
							your immortal Poet, who asked a Kingdom for a Stage, Princes to act, and
							Monarchs to behold the swelling Scene, is not large enough for the
							purposes of your Institution— Your Theatre, is not a single kingdom, but
							the whole habitable globe— Your Actors are Princes and Monarchs—and the
							beholders; are the blessed Spirits that encircle the throne of
							Omnipotence— They look down on labours like these with complacency—they
							behold, the swelling <pb n="6" type="ms"/>Scene with delight— For the
							Action, the object of your labours is the first, and noblest of moral
							and Christian virtues—Charity— Charity in its most extensive sense—
							Charity, not confined to one language, one religion or one Country, but
							expansive as the Globe, and universal as the blessings of Providence.
							Gentlemen, to give utterance to the feelings which fill the bosoms of my
							noble colleagues, and my own, in return for the notice bestowed upon us
							by such an Association, is beyond the powers of language possessed by us
							all. We can only say in the honesty and simplicity of our hearts, we
							thank you.”— This address was very well received— Lord de Dunstanville,
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Villiers, and the Russian and French
							Consuls, complimented me civilly upon it. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Villiers asked me if I had been prepared for it.— I told him I had not
							had a conception until the moment when we sat down to dinner, that I
							should be called upon to answer for the whole Corps Diplomatique— But
							the truth is, I was not gifted by nature with the talent of
							extemporaneous speaking; and on this and all the other similar
							occasions, I have felt myself in much embarrassment, and have got
							through without discredit, only by revolving during the dinner time,
							what to say; a process not remarkably favourable to the enjoyment of the
							conviviality of the table— My aukwardness was this day aggravated, by an
							observation of a Gentleman, who sat opposite to me at the table, that he
							had heard at one of these same dinners, some years ago, a Speech from
								<persRef ref="pinkney-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pinkney</persRef> which he should never forget, and of which he
							spoke in an extasy of admiration— I confess the eulogy might have come
							at a more acceptable moment— But this Table-Cloth Oratory, is one of the
							duties of an American Minister in this Country, which I had not
							anticipated— The Vice Presidents of the Society were toasted next, for
							which their thanks were returned in a short Speech by Lord de
							Dunstanville. <persRef ref="murray-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Charles Murray</persRef> the Secretary read an account
							of the proceedings of the Society, and the donations and subscriptions
							of this day, amounting to upwards of £700— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Vaughan the Treasurer was toasted, and returned thanks, in
							so low a voice that although near him at table, I could not hear him.—
							The Stewards of the day were given, and Lord de Dunstanville returned
							thanks for them.— Then the foreign Clergyman, the founders of the
							Society, for whom <persRef ref="schwabe-c">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Schwabe</persRef> returned thanks in good language, but
							with a German accent— Another foreign Clergyman, a <persRef
								ref="kuper-johann">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kuper</persRef>,
							was also toasted, and thanked— Lastly the Duke of Kent, gave, the
							Directors of the Society, and observed that as it was growing late, he
							would join in the toast, the Secretary M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Murray.— He returned thanks for them all.— The Duke of Kent’s Band of
							Music attended, and performed during and after the dinner— Non Nobis was
							sung after dinner— This is a gloomy piece of Church-Music, which at
							almost all these Public Dinners they sing, instead of a Grace after
							meat. They had also besides the usual National Songs, God Save the king,
							and Rule Britannia; several others; grave and gay. About half past ten
							the Duke of Kent left the Chair; and was followed, by the persons of the
							Centre Table— I sat down M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith at Craven
							Street, and got home between twelve and one— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Pfeffel told me that a new Minister from Wurtemberg,
								<persRef ref="u">General Neiffer</persRef> had arrived, and that
								<persRef ref="vonberoldingen-joseph">Count Baroldingen</persRef> was
							recalled— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perkins spoke of the late
							accounts from America, as being full of commercial distress, and
							threatening many failures—which he attributes to the process of getting
							the new Bank of the United States into Operation.— He thinks of sailing
							next week with <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Perkins</persRef> for Boston.</p>

						<p><date>11. VIII:30. </date>It was in vain to think of writing this

							the army, recommended to me by <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>— He is an Irishman;
							but has been upwards of twenty years residing in America, and now
							obtained a leave of absence for a year, to come and look up some of his
							family relations; most of them are dead, and he has been unsuccessful,
							particularly in the search for <persRef ref="u">his Son</persRef>, of
							whom he can obtain no tidings.— He told me he had a friend at New-York,
							named <persRef ref="story-thomas">Thomas Story</persRef>; also an
							Irishman, and one of those who nearly twenty years since was proscribed
							by name, for the part which they then took in the troubles of Ireland—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Story wishes to obtain a permission
							to go to Ireland for a few Months, to settle some private affairs there,
							and then return to America— And M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook
							enquired if I could interpose with the British Government to obtain such
							a permission. I assured him that I readily would, if I could do it with
							any prospect of success— But I intimated to him the great delicacy of
							the subject, and the belief that unless there was a probability that the
							application would succeed, it would be from many considerations
							advisable not to make it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook likewise
							wanted a small sum of money, about one hundred dollars, for his personal
							expences, for which he offered his own Bill of Exchange, upon the same
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas Storey; and I agreed to supply

							recommending <persRef ref="dutton-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							which Dutton gave to <persRef ref="fox-robert2">R. W. Fox jun<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> to send to me, as his proof
							that his name was James Brown, and that he was an American Citizen—
							Baker said that that Protection, was an old one, <pb n="9" type="ms"
							/>which with four or five others, belonging to Sailors who had been with
							him on former voyages, had remained in his possession; and all of which
							he had left locked up in the lid of his chest at Falmouth— I asked him
							if he did or did not know that the real name of the pretended James
							Brown, was George Dutton— He equivocated, but said he had heard him
							called by the name of Dutton.— Said he had always told him his name was
							James Brown, and had been recommended to him by that name by <persRef
								ref="u">Captain Abrams</persRef>, Master of the American Ship
							Adriana of Baltimore— I shewed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Glennie
							the note from W. &amp; J. Brown of Liverpool, which he recognized as
							their hand-writing— I then requested him to write to those Gentlemen,
							stating these circumstances to them; asking an explanation of them, and
							informing them that I expected a candid answer— With regard to the wages
							of the Seamen, there was much discussion, but nothing agreed to— Baker
							had produced an account against the Seamen, to part of which they had
							objected. He told one Story, and they another. It was finally agreed,
							that they should all meet to-morrow at Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

							give him none until he gave his Seamen their discharge and settled with

								>Countess Lieven’s</persRef> Evening party, which was not much

								ref="esterhazy-paul">Prince Esterhazy</persRef> the Austrian

								<persRef ref="frederica-sophia">Duchess of Cumberland</persRef>.—
							The <persRef ref="pery-edmund">Earl of Limerick</persRef> introduced me
							to <persRef ref="hamilton-thomas2">Lord Binning</persRef>. I enquired of
								<persRef ref="neumann-philipp">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Neumann</persRef>, the Secretary of the Austrian Embassy, whether
							small arms, as well as ships, and Cannon were to be procured by purchase
							from his Government? He said he thought they were, and he promised to
							write, and enquire; and of their prices. <persRef ref="u"
								>Curtoys</persRef>, the Secretary of the Spanish Embassy told me,
							that he knew not when he should return to Spain— The Ambassador,
								<persRef ref="delosrios-carlos">Count Fernan-Nuñez</persRef> had
							told me that his own brother was coming to take the place of Curtoys—
							But Curtoys said he did not know how that would be— It was an elder, and
							illegitimate brother of the Count’s who was to come; and it was quite
							uncertain whether he would come, or not— Curtoys told M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams, that he was so disgusted with the
							trifling nonsens which was all they had to do here, that he was
							excessively anxious to be gone— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Balk Oleff</persRef> the Russian Minister going to Rio

						<p><date>17. VIII:30. </date>I wrote last Evening to <persRef

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> James Brown</persRef>, of the
							house at Liverpool had arrived in London, and they wished me to appoint
							a time when I would see them— I appointed this day 3. O’Clock at Craven
							Street— Immediately after Breakfast I walked from home about four miles;
							when I overtook the Hammersmith Stage in which, I went into London—
							Alighted at the king’s mews near Leicester Square. Went to the Covent
							Garden Theatre Box-Office to bespeak tickets, for the 28<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							<persRef ref="booth-sarah">Miss S. Booth’s</persRef> benefit, when
								<persRef ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear’s</persRef> As you
							like it is to be performed; but the Box keeper told me she had not
							informed him what boxes she had reserved to let herself, and what he
							might dispose of— He should know to-morrow.— At Drury Lane Theatre, I
							took two seats for this Evening— At the Office in Craven-Street, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> James S. Glennie came with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown of Liverpool. Brown admitted that
							the note to <persRef ref="baker-wrothbond">Captain Baker</persRef>,
							recommending <persRef ref="dutton-george">Dutton</persRef> to him as a
							Mate was written by a partner of the house, and he had no doubt had been
							received at the time, by Baker— He said that Dutton had been recommended
							to them by <persRef ref="budd-charles">Captain Budd</persRef>, who had
							been a Lieutenant in the Navy of the United States, but lastly Captain
							of a vessel called the Acme of Baltimore, seized and condemned last
							Winter, in Ireland, for smuggling.— Budd had told them that Dutton had
							been Mate on board the Acme— He added that since Dutton had been at
							Falmouth, they, the Brown’s had written to him, offering him the place
							of Mate on board the Eagle, a vessel they were sending out to India, but
							he had declined accepting the offer— Dutton’s own Story to <persRef
								ref="fox-robert2">R. W. Fox jun<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi></persRef> was that he had been mate of the Adriana, a
							Baltimore vessel which foundered at sea last winter, and the crew of
							which were taken out of her by a British vessel, called the S<hi
								rend="superscript">t</hi> Patrick— But <persRef ref="ware-gustavus"
								>Ware</persRef>, the Steward of the Baltimore says that Dutton, was
							the mate of the S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Patrick; an Englishman,
							and had never been in the United States— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brown thanked me for having obtained the order to the <persRef
								ref="swainson-john">Collector at Liverpool</persRef>, to clear out
							American Vessels for Batavia— But he declined paying any part of the
							wages of the Seamen of the Baltimore. He said they had already advanced
							upon the ship, more money than she was worth, and the owner was not a
							responsible person. Immediately after these persons left the office,
								<persRef ref="cook-john4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cook</persRef> came in— I paid him the remainder of £22:10. and took
							his Bill upon New-York for one hundred dollars— I had afterwards a visit
							from <persRef ref="allston-washington">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Allston</persRef> and <persRef ref="leslie-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Leslie</persRef>, the Painters—and a

									>r</hi> Ingraham</persRef>, enclosing a pamphlet from
							Washington, respecting the Presidential Election, and requesting me to
							examine his accounts, and sent him a draft for the money.— <persRef
								ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> went
							out to dinner— At 6. O’Clock, <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> came in the Carriage
							to town, and we went to Drury-Lane Theatre.— The Play was A new way to
							pay old debts, a revival from <persRef ref="massinger-philip"
								>Massinger</persRef>— <persRef ref="kean-edmund">Kean</persRef>, in
							the part of <persRef ref="sirgilesoverreach">Sir Giles
								Overreach</persRef>.— Kean is now the most popular actor upon the
							London stage, and has had great success in this particular part— It was
							the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> time of his performing it this
							Season. I think him a good actor, but the Play itself a very miserable
							one, and Sir Giles Overreach, rant from beginning to end.— The
							Entertainments were, first a new farce, called The man his own Master; a
							translation from le Nouveau Seigneur de Village, leaving out the
							music—and secondly, the Irishman in London— We came away in the midst of
							the second act of this last piece; and after calling at Craven Street,
							where we found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith reading in bed, we
							went to the <persRef ref="petty-mary">Marchioness dowager of
								Lansdowne’s</persRef> Route— There the crowd <pb n="12" type="ms"
							/>of fashionables was excessive—nearly five hundred persons crowded into
							two small chambers. As we entered the first Drawing-Room, we had the
								<persRef ref="ernest-augustus">Duke of Cumberland</persRef>
							immediately before us, and the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince
								Regent</persRef> immediately afterwards came up behind— It was not
							without difficulty that I made way for him to pass. We stayed there a
							full hour, jamm’d up in a corner of the Drawing-Room, and unable equally
							to advance or to retire. very few of the company were known to us— It
							was half past one in the morning when we got away, and as we descended
							the stairs we met <persRef ref="forbes-francis">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Forbes</persRef> our old S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
							Petersburg acquaintance going up. He had just come from a similar party
							at the <persRef ref="villiers-frances">Countess of Jersey’s</persRef>.
							About three O’Clock, almost at Sunrise we reached home; and after taking
							a very light substitute for my dinner, which I had omitted, at nearly
							four I retired to bed.</p>

						<p><date>18. IX:15. </date>The struggle to apply some part of the day to

								ref="ingersoll-jared">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jared
								Ingersoll</persRef> of Philadelphia, to the Letter from this person,
							which I transmitted to him last Summer. I enclosed this Letter to M<hi

								>Clisby</persRef>; asking for a Passport; but without enclosing any
							documents. I answered, directing him to apply to the Consul at
							Liverpool, <persRef ref="maury-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Maury</persRef>. I also wrote as much as I was able at my Journal.
							While at dinner I received Letters from <persRef key="adams-john">my

							and from <persRef ref="bellesandharold">Belles and Harrold</persRef> at

								Adams</persRef> and I went into London, to an Evening party at the
							Dutch Ambassador <persRef ref="fagel-henry">Baron Fagel’s</persRef>— It
							was rather late—there had been a party there at dinner, and it was a

								ref="vonberoldingen-joseph">Count Beroldingen</persRef> took leave
							of me, and told me he should leave London, the day after to-morrow— Lord
							Castlereagh told me that <persRef ref="brougham-henry2"
								>Brougham</persRef> had been asking this day in the House of
							Commons, for the papers of <persRef ref="pellew-edward">Lord
								Exmouth’s</persRef> proceedings with the Barbary powers; but he had
							answered that he was not yet quite ready to give them.— He also said
							there had been this day a sort of confirmation of the Story which has
							been for some days in circulation, that there had been some subsequent
							hostilities by the Algerines against the British at Oran— I told him
							that I hoped it would tend to recommend the advice which I had taken the
							liberty to give him, and to persuade the British Government to put down
							the crying scandal of those Barbary Piracies— He intimated that the new
							quarrel was owing to an attempt of Lord Exmouth to obtain from the
								<persRef ref="agha-omar">Dey of Algiers</persRef>, a declaration
							that he would in future make no more Christian Slaves; similar to the
							Declarations which had been given by the <persRef
								ref="mahmudibnmuhammad">Bey of Tunis</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="qaramanli-yusuf">Bashaw of Tripoli</persRef>: and added that it
							could not be on account of the mere protest which Lord Exmouth was to
							make on his return to Algiers, against one Article of the Algerine
							Treaty with the United-States, because, he was not even to ask that the
							Treaty should be annulled; but only that the prior engagements with
							Great-Britain should not be broken— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hamilton, the Under-Secretary of State told me that they had this day
							received advices that the late quarrel between Lord Exmouth and the
							Algerines had been arranged; and that the vessels and the Vice-Consul,
							seized at Oran had been restored. I spoke to the Sardinian Minister,
							about the Peace made for Sardinia by Lord Exmouth, and found that he was
							content to consider it as a very advantageous one— He said to be sure
							they had some money to pay; but that was a trifle, and they had got all
							their prisoners ransomed; besides a stipulation by the Bey of Tunis, not
							to make any more Christian Slaves. We came away at half past twelve; and
							as we were descending the Stairs, met the <persRef ref="pratt-john"
								>Marquis of Camden</persRef>, the <persRef ref="lowther-william2"
								>Earl of Lonsdale</persRef>, <persRef ref="addington-henry2"
								>Viscount Sidmouth</persRef>, and the <persRef

							Pall-Mall— This is a collection of 125 Pictures of the Italian and
							Spanish Schools, sent to the Gallery by the members of the British
							Institution for promoting the fine Arts, to be exhibited to the Public,
							for six weeks or two Months— A shilling admittance is paid for each

								<persRef ref="achilles">Achilles</persRef>, by <persRef
								ref="banks-thomas">Banks</persRef>; said to be the best piece of

							being selections of two or three from all the richest collections in

								>Raphael</persRef>, besides two of the Cartoons from Hampton-Court.
							The miraculous draught of fishes, and <persRef ref="paul"

							Raphael, Murillo, Andrea del Sarto, and one of the Claude’s. The Rooms
							were full of company.— We walked from them to the Office in
							Craven-Street, where I found a man, stating himself to be an American,

							a new Convention of Commerce with the British Government; together with
							a variety of other documents, which I fear will be to very little

							to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef>, asking for the settlement of his account.— Went to
							London with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams, and <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2;adams-john2;adams-george">our three
								Sons</persRef>— I took with me a check upon <persRef
								ref="martinstoneandmartin">Martin, Son, and Martin</persRef>,
							Bankers 68. Lombard Street, from <persRef ref="baringbrothers">Baring
								Brothers and C<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi></persRef> which I have
							had ever since the 20<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of May, without one
							opportunity of going into the City to receive it. I gave it to <persRef
								ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. A.
								Smith</persRef> requesting him to receive it to-morrow, and at the
							same time to call at the Consul’s Office, N. 1. Bishopsgate Church-Yard,
							and settle M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb’s Bill, which I also
							gave him—and with it, the Letter to <persRef ref="harris-levett">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris</persRef> at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t</hi> Petersburg, to be left with his nephew,
								<persRef ref="harris-john">John</persRef>, at the London
							Coffee-House— I found at my Office in Craven Street, a Note from
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, in
							answer to that I had addressed to him concerning the case of the
							Nanina.— It is an explicit refusal, to interfere with the proceedings in
							the Admiralty Court.— And Letters—from <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>, recommending
								<persRef ref="foxall-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry
								Foxall</persRef>, the former owner of the Cannon Foundery at
							Georgetown; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Foxall left the letter at the
							Office, and will call again—from <persRef ref="everett-alexander">A. H.
								Everett</persRef>, at Amsterdam. He is upon his return to the United
							States; and expects to sail about the first of next Month— This Letter
							was left by <persRef ref="everett-oliver">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Oliver Everett</persRef> who has returned from the Continent and is
							going to Liverpool—from <persRef ref="greuhm-frederick">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Greuhm</persRef>, the Secretary of the
							Prussian Legation, enclosing one from the <persRef ref="deliagno-alvar"
								>Chevalier de Llano</persRef> at Berlin— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Greuhm informs me that he likewise forwarded to me the last
							Letter that I received from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> de Llano—
							This Gentleman who has become a very assiduous Correspondent of mine,
							has I fear more liberality of principle than discretion— I find by this
							Letter that old <persRef ref="beresford-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Beresford</persRef> the English or
							Irish Clergyman whom we knew at S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
							Petersburg, is again at Berlin, and has lent my Lectures to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Llano, who writes of them in too
							flattering terms—and lastly, from <persRef ref="kenrick-warren">W. A.
								Kenrick</persRef>, the second Mate of the Baltimore, representing
							himself to be sick, and in great distress, and imploring relief— There
							had also been at the office a <persRef ref="birkbeck-morris">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Birkbeck</persRef>, who has the
							project of going out to make a settlement in the United States— <persRef
								ref="goodlet-a">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> A. G.
								Goodlet</persRef>, <persRef ref="saunders-prince">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> P. Sanders</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="bollmann-justus">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bollmann</persRef>, who is again here, had left Cards at the Office—
							After being engaged about an hour with these Papers, I went, with all
							the family to see <persRef ref="grosvenor-robert">Earl
								Grosvenor’s</persRef> Collection of Pictures at his House in Upper
							Grosvenor Street N. 33. We were admitted by the Ticket procured for us
							by <persRef ref="leslie-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Leslie</persRef>, as <persRef ref="west-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> West’s</persRef> Friends— The Pictures
							are in five large Rooms on the ground floor, and form one of the finest
							collections I ever saw— In the first Room are principally works of
							English Painters, and among them are the Death of <persRef
								ref="wolfe-james2">Wolfe</persRef>, and the Battles of La Hague, and
							of the Boyne by West—and the blue boy of <persRef
								ref="gainsborough-thomas">Gainsborough</persRef>— In the second, the
							largest and perhaps finest picture is the pursuit of Labon after Jacob
							by <persRef ref="murillo-bartolome">Murillo</persRef>— But there are
							four <persRef ref="lorrain-claude">Claudes</persRef>— Two Morning’s and
							two Evenings— Allegorical representations, of the rise and decline of
							the Roman Empire— Three small alledged <persRef ref="sanzio-raffaello"
								>Raphael’s</persRef>; but having nothing in them justifying the
							claim to my eyes— One of them however is a <persRef ref="johnthebaptist"
									>S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John Baptist</persRef> in the
							desart, which if genuine is the original of all the fine wild figured
							baptists, since painted— A tribute money by <persRef ref="titian"
								>Titian</persRef>, copied as I take it from the two copies of the
							same Picture in the Dresden Gallery.— A Madona and Child by <persRef
								ref="reni-guido">Guido</persRef>; a Marriage Feast by <persRef
								ref="veronese-paolo">Paul Veronese</persRef>; an Arcas and Calisto
							by <persRef ref="poussin-nicolas">Poussin</persRef>, and others of less
							Note— In the third Room is Ixion embracing the Cloud by <persRef
								ref="rubens-peter">Rubens</persRef>; an excellent Holy Family by
								<persRef ref="delsarto-andrea">Andrea del Sarto</persRef>—the
							Sacrifice of the Israelites to the golden Calf, by Claude, and another
							smaller landscape by the same. A woman taken in Adultery, by Titian— A
							large and excellent <persRef ref="teniers-david">Teniers</persRef>,
							containing a Portrait of Teniers. a Meeting of David &amp; Abigail by
							Poussin, and a Landscape with the Story of Jupiter and Antiope by
							Titian— In the fourth room five Portraits by <persRef
								ref="vanrijn-rembrandt">Rembrandt</persRef>, including his own—a
							salutation by Rembrandt— One Cattle piece, much admired, by <persRef
								ref="potter-paulus">Paul Potter</persRef>, and one by <persRef
								ref="u">Van der Velde</persRef>—Dead Game, two pictures by <persRef
								ref="cuyp-aelbert">Cuyp</persRef>, and sundry dutch Landscapes and
							water Pieces. In the fifth Room is a large Picture by <persRef
								ref="snyders-frans">Snyders</persRef>; a battle between two Bears,
							and a pack of Hounds, perhaps the most perfectly executed piece of the
							whole collection— The adoration of the three kings, by Rubens, likewise
							an Admirable Picture; a Madona and Child by Raphael, in his second
							manner— A Christ and the Samaritan woman at the Well, which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Leslie told me was a poor Picture—it was
							by <persRef ref="mignard-pierre">Mignard</persRef>— A marriage of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Catherine, by <persRef
								ref="vandyke-anthony">Vandyke</persRef>— And a little Prince riding
							on a large clumsy horse by <persRef ref="velazquez-diego"
								>Velasquez</persRef>— There were many other pictures of inferior
							note, and smaller size— As I went in, I met <persRef
								ref="dejust-william">Baron Just</persRef>, the Saxon Minister coming
							out— He told me he had received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="watzdorf-carl">General Watzdorf</persRef>, and intended to call
							upon us in the Country— We also met at the Rooms, <persRef
								ref="joy-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry Joy</persRef>;
							and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peticoles</persRef>;
							and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams met her old acquaintance
								<persRef ref="bancroft-catharine">Catherine Bancroft</persRef>,
							youngest daughter of <persRef ref="bancroft-edward">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bancroft</persRef>. We spent about two
							hours at the rooms, and then walked back to Craven Street, where I found
							Company— <persRef ref="joy-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G.
								Joy</persRef> who finding me engaged immediately went away— <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Corbin de la
								Beaussonniere</persRef>, Frenchman, and formerly military Officer,
							with another person of the same description. Their object was to <pb
								n="18" type="ms"/>enquire if there was any encouragement for them to
							go and offer their services to the United States? Whether I would pay
							for their passages? or whether they could expect to obtain Commissions,
							if they should go at their own expence— I told them that I had no
							authority to pay for the passage of any person; and that from the
							peculiar circumstances of the Country, there would be very little chance
							for any foreigner to obtain a military Commission there— They asked me,
							if I could give them a Passport. I said I thought they could now go,
							without any Passport; but if any one was necessary, they must have it
							from the <persRef ref="eustache-rene">French Ambassador</persRef>— They
							doubted whether he would give them one, and left me, saying they were
							disappointed in their hopes— We had met <persRef ref="bathurst-lawrence"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Laurence Bathurst</persRef>
							almost at the door of the Office, and he returned to it with us— He now
							told me his Story and shewed me some of his Papers— He appeared from
							them to be a son of <persRef ref="bathurst-lawrence2">Sir Laurence
								Bathurst</persRef> Baronet, who was son of a <persRef
								ref="bathurst-francis">Sir Francis Bathurst</persRef>, who was one
							of the original settlers of the Colony of Georgia; and as he says, a
							Brother of the first <persRef ref="bathurst-allen">Allen Lord
								Bathurst</persRef>— He tells a confused Story about his father, and
							strongly intimated that what there was to tell of him, particularly in
							his younger years, was not good— His main object is to obtain access to
								<persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Earl Bathurst</persRef>— I advised him
							to write a Note to the Earl, stating who he is, and asking to see
							him—with which I told him I had no doubt the Earl would comply— I said
							he might state that if the Earl would wish for evidence that he was what
							he claimed to be, he might refer to me; and assured him that I should be
							glad if I could be of any service to him— He said that after making his
							application to Earl Bathurst, he would call upon me again— We made a
							hasty cold dinner and then went to <persRef ref="booth-sarah">Miss S.
								Booth’s</persRef> benefit, at Covent-Garden Theatre. The Play was
								<persRef ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear’s</persRef> As you
							like it— We arrived after the Play had begun—at the second scene. Miss
							Booth herself performed the part of <persRef ref="rosalind"
								>Rosalind</persRef>—<persRef ref="kemble-charles">Charles
								Kemble</persRef>, <persRef ref="orlando2">Orlando</persRef>—<persRef
								ref="fawcett-john">Fawcott</persRef>
							<persRef ref="touchstone">Touchstone</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="young-charles">Young</persRef>, <persRef ref="jaques"
								>Jaques</persRef>, and <persRef ref="murray-charles2"
								>Murray</persRef>
							<persRef ref="oldadam">Old Adam</persRef>.— Like Others of the best of
							Shakespear’s reading Plays, it disappointed me in the performance— Miss
							Booth’s Rosalind particularly fell short of my expectations— She sung
							the cuckoo song however very well, and was encored— <persRef
								ref="duruset-john">Duruset</persRef> sung the other two Songs, Blow,
							blow thou Winter’s Wind—and Under the Greenwood tree, delightfully.
							There was not enough of the humorist in Jaques, nor of the fool in
							Touchstone. Several of the finest passages in the Play were omitted;
							particularly the satirical strokes of Jaques, upon Pride, and the City
							woman, and the fine speech of the banished Duke, at the beginning of the
								2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Act. But there was a transposition
							still more improper of the description by one of the banished Lords, of
							the wounded stag, and the reflections of Jaques upon it; for they have
							put the narrative of this Lord, and the repetition of the good sayings
							of Jaques, into his own mouth, which is a total depravation of his
							character, changing him from the melancholy humorist, into a vain and
							impertinent coxcomb— The masque in the fifth Act was flat; and Miss
							Booth spoke the original Epilogue; where she said instead of if I were a
							woman—if I were among you, I would kiss as many of you, as had beards
							that pleased me &amp;c as if any of the audience had any beards— After
							the Play <persRef ref="egerton-daniel">Egerton</persRef> came forward
							and announced for to-morrow Evening Henry the 8<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> for the benefit of the fund for decayed actors; and stated
							that on this occasion <persRef ref="siddons-sarah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Siddons</persRef> had kindly
							consented to perform the part of <persRef ref="queenkatherine">Queen
								Catherine</persRef>— Upon which there was a considerable hissing
							among a part of the Audience—others clapped; but the marks of
							disapprobation were stronger than those of applause. M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Siddons about two years since took formal
							leave of the Stage, but has lately reappeared already twice, and now
							comes for the third time— And no small part of the Public, question the
							propriety of this re-appearance; and although it is generally admitted
							that she is superior still to any other performer now on the Stage; they
							seem to consider it as a sort of offence against the public, after
							having once taken leave of them, that she still obtrudes her excellence
							upon their notice.— Between the hissing and the clapping, there arose a
							brawl in the Pit just before our box, in which there was an attempt to
							turn a man out—some pulling and hauling, and one or two fisty-cuff blows
							given; but the man kept his seat, and the Peace was restored by the
							appearance of <persRef ref="sinclair-john2">Sinclair</persRef> &amp;
								<persRef ref="stephens-catherine">Miss Stephens</persRef>, who sung
								<persRef ref="boyce-william">Boyce’s</persRef> duet “together let us
							range,[”] which was followed by an Interlude called the Rival
							Soldiers—silly like all the modern English farces; but in which <persRef
								ref="mathews-charles">Matthews</persRef> had a good part of a low
							lived Drunken fellow, in which he exercised humorously enough his powers
							of mimicry— He sung two songs, one A Lass is Good and a Glass is good,
							and the other, the Royal Visitors— Four-and twenty-Visitors all in a
							Row, much to the entertainment of the Company.— The Melo-Drama of the
							Blind Boy came next—the part of <persRef ref="edmund">Edmund</persRef>,
							by Miss S. Booth—then the Dance from Mother Goose by <persRef
								ref="grimaldi-joseph">Grimaldi</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
								>Ellar</persRef>; and lastly Ellar flew, or rather swung down from
							the Back of the Gallery, to the extremity of the Stage, by a Rope— It
							was at least half past twelve at Night when the whole was finished— We
							called at Craven Street, and thence came home— We arrived about three in
							the morning, and with broad day-light. I brought out with me <persRef
								ref="story-joseph">Judge Story’s</persRef> address to the Grand Jury
							of the U.S. Circuit Court, containing the biographical notices,
							concerning <persRef ref="dexter-samuel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Samuel Dexter</persRef>; a pamphlet which <persRef
								ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Aspinwall</persRef> had sent me—and <persRef ref="say-jean"
								>Say’s</persRef> pamphlet, de l’Angleterre, et des Anglois, which
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. Joy had left at the Office.— I
							left <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh’s</persRef> Note
							concerning the case of the Nanina, at the Office, to be copied by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith. It was almost Sun rise, when we
							retired to bed.</p>

							repentance.— It was a well written discourse in the most temperate
							Style, regularly constructed, with an introduction, and a natural
							division into three heads. The language was plain, with little ornament,
							and without any attempt at pathos. He cautioned his hearers against a
							misconstruction of the latter part of the text, as if there were any
							person who needed no repentance; and referred to the expositions of
							judicious Commentators to explain the proper meaning of the expressions—
							He shewed what kind of persons were to be understood by the term
							Sinners, and how they were to be saved by repentance— One of the
							strongest marks that I have of the merit of a Sermon is, to find
							attention possible without effort, and without involuntary wanderings. I

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>.</date> I have been into London, almost every other

							Evening parties, from which I returned always after Midnight—often by
							broad morning day-light.— The necessary consequence has been late rising
							hours the subsequent days, and the actual consequence late rising hours
							generally.— Hence a relaxation of Industry—accumulated arrears of
							Correspondence, and the impossibility of retrieving those of my Journal
							for the last Month. I have barely succeeded in keeping along with the
							current of this— I have scarcely ever risen so early as six, and once as
							late as ten— The hours before breakfast have thus been in a great
							measure lost, and on the days when I go into London, they are commonly
							the only hours that I have for writing.— <persRef

							eleven, and dine at six, or when I return from London to dinner, at

							Newspapers—the Morning Chronicle of the Day, and the Courier of the
							preceding Evening, and on Sunday’s the Observer and <persRef
								ref="cobbett-william">Cobbett’s</persRef> Register.— Sunday
							Morning’s, I always attend the Church at Ealing— After dinner, I must be
							idle— In these long days we sometimes walk in our garden, and sometimes
							round the neighbourhood— I seldom retire to bed, until near Midnight—
							The Season has been backward, almost beyond example— There has been yet
							scarcely a day of warm weather; but the face of the Country has been
							exquisitely beautiful— Our garden though small, is laid out with taste
							and elegance, with forest trees, fruit-trees, shrubs, Plants, herbs,
							kitchen vegetables, and flowers in profusion— It is a little Paradise,
							vocal with the harmony of every feathered songster of the Spring— The
							Session of Parliament is just about closing. The fashionable world is
							deserting the City, and I hope henceforth for several Months to have no
							calls to London, other than of business or of curiosity— That I may be
							thus enabled to resume my hours of early rising, redeem my arrears of
							Correspondence, and of Journal, and find an occasional hour for useful
							reading.— The Season of hay-making is just now commencing, and within
							the last five days we have the first peas and strawberries from our
