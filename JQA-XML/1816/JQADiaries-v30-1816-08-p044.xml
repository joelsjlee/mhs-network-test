						<p><date>1. VII:15. </date>We have been this day one year residing at
							Little-Boston-House, Little Ealing, as comfortable and pleasant a place

							troublesome, particularly for the last six Months, that we propose to
							remove either into London or nearer to it, at the approach of the next
							Winter— I wrote part of a Letter to <persRef ref="adams-john">my

							Ambassador in answer to mine of<space/>to him— He writes that he has sent in

							read this Evening part of the Journal of a <persRef ref="babcock-amos"

							That event was the 18<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of February. The

								Smith</persRef> came with a Letter of introduction and
							recommendation to me, from <persRef ref="mann-william">W.
							Mann</persRef>, Chaplain to the fishmonger’s company— Joseph Smith is a
							Clergyman and a Schoolmaster, born of English Parents in South-Carolina,
							bred and educated at Greenwich in England, which he left in 1799. he
							lived sometime in Virginia and afterwards in the State of New-York where
							he kept a school of 60 scholars and occasionally preached, until two or
							three years since when he became <pb n="45" type="ms"/>afflicted with
							the rhumatism in his head, so severely, that he was obliged to give up
							both his school and his preaching, and went to Jamaica for the recovery
							of his health. From Jamaica he came here, where he had several relations
							from whom he hoped to obtain relief or assistance. But he found that
							many of them were dead and the survivors unable or unwilling to give him
							any assistance. He is now at Guy’s Hospital—and extremely anxious to
							return to America— He experiences unkind treatment at the hospital, from
							the prejudices of the lower class of people against him as an American.
							A Master of an English Vessel now at the Tower wharf ready to sail for
							New-York with Passengers, has offered him a free passage if he can raise
							£12 Sterling to pay for his provisions.— He came out yesterday in the
							Ealing Stage, but finding me not at home, he lodged last Night at
							Brentford, and wished to return by the eight O’Clock Stage this Morning—
							Unable to give him all the assistance that he needed, I gave him the
							direction to the <persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas">American
								Consul’s</persRef> Office, where I thought he might be referred to
							persons who would make up for him the sum required to pay for his
							passage. I received a line from <persRef ref="smith-john">J. A.

							She went out upon a fishing party with <persRef ref="adams-charles2;adams-george;adams-john2">our three Sons</persRef> before Noon, and
							returned after seven in the Evening— I walked to the junction canal,

								ref="luffman-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Luffman</persRef>
							the engraver came, and made further enquiries about the means for him,
							of going to the United States— He proposes to take out with him many <pb
								n="46" type="ms"/>plates of his maps to pursue his business in
							America; but being apprehensive that they might be seized in the attempt
							to carry them away, he came to enquire if I would guarantee their safe
							exportation, which I of course declined. <persRef ref="smyth-patrick"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Patrick Smyth</persRef> came
							according to the appointment I had made, and shewed me the Will of
								<persRef ref="u">his brother</persRef> upon which he claims the

							not fully ascertained that the testator himself is dead. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smyth, that as the general question in
							this case applies to both Nations, it might be necessary that there
							should be an understanding between the two Governments on the subject—
							It would be therefore advisable for him to apply to the British
							Government; and, obtain their interest in his favour— They would then
							either through me, or through the <persRef ref="bagot-charles">British
								Minister in the United States</persRef>, propose some arrangement
							which may operate with reciprocity, and I was sure the Government of the
							U.S. would be ready to settle it upon the most liberal principles— After
							some embarrassment and hesitation, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smyth
							acknowledged that he had already made an application, upon his case to
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, and
							had received his answer, which declined any interference, until Smyth
							should have pursued his pretensions, <hi rend="italic">in the proper
								channel</hi>, which Smyth said he had now done by applying to me— I
							told him I supposed Lord Castlereagh had meant, not me, but the Courts
							of Law in the Country where the estate lies— Smyth wanted me to give him
							in writing the assurance that the American Government would make the
							settlement on the most liberal principles, but he finally went away,
							saying that he should make a new application to Lord Castlereagh. There
							was also a Letter from <persRef ref="thorne-philip">Philip
								Thorne</persRef> of Tavistock; enquiring if I had received his
							Letter enclosing the Information of <persRef ref="avery-thomas"
								>Avery</persRef>, and stating that he had been advised to publish it
							in the Newspapers; but as they would probably go to the United States,
							he wished first to hear from me.— I answered his Letter, dissuading him

								Sanders</persRef>— The Conversation at table was not remarkably
							harmonious; and the company was not well assorted— After dinner there
							was a numerous party; and one Card-table made up. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Drouet played upon the flute; his Sister,
								<persRef ref="u">Miss Cowell</persRef>, and one or two other young
							Ladies played on the Piano, and sung. There was a younger <persRef
								ref="u">Miss Cowell</persRef> who sung uncommonly well. Young Cowell
							introduced Sheridan to me— I asked Perry who was the author of some
							verses on the Death of Sheridan which appeared in this day’s Morning
							Chronicle— He told me it was <persRef ref="moore-thomas">Tommy
								Moore</persRef>— He spoke to me of a pretended Treaty between Russia
							and the United States, which has been announced in many late Newspaper
							paragraphs— I told him he might rely upon it there was no foundation for
							the Story— He spoke also of the distressed State of the Country, and the
							late Meeting, called by the <persRef ref="manners-john">Duke of
								Rutland</persRef>, and presided by the <persRef
								ref="frederickaugustus">Duke of York</persRef>; which had a curious
							and quite unexpected result.— He said that in his paper to-morrow, there
							would be an account of the Spanish Expedition against Algiers, in 1775.
							which failed.— That the present expedition of <persRef
								ref="pellew-edward">Lord Exmouth</persRef> had been undertaken
							sorely against the inclinations of the British Government, at the urgent
							instigation of the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor of
								Russia</persRef>, who was meddling with everything.— That there
							would also be in to-morrow Morning’s paper, a call upon the Ministers to
							assemble Parliament immediately, or that they would incur a heavy
							responsibility— That there was a monthly agricultural Report in which
							there were dreadful details of the distresses of the Country— It was
							printed, and partially published; by distributions only to particular
							persons— But he had a copy of it, and should certainly make use of it—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. A. Smith sent me the Note to Lord
							Castlereagh, concerning <persRef ref="shapleigh-reuben">R.
								Shapley’s</persRef> case to be signed— I took it home with me— It
							was one in the Morning when we reached home— The Morning had been fine,
							and at Summer heat; but there was a heavy thunder shower by four in the
							afternoon, and from that time cold and frequent rains all the
							Evening.</p>

							documents to prove his good conduct and the importance of his Services
							in the War— The rainy weather kept me at home until after dinner, when I

							Boyd’s pamphlet after my return— George feels his return to School so
							irksome, that I expect to find it necessary to remove him from it, at
							the end of this term.</p>

							Bidwell told me there was a Note coming to me, from <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, with several
							Affidavits of Officers, respecting the carrying away of American
							Slaves—from which it will appear that the charges against the Officers
							were false. There had already been a Report from <persRef
								ref="cockburn-george">Admiral Cockburn</persRef>; and now there were
							several others— Bidwell spoke also of <persRef ref="pellew-edward">Lord
								Exmouth’s</persRef> present expedition against Algiers— He said that
							to be sure they were barbarous people; but he did not see why they
							should now be destroyed more than at any former time— It would be as
							well to go on enduring them as they had been endured so many years. The
							language of the subaltern discloses the intention of the principal— I
							returned to my Office where I found a Note from <persRef
								ref="kellerman-o">O. C. Kellermann</persRef>, with a small Volume in
							the Danish language, upon the Nicobar Islands— I had also received this
							morning a Letter from <persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> T. Aspinwall</persRef>, in reply to
							mine of yesterday to him. I answered M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Visger’s Letter.— Dined at the Mansion House with the <persRef
								ref="wood-matthew">Lord Mayor</persRef>.— It was a dinner to the
								<persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of Wellington</persRef>, and
							for the purpose of presenting to him a Resolution of thanks from the
							Common Council of London voted shortly after the Battle of Waterloo, and
							upon that occasion. The party was small— A single table of about
							thirty-six persons. The <persRef ref="adolphus">Duke of
								Cambridge</persRef> and <persRef ref="leopold2">Prince
								Leopold</persRef> had been invited but sent excuses— The <persRef
								ref="augustusfrederick">Duke of Sussex</persRef> had engaged to
							attend, but the <persRef ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef> sent for him
							to dine with her; a summons that he was of course obliged to obey. He
							came before the company left the table after dinner.— The Lord Mayor
							received an excuse from <persRef ref="esterhazy-paul">Prince
								Esterhazy</persRef> the Austrian Ambassador just before going to
							table. He said he had not expected him— I had called upon M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourke, partly to enquire if he had been
							invited to the dinner— He had not— I was the only foreign Minister
							present; a favour, for which I have more than once been indebted to the
							present Lord Mayor; without precisely knowing why— Probably because he
							is a whig; and friendly to liberal principles with regard to America— I
							had been doubtful whether to go in full Court <pb n="48" type="ms"
							/>Dress to this party, or in Frock-Dress— On consulting M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bourke, he advised me to go in Frock— I
							accordingly went so, but found the Lord Mayor, and most of the Company
							in Full-Dress— The <persRef ref="edward">Duke of Kent</persRef>,
							however, the only person of the Royal family who attended, came in
							Frock—as did the <persRef ref="bligh-john">Earl of Darnley</persRef> and
							his Son <persRef ref="bligh-edward">Lord Clifton</persRef>— The Duke of
							Wellington himself, and his Aids de Camp, <persRef ref="hill-arthur"
								>Lord Arthur Hill</persRef>, and Colonels <persRef ref="percy-henry"
								>Percy</persRef>, <persRef ref="herveybathurst-felton"
								>Hervey</persRef> and <persRef ref="fremantle-john"
								>Freemantle</persRef>, were in Military Uniform— <persRef
								ref="erskine-thomas">Lord Erskine</persRef>, and the Aldermen were
							in Court dresses— I apologized for being in Undress— Before dinner the
							Lord Mayor introduced me to the Duke of Wellington— I observed that I
							had already been introduced to him— Oh! Yes! said he—at Paris— No—at the
							Prince Regent’s last Levee, at Carlton-House, by your Grace’s brother,
								<persRef ref="wellesleypole-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wellesley-Pole</persRef>— Oh! Aye! Yes! said the Duke, who had
							obviously forgotten me and my introduction.— This is one of the many
							incidents from which I can perceive how very small a space my person or
							my station occupy in the notice of these persons, and at these places—
							The Lord Mayor intimated to me that I was to take my place at table
							after Lord Darnley and Lord Erskine, and before Lord Clifton, who he
							observed was not a Peer.— But as in handing the Ladies down, I took the
							Lord Mayor’s eldest daughter, <persRef ref="wood-maria2">Miss
								Wood</persRef>, it happened that I found myself at table next above
							Lord Darnley, with Miss Wood between us— There were no Cards as on
							former occasions in the Plates— Before we were seated, the Lord Mayor
							repeatedly told Lord Darnley that he was not high enough; but there was
							no higher place that he could have taken except mine, and I did not take
							the hint of offering it to him. We kept our seats therefore as we had
							taken them— The Lord Mayor and <persRef ref="wood-maria">Lady
								Mayoress</persRef> sat as usual at the head of the Table side by
							side. The Duke of Kent at the right of the Lord Mayor, and the Duke of
							Wellington at the left of the Lady Mayoress— The Dinner was of Turtle
							and Venison, and otherwise luxurious as usual. At the dessert the loving
							Cups of Champagne Punch, and the Basons of Rose water went round— The
							Steward at the passing of the Cups, and at the first toast <persRef
								ref="george-iii">The king</persRef>—went through the nomenclature of
							the company, according to custom; naming the American Minister
							immediately after Lord Erskine.— The Lord Mayor gave us the toast
							immediately after the King—the Queen and female branches of the Royal
							Family—forgetting the Prince Regent; of which he was immediately
							reminded by the Duke of Kent— He corrected his mistake; but this
							forgetfulness led me to inferences similar in principle to those I had
							drawn from the Duke of Wellington’s oblivious faculties, at the
							introduction to him by his brother of an American Minister— The routine
							of standing toasts followed. The Duke of York and the Army— The Wooden
							Walls of Old England, and better health to the <persRef ref="william"
								>Duke of Clarence</persRef>— He was it seems yesterday suddenly
							seized with an illness so violent that he was last Night in the most
							imminent danger— But had been relieved, and the danger entirely removed—
							Next came the personal attacks— The Lord Mayor gave every toast with a
							Speech. First the Duke of Kent, who only bowed, without returning
							thanks— Just as the Lord Mayor was about proposing the Duke of
							Wellington, the Duke of Sussex came in— He would not permit the Lord
							Mayor to postpone on his account the toast proposed; and accordingly the
							Duke of Wellington was given— He also answered only by a bow— The Duke
							of Sussex was toasted next, and his brother said to him laughing—“now
							you must make a speech— I made a speech of about a quarter of an hour”—
							But Sussex saw he was joking and only bowed— The Lord Mayor introduced
							the Earl of Darnley’s health, with a high Eulogium upon his hospitality
							last week to the whole City party, who went with the Lord Mayor on the
							septennial tour to claim the City Jurisdiction upon the rivers Thames
							and Medway— Lord Darnley returned thanks with a short Speech, expressing
							his pleasure at having had the opportunity of shewing attentions to the
							City-Party, and his wish that a similar opportunity could occur annually
							instead of once in seven years— Then Lord Erskine was given, with Trial
							by Jury— He said that if that addition had not been made, he should have
							remained silent though thankful; but when trial by Jury was given, he
							could not suppress his feelings.— He then made a short Speech, in which
							he said that he had not changed his principles; made a very flattering
							compliment to the Duke of Wellington, and declared himself inexpressibly
							happy to have entered Paris with him last Summer. All which was owing to
							Trial by Jury— Now came the turn of the American Minister, whose health
							the Lord Mayor introduced with thanks for having had several times the
							pleasure of his Company on these Occasions— I returned my thanks in a
							few words; with a reference to the conciliatory and popular conduct of
							the British Minister in the United States, and expressing my pleasure in
							remarking that he was a near relative to the illustrious Commander, whom
							Britain claimed as her own; but who in a more enlarged point of view,
							belonged to the whole human race as every individual whose virtues and
							atchievements does honour to our common Nature, is the pride and glory
							not merely of one Nation but of all human kind— The City members of
							Parliament, were toasted next—for whom <persRef ref="atkins-john"
								>Alderman Atkins</persRef>, the only one of them present, returned
							thanks in a Speech— Then the Aldermen, for whom <persRef
								ref="scholey-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Scholey</persRef> answered— Then the Duke of Wellington’s Aides de
							Camp, whose thanks were laconically returned by Lord Arthur Hill—
								<persRef ref="u">General Witherell</persRef>, was succeeded by the
							Sheriffs <persRef ref="bell-thomas">Sir Thomas Bell</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="thorp-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thorpe</persRef>, both <pb n="49" type="ms"/>of whom answered. The
							Lord Mayor then proposed giving the Sheriff elect, <persRef
								ref="kirby-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kirby</persRef>,
							but the Duke of Sussex insisted upon giving the long pull, the strong
							pull and the pull altogether— This was meant as a compliment to the Duke
							of Wellington; pledging and asking for harmonious co-operation, though
							Sussex is in high opposition to the Ministry; and at personal variance
							with the Regent— Wellington received the compliment as it was meant— His
							countenance lightened up, and he made a speech of thanks to the Lord
							Mayor, and the City of London for their Resolutions and the dinner— He
							was not fluent; but he expressed his earnest hope for a long and general
							Peace; and most especially with America; upon which occasion he spoke in
							terms of great civility of the American Minister— The company had
							already risen from table; but the Lord Mayor renewed the proposition for
							drinking the Sheriff elect, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kirby
							returned thanks and promised to devote himself, and all his efforts to
							the service of the City— The gentlemen then returned to join the Ladies
							in the drawing-Room above Stairs— The Ladies had withdrawn soon after
							the Duke of Sussex came in, and the Duke of Kent immediately afterwards
							went away— The Lord Mayor and the City of London, was then given by the
							Duke of Wellington, after which the Duke of Sussex gave the Lady
							Mayoress, for whom the Lord Mayor returned thanks.— Every toast,
							excepting the first (the King) was drank standing; with what they call
							three times three—hip-hip-hip—and nine huzza’s.—for the Lord Mayor
							observed that it was impossible to do any thing in the City without
							noise— With all this, the dinner was inexpressibly dull— The company was
							obviously not well assorted— The Duke of Wellington yawned like
							L’Eveillé in the Barbier de Séville, and his aids occasionally laughed
							in the Sardonic manner, as if it was at themselves for being in company
							with the City— Wellington has no lively flow of Conversation; but he
							bore the daubing of flattery spread over him at every toast with
							moderate composure. The general aspect of his countenance is grave and
							stern, but sometimes it opens to a very pleasing smile— The City
							Resolutions elegantly written and illuminated upon parchment were read
							by a City Officer, and delivered to him in the Drawing Room before
							dinner. After dinner a drawing of the Silver Column, with a shield
							covering its base, which is to be presented to the Duke, by a
							subscription raised in the City, was exhibited, and freely criticised by
							the Duke’s Aids— I had conversation with Lord Erskine before, and with
							the Earl of Darnley after dinner— Lord Erskine said it was very well for
							us to come and dine there upon Turtle and Venison, but the Country was
							ruined. He told me again of his determination to go and travel in the
							United States.— Lord Darnley seemed to be under apprehensions of a new
							War with the United States which he deprecated. He thought also that the
							British Government ought to furnish assistance to the South-Americans,
							to accomplish their emancipation— One of the Aldermen disclosed to me
							his consternation that the Stocks had fallen this morning full one per
							Cent, which he attributed to the manoeuvering of certain Jew
							Stock-brokers, and to <persRef ref="cochrane-thomas">Lord
								Cochrane’s</persRef> assertion at the late meeting in the City to
							relieve the poor, that the interest upon the national debt must be
							reduced. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sheriff Thorpe, made enquiries
							of the health of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams.— I told him she
							had been long intending to go and pay <persRef ref="thorpe-samuel">his
								father</persRef> a visit— The Duke of Sussex told me that he
							intended in the course of three or four weeks to make me a visit at
							Ealing, and to ask me for a joint of Mutton— He said he would give me
							notice beforehand, and I asked him to bring his Son <persRef
								ref="deste-augustus">Captain D’Esté</persRef> with him, which he
							promised. I spoke to the Captain himself about his expedition to
							New-Orleans, where he was Aid de Camp to <persRef ref="pakenham-edward"
								>General Pakenham</persRef>; but he said it was a shocking affair
							and did not incline to talk much about it. He said it was a foolish
							thing ever to attempt an invasion in America. It was half past eleven
							when I left the Mansion House, and there was still such a crowd of
							People at the door, that it was with difficulty the Carriage could come
							up— When I went there had been a similar crowd— The Lord Mayor said they
							had been there from nine O’Clock in the morning— They shouted on the
							arrival of the Royal Dukes, and of the Duke of Wellington— I stopped a
							moment at Craven-Street, and got home, at half past one in the
							Morning.</p>

							walked to my Office— I had met at my own door as I left home, a poor

							to <persRef ref="carleton-guy">Lord Dorchester</persRef> then Governor

						<p><date>12. VI: </date>The <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince
								Regent’s</persRef> Birth-day. Sent by the Post the Note to <persRef
								ref="wellesleypole-katherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Wellesley-Pole</persRef>, and enclosed to <persRef ref="smith-john"
								>J. A. Smith</persRef> that to <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert"
								>Lord Castlereagh</persRef>. Wrote a short Letter to <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> received a Letter
							from <persRef ref="fusil-louise">Madame Fusil</persRef>, requesting to
							see her. The journal occupied me great part of the day. We dined at half
							past five, and at half past seven left home, and were at the <persRef
								ref="charlotte2">Queen’s</persRef> Palace, Buckingham House,
							precisely at nine. An accident had happened to the <persRef
								ref="louis-philippe">Duke of Orleans’s</persRef> Carriage at the
							front iron grate, so that the gate was shut, and we were obliged to go
							in at the side entry— Within half an hour, the Queen appeared, arm in
							arm with the Prince Regent— She went round the circle, and spoke a few
							words to each person. The Dukes of <persRef ref="edward">Kent</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="adolphus">Cambridge</persRef> were the only brothers
							of the Regent, there. The <persRef ref="frederickaugustus">Duke of
								York</persRef> was absent, I know not why. The <persRef ref="frederica">Duchess</persRef> was there. He
							had been at the dinner. The <persRef ref="william">Duke of
								Clarence</persRef> is yet confined by illness. <persRef
								ref="ernest-augustus">Cumberland</persRef> is at variance with the
							Queen, because she will not see <persRef ref="frederica-sophia">his
								wife</persRef>; and <persRef ref="augustusfrederick"
								>Sussex</persRef> at variance with the Regent for Politics and
							perhaps other causes. the Princesses <persRef ref="augustasophia"
								>Augusta</persRef> and <persRef ref="elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef>
							were there— <persRef ref="leopold2">Prince Leopold</persRef>, but not
							the <persRef ref="charlotte">Princess Charlotte</persRef>. The <persRef
								ref="williamfrederick;mary2;sophiamatilda">Duke and Duchess and
								Princess Sophia of Gloucester</persRef>— The <persRef
								ref="louis-philippe;marieamalie">Duke and Duchess of
								Orleans</persRef>. The <persRef ref="louisdukedebourbon">Duke of
								Bourbon</persRef>— The foreign Ambassadors and Ministers, and about
							two hundred of the nobility and gentry of the Country, of both sexes.
								<persRef ref="neumann-philipp">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Neumann</persRef> the Austrian Secretary of Embassy, asked me, if I
							had any answer to the proposal concerning the Ships at Trieste and
							Venice— I had none— He said he had an answer to my enquiries about
							muskets; that they could be obtained without difficulty; but it was
							thought best that it should be by the way of commerce. I asked if he
							could mention the price— He said he would let me know it, nearabouts in
							a few days— I enquired of <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count
								Lieven</persRef>, the Russian Ambassador, whether it was true, as
							was intimated in some of the Newspapers, that the new British Armament,
							under <persRef ref="pellew-edward">Lord Exmouth</persRef>, fitted out
							against the Barbary Powers, had been sent in consequence of the interest
							taken in the affair by the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor
								Alexander</persRef>, and by his influence— The Count asked me to
							call at his house at eleven O’Clock to-morrow Morning; which I promised.
							I mentioned to the <persRef ref="eustache-rene">Marquis d’Osmond the
								French Ambassador</persRef>, that I had received an answer from the
							United States, to an Application made at the request of his predecessor
							the <persRef ref="delachastre-claude">Duke de la Châtre</persRef>, to
							stop the transfer of certain Stocks, purchased here by a frenchman; a
							fraudulent cashier of a Commercial house, who had absconded with its
							funds. The Marquis asked me to write him a line about it.— I enquired of
								<persRef ref="chester-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chester</persRef>, the Assistant Master of the Ceremonies, and of
							the <persRef ref="freire-cipriano">Chevalier de Freire</persRef>, the
							Portuguese Minister, whether there was any settled principle of
							precedence at this Court, between Foreign Ministers of the second order,
							and persons of distinction natives of this Country— Chester equivocated,
							and evaded answering. He said that on occasions of etiquette, the
							Ambassadors and foreign Ministers were always considered as a Corps by
							themselves. A special place was assigned for them all together; and that
							was always, as near as possible to the king— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Freire had no more settled notion upon the subject— Chester
							ultimately admitted that there was no settled etiquette in the case.—
							The practice, as I have found it, is this. They give precedence to
							Ambassadors, next after the blood royal.— When there are several
							Ambassadors and Ministers of the second order, they put them together as
							a Corps; the Envoys then immediately succeed the Ambassadors, and thus
							precede the nobility— But when there are only Ministers of the second
							Order, all the Ministers of State, all the household Lords, and all the
							peers of the realm, take precedence of them, and have it assigned to
							them— The <persRef ref="wood-matthew">Lord Mayor</persRef> marked this
							at his dinner last week, by assigning to me the place next to <persRef
								ref="bligh-john">Lord Darnley</persRef>; and before his Son,
								<persRef ref="bligh-edward">Lord Clifton</persRef>, who is not a
							peer.— That is the principle—though by particular occasions and
							incidents, they sometimes place the foreign Ministers before Peers— They
							placed me so at the Fishmongers dinner— Probably because the Peers
							present, were considered as members of the Company, and at home. The
							general practice here is conformable to that in the other European
							Governments that I have known— In Russia, where all rank is graduated
							upon the Military scale our Ambassador ranks with a Field Marshal, and
							an Envoy or Minister Plenipotentiary with a lieutenant-General.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Wellesley Pole told me she had received
							my note, but did not know where Madam Fusil lived— The <persRef
								ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of Wellington</persRef> took leave of
								<persRef ref="wellesleypole-william;wellesleypole-katherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Pole</persRef>, just as I was speaking to them— He told me he should
							go to-morrow Morning for Paris— <persRef ref="munster-ernst">Count
								Munster</persRef> at my request introduced me to the Duke of
							Cambridge—who recollected that he had formerly known me at Berlin, in
							1801. He told me that he was happy that Peace between this Country and
							America was restored; and hoped the good understanding would continue—
								<persRef ref="addington-henry2">Viscount Sidmouth</persRef>
							earnestly recommended to me to see their dockyard at Portsmouth, which
							he said he had visited with much satisfaction last week; but when I <pb
								n="52" type="ms"/>hinted a doubt whether I could obtain admission he
							told me not very confidently that he thought there would be no
							difficulty— The <persRef ref="pery-edmund">Earl of Limerick</persRef> as
							usual conversed freely with me— This is an Irish nobleman who last
							Summer was created a Peer of the United Kingdom by the title of Lord
							Foxford— He has strong Irish and Republican propensities, which are
							overpowered by his honours and preferments and other courtly shackles—
							He told me that <persRef ref="pery-edmund2">his uncle</persRef> had been
							Speaker of the Irish House of Commons in 1783. when they made the great
							stand for the Independence of Ireland— That he himself had been a very
							turbulent fellow formerly— But that now they treated him so well, that
							he was quiet and well satisfied— He said that if America had been
							treated so she might have been kept forever; but there never was a
							Country so foolishly thrown away as she had been— <persRef
								ref="greville-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Greville</persRef> spoke to me of the new Packet that sails between
							Milford-Haven and Waterford, and his wife the <persRef
								ref="greville-louisa">Countess of Mansfield</persRef>, told me about
							her brother Lord Cathcart, the Ambassador in Russia—what an
							extraordinary favourite he was of the Emperor’s—who had dined with him
							at his house—an honour which he had never done to any other Ambassador;
							and who occasionally paid him Evening visits, as <persRef
								ref="cathcart-william">Lord Cathcart</persRef> lives in a very
							domestic manner with his family. These scraps of conversation and others
							more insignificant consumed the Evening— The Queen after going round the
							circle retired to her Card party; and most of the company to the Japan
							chamber, where refreshments were served. About twelve we came away, and
							after waiting full half an hour at the side-entry, found the Carriage at
							the front door— Home at two in the Morning.</p>

						<p><date>13. VII: </date>Breakfasted at nine; and immediately afterwards
							went into London, to <persRef ref="lieven-christopher">Count
								Lieven’s</persRef>—dismissed the Carriage with orders to come for me
							to Craven-Street at five, and sent <persRef ref="william5">William</persRef> the footman with a Note to
								<persRef ref="fusil-louise">Madame Fusil</persRef>, proposing to see
							her at my office at three— Count Lieven, referring to the questions that
							I had put to him last Evening, told me that since the General Peace the
								<persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> had been desirous of
							promoting and protecting the commerce of his Subjects— That finding it
							was much annoyed by the Barbary States, particularly the Commerce of the
							Black Sea, which was of the utmost importance to Russia, he had found it
							necessary to consider of measures to be taken— The commerce of several
							other Nations was annoyed in like manner. Not only the Italian States,
							but Spain and the Netherlands were in a state of hostility with them.
							Various propositions had been made by those Powers—the Netherlands were
							desirous of concerted operations—Spain had gone so far as to propose
							that a joint naval armament should be fitted out to act against the
							Barbary States; the command of which should devolve upon the Power which
							should furnish the greatest contingent of force— Without acceding
							exactly to this the Emperor Alexander had been sensible of the
							inconvenience of partial operations and negotiations which by making
							Peace for one or two Nations would immediately have the effect of
							producing hostilities against others. Before he took any decisive
							measures, the Emperor had thought it expedient to consult with
							Great-Britain, and to enquire what were the views, the maniere de voir
							of this Government on the subject— In the first instance and before the
							late outrages which have occurred in the Mediterranean, they answered
							that as to the general sentiment of dissatisfaction at the Barbarian
							mode of warfare, their practice of making Slaves of their prisoners, and
							their cruelties to them, the British Government perfectly concurred in
							the Sentiments of the other European States, and of the Emperor in
							particular. That they were disposed to assist their allies in the
							endeavours to restore Peace to them; but that having themselves no cause
							of complaint against the Barbary Powers, they did not think it would be
							justifiable to join in any general confederacy against them, such as was
							proposed—but considered that it would be best for each European Nation
							to Negotiate for itself and provide for its own security. This was the
							substance of the first Answer— The Count said he had yet received no
							reply from his own Court to that Communication, and did not know how it
							had been received.— Since then however the new hostilities of the
							Algerines and Tunisians had been committed; upon which the new
							expedition under <persRef ref="pellew-edward">Lord Exmouth</persRef> has
							been fitted out, and in which he trusted that the general interests and
							objects of the European Nations in relation to the Barbarians would be
							duly pursued, as he was assured they should be— I told the Count I was
							happy to find that this was his impression, and sincerely hoped his
							anticipation would be realized— But I must say in the utmost confidence
							to him, that I had strong misgivings that the result would be quite
							different.— I referred to the proceedings under Lord Exmouth’s former
							expedition— To his instructions, to protest against the Algerine Treaty
							with America— To the heavy ransom paid and promised for the Sardinian
							and Neapolitan Prisoners—to the future contributions stipulated; to the
							moral lecture which the Admiral was to give the Barbarians against
							making Slaves, and exacting ransom, while with the other he was paying
							the ransoms as high as ever; and finally to the result which was that
							the next Morning after signing his Treaties with Lord Exmouth, <persRef
								ref="agha-omar">the Dey</persRef> had annulled his Treaty with the
							United States; and from all the proceedings of that time; from the
							manner in which <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef> had talked to me; from the language he had
							held in Parliament, Upon <persRef ref="brougham-henry2"
								>Brougham’s</persRef> motion relating to this affair, and
							particularly from an Article <pb n="53" type="ms"/>concerning the
							Barbary States, in the Quarterly Review, just published, I inferred that
							Lord Exmouth’s might lead to a shewy atonement from the Barbarians, for
							the late particular outrages and insults to the British, but would do
							nothing for the general European Cause, or for that of humanity. I told
							the Count I supposed he knew the Quarterly Review, was a mere
							ministerial pamphlet— He said certainly— He had not yet looked into the
							number just published— But he had got it, and was going to take it with
							him into the Country to read. As to the general policy and inclination
							of this Government, he perfectly agreed in sentiment with me— That so
							far from being friendly to the Navigation of other Nations in the
							Mediterranean, they would prefer to have it continue subject to the
							depredations of those Pirates; but the prospect of a concerted armament
							by the other Powers, which might proceed to act without them, had also
							its inconveniences— They had been very far from giving satisfaction to
							their allies of Naples and Sardinia for the bargains they had lately
							made for them. They had received heavy reproaches instead of thanks for
							them. He thought therefore that they had now taken the quarrel into
							their own hands, to prevent a confederacy of the other powers, which
							might have accomplished the object without their assistance; and he
							expected they would do something of importance for the general interest—
							This was the substance of an hour’s Conversation with the Count, after
							which I left him, and called at <persRef ref="west-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> West</persRef>, the Painter’s; but he
							was not at home. This is the third time that I have missed of seeing
							him— I stopped at the Engraver <persRef ref="silvester-richard"
								>Silvester’s</persRef> in the Strand to enquire if my seal was
							finished— His Shopman said it would be ready in about another week. He
							shewed me an impression of it, as far as it is yet finished— Called at
								<persRef ref="u">Williams</persRef> the Stationers, and took the
							Quarterly Review N. 29— Then went to Craven-Street. There I found a
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Savage</persRef> who
							came for a Passport. <persRef ref="joy-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> G. Joy</persRef> came in soon afterwards, and kept up a
							conversation of an hour. While he was with me, Madame Fusil came— She
							said she intended to go to the United States next Spring, and had
							requested of <persRef ref="wellesleypole-katherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Wellesley</persRef> Pole an
							introduction to me, in order to obtain Letters of Recommendation, or
							perhaps facilities in procuring her passage to America— M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Pole had written me that she was going
							out with the company of French Players, who have been performing at the
							Argyle Rooms, but she said she was only going herself with <persRef
								ref="wellesleypole-william">her husband</persRef> and her own
							family. For the present the Company were not going with her. They did
							not expect that they could support a French theatre in the United
							States— But she had resided several years in Russia; until she was
							obliged to leave Moscow, with the French armies in 1812. She had
							afterwards seen <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> at <persRef ref="dolorukay-elena"
								>Princess Dolgorouki’s</persRef> at S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
							Petersburg— Since then she had been in this Country, teaching Music,
							among the Nobility, and to please them, the Plays at the Argyle Rooms
							had been performed. It was rather a Societé d’Amateurs than a regular
							theatre, and it had been of little or no profit to the performers— Her
							object in going to America, would be to teach Music, and perhaps
								French—<persRef ref="fusil-claude">her husband’s</persRef> the same—
							And when they should be there; if they should find a prospect of
							encouragement for a French Theatre they might take up that plan— She had
							brought with her a Letter from herself to <persRef ref="regnault-michel"
								>Count Regnault de Saint Jean d’Angely</persRef>, which not knowing
							where he was, she requested me to have forwarded, as I promised her it
							should be. She told me that <persRef ref="benard-abraham"
								>Fleury</persRef> the actor at the French theatre was a relation of
							hers— Soon after she went away <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Snow</persRef> came in, and kept me there till six. He
							lent me <persRef ref="turreau-louis">General Turreau’s</persRef>
							pamphlet upon the political situation of the United States— These
							visitors at the Office absorbed my time so that I could not open half
							the despatches and Letters which I found there. <persRef
								ref="mason-john6">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mason</persRef> of
							New-York had been there and left his card. He has just arrived from the
							United States; was passenger in the same Vessel with <persRef
								ref="parish-david2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> David
								Parish</persRef> whom he left at Southampton. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Parish forwarded by him the dispatches
							which he had received in America for me, enclosed with a letter,
							informing me that he is going to spend a week with <persRef ref="u">his
								father</persRef> at Bath, and that he will call upon me when he
							comes to London. There was a despatch from the <persRef
								ref="monroe-james">Secretary of State</persRef>, dated 8. July, with
							copies of two Letters from <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Lewis
								Cass</persRef> Governor of the Michigan Territory and six Affidavits
							concerning American vessels, boarded by British naval Officers on Lake
							Erie. I read the despatch, and postponed the enclosures— Duplicate of a
							despatch of 13. June from the <persRef ref="dallas-alexander">Secretary
								of the Treasury</persRef>— A Letter from <persRef
								ref="scott-winfield">General W. Scott</persRef>, dated 14. July at
							New-York, enclosing a receipt from <persRef ref="ludlow-gulian">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gulian Ludlow</persRef>, of a Letter
							from me to him of which Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Scott had
							taken charge, when he went from this Country— A cover from the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">President of the United States M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison</persRef>, enclosing a Letter
							for <persRef ref="sinclair-john">Sir John Sinclair</persRef>, with a
							request that I would have it delivered. A packet with a file of National
							Intelligencer’s from 29. June to 8. July which <persRef ref="smith-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> had opened— He
							had also received the first twelve Numbers of <persRef
								ref="cobbett-william">Cobbett’s</persRef> New-York Register which I
							had requested him to procure— I took them all, together with the first
							number of the Colonial Journal which <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Page</persRef> had left at the Office
							for my perusal;—the Letter to Sir John Sinclair was directed to
							Sackville Street. I found on consulting the Court Guide that the Board
							of Agriculture was at N. 32. in that Street, and on calling there, found
							him, and <pb n="54" type="ms"/>delivered the Letter to him— I had been
							acquainted with Sir John Sinclair in the Winter of 1795 and Spring of
							1796, and had not seen him since. He was then in the prime of Life— He
							is now in its decline; little short of seventy. He told me that he now
							resided in the Country, at Ham, and was now only accidentally in town—
							That he had sent to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Madison a copy of the
							fac-simile of <persRef ref="washington-george">General
								Washington’s</persRef> Letters to him and this was his answer.— He
							also shewed me a copy of a Letter which he had very lately received from
							a Correspondent in America, and which gave a very favourable, and indeed
							highly flattered picture of the present State of that Country. Sir John
							shewed me the Hall where the Board of Agriculture meet, hung round with
							portraits of Cattle of the different breeds, and the printed reports of
							the Agriculture of the several Counties in Great-Britain. He also gave
							me a copy of a printed paper, published by him about a Month since, on
							Circulation and Coin, and the means of arresting the Progress of the
							Public Calamities. Its object appears to be prove the superior
							excellence of Paper Circulation over Gold and Silver— The necessity of
							Public Loans by Government to the Commercial and Agricultural Interests;
							and that Silver rather than Gold should be the standard of the Coins— On
							my way home I read the first Number of Cobbett’s Register published at
							New-York— An Introductory Address to the People of the United States— It
							was past seven O’Clock when I got home; and more than half an hour
							later, when <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef> returned from their fishing
							party— After dinner, I opened the remaining packets and Letters, which I
							had brought with me from London without breaking the Seals.— There was a
							second Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> David Parish, which
							had come by the Post—dated Yesterday at Weymouth, and enclosing a Letter
							which he had overlooked, when he gave the others to his fellow-passenger
								D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Mason. The letter was from <persRef
								ref="thornton-william">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								Thornton</persRef> at Washington, and covered one from <persRef
								ref="gual-pedro">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gual</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="delreal-jose">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> del
								Real</persRef>— A Letter from President Madison, in answer to two
							which I had written to him, in September and December last year, and
							covering two others which he recommends to my care— One for <persRef
								ref="eustis-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eustis</persRef>
							at the Hague, and the other to <persRef ref="bentham-jeremy">Jeremy
								Bentham</persRef> in London. The two large Packets were merely
							enclosures to me— Covers to sealed Packets directed to G. Joy; with
							which there was a letter to me, from <persRef ref="gales-joseph"
								>Gales</persRef> and <persRef ref="seaton-william">Seaton</persRef>,
							Editors of the National Intelligencer, mentioning that they sent the
							Papers in the Packets as joint property between Joy and me. I found also
							at the Office several Cards of persons who had been to pay me visits—
								<persRef ref="beckwith-george">Sir George Beckwith</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="clymer-george">G. Clymer</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="slidell-j">J. Slidell</persRef>, <persRef ref="montgomery-jc"
								>J. C. Montgomery</persRef>. <persRef ref="connell-john3">J.
									Connell</persRef>. <persRef ref="amory-jonathan">J. Amory</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="rotch-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rotch</persRef>— Received there a Card of invitation from the
								<persRef ref="wood-matthew">Lord Mayor</persRef> &amp; <persRef
								ref="wood-maria">Lady Mayoress</persRef> to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Adams and myself, on Board the Lord Mayor’s Barge on
							Thursday the 22<hi rend="superscript">d:</hi> instant at Westminster
							Bridge at eleven O’Clock precisely to proceed to Richmond and dine on
							Board the Navigation Barge at 4 precisely.— Carriages to be ordered in
							the Evening at Kew Bridge at 8 O’Clock— An immediate answer was
							requested, and written and sent by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith—
							The objects of attention this day have been so multitudinous, that the
							recollection of all of them loses much of its distinctness— Important
							business dissipation, Visits, variety of Conversation, Letters,
							dispatches, Newspapers, Pamphlets, Books, and invitation Cards are all
							so blended together in the Memory, that the impressions wear out one
							another and all are faded and confused— Such days frequently occur to
							me; particularly when I go to London, and they give me a strong sympathy
							with what appears to be the ordinary state of Lord Castlereagh’s mind—
							He appears to me scarcely ever to have a distinct remembrance of any
							thing.</p>

						<p><date>14. VI:15. </date>The Spanish Ambassador, <persRef

							which at my request he had sent in, relative to the Case of the William
							and Mary, now depending in the Admiralty Court; and that <persRef
								ref="u">Curtoys</persRef> was making out a copy of it to send me.
							This morning I received a Note from Fernan-Nuñez, enclosing the copy.
							Castlereagh in very courteous terms recommends that if there are any
							circumstances which make an immediate decision of the Cause necessary,
							the Parties should be advised to suggest them to the Court; and if not,
							that the Cause will be taken up in its turn— I expected some such answer
							as this, and remark in it principally the politeness and complacency of
							the manner, which is in a Style very different, when addressed to the
							Spanish Ambassador, from what it is in similar cases when addressed to
							me.— Nearly the whole of this day was absorbed in reading over again the
							Letters from America, and in turning over the Newspapers— Foul weather
							still continued— I walked to Ealing and Brentford.</p>

						<p><date>21. VII: </date>My proposed occupation for the day was disconcerted
							by a Note from <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef>; brought me by the second Post, requesting me
							to call upon him this day at the Foreign Office at four O’Clock. I went
							immediately into London, left the Curricle at Hyde-Park corner, with
							orders to the Coachman to come for me to the foreign Office at a quarter
							past four O’Clock, and walked first to my Office where I stopped a few
							minutes, and then went to Downing Street, where I was soon admitted to
							Lord Castlereagh.— The preliminaries to his Conversations usually turn
							upon the weather. He said that he hoped we should now have a Month or
							six weeks of fine weather, and if so, from the accounts he had from the
							different parts of the Country, there would be a fine harvest. This
							observation struck me the more remarkably, as all the appearances of the
							harvest in our neighbourhood are unfavourable, as there have been now
							for a full Month, public Prayers in the Churches for a change of
							weather, and as the average price of flour and wheat throughout England
							and Wales has been gradually rising, at the moment when the
							harvest-season is arrived— Lord Castlereagh proceeded to tell me, that
							he had requested to see me, relative to the subjects of our Conversation
							of the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July— The proposal on the
							part of the United States to enter upon the negotiation of a new Treaty
							of Commerce, had been considered by this Government— As to a general
							Treaty of Commerce they did not think it advisable, particularly, as
							there was a commercial Convention already existing. With regard to the
							intercourse between the United States, and the British Colonies in the
							West-Indies, Great Britain declined entering into any Stipulation. She
							thought herself competent to furnish them all the supplies that they
							needed; and concluded to adhere to the antient Colonial System— He did
							not know whether it was a wise system—much had been said for and against
							it— But as it had been so long established it was thought best not to
							depart from it. Besides other Considerations, an objection against any
							new Stipulation would be to affect the Treaties with other Powers,
							entitled to claim the privileges of the most favoured Nation— It had
							been mentioned by me as an argument in favour of a new Article, that by
							the exclusion of American Vessels from the British West-India Islands,
							the object of the existing Convention, of placing the ships of the two
							Nations upon an equal footing in the direct intercourse between the
							British Dominions in Europe, and the United States was defeated; as the
							British Vessels, by circuitous Voyages first from Europe to the United
							States—thence to the West Indies, and thence back to Europe, had a great
							advantage even for the first part of the Voyage, over American Vessels,
							confined as they were to the freights obtainable for the direct Voyages
							to and from Europe. This disadvantage it would however be in the power
							of the United States to remove, by regulations of their own; either by
							prohibiting the intercourse between the United States and the British
							West-India Islands, in British vessels, or by charging it with
							additional duties— This Government were aware that the United States had
							the whole subject at their discretion, and would feel no dissatisfaction
							at any measure they might adopt; trusting that the measures would be
							adapted only to the object of counteraction, and without resentment— I
							said the natural reciprocal and corresponding measure would be a
							prohibition; probably that would be adopted— Lord Castlereagh intimated
							that additional duties would be more acceptable, but again acknowledged
							that the whole ground would be at our disposal— As to the intercourse by
							land, between the United States and the British Colonies in
							North-America, he said there had been proposals made and discussed, at
							the negotiation of the commercial Convention. It had not then been found
							practicable to agree upon that article, but the British Government was
							willing to receive, any proposition upon the subject, and to make an
							arrangement concerning it— He said the same in relation to Seamen; but
							as it seemed to be agreed that the policy of both Governments, should be
							to encourage its own native Seamen, Great-Britain would be willing to
							wait the favourable effects of that policy. Concerning the points of
							collision between neutral and belligerent pretensions and maritime
							rights in time of War, Great-Britain was desirous of not touching upon
							them at present, and particularly of not undertaking a Negotiation,
							without a prospect of bringing it to a successful result.— It was better
							to leave things as they were, and give time for prepossessions and
							prejudices on both parts to subside, than to encourage expectations by a
							formal negotiation of a Treaty, which might terminate in disappointment—
							I said then that I understood him as giving me the determination of the
							British Government as declining any Negotiation relative to the
							intercourse between the United States, and the British West-India
							Islands, or relative to the objects of blockade, Contraband of War, and
							the other points connected with maritime neutrality, which are usually
							included in the adjustment of commercial Treaties; but as being willing
							to receive proposals, in relation to Seamen, and to the intercourse by
							Land, between the United States, and the British Colonies in
							North-America— He assented to this— I told him that I knew the measures
							which the American Government would find <pb n="58" type="ms"/>itself
							compelled to adopt, would be taken with great reluctance. That the
							renewal of the Colonial exclusions in all their rigour since the
							conclusion of the Convention, and the effect of those measures upon the
							operation of the Convention itself, had already occasioned much
							uneasiness among the merchants in our Cities, and occasioned a loud call
							for counteracting restrictions. The Government had preferred to make the
							attempt to settle the business by an amicable arrangement, knowing that
							restrictive measures have always the tendency to excite irritation, and
							anxious in the highest degree to avert by every possible effort, every
							thing that can even tend to impair the harmony, or add to those
							prepossessions and prejudices to which he had alluded. The same
							principle had prompted the renewed proposals to treat upon the most
							interesting points of maritime neutral Commerce— The experience of the
							evils produced by the want of stipulations upon those points, and the
							earnest desire to guard against their recurrence were the motives which
							induced them again and again to urge these subjects to the attention of
							the British Cabinet— My instructions to this effect were so earnest that
							my Government would expect me to receive the ultimate decision of this
							Government in writing. I should therefore shortly address a Note to him,
							with a formal re-statement of the proposals, and to which I should
							solicit at his convenience an answer.— He said there would be no
							objection to that so far as related to the Seamen and the West-India
							trade, but he wished me to consider whether it would be advisable to say
							any thing relative to the neutral and belligerent questions, by
							proposing a Negotiation without a Prospect of bringing it to a
							successful termination— I told him, I should seriously consider of this
							observation before sending in the Note— I then mentioned the Instruction
							that I had received respecting the improper conduct of a British Naval
							Officer, in boarding several American Merchant Vessels upon Lake Erie,
							and told him I should send him copies of the Papers— He said he wished
							me in the Note to express the fullest conviction that this Government
							will disapprove of every such proceeding on the part of their Officers,
							and take every proper measure to suppress them— I replied that this was
							the light in which the affair was viewed in my Instructions. The
							American Government was fully perswaded that the conduct of the Officer
							would be disavowed— But Lord Castlereagh professed not to have heard of
							this transaction before, which I can scarcely believe; for it has been
							in the Newspapers here; and an Advertisement from the Admiralty for
							Transports to carry 5200 tons of Ordinance Stores to Canada, happening
							to be published about the same time, gave an alarm of War, and
							occasioned a depression of the funds, of at least one per Cent. I also
							spoke to him of the several Notes that I have lately sent him— He said
							he had just received that relating to the American Seamen, whom the
								<persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas">Consul</persRef> wishes to send
							home— That there would be no difficulty in giving the order authorizing
							the vessel to take more than the limited number of one person to every
							five Tons. Because this case stood upon a foundation altogether
							different from that of vessels taking ordinary passengers. Concerning
							the extra-duty of five per Cent, on Merchandize sold at Auction, he sent
							for <persRef ref="planta-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Planta</persRef>, who came and said that the order from the Treasury
							to remove the duty, had been dispatched this day. Upon the case of the
							ship Independence at Glasgow I observed that some of the parties
							interested were apprehensive that notwithstanding Lord Castlereagh’s
							recommendation there would be some difficulty in obtaining the order at
							the Treasury— He said it might perhaps depend upon the state of
							preparation of the vessel, before the new Act of Parliament was known—
							If the preparations had been all made, and the expence incurred, he
							thought the order would be granted, but if it was merely a speculation
							of the shippers, that might raise a difficulty. It might all depend upon
							the strength of the case that the shippers should make out. I said that
							from their representation to me, a stronger case could not be made out;
							for the shippers had no knowledge of the new restriction, until they
							applied to clear out the vessel; and the Act of Parliament had been
							received at the Custom house only the day before. He said then perhaps
							the Lords of the Treasury had referred it to some of their own Officers,
							for a report of the facts, and that had occasioned the delay— My note
							respecting the damaged provisions said to have been furnished to the
							American Prisoners of War at Dartmoor, had been referred to the Lords of
							the Admiralty.— Lord Castlereagh then adverted to the expedition against
							the Algerines, and gave me to read a Copy of the last Instructions to
								<persRef ref="pellew-edward">Lord Exmouth</persRef>— They were dated
							the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July, the very day that I had a
							long interview with Lord Castlereagh, and in which much was said upon
							this same Subject. These Instructions recite that the <persRef
								ref="agha-omar">Dey of Algiers</persRef> by his insults and outrages
							since the Treaties concluded by Lord Exmouth with him, had placed
							himself in a state of war with Great-Britain— Lord Exmouth is therefore
							directed to go with his Squadron to Algiers. on his arrival there he is
							to offer Peace to the Dey, upon three Conditions. 1. That he shall sign
							a declaration like those already obtained from the Bey of Tunis and the
							Bashaw of Tripoli—namely, to renounce for ever the practice of reducing
							Prisoners of War, taken from Christian Nations to Slavery, and promising
							to exchange prisoners, according to the practice of Christian Nations.
							2. To liberate without ransom, all the Christian Slaves now in the Dey’s
							possession; and to place them in the first instance at Lord Exmouth’s
							disposal, by sending them on board his fleet. 3. To repay the whole sum
							of money paid by Lord Exmouth for the ransom of Sardinians and
							Neapolitans last April— No modification of either of these Conditions is
							to be admitted— If either of them is refused by the Dey, Lord Exmouth is
							to commence immediate hostilities against the Algerine fleet, and to use
							all the means in his power to effect its destruction— If the Dey
							complies with the three Conditions, Lord Exmouth is to conclude a Peace
							with him, but is to admit no <pb n="59" type="ms"/>stipulation, for the
							payment hereafter of any consular present whatever— I observed that the
							instructions did not contemplate in case the Dey should refuse the
							Conditions, an attack upon Algiers itself. Lord Castlereagh said if the
							state of War should ensue, hostilities would then be directed against
							any point where they might be found vulnerable. He said he had been
							particularly desirous, and had quite made a point of it to avoid making
							a demand that the fleet should be delivered up; because other Nations
							were already sufficiently jealous of the British naval Power, and ready
							to suspect this Government of the wish to annihilate the naval force of
							others, and if they had insisted upon having the Algerine fleet, it
							would have given countenance to such surmizes. They had in the first
							instance, declined entering into any combination of European Powers
							against the Barbary States, because they had no particular cause of
							complaint against them— But as the Dey of Algiers by his subsequent
							conduct had chosen to place himself in a state of hostility to
							Great-Britain, she was now released from the obligation of her Treaties
							with him, and free to espouse the general Cause of Europe against him—
							She had therefore determined to prescribe those conditions that I had
							read as the terms upon which alone she would listen to the renewal of
							Peace, and when those were settled, she would willingly co-operate with
							the other Nations interested in maintaining the observance of the
							principles of civilized Nations, by the Barbary powers in future; by
							supplying her proportion of a force commensurate with that object. But
							it was her intention, to combine this purpose with that of completing
							the abolition of the African Slave-trade, and to obtain the assent of
							the Nations which will contribute to the joint armament to put down for
							ever the Barbary piracies, to allow the same joint application of power
							to arrest every ship, pursuing the traffic in black Slaves— I told him
							this appeared to me perfectly fair. The instructions to Lord Exmouth
							were such as must give satisfaction to every Power, annoyed by the
							Barbarian piracies, and if Spain and Portugal were so anxious for the
							abolition of one Slavery, it could not consistently be refused by them,
							to lend a hand for the abandonment of another. As to the United States,
							they, as well as Great-Britain had totally prohibited the Slave trade by
							their own Citizens, and could have no objection to measures which may
							serve to put down these odious practices the one by the other— When I
							left Lord Castlereagh it was a quarter before five; I came immediately
							home, and found part of our company already here. The party who dined
							with us were, <persRef ref="bruen-matthias">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bruen</persRef>, who had brought me a Letter of

							from table, and the company were all gone, before eleven— While I was in
							town, this day I went into S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> James’s Park,
							and took a view of what is called the Regent’s Bomb, a huge mortar, used
							by the French at the Siege of Cadix; abandoned by them when the Siege
							was raised—presented by the Cortes, to the <persRef ref="george-iv"

							immortalizing the <persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of
								Wellington</persRef>, the Prince Regent, and the <persRef
								ref="phipps-henry">Earl of Mulgrave</persRef>, Master General of the
							Ordnance— It was uncovered to public view, first on the Prince’s
							birth-day, and immediately caricatured, under the title of the Regent’s
							Bomb uncovered— The People are constantly crowding to see it; but it is
							surrounded by a Palissade to keep them off, and two Soldiers are
							stationed there as Centinels, to guard it from being defaced. They are
							surly as Bull-dogs and allow no person to touch even the Palissade.</p>

						<p><date>22. VI: </date>At eleven O’Clock this Morning I was with <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> at Westminster Bridge
							where we embarked in the <persRef ref="wood-matthew">Lord
								Mayor’s</persRef> Barge, but it was near twelve when he came himself
							with the <persRef ref="wood-maria">Lady Mayoress</persRef> and his
							family. There was a company of about one hundred persons, among whom
							were <persRef ref="erskine-david">Lord Erskine</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="craven-elizabeth">her Highness the Margravine of
								Anspach</persRef>, <persRef ref="forbes-elizabeth">Lady Elizabeth
								Forbes</persRef>, the Sheriffs, <persRef ref="bell-thomas">Sir
								Thomas Bell</persRef> and <persRef ref="thorp-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Thorpe</persRef>, several of the
							Aldermen and their families, with other city Officers and Strangers, and
							a musical party, <persRef ref="smart-george">Sir George Smart</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="lacy-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lacy</persRef>, <persRef ref="lacy-jane">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Bianca Lacy</persRef>, <persRef

								Billington</persRef>, <persRef ref="salmon-eliza">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Salmon</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="u">Miss Goodall</persRef>, and some others. The
							Barge was elegantly ornamented with Streamers, and the <persRef
								ref="edward">Duke of Kent’s</persRef> Band of Music were on board.
							We started from Westminster Bridge just at Noon, and were rowed down the
							Thames to Richmond, passing through the Vauxhall, Battersea, Putney, Kew
							and Richmond Bridges— The weather was fine, and the barge was surrounded
							all the way down by a number perhaps twenty boats filled with company
							Ladies and Gentlemen, as witnesses of the Scene. We passed by Chelsea
							Hospital, Craven House, which is the Margravine’s Villa, and some other
							Country Seats, as well as several Villages on both sides of the river.
							But the prospects are not on the whole equal to my expectations— The
							Country on both sides is very low, and not remarkably picturesque. The
								<pb n="60" type="ms"/><persRef ref="augustusfrederick">Duke of
								Sussex</persRef> and <persRef ref="hill-arthur">Lord Arthur
								Hill</persRef> came on board at Kew-Bridge. At Richmond we found the
							new, or Navigation-Barge, called the Maria Wood, in honour of the
							present Lady Mayoress. It is much larger than that in which we had come
							from Westminster-Bridge, and the whole company passed from the one to
							the other— Just then the <persRef ref="adolphus">Duke of
								Cambridge</persRef> was seen, walking with <persRef
								ref="haggerston-carnaby">Sir Carnaby</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="haggerston-frances">Lady Haggerston</persRef>, and the Lord
							Mayor, accompanied by the Duke of Sussex went on shore, and invited them
							to come on board— They came accordingly, but could not stay to the
							dinner. The Navigation Barge was towed up the river to Twickenham as far
							as the Lord Mayor’s Villa, passing by <persRef ref="pope-alexander"
								>Pope’s</persRef> House and Grotto which now belong to <persRef
								ref="ellis-henry">Lord Mendip</persRef>, and several other Country
							Seats. We returned and anchored about five O’Clock near Richmond Bridge,
							when the whole company sat down to an elegant cold dinner. The Carriages
							were ordered to be at Kew Bridge, at eight o’Clock, but it was nine
							before we left the table, and ten by the time we got back to Kew Bridge.
							The usual toasts were drank, and the usual Speeches made after dinner,
							by the Lord Mayor, the Duke of Sussex, Lord Erskine, the Sheriffs, the
							Aldermen, and Lord Arthur Hill, and myself— The Duke of Sussex, as he
							always does, put Politics into his speeches— Lord Erskine was more shy,
							although the Lord Mayor in toasting him, alluded to his inactivity of
							late years, and hoped he would soon come forward again— The Duke of
							Sussex is ambitious enough to come forward, and told us that he was to
							move for the repeal of the alien act at the next Session of Parliament—
							He also declared himself against the new political doctrine of
							legitimacy, but Lord Erskine took care to declare himself in its favour.
							This party consisted for the most part of whigs, and they were very much
							perplexed at the result of a Meeting of the City of London yesterday, in
							Common Hall— It was a Meeting called to deliberate upon the distressed
							state of the Country. A number of violent Resolutions were passed
							unanimously, at a very numerous meeting, and a petition to the <persRef
								ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef> was voted, to be presented
							to him seated on the throne, which it is known he will refuse; at this
							meeting there were only three Speakers, all on one side, that of the
							Reformers, and equally inveterate against the Ministers and the leading
							whigs. Neither a whig nor a Tory ventured to open his lips at this
							meeting, yet the Resolutions and the Petition were voted unanimously at
							a meeting of two thousand persons— The Lord Mayor mentioned it with
							surprize, to Alderman <persRef ref="smith-christopher">Christopher
								Smith</persRef>, who it seems is to be Lord Mayor the next year, and
							who is a staunch Ministerial man— All the resolutions unanimous! said
							the Lord Mayor— And some of them, very strong— Aye, said Smith, and if
							they had put it to vote to hang the Lord Mayor, they would have passed
							that unanimously too!— No—not this year—perhaps they might the
							next—replied the Lord Mayor, much to the diversion of the Company who
							enjoyed a hearty laugh, at the expence of Alderman Smith. <persRef
								ref="perry-james">Perry</persRef>, the Editor of the Morning
							Chronicle, was of the party this day, and invited me to dine with him
							next Saturday, in company with the Duke of Sussex and <persRef
								ref="wilson-robert3">Sir Robert Wilson</persRef>. Perry is a whig;
							and not satisfied at-all with the proceedings of the city meeting
							yesterday.— There was an Article in the Morning Chronicle, asserting
							that notwithstanding the lateness of the Season there would be this year
							an uncommon fine harvest— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hunt</persRef>, one of the Speakers in the City
							yesterday, contradicted this statement upon his honour as a Gentleman,
							and censured the Morning Chronicle as attempting to impose upon the
							People, by it— Perry still insists that according to his information
							from all parts of the Country, the harvest will be excellent if they
							have yet good weather— <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef> told me the same thing yesterday. <persRef
								ref="cobbett-william">Cobbett</persRef> proclaimed three weeks ago
							that the harvest would be bad. Hunt yesterday pledged his honour that it
							would be— It is strange that such a thing should be made a party
							question, but so it is. Lord Erskine told me this day that he still
							intended to pay a visit to the United States; I observed to him that it
							would be best to fix a time, to carry his project into execution— He
							said he thought he should go the Summer after next. He was much
							gratified with receiving from <persRef ref="romayne-nicholas">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Roymayne</persRef> at New-York by
								<persRef ref="mason-john6">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mason</persRef>, a copy of his Speeches, reprinted at New-York, from
							an Edition published here by <persRef ref="ridgway-james">Ridgway</persRef>— The Margravine of Anspach was once
							a Lady Elizabeth Berkley, sister to the late <persRef
								ref="berkeley-frederick">Earl of Berkley</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="berkeley-george2">Admiral</persRef>. She married first a
								<persRef ref="craven-william">Lord Craven</persRef>, and as Lady
							Craven, published her travels in the Crimea. Her second marriage was
							with the <persRef ref="christianfriedrich">Margrave of
							Anspach</persRef>, of whom she is now the widow— She is nearly seventy,
							and very tenacious of her title of Highness. She has been heretofore a
							very distinguished person in fashionable life, but is now so forgotten
							that she puts up with a Lord Mayor’s and City party. Lady Elizabeth
							Forbes who accompanied her, is her niece. The Margravine was toasted
							after dinner but made no speech. There were some Country dances before
							and after dinner, but the most delightful part of the entertainment was
							the songs and glees sung by the musical guests; which were without
							accompaniment of instruments, but in the very highest Style of
							excellence. The Duke of Sussex sung a glee Rosy Bacchus, God of
							Wine—tolerably well. When his Health was given the singing party gave
							the cheer of three times three hurra’s in musical intonation, which was
							called for again and repeated.— As the Night came on the surrounding
							boats drew up closer to the barge which was thus surrounded by genteel
							people looking in upon the company, and participating in the pleasures
							of the Music. A <persRef ref="newman-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Henry Newman</persRef>, holding some office in the City,
							introduced himself to me, as having been invariably a friend to
							America.— It was very dark when we landed, in a Boat from the Barge at
							Kew Bridge. We found our Carriage there, and <pb n="61" type="ms"/>were
							at home shortly after ten. I found a Note from Lord Castlereagh—an
							answer upon the case of <persRef ref="shapleigh-reuben">R.
								Shapley’s</persRef> Vessel, refers him for a remedy to the admiralty
							Court— A Letter from <persRef ref="erving-george">G. W. Erving</persRef>
							at Madrid: waiting for the <persRef ref="ferdinand-vii">king of
								Spain</persRef>— From <persRef ref="dickason-thomas2">T.
								Dickason</persRef>, asking again for the <persRef
								ref="delosrios-carlos">Spanish Ambassador’s</persRef> interposition
							in the case of the William and Mary— From the <persRef
								ref="glennie-alexander">Glennie’s</persRef>, complaining that they
							can get no answer from the Treasury, on the case of the Ship
							Independence at Glasgow; and asking for my assistance in another case,
							that of the Ship Lion and Cargo, belonging to <persRef
								ref="hollinsandmcblair">Hollins and M’Blair</persRef>, and to
								<persRef ref="stiles-george">George Stiles</persRef> of Baltimore—
							From <persRef ref="dechateauneuf-agricol">A. H. de
							Chateauneuf</persRef>, with several copies of Prospectuses for two
							works. One a History of <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon"
								>Buonaparte</persRef>, and the other the Chronique de l’Europe, a
							periodical journal; both to be published in numbers, twice a Month. He
							solicits my subscription— I forgot to mention that among the company at
							the Lord Mayor’s party this day was <persRef ref="reeves-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Reeves</persRef> formerly of the
							Alien-Office. This person from having been one of the most inflexible
							supporter’s of the doctrine of unalienable allegiance, and being a
							lawyer, was led to pursue the principle into its consequences, and
							brought himself to the conclusion that all Americans born before the
							Declaration of Independence and at least their children were entitled
							unalienably to the privileges of British Subjects.— So that while he was
							at the head of the Alien-Office, where he had been placed, in
							consequence of the fiery zeal of his loyalty, he used to tell every
							American, who came to him for a Passport, that he was no more an alien
							than himself, and that he needed no Passport. The Government, who could
							not answer his argument, but whom his inferences did not suit, removed
							him from the alien-office, upon which he published a book, in support of
							his theory. He has now all the stubbornness of a religious or political
							bigot, upon the subject of his doctrine— It was but just as we were
							going down to dinner that he discovered who I was; and he was quite
							anxious to have a long conversation with me— He told me that he had read
								<persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hay’s</persRef> pamphlet upon expatriation, and asked my opinion of
							his book— I told him I thought his conclusions were correctly drawn from
							the British premises; but that in America, our principles were
							different; and of course they led to different conclusions— He said that
							some People here did not like his doctrine—what was that to him? He knew
							it to be the Law—and no lawyer in England would dare to say it was not—
							Let any body try it, in the Court of King’s Bench— No judge would dare
							to decide the question against him. I told him I thought if the question
							was brought before them; they would devise some means to get rid of
							it—they were subtle persons and I should be sorry to have a stake
							depending upon that question before them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Reeves was very sangwine that they must decide it, according to his
							theory, but he had not time to explain it to me at large.</p>

							hour and a half of every morning. Wrote a short Letter to <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef>, and went to London. I found
							at my Office in Craven Street, young <persRef ref="murray-wb">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Murray</persRef> of New-York, who
							brought me a Letter of recommendation from <persRef ref="forbes-john">J.
								M. Forbes</persRef>— He has just returned from a long visit in the
							Country, and is going shortly to France. I found also a Letter from
								<persRef ref="couling-william">W. Couling</persRef>, dated at
							Llanidlos, Montgomeryshire— He is going to Liverpool to embark for the
							United States; expects to be ready by the second week in September, and
							enquires if I have received any answer from the <persRef
								ref="nicholas-wilson">Governor of Virginia</persRef> upon his
							proposals. I remained only a few minutes at the Office, and then called
							at <persRef ref="leslie-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Leslie</persRef> the Painter’s, with the intention of sitting to him
							for my Picture, which <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">brother</persRef> has requested me
							to give him; but Leslie was not at home— I then went to see <persRef
								ref="west-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> West</persRef>,
							and at last found him at home, it being the fourth time I had called at
							his house— I was with him an hour and a half, and he shewed me all the
							collection of his Pictures that he now has at home. They are principally
							scriptural Subjects— <pb n="62" type="ms"/>He told me that he had been
							these many years painting a series of these Pictures for <persRef
								ref="george-iii">the king</persRef>— The whole number of them was to
							be thirty-six, twenty-five of which are finished— He classes them in to
							what he calls the four dispensations, the patriarchal, the Mosaic, the
							Christian or Gospel, and the Revelation or Apocalyptic dispensation— He
							is now engaged upon a Picture of Death upon the pale Horse, from the
							sixth chapter of the Book of Revelations verse 8. which he says must be
							in the terribly sublime Style. The picture is to be 28 feet long, and 22
							feet high— The sketch was before him, and the head of the figure of
							Death is completed, or as he calls it settled. The head of the horse is
							nearly finished— He expects to have it finished by next Spring. He is
							also painting a large transparent piece to be copied upon glass for a
							church window— It is the Angels proclaiming Peace on Earth at the
							Nativity of Christ— He has one large picture, from the Scottish History,
							an incident which he says founded the family of M’Gregor’s—and one copy
							of his Death of <persRef ref="wolfe-james2">Wolfe</persRef>, of which he
							told me he had painted four, with some varieties in the back grounds— He
							says he has been offered a hundred guineas for his proof copy of
								<persRef ref="woollett-william">Woollett’s</persRef> print of that
							picture—and that there is no engraver now living equal to Woollett— He
							shewed me two Pictures, which had been sent to him by British Officers,
							to judge of them— They were bought in Spain; one for a <persRef
								ref="titian">Titian</persRef>, the other for <persRef
								ref="sanzio-raffaello">Raphaël</persRef>. West says they are not
							only copies, but very bad copies.— And he adds that many of the British
							Officers have been greatly imposed upon in the same manner— Soon after
							six I left M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> West, and went and dined with
								<persRef ref="perry-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Perry</persRef> at Tavistock-House, North of Tavistock Square. The
								<persRef ref="augustusfrederick">Duke of Sussex</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="wilson-robert3">Sir Robert Wilson</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="long-robert">General Long</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="dupin-pierre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dupin</persRef> a
							French engineer, <persRef ref="dupin-andre">brother of the
								Dupin</persRef>, who was Sir Robert Wilson’s Counsel on the late
							trial at Paris, <persRef ref="wilson-richard">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Richard Wilson</persRef>, and another Gentleman whose
							name escaped me, constituted the company. <persRef ref="bruce-michael"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bruce</persRef>, Sir Robert’s
							associate in effecting the escape of <persRef ref="chamans-antoine">La
								Vallette</persRef> had been invited, but was prevented by some
							accident from coming. The conversation at table was very free on
							political subjects; and sentiments were expressed without reserve. The
							company were whigs; evidently not satisfied with the issue of the City
							meeting last Wednesday; yet railing at Sinecures, and complaining that
							many of their friends will not come out. And something was said about
							trimmers— Sir Robert Wilson asserted as a fact which came from <persRef
								ref="fouche-joseph">Fouché</persRef> himself, that the Royal French
							proscription list, of the Ordonnance of 24 July 1815 was submitted to
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, and
							had his sanction before the Proclamation was issued. It was remarked
							that he ought to be impeached for this, and that it deserved a capital
							punishment— There was much talk about Sinecures; the <persRef
								ref="pratt-john">Marquis of Camden</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="perceval-charles">Lord Arden</persRef> &amp;c. But this is a
							point upon which the whigs ought to be tongue-tied; for many of their
							leaders are upon the list— It was said that the <persRef
								ref="scott-john2">Lord Chancellor Eldon</persRef>, and his brother
								<persRef ref="scott-william">Sir William Scott</persRef>, had made
							by the public a property of at least a Million Sterling, and some very
							ludicrous Stories were told about “Old Bags”— The <persRef
								ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef> has been very dangerously
							ill— He went to Windsor the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> to keep
							the <persRef ref="frederickaugustus">Duke of York’s</persRef> birth day
							with the <persRef ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef>— He was unwell there;
							but returned after the party, to the Stud-house at Hampton-Court, where
							he was seized with extreme Violence. It was an inflammation of the
							bowels. He had a girdle of 36 leaches round his waist, and when they
							dropped off was put into a warm bath to continue the bleeding. In the
							whole he had eighty ounces of blood taken from him— It was not until
							yesterday that his signature could be obtained to the prorogation of
							Parliament, which was from this day to the 4<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of November— The public knew nothing of the Prince’s
							illness until he was recovering— The Queen left Windsor to go and see
							him, but was met on the road by the <persRef ref="adolphus">Duke of
								Cambridge</persRef>, and persuaded to return— Perry had a Letter
							from a Gentleman of respectability giving it as an undoubted fact that
							the Prince was raving mad— The only foundation for which was the
							delirium occasioned by the violence of the fever.— There was something
							said of <persRef ref="erskine-thomas">Lord Erskine’s</persRef> having
							had a long conference with the Lord Chancellor, and of high words having
							passed between the Regent and the Chancellor. They related to the
							projected divorce from <persRef ref="caroline-brunswick">his
								wife</persRef> which the Regent is very desirous of obtaining, but
							which is vehemently opposed by the Chancellor— The <persRef
								ref="charlotte">Princess Charlotte</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="leopold2">Prince Leopold</persRef>, are so disgusted with
							Camelford-House, their Town Residence, which they have now left, and
							removed into the Country that they will not return to it. They are to
							have Apartments in Kensington Palace; but the Duke of Sussex said he
							would not give up his there— They were granted to him he said by the
								<persRef ref="george-iii">king</persRef>; and he insisted that they
							could not be taken from him during the King’s life. There was question
							to whom the Regency would be assigned in case of the Prince of Wales’s
							demise; and it seems it would be a great Question between the Princess
							Charlotte and the <persRef ref="frederickaugustus">Duke of
								York</persRef>— The Duke of Sussex was earnest in the wish for the
							dissolution of the political connection between this Country and
							Hanover, by the separation of the Crowns— After dinner I reminded the
							Duke of the promise he had made me of naming a day when he would come
							and dine with me. He named next Friday. I also invited Sir Robert
							Wilson, who promised to come, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perry,
							who excused himself, being obliged to go on Thursday to Brighton.— It
							was near twelve, when the Duke left the Company; and I came away
							immediately afterwards— Reached home at half past one.</p>

						<p><date>25. VII— </date>Attended Church with <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef>— Prayers for the eleventh Sunday after Trinity
							were read by <persRef ref="milman-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Milman</persRef>; and a Charity Sermon was preached, for the benefit
							of the Boys Charity School, by the <persRef ref="harness-william">Rev.
								William Harness</persRef>, M.A. of Christ’s College, Cambridge. His
							text was Luke XVIII.16. “But Jesus called them unto him, and said,
							Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not.” M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Harness is a young man; nearly of the age
							of Milman, but I prefer much both his composition and delivery to
							Milman’s. His <pb n="63" type="ms"/>Sermon was adapted well to the
							occasion, and soberly and forcibly written— They boys were catechised by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Milman; and after Church there was a
							collection for them. Returning home from Church, I stopped and paid a
							visit to my neighbour, <persRef ref="dumouriez-charles">General
								Dumouriez</persRef>. I found he was not going to the dinner this day
							at the <persRef ref="eustache-rene">French Ambassador’s</persRef>.
							Dumouriez has lost all hopes of being recalled to France under the
							present order of things, and is not so much in the secret of affairs as
							he was last year. I asked him if it was true, as the Newspapers had
							announced, that a person had been arrested in Paris for corresponding
							with him— He said it was— A <persRef ref="morgan-jacques">General
								Morgan</persRef>, who had been one of his Aide de Camp’s. The
							Letters had been so far from containing any thing exceptionable that he
							had shewn them when he received them to the <persRef
								ref="delachastre-claude">Duke de la Châtre</persRef>, then French
							Ambassador here. But <persRef ref="decazes-elie">Monsieur
								Cazes</persRef> the Minister of Police had taken it into his head
							that he, Dumouriez, with his 78 years upon his head, was the chief of a
							party, in favour of the <persRef ref="louis-philippe">Duke of
								Orleans</persRef>— And although Morgan’s Letters were sent through
							the <persRef ref="stuart-charles">British Minister Stuart</persRef>, and
							enclosed to <persRef ref="vansittart-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Vansittart</persRef> the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
							Monsieur Cazes had broken them open, and sent Morgan to prison— But that
							is not surprizing when it is considered that there are now fifty-eight
							thousand state prisoners in France. He, Dumouriez immediately applied to
							Vansittart, that Stuart might be instructed to remonstrate against this
							procedure; but it was without effect; and Morgan was not released until
							the Duke de la Chatre went home, when he made such a noise about it that
							they let the man go— But Monsieur Cazes had also broken open Letters,
							addressed to <persRef ref="hamilton-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hamilton</persRef>, the Under Secretary of State, and
							found treason lurking in one of them, because the writer stated that he
							had paid for something, eighteen shillings— I asked Dumouriez, what had
							been the object of the <persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of
								Wellington’s</persRef> late visit in England. He did not know. He
							had not seen the Duke, though he had called at his house for that
							purpose— Perhaps it was on account of his health, as he went for some
							time to Cheltenham— <persRef ref="wilson-robert3">Sir Robert
								Wilson</persRef>, and <persRef ref="bruce-michael">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bruce</persRef>, since their return
							from France have been to visit Dumouriez, who has a much higher opinion
							of Bruce than of his associate. He thinks that Bruce will shortly be
							brought into Parliament, and will make a figure there— After I returned
							home we had a visit to take leave, from <persRef
								ref="vonjacobikloest-konstans">Baron Jacobi-Klöst</persRef> the late
							Prussian Minister— He informed us that <persRef ref="greuhm-frederick"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greuhm</persRef>, was going with
							him; and that he had presented <persRef ref="jouffroy-georg">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jouffroy</persRef> here as the
							Prussian Chargé d’Affaires. Baron Jacobi is far advanced in years and
							intends now to retire from public life altogether— I went into London
							and dined at the Marquis d’Osmond the French Ambassador’s— It was
								<persRef ref="stlouis">S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi>
								Louis’s</persRef> day, and a great Diplomatic dinner. But as “Full
							Dress,” had not been marked upon the invitation Cards, as is usual on
							such occasions, and as was done upon the Count de la Chatre’s Cards on
							the same occasion last year, I went in frock undress, but found all the
							rest of the Company in full dress; excepting the <persRef ref="u"
								>Marquis de Grimaldi</persRef>, the Sardinian chargé d’Affaires, who
							had made the same mistake, and two French Bishops, who could not appear
							in their full dress conveniently. The Company consisted of the Cabinet
							Ministers, the Earls of <persRef ref="jenkinson-robert"
								>Liverpool</persRef> and <persRef ref="bathurst-henry"
								>Bathurst</persRef>, and <persRef ref="canning-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning</persRef> the new President of
							the Board of Controul; most of the foreign Ambassadors and Ministers;
							the two French Bishops above-mentioned, and a number of French Officers,
							with the <persRef ref="seguier-armand">Consul Seguier</persRef>. One of
							the Officers, next to whom I was seated at table, told me that he had
							married a Sister of de <persRef ref="u">Cabre’s</persRef>,
							and spoke in handsome terms of the <persRef ref="caulaincourt-armand"
								>Duke de Vicence</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning
							came late, after the company had sat down to Table— He made acquaintance
							with me, by asking me to help him to a dish that was before me, and to
							take a glass of wine with him— After dinner, at his request the Earl of
							Liverpool formally introduced him to me. This Gentleman, whose celebrity
							is great, and whose talents are perhaps greater than those of any other
							member of the Cabinet, has been invariably noted for the bitterness of
							his inveteracy against the United States, and I suppose considers it as
							a rule of personal courtesy to make up by an excess of civility, for the
							rancour which he has so constantly manifested against us. <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef>, more than once mentioned to me that such had been
							his conduct towards him— He and Lord Liverpool both talked about the
							great and rapid increase of the population of the United States— They
							enquired when the next Presidential election would take place, and who
							would probably be elected— I told them <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>. Lord Liverpool said
							he had heard, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s election might be
							opposed on account of his being a Virginian— I said that had been made a
							ground of objection to him, but would not avail.— I asked <persRef
								ref="pfeffel-christian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pfeffel</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="freire-cipriano">Chevalier
								de Freire</persRef>, to come and dine with us next Friday. Freire
							promised to come. Pfeffel had a previous engagement. The weather was so
							cold that there was a fire in the drawing Room; so there was yesterday
							at <persRef ref="perry-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perry’s</persRef>. The Ambassador’s Lady,
								<persRef ref="eustache-helene">Madame d’Osmond</persRef> was much
							out of humour, at being obliged to live at this Season of the year in
							Town. Their daughter <persRef ref="deboigne-adele">Madame de
								Boignes</persRef> is a handsome and agreeable woman. They all speak
							English well— They lived many years in this Country as Emigrants. <pb

							at home before twelve. <persRef ref="nicholas-ellen">Ellen

						<p><date>30. VI:15. </date>Received this Morning a Note from <persRef
								ref="tuckerman-joseph2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tuckerman</persRef>, mentioning that he is to leave London
							to-morrow, to pass some time at Cheltenham and Bath, and intending to
							embark in four or five weeks at Liverpool for the United States. He
							offers to take any thing for our friends in America— Also a Note from
							the <persRef ref="jenkinson-robert">Earl of Liverpool</persRef>, in
							answer to mine of the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> he says that an
							order was sent on that day from the Treasury to the Commissioners of the
							Customs, to clear out the Princess of Wales, although the number of men
							on board should exceed the number allowed by Law in ordinary cases: this
							being considered as a Case to which the law alluded to did not apply—
							But in the case of the ship at Glasgow, they could not sanction the
							Breach of a positive Law. They had however informed the parties, that if
							they should be sued upon their contracts they should be defended at the
							public expence. I sent by the Coachman a note to the <persRef
								ref="augustusfrederick">Duke of Sussex</persRef> reminding him of
							his engagement to dine with us this day, and received his answer. I
							walked to Hanwell, and afterwards amused an hour with <persRef
								ref="turreau-louis">General Turreau’s</persRef> spiteful pamphlet
							against the United States. The Duke of Sussex, <persRef
								ref="erskine-thomas">Lord Erskine</persRef>, the <persRef
								ref="wood-matthew">Lord Mayor</persRef>, the <persRef
								ref="freire-cipriano">Chevalier de Freire, Portuguese
								Minister</persRef>, <persRef ref="wilson-robert3">Sir Robert
								Wilson</persRef>, <persRef ref="nicholas-george2">Doctor
								Nicholas</persRef> and his <persRef
								ref="nicholas-caroline;nicholas-ellen">two eldest
								daughters</persRef> dined with us. The Duke was unwell, but in good
							Spirits. Sir Robert Wilson told us, many very interesting particulars of
							the escape of <persRef ref="chamans-antoine">La Valette</persRef>, most
							of which were however already known. There was some allusion to the
							moral and political question as to the propriety of the conduct of the
							three Englishmen concerned in that affair. There is much diversity of
							opinion upon the subject, and the political bias generally decides the
							question in the mind of each individual. It is my opinion that when the
							municipal Laws of a State, or the Laws of military discipline come in
							too violent collision with the Laws of humanity, it is just and proper
							that they should snap asunder, rather than that the ties of nature
							should be dissolved. I think therefore that the action of <persRef
								ref="bruce-michael">Bruce</persRef>, <persRef ref="wilson-robert3">Wilson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="helyhutchinson-john">Hutchinson</persRef>, in assisting La
							Valette to escape was laudable and proper. It would have been perhaps
							more prudent, and possibly not unjustifiable to have declined— There are
							other particulars in the life of Sir Robert Wilson, of far more doubtful
							character in my estimation, and his conversation this day and last
							Saturday gave me no very high opinion of his judgment— The Letter by
							which he and his associates were detected after their success was a
							great indiscretion— He appears to me to be in desperate circumstances,
							and told me he had had thoughts of going to South America, to offer his
							services to the South-American Insurgents; which I advised him not to
							do. He conversed much upon the State of affairs here, and said he
							thought <persRef ref="grey-charles">Lord Grey</persRef> would come out
							with effect at the next Session of Parliament— But Lord Grey, and all
							the parliamentary opposition, with the single exception of <persRef
								ref="burdett-francis">Sir Francis Burdett</persRef>, are as much out
							of favour with the people as any of the Ministers. Wilson says some
							incident will occur to make them popular, which I very much doubt. They
							are pledged to opinions with which they and the Ministers will sink or
							swim all together.— Wilson told me that <persRef ref="mina-francisco"
								>Mina</persRef> was at Baltimore; and that he knew the whole Story
							how he had gone away from this Country— Lord Erskine was quite
							entertaining; and amused the company with many of his puns— He is much
							addicted to this practice. He repeated to us an epigram which he sent to
							the Morning Chronicle, and which was published in that paper— It was in
							four lines, and the idea was, that of all the people slain on Waterloo’s
							immortal field, there was not one, who fell half so flat as <persRef
								ref="scott-walter">Walter Scott</persRef>. He insists positively
							that Scott is not the author of Waverly, Guy Mannering nor the
							Astrologer, and the Antiquary. Lord Erskine says the Country is ruined;
							but as after opposing the original Wars against <pb n="66" type="ms"
							/>the French Revolution for many years, he finished by supporting the
							Wars against <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Napoleon</persRef>, he is
							a little puzzled, and a little over anxious to maintain his own
							consistency— He never once attended in Parliament, the whole of the last
							Session; and it will probably be wise for him not to attend the next— He
							is however upon good terms with the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince
								Regent</persRef>, and may possibly come in again as Chancellor if
								<persRef ref="scott-john2">Lord Eldon</persRef> should go out.— This
							both he and <persRef ref="jenkinson-robert">Lord Liverpool</persRef> are
							said to have threatened, upon the divorce question— I asked the Lord
							Mayor, how those Resolutions at the late City meeting could be passed as
							they were, without opposition—he said the friends of the Government, had
							not dared to make any opposition— I asked him how many whigs there were
							among the aldermen—he said scarcely any. <persRef ref="birch-samuel"
								>Birch</persRef> was no whig— He had had a little difference with
							the Ministers at the time of the Corn-Bill; but <persRef
								ref="curtis-william">Curtis</persRef> had afterwards made it up with
							them for him— As for himself he had never invited any of the Ministers,
							to any one of his parties, excepting those public entertainments, to
							which they were officially invited, and of course They had not chosen to
							attend at them, and he had not and would not invite them to any others.
							He said it would be <persRef ref="smith-christopher">Smith’s</persRef>
							turn to be Lord Mayor next year; and he would doubtless be elected, as
							they scarcely ever went out of the regular course. Smith is highly
							ministerial— The Duke of Sussex was more moderate, and reserved in his
							conversation than he sometimes is— After we rose from table, the Ladies
							sung and played on the Piano— The company left us about twelve.</p>

							half— The Letters by the Morning’s Post, and the Newspapers come in
							about nine— With the interval of an hour at Breakfast, I am reading
							them, answering the Letters or writing in this journal and overlooking
							papers until five in the afternoon. I then walk an hour or more— We dine
							between six and seven; after which I am idle. Sometimes reading a few
							pages, and sometimes taking a short walk. The Season for walking after
							dinner is however now past, and the weather has been so constantly cold
							and wet the whole Summer through that we have very seldom enjoyed it.
							Two or three times a week I go into London, and then I write and read
							little or nothing after Breakfast.</p>
