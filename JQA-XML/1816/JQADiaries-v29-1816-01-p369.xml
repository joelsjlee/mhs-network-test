						<p><date>1. V:15. </date>I began the morning of the New-Year, as I had the
							closing day of the last with writing to redeem the arrears of this
							Journal— Wrote a short Letter to <persRef ref="joy-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joy</persRef>, and sent back to him
							the Letters which he had enclosed to me for perusal. Began the draught
							of a Letter to <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord
								Castlereagh</persRef> in reply to <persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Lord
								Bathurst’s</persRef> Note respecting the fisheries— It has long
							weighed heavily upon my mind, and perhaps ought not to have been delayed
							to this time. It must necessarily be long and my great concern will be
							to shorten it as much as possible without impairing the substance of the
							argument. In my walk before dinner I called at the house of <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray</persRef> to return his
							visit— He was gone to London, and I left a Card.— <persRef
								ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. A.
								Smith</persRef> came out from town to dinner— He brought me two
							Letters— One from <persRef ref="giles-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Eliza Giles</persRef>, and the other from <persRef
								ref="maury-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury</persRef>.
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Giles encloses an open Letter from
							herself, to The <persRef ref="rose-george2">Treasurer</persRef> of His
							Majesty’s Navy, Somerset House, London.— She gives in that Letter a
							statement of facts, respecting her Son, <persRef ref="giles-william2"
								>William Axtell Giles</persRef>—namely, that in the year 1804, being
							an American, and a Gentleman by Birth and Education, he was impressed
							into the British Naval Service, and continued in it serving in various
							ships until 1809. when he was discharged as an American, having 17
							Months pay, and prize money due to him.— That in 1813, he left New-York
							for Cadiz, and from the best information she has been able to collect
							(not having had any Letters from himself since that period) he again
							entered the British Navy, and sailed to Canada in the Linnet as Purser,
							and volunteered his services on deck during the action, wherein the
							Linnet was captured on Lake Champlain by <persRef
								ref="macdonough-thomas">Commodore M’Donogh</persRef>—that she knows
							not how long he remained a Prisoner of War, but that he died suddenly
							and intestate at the Havanna on the 13<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> of
							July 1815. That she has received all the necessary documents empowering
							her to receive from the British Government whatever was due from them to
							her son, and that some informalities have prevented her receiving it
							hitherto— She states her great want of the money, and solicits the
							immediate attention of the Treasurer of the Navy to this claim, and
							sends the Letter to me, desiring me to favour her with a line of
							recommendation, to facilitate the business; and wishes it to be put into
							the hands of <persRef ref="beasley-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Beasley</persRef>, the American Consul.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury’s Letter still complains about the
							Sailors, and the want of money to assist them and pay for their
							passages. The <persRef ref="barton-william4">Mayor of
								Liverpool</persRef> has called upon him to see him and concert
							measures for sending home those who are become burthensome to the
							Parish—and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury having now upwards of
							100 upon his hands, has resolved in future to afford relief only to the
							sick. Anticipating that this will occasion complaints against him in the
							United States, he writes to give me notice of it.— <persRef
								key="adams-george">George</persRef> made an attempt to resume his
							reading; but his cough made it difficult, and he read only two Chapters,
							and I the other four— The <persRef
								ref="nicholas-caroline;nicholas-ellen">two eldest
								Nicholas’s</persRef>, with an Italian young Lady, came and paid a
							morning visit to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Adams</persRef>— They also spent the
							Evening here, and we all played at Loto, until past eleven.</p>

								Dec<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> mentioning a number of respectable

							for the appointment of Secretary to this Legation, before he received my

								<persRef ref="morris-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Anthony
								Morris</persRef> at Madrid, dated 18. Dec<hi rend="superscript"
								>r:</hi> in answer <pb n="370" type="ms"/>to mine of 25. November

								ref="cevallos-pedro">Secretary of State Cevallos</persRef>, from
							whom he received only a verbal, and very offensive reply in July that

							left the Letter at the Office to be forwarded to me— I was employed upon

							came and gave a lesson to <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> and

							Smith’s lodgings, Number 13. Craven-Street, where my Office is
							henceforth to be kept— <persRef ref="grubb-james">M<hi

								Sterry</persRef>, appointed Consul at La Rochelle; and from Paris by

							concerning the Sailors and the want of money. 4. From <persRef
								ref="bourne-sylvanus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bourne</persRef> at Amsterdam, with complaints on the same Subject,
							and urging again compensation for Consuls. 5. From <persRef

							published by <persRef ref="morgan-william3">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Morgan</persRef> in his Memoirs of the Life of D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Price— While I was at the Office, <persRef
								ref="aspinwall-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John M.
								Aspinwall</persRef> of New-York, brought me a Letter of introduction
							from his father <persRef ref="aspinwall-gilbert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gilbert Aspinwall</persRef> one of the assignees of
								<persRef ref="bird-robert">Robert Bird</persRef>. He says in his

							going immediately to Paris, and promised to take Letters for me, and the
							200 franks which <persRef ref="hauel-lucy">Lucy Hauel</persRef> wishes
							to send for <persRef ref="u">her father</persRef>— He came for a
							Passport which was given him, and he asked, if he could not get M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb to obtain the endorsement of the
								<persRef ref="delachastre-claude">French Ambassador</persRef>, and
							the papers necessary from the Alien Office—and he added that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb had done so for another American
							Gentleman, who had given him a fee for it; though M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb had told him there was nothing to
							pay for what was done at this Office— I told M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Aspinwall, that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb was no
							longer in this Office— That my strict injunction to him had been to take
							no fees whatever while in my Office; and that this was the first notice
							I had that he had ever taken any. He was indeed under no obligation to
							obtain for Americans the endorsement of the French Ambassador, or the
							papers at the alien-office, and he might have thought himself at Liberty
							to receive a fee for doing it— But had it been known to me I should
							strictly have forbidden it; and I could not permit that he should now
							receive a fee for doing any thing connected with the business of this
							office— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Aspinwall took therefore his
							Passport, to transact the business himself.— A Letter was likewise
							brought me from <persRef ref="karthaus-frederick">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Karthaus</persRef>, in reply to mine
							of 23. December. <persRef ref="bagot-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bagot</persRef> came about three—and informed me that
							the Frigate Niger was now ready, at Portsmouth and he expected to leave
							London next Saturday or Sunday to go and embark for Annapolis; though he
							should not move if the wind should be westerly. He offered again to take
							Letters, Despatches and any thing that I may wish to send— He said he
							was to have the same Captain, (<persRef ref="jackson-samuel"
								>Jackson</persRef>) with whom he was to have gone out in the
							Lacedemonian— But that Frigate was a twin ship, with the Macedonian,
							they were both built for sailing, and so sharp, that there was not room
							for the stowage of his baggage. He had then taken a Transport to carry
							that— But the Niger was of a different Construction, and could take all
							his effects; so that he should take no Transport. As he said Lord
							Castlereagh, who is now at Norfolk, at <persRef ref="harbord-william"
								>Lord Suffield’s</persRef>, the brother in Law of <persRef
								ref="stewart-amelia">Lady Castlereagh</persRef>, would be in town to
							attend next Monday at Brighton the celebration of the <persRef
								ref="charlotte">Princess Charlotte of Wales’s</persRef> Birth-day, I
							asked him if there was any foundation for an insinuation lately twice
							repeated in the Morning Chronicle, that the Princess was to marry one of
							the <persRef ref="johnarchdukeaustria;louisarchdukeaustria">Austrian
								Archdukes</persRef> now here— He said none in the world— The Morning
							Chronicle had pretended that the late Council held at Brighton had been
							deeply engaged in that important affair. The truth was that the Council
							was held for the sole purpose of swearing in <persRef ref="pitt-william"
								>Lord Amherst</persRef>—(The Ambassador going out to China) and
							there were so few members to attend it, that the <persRef
								ref="george-iv">Prince</persRef> had been obliged to direct <persRef
								ref="wellesleypole-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pole</persRef>, to stay at Brighton a day longer than intended <pb
								n="371" type="ms"/>because there were not sufficient number of the
							members present, to form a Council without him.— We had some further
							conversation, upon the late accounts from France— The escape of <persRef
								ref="chamans-antoine">La Valetta</persRef>—the projects of Amnesty
							and Revenge, the Ministry and the Legislative Chambers. I told him I
							should bring him some Letters for the United States on Friday. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb had several times proposed to me, to
							subscribe to the Westminster Library N. 44. Jermyn Street; and having
							renewed this day the proposal, I assented to it— He informed the
							Secretary of my wish, and brought me a Catalogue of the Books, and a
							copy of the printed Terms of Subscription— He was then going into the
							City, and offered to call upon Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							Dickason and Nevett, whom I was desirous of informing of the substance
							of the Letter this morning received from the Spanish Ambassador. But
							before he left the Office, <persRef ref="nevett-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nevett</persRef> came in— I shewed him
							the papers, and told him that they had now only to apply to Count Fernan
							Nuñez, who would immediately give them the authority to enter the appeal
							of Territory— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nevett promised to send me
							some American Newspapers, arrived by the Milo; the vessel that brought
							the Letters from my Mother. <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Chitty</persRef> called, with the Broad Cloth, which I
							had ordered— Just before I left the Office, <persRef
								ref="dashwood-ludlow">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dashwood</persRef>, one of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. A.
							Smith’s fellow-passengers from New-York, came in— I thought I had seen
							him before, without recollecting where; and after some time, he asked me
							how I had been, since we came from Sweden together— I then immediately
							remembered him as the Purser of the John Adams— He gave a very bad
							account of <persRef ref="nicholls-jesse">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jesse Nicholls</persRef> who was also one of our fellow passengers
							from Sweden to the Texel— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dashwood told
							us that he intended to go next Saturday to Liverpool, to embark
							immediately upon his return to America— He offered to take Letters— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot, and <persRef ref="pursh-frederick"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pursh</persRef> are to go about
							the same time— My Carriage was ordered at four, and came soon after.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith gave me several late American
							Newspapers and other publications.— I got out of the Carriage at the
							third and walked nearly to the sixth Mile-Stone— It was about six, when
							I reached home— In the Evening my wife read a few chapters of
							Patronage.</p>

							“Glorious Regency.” About a dozen of the rabblement were collected

						<p><date>8. V: </date>A day of miscellaneous occupation, in which with
							twelve hours of employment, I did a little of many things. The Journal
							was short; I wrote an answer to the Letter of <persRef
								ref="millard-john">Millard</persRef>, the convict at Gosport, a
							despatch N. 26. to the <persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary of
								State</persRef>; to be sent by <persRef ref="bagot-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef>, and began a Letter to
								<persRef key="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef>.— As I am now
							enabled to write again with my own hand, though slowly and with
							difficulty, I resort again to the copying-Press, from which I take
							copies of my Letters and despatches, which although often faint, and
							scarcely legible, are at least the most accurate of all copies when they
							can be read— My Letter Books, are all so incorrect that I scarcely ever
							have occasion to recur to the copy of a Letter in any one of them,
							without detecting several errors—sometimes omissions of a whole
							sentence—often of a whole line—often the whole interval between the
							recurrence twice of the same word, and often mistakes of words, which
							distort the sense of a paragraph into nonsense or absurdity— The
							omission of the word “not” often inverts the meaning of a sentence, and
							turns denial into affirmation— These errors are inseparable from all
							copying, and increase in numbers when the writing of one person is
							copied by another. Long practice, gives a copying Clerk more or less of
							accuracy, according to his proportion of Understanding and assiduity,
							but none can ever be perfect.— The Press-Copy if legible, is always a
							perfect transcript from the original.— I took copies of my Note to
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, and of
							my despatch to the Secretaty of State. <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> made me a Copy of the Note— I made out my quarterly
							Account to be transmitted with the despatch— A walk before dinner to
							Brentford and Ealing— Drizzling rain and foul roads— Received a Note
							from <persRef ref="smith-john">J. A. Smith</persRef>, with information
							that he has six Packets for me from the Department of State, brought by
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Price</persRef> of
							New-York, and that he keeps them until to-morrow. Also a Letter from
								<persRef ref="grubb-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Grubb</persRef>, at N. 11. Threadneedle Street, the Consular Office.
							He encloses to me three Letters—from <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>, my mother and <persRef ref="everett-alexander">A.
								H. Everett</persRef>, dated 10 and 11. March last. Grubb says the

							Examiner of Yesterday; a Sunday’s paper; and an anonymous Note, from one
							of the tribe of inventors, who wishes to know what encouragements or

							and <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went with me. I
							found at the Office the <persRef ref="vaudoncourt-frederic">Chevalier de
								Vaudoncourt</persRef>, who had been recommended to me by <persRef
								ref="chichagov-pavel">Admiral Chichagoff</persRef>; he told me that
							having been an Officer in the French army, and having written an
							impartial History of the Campaign of 1812. he had not felt himself easy
							in France, under her present situation. He had therefore withdrawn from
							that Country, and had been obliged to leave his property behind; not
							having been able to dispose of any part of it— That he was desirous of
							going to America, the only Country where the principles to which he was
							devoted <pb n="374" type="ms"/>were yet in honour, and he wished to know
							whether in his profession as an Officer of Artillery he could expect
							employment, or assistance in any other manner from the Government of the
							United States— I told him of the great difficulty which there must be,
							under the present Circumstances for any foreign Officer to obtain
							military employment in America, from the great embarrassment of the
							Government to provide for the meritorious native Officers, who have been
							in the service during the War; many of whom they had just now been
							compelled to discharge— He said he was aware of that, but there were
							great numbers of other persons in France situated like himself— Some had
							already gone to America; and he particularly mentioned the <persRef
								ref="gilly-jacques;u">two Generals Gilly</persRef>— Many others
							would be going as they should find opportunities. He had thought there
							might be enough of them to form a Colony, while Peace should continue,
							and that perhaps the Government might be disposed to give them some
							assistance. I told him that I believed whatever could be done in that
							way, must be effected by the means of individual and voluntary
							association— If numbers adequate to the formation of a Colony could
							associate themselves together, and undertake a settlement, the
							Government might afford them some facilities with regard to the
							acquisition of Lands, as had been done in similar cases, but that was
							all that could be expected— He asked me, if he could easily find
							opportunities to embark for the United States, in an American Vessel;
							for he should not like to go in any other— I told him there were
							American Vessels continually going from Liverpool, and others, though
							not so often, from London— He would find no difficulty in obtaining a
							Passage, by any of them, and I would render him any service in my power,
							that could be necessary to assist him. He promised to call upon me
							again; and to lend me a copy of his History of the campaign of 1812 to
							read— It was an enlargement of the pamphlet upon the passage of the
							Beresina, which Admiral Chichagoff gave me last Summer— He would give me
							a copy of the work; but he had not yet been able to publish it— He had
							left an Edition of it, printed at Paris, but so harsh was the tyranny
							exercised over the Press in that Country, and such inquisitorial
							searches had been making for his book, that his Printer had been obliged
							to send the whole Edition from his own house, and out of Paris to a
							place where it could be hidden— The persecution of every body who had
							belonged to the French army was equally rigorous— There was a system of
							proscription pursued against them— He had written Letters lately to
							several General Officers at Paris, and among them to one who had been a
							warm partizan of the Bourbons, the person to whom he had sent the
							Letters to deliver them, and to whom he had indicated the places of
							their lodging, had answered him that he had called at those places, but
							none of those persons were to be found; and added some obscure and
							singular expressions, from which he could only infer that they had all
							been arrested—and he had heard from another quarter that eighteen or
							twenty Generals had been arrested at once— He spoke of <persRef
								ref="demarmont-auguste">Marmont</persRef> as an infamous character
							who had betrayed his Country; but said he had acted lately a generous
							part in the case of <persRef ref="ney-michel">Ney</persRef>, and of
								<persRef ref="chamans-antoine">La Valette</persRef>— He expressed
							high admiration at the heroic devotion of <persRef ref="chamans-emilie"
								>La Valette’s wife</persRef> but said if the <persRef
								ref="marietheresecharlotte">Duchess d’Angoulême</persRef> could have
							her will, Madame La Valette would be guillotined instead of her husband—
							Marmont’s first intercession for La Valette, he said had been that the
							mode of his Execution might be changed— He had wished to die the death
							of a Soldier— But the <persRef ref="louis-xviii">king</persRef> had
							answered that the Law must have its course— He had no power to alter
							it.— The Chevalier also told me that <persRef ref="sebastiani-horace"
								>General Sebastiani</persRef> was now in London— He too had been
							obliged to leave all his property behind him— He had not been able to
							sell even the furniture of his lodgings— M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi>
							Vaudoncourt said he knew not how long this state of things would
							continue in France—the <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Emperor
								Napoleon</persRef> had organized an internal Government so
							energetic, that the Bourbons now in possession of all the means provided
							by him, might maintain themselves against all possible resistance— The
							immense majority of the population of France, was against them— Not one
							hundredth part of the People was in their favour; but the one might long
							tyrannize over the ninety nine.— At all Events, if a change should take
							place, and there should be any thing to be done in France, he should
							immediately return there— The Chevalier now left me, and I took up the
							six packets of despatches from the <persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary
								of State</persRef>. I had expected that some of them would be merely
							packages of Newspapers and U.S. Laws— But they were all written, and so
							voluminous, that before leaving Town, I could read only a very small
							portion of them. There are Letters from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe of the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> 19<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> 23<hi rend="superscript"

							at five guineas a week, and to give on either side a Month’s Notice at
							quitting. I enquired of Bates, whether he had now any houses on hand, in

							the Rents of well situated houses have not fallen at all— Secondary
							situations will not fetch so much as they did two years ago— It is
							almost impossible to sell any real Estates; the sales that he has made
							are not so great by many thousands as they were last year—and the case
							is the same with others; for he has been informed that the auction duty
							has not yielded this year one half the sum that it did the last.— What
							the sum that it yielded was, he does not know— But they have let as many
							houses as before. He is to send me a Note of the houses they have, to
							let on lease by the year— I walked to Gunnersbury and Brentford, and the

							despatches from the <persRef key="monroe-james">Secretary of

						<p><date>12. VI. </date>My rising hour should be
							five— But on our firm resolves, the inaudible and noiseless foot of
							Time, steals on. More than half the Morning’s find me yet in bed at or
							near six. It was thus this morning, and I lost thereby the moments for
							finishing the Letter to <persRef ref="cornelissen-edige">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cornelissen</persRef>. I wrote however
							a short Letter to <persRef ref="boyd-robert">M<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="hauel-lucy">Lucy Hauel’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="u">father</persRef>, by <persRef ref="gray-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> J. C. Gray</persRef>; and went into
							London. It was past twelve O’Clock when I left my door, and just before
							I stepped into the Carriage the Postman brought me a Letter from
								<persRef ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hughes</persRef> of Baltimore, enclosing one for <persRef
								ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Russell</persRef> at Stockholm— A Letter from a <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Wiltshire</persRef> requesting
							to see me, and calling herself an American; and a Packet from <persRef
								ref="vonberoldingen-joseph">Count de Beroldingen</persRef>, the
							Minister of the King of Wurtemberg enclosing two papers of enquiries,
							concerning property of individuals in North and South Carolina, natives
							of Wurtemberg— I took these papers with me—the Coachman took me, by the
							Uxbridge road, half a mile shorter than that by Brentford, Hammersmith
							and Kensington, but at least now two miles heavier I first went to the
							Counting House, of the <persRef ref="baringbrothers">Brothers, Baring
								and C<hi rend="superscript">o.</hi></persRef> and saw <persRef
								ref="baring-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alexander
								Baring</persRef>. I enquired if the remittance of 25000 dollars,
							from the Treasury Department, which the <persRef key="monroe-james"
								>Secretary of State</persRef> had informed them, would be made, and
							upon which he had given me a credit upon their house, to that amount,
							had been made— He found it had not; but said they had an old balance due
							to the United States upon the diplomatic fund, and I might therefore
							draw without reserve— I took a draft for £1500 and signed triplicate
							receipts for it— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baring mentioned that
							their usage had been to keep a private account with the Minister of the
							United States, crediting them for their quarterly Salaries, and then
							debiting them with the monies paid them. I told him that was the proper
							course, when the credits given to the Ministers by the Department of
							State, were as I presumed they had been, and as mine had been, while in
							Russia, upon the <persRef ref="willinkfirm;vanstaphorstfirm">Bankers of
								the United States</persRef> at Amsterdam, for an annual sum, the
							amount of their Salary and the Contingencies of the Legation— But my
							credit upon them was for a specific sum—25000 dollars— I could draw upon
							them only to that amount, and might draw for it all at once, or as
							suited my convenience— I had other accounts open with the Government,
							and a balance due to me for former expences— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Baring assented to these remarks, and gave me a draft on
								<persRef ref="martinstoneandmartin">Martin Stone and
								Martin</persRef>, Bankers, 68 Lombard Street for the £1500— We had
							then some conversation upon general topics— I mentioned the approaching
							Session of Parliament— He said it would pass off in perfect quietness.
							There was no Opposition— The Ministers were firm as <hi rend="italic"
								>Rocks</hi>. I asked him whether something would not be said about
							the distress of the agricultural interest, of which we occasionally
							heard. How the revenue would stand, and whether they could give up the
							property tax— He said, laughing, that the agricultural interest was to
							be sure in a sad State; but the Revenue of the year, would exceed that
							of the last— There had been however a falling off in the last Quarter—
							Not of the Excise, but of the Customs.— As to the property tax, poor
								<persRef ref="vansittart-nicholas">Vansittart</persRef> was like the
							man with his wife, nec possum tecum vivere nec sinete—there was a
							clamour against the tax which made it almost impossible for him to renew
							it; and yet he could not well do without it— He, Baring had been writing
							him a Letter yesterday, and proposed to him to take it off from the
							tenants—to leave it on the Landlords, and on the funds reducing it to
							five per Cent— This would yield about six Millions— He would take six
							Millions more from the sinking fund, and five Millions from what were
							called the War taxes— This would form an establishment of about
							seventeen Millions. More could not be necessary— There never was a
							period when a small peace establishment could have been more safe and
							easy than at this time. Never a period when the Country was in such
							perfect security— The army was for some years to be maintained by
							France; there was no danger to be discerned from any quarter, and
							(laughing) your Navy (said he) is the only one now formidable to us—and
							more formidable than all the naval power in the world, beside— Seventeen
							Millions a year therefore would be sufficient for the Peace
							Establishment, and the ordinary revenue of the Country would be just
							sufficient to pay the interest of the debt. As to the sinking fund—the
							forms must be observed—it was to be left untouched in point of form, but
							loans of about six Millions every year must be made, which would
							intrench so much upon it. For the last twenty years this Country had
							been borrowing, upon an average twenty-five Millions every year— This of
							course had been collected from the savings of the People— If now from a
							borrower, the Country should suddenly become a lender, to the amount of
							eleven millions a year, it would throw back upon the People, a Mass of
							Capital, without employment, the effect of which must be to reduce the
							rate of interest— It would be, as he had known it in Holland, where he
							had seen Stocks, bearing an interest of two and a half per Cent, above
							par— He would leave about five Millions of the sinking fund still to
							operate, which would be as much as it could without inconvenience. But
							he supposed we should hear a great deal in Parliament about economy,
							(laughing) retrenchments and the like— The Ministry he said were very
							good sort of people, and <pb n="377" type="ms"/>quite pacific in their
							disposition— <persRef ref="jenkinson-robert">Lord Liverpool</persRef>
							was a very worthy, amiable man— So was <persRef ref="addington-henry2"
								>Lord Sidmouth</persRef>— There was but one very warlike man among
							them, and that was <persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Lord
							Bathurst</persRef>— It was entirely upon his suggestion that the Troops
							from Spain had been sent over to Canada. The Expedition to New-Orleans
							had been entirely a plan of his.— I said that the disposition, upon both
							sides seemed at present so pacific that I hoped we should have a long,
							and quiet Peace— I was sorry however to hear that they were increasing
							their armaments on the lakes of Canada; because arming on one side would
							make it of course necessary to arm on the other; and we had been
							disposed on the contrary to disarm there altogether— He said their
							arming was the foolishest thing in the world—for, said he we are “the
							lamb” in Canada; it is in vain for us to think of growing strong there
							in the same proportion as America— [“]But surely our Ministers will
							consent to disarm there on both sides”— I said they had always a
							sufficient security against a sudden attack upon Canada, by the exposed
							state of our Commerce— He replied that he wished the British Government
							would give us Canada, at once— It was not worth <persRef ref="yeo-james"
								>Sir James Yeo’s</persRef> hundred gun ship, and was fit for nothing
							but to breed quarrels. I mentioned to him the series of Articles in the
							Morning Chronicle, against the late commercial Convention, and after
							speaking of their character and tendency, and of the perverse ability
							with which they were written, said I was a little surprized at the
							quarter from which they came.— He had not seen the Papers; but from the
							description that I gave of them he thought he knew whence they came—
							That <persRef ref="perry-james">Perry</persRef> (Editor of the Morning
							Chronicle) had formerly been under controul; but now he was under none,
							and his main object doubtless was to worry the Ministers— He said he
							would collect the Papers and read them— On leaving M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baring I went to <persRef
								ref="williams-samuel2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S.
								Williams</persRef> N. 13. Finsbury Square Enquired the state of my
							Account with him, gave him the draft for £1500. and took a draft from
							him on <persRef ref="stephensonremingtonandsmith">Stephenson, Remington
								and Smith</persRef>, 69. Lombard Street, for £500— I shewed him the
							Letter that I lately received from <persRef ref="ludlow-gulian">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> G. Ludlow</persRef>, at New-York, and
							asked him to procure the power to receive the October dividend— I
							enquired the present price of American six per Cent Stocks— He said
							there were no Sellers; but 83 1/2 had been offered, for them yesterday—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baring had told me the same thing.
							Baring added that his house had received Letters from the United States,
							from various quarters at the same time; to buy for them and hold the
							Stocks— On the calculation that they would rise— He said they probably
							would rise— But he thought the exchange upon this Country would rise
							too— That it would be at a considerable advance even for specie.
							American goods here were very flat— Cottons would fetch scarcely any
							price at-all— Tobacco had sold very well, but there was none. The
							exports from this Country to America, had very largely exceeded the
							imports— The American Market was indeed now very fully supplied, and the
							demands had in a great measure ceased— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Williams too, doubted whether the American Stocks would rise much— He
							said the french Stocks now yielded eight per Cent— But French Stocks are
							funded upon a Volcano— I asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams
							if he knew any thing of a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Nickels</persRef>, who some time since borrowed of me a
							document a Judicial opinion of <persRef ref="davis-john">Judge
								Davis</persRef> of Boston; and has not returned it— He said he had
							seen him about ten days since, but knew not where he lodged, or where he
							was to be found. He had failed in the application for the restoration of
							his vessel, but had been informed, that he might perhaps obtain the
							half, that came as a droit of Admiralty to the Crown— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams gave me some Papers of a similar
							case, the ship General Gates, captured 26. May 1812. under the orders in
							Council. The Trial suspended, being detained subsequent to the 20<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May; but condemned to the Captor, 4.
								Nov<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> 1812 in consequence of the War.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams said he put these papers
							into my hands as he had been requested; though he had no expectation
							that any thing could be done for the owners, and had written so to them.
							He told me that he had sent to my Office in Craven Street, some Letters
							for me, which had been brought by <persRef ref="tarbell-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tarbell</persRef>. I called at
								<persRef ref="lackington-george">Lackington’s</persRef> to enquire
							for <persRef ref="chalmers-george">Chalmers’s</persRef> Political Annals
							of the Colonies, and <persRef ref="adair-james">Adair’s</persRef>
							History of the Indians, which <persRef ref="plumer-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Plumer</persRef> had
							written to request me to procure for him; but they had neither of the
							Books— Went to the Bankers N. 69. Lombard Street, and took up M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams’s draft, that is, the money upon
							it. Thence proceeded to the Office in Craven Street. It was five O’Clock
							when I arrived there I sent the Carriage, to put up the horses at their
							owner’s, for an hour, and walked there, at the expiration of the time.—
								<persRef ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> had sent from the Office, to the three penny
							Post-Office, a Note from Lord Castlereagh. While I was there the Letters
							brought by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tarbell and which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams had sent me, arrived— They were
							from <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef>, <persRef
								key="adams-abigail">mother</persRef> and <persRef key="adams-thomas"
								>brother</persRef>, to myself and to all the family. M<hi

							me also some papers left by a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi>
								<pb n="378" type="ms"/>Fead</persRef>— A grant of Lands in

							is now dead, and his Son applies to know if he can have the Land. I took
							the papers with me, to see if I could find any thing on the Subject in

							Birnie, advising her to ask him to recommend her to <persRef

							marry her, was <persRef ref="laymore-thomas">Thomas Laymore</persRef>—
							That he had been Captain’s Steward of a merchant vessel, and here a
							waiter at an Inn. The woman who came with her said that she was now
							living with her; but totally destitute of all means of support— She
							herself was the wife only of a labouring man, and could not maintain her
							long.— I went to <persRef ref="u">Williams</persRef> the Stationers at

								<persRef ref="u;u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi

							Estate of about 4000 dollars, did upon his death-bed declare to him,
							Braun, that he had a <persRef ref="u">wife</persRef> and children living

							had a daughter, by a former husband, whose Son, named <persRef ref="u"

							to a house at Altena; claiming a portion himself as joint-legatee, which
							he says Czeyka promised him as a reward for this service— Upon the

							miles out of town— They said it was the custom; I said there was no such

							favour, but it was not the usage— I told him I asked no favours—nothing
							but my right— If the Bill was not accepted I should protest it— He asked
							me if I was the person to whom the Bill was payable— I told him I was—
							He said, I was a very rude man— I came at improper hours (It was between
							three and four O’Clock.) They had hundreds of such Bills presented,
							every day. I told him I cared not how many Bills they had presented to
							them. I had but one, and if they did not accept it I would protest it— I
							offered to leave the Bill if they would send it to me to-morrow— He
							pettishly refused to send it to me— I repeated that I would protest the

							now what I say— The Bill is a good Bill— I took the Bill and came away.
							But I knew not where to find a Notary; and the Clock struck four, before

							reflection I cannot acquit myself of having been hasty and peremptory,
							when by mildness and complacency, I might have got the Bill accepted,
							and saved myself, all further trouble.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							is going to France upon that business. His brother who has heretofore
							been Printer to the University of Cambridge, is now establishing the
							Stereotype printing in London—Picket Street, near Temple Bar— In about
							two months he expects to have his works complete, and promised me he
							would then shew them to me— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Watts is
							to return here, from France, and to go out the next Fall to America— The
								<persRef ref="colburn-abia">father</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="colburn-zerah">Zerah Colburn</persRef>, the innate
							Arithmetician from Vermont came to ask for money to bring him over here
							from France— He is now at the Polytechnic School, but <persRef
								ref="bridges-george">Alderman Bridges</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="crombie-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crombie</persRef>, and I know not who, have perswaded the father
							that he must bring him over here, and raise a subscription of £300
							Sterling a year, for six years to educate the boy until 17. and to
							maintain the father here in the meantime. So the father has written to
							him to come over, and has received for answer, that he, cannot come,
							until his first suit of Clothes made for him as a scholar at the
							Polytechnic school have been paid for— And for this purpose Colburn the
							father wants five hundred franks— I told him that I saw no sufficient
							reason for bringing the boy here. He, the father had been extremely
							anxious to obtain admission for him at the Polytechnic school; when I
							saw him at Paris last Spring— I had then highly approved of that
							arrangement and saw no prospect either of advantage to the boy or of
							benefit to the public by taking him away and bringing him here. I did
							not believe he would obtain a subscription of £300 a year for six years,
							nor of half the money; and if he brought him here, under such an
							expectation he would only be disappointed, and lose the opportunity for
							his son’s education which he now enjoyed. He said he was not at all
							concerned about that, for alderman Bridges had told him he would
							subscribe five guineas a year himself and had promised to get as many as
							twenty more subscribers— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crombie would
							get eight or ten, and so forth— I told him he would find he was leaning
							upon a broken reed, if he relied upon such promises— And at any rate I
							could not help him to the money he wanted If a subscription of £300 a
							year, for six years, could so easily be raised to educate his son and
							maintain himself there could be no difficulty in raising £20. to bring
							him here— I could neither approve nor lend my hand for any part of the
							expedient— He left me, complaining that since he had discovered his
							son’s mind; it had been nothing to him but a source of constant
							misfortunes— But the reason of that is that instead of availing himself
							of the liberality and benevolence of those who have contributed for the
							education of the boy; he has been, and is yet endeavouring to make it
							the means of raising money for his own support or emolument— And for
							that purpose has practiced delusion upon the public—particularly by the
							pretence of publishing a book, which is to contain the secret of his
							Son’s process of calculation.— These visitors engaged me until four
							O’Clock— I left with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith the despatches
							and Letters for America; to be taken this Evening to the New-England
							Coffee-house, and go thence in a bag to Liverpool— The weather and roads
							were so bad that I did not walk any part of the way home— We reached
							home about six— After dinner, the boys finished reading the Mid summer
							Night’s dream.</p>

						<p><date>25. V: </date>I gave up this morning to the business of the day,
							and having a variety of Subjects upon which I wished to confer with
								<persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, I made
							a minute of the principal points to be borne in mind—classing them under
							ten different heads; and to preserve the order of them, arranged them
							alphabetically— Fixing upon a word which would immediately remind me of
							the whole subject— The initials of the word proceeding successively from
							A. to J— This was an application of the Principles of a technical memory
							which I had never made before, and which for a first attempt succeeded,
							not completely; but beyond my expectation— I have often experienced
							inconvenience in conferences of this kind, by forgetting while engaged
							in the conversation upon some of the topics, for which I had proposed
							the interview, others perhaps of equal importance; or at least
							observations that before the meeting, I had intended to make, and which
							after the meeting I regretted to have omitted. I did not entirely escape
							the second of these maladdresses, but had less of it than I have often
							experienced; and none of the principal topics were omitted— In one
							instance the order of my arrangement was discomposed, much to my own
							satisfaction; for as it was a Subject upon which my instructions were to
							feel the pulse of this Government without committing my own, I was under
							some embarrassment how to introduce it— But it had an incidental
							connection with another Subject which I had classed in order before it,
							and as <pb n="383" type="ms"/>I was to disclose explicitly my
							Instructions on the first point (Florida) and to speak entirely from
							myself on the other (South America) I had separated them with an
							interval of two others between them— But in the midst of our discussion
							of the former, Lord Castlereagh himself introduced the latter, and more
							than compensated for the inroad upon my arrangement, by relieving me
							from the aukwardness of entering upon most delicate and difficult matter
							upon which I was to treat. I did not lose by this incident the clue of
							my alphabetical arrangement, which though in appearance whimsical, I
							found decidedly useful— I went into town immediately after breakfast,
							and was at Lord Castlereagh’s door at half past eleven—the hour that he
							had appointed for the meeting— I sent away the Carriage, with orders to
							come for me to Craven Street at four— I was detained, not five minutes
							in the Antichamber, where I saw a young man, I suppose a private
							Secretary but not <persRef ref="planta-joseph">Planta</persRef>. Lord
							Castlereagh immediately received me in his Library— He began upon the
							dampness and foulness of the weather— Then enquired whether I resided in
							town— Said <persRef ref="stewart-amelia">Lady Castlereagh</persRef> had
							made enquiries for <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams</persRef>, but was informed we
							were still in the Country.— I enquired if he had any Accounts this
							morning from the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef>, who
							is laid up at Brighton, with the Gout— He said the Prince was now free
							from Pain and recovering— But it had become at last after shifting about
							for several days, a regular attack; and as it had left him weak, his
							medical attendants had advised that Parliament, which is to sit on the
							first of February, should be opened by Commission, and that the Prince
							should remain ten days or a fortnight longer at Brighton, before coming
							to Town.— He said the Prince had exposed himself to the damp weather in
							going round with him, to shew him the place; (the new Pavilion at
							Brighton) and afterwards to the <persRef ref="charlotte2"
								>Queen</persRef>, when she came. The Gout had been some days
							unsettled; but had finally fixed, and the attack while it lasted had
							been sharp— We now entered upon the subjects for which I had requested
							the interview, and I shall give the dialogue to the best of my
							recollection as it passed; distinguishing the speakers respectively by
							the initials of their names— A. I have observed by the Public papers
							that your Lordship has received the Ratification by the <persRef
								ref="madison-james">President of the United States</persRef>, of the
							Commercial Convention concluded in July last— C. Yes—and the
							Ratifications may be exchanged in a few days . . . or . . . I believe
							they were exchanged there; at Washington. . . A. That was what I wished
							to enquire of your Lordship—having myself no advices from my Government,
							since the Ratification— C.—Yes—the Ratifications were exchanged there—
							A. At the time when that Convention was concluded, the Full-Powers of
							the <persRef ref="clay-henry;gallatin-albert">American
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef> were much more extensive than the
							objects upon which it was found the parties could then come to an
							agreement; and as my two Colleagues were shortened for time, and anxious
							to return to America; it was thought best to conclude what we could then
							adjust, and notice was given by us, that further proposals might
							afterwards be brought forward by me—for negotiation.— The <persRef
								ref="robinson-frederick;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef> told us that their powers would be
							terminated by the Convention then signed; and in case of a further
							Negotiation they did not know whether it would be committed to them. I
							then informed them, that I should not propose any thing further, without
							new Instructions from my Government, and in that case, should address
							myself through the regular channel of the Foreign Department— Since then
							I have received Instructions directing me to make proposals for
							arrangements which I presumed could be settled only in the form of a
							Treaty— Other proposals of negotiation had been made, in the course of
							my Correspondence here, during your Lordships absence in France, by
								<persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Lord Bathurst</persRef>; I wished
							therefore now to enquire, what are the Views of His Majesty’s Government
							in this respect— Whether they are disposed to enter upon a new
							Negotiation—and if they are whether they will consider the Full Power
							heretofore produced by my Colleagues and me as competent for concluding
							an additional Treaty; or will they expect me to produce a new Power— And
							whether I shall treat with the same British Plenipotentiaries with whom
							we treated before; or with your Lordship— C. Yes—I remember we thought
							it best then, for restoring harmony and good Understanding between the
							parties, to get along as far as we could at that time agree; and to
							postpone every thing, upon which the different views of the two sides
							precluded an agreement— Our dispositions are now the same—we have with
							the utmost sincerity the desire to preserve and cultivate Peace and
							Harmony with you— But what are the subjects upon which you would propose
							a further Negotiation? A— Several—the first and most important is that
							relating to Seamen—Impressment—A Subject which had heretofore been the
							greatest cause of the unfortunate differences between the two Countries;
							about which there is much anxiety in America, and to which the attention
							of the Government of the United States is yet strongly rivetted, as
							appears by the President’s last Message to Congress, in which he again
							recommends a law for confining the Navigation of American Vessels to
							American Seamen— C. Why, your Government is taking the right measures
							for removing <pb n="384" type="ms"/>the grounds of those differences,
							and I am glad to see it— By encouraging your own Seamen which is
							certainly a wise and proper policy— But it is a question to be
							considered, whether such measures as these tending to take away the
							cause of dissension, will not be more effectual as a practical remedy
							for the evil, than any arrangement which could be made by Treaty— The
							British Government, are and always have been ready and willing to
							discuss any proposal that can be offered, for an arrangement by Treaty;
							but the Views as to the Right, of the two Governments, are so opposite—
							The popular feeling is so strong, and so irritable, on your side in one
							direction, and on ours in the other, that while there is no practical
							operation of the inconvenience, perhaps it is not the best time, for any
							formal stipulation concerning it— A. There is another point of view, in
							which the present may be considered as the best time for an arrangement;
							as being a time, when the Passions on neither side will be interested to
							take part against it— A Time of Peace when the whole subject may be
							considered coolly, and no irritable feeling would mingle with the
							discussion— C. The public feeling on this subject is yet very keen— It
							will be better to wait for the effect of the full disclosure of the
							Policy of Your Government— It is a change from its policy heretofore,
							when foreign Seamen were rather invited and encouraged into your
							Service, and undoubtedly you had a very large body of British Seamen in
							your Ships— If the Law passes and is carried into effect, of confining
							your Navigation to your own Seamen, we shall have no occasion for taking
							our Men from your ships, because there will be none to take. We shall
							always be ready to make such regulations as may guard the exercise of
							our rights from abuses. A— The Policy of the Government of the United
							States cannot be said to be changed— They have not indeed heretofore <hi
								rend="italic">excluded</hi> foreign Seamen from our Service, but
							they were never encouraged or invited into it— Whatever number of
							British Seamen there may have been it, were led to it by their own
							inclinations— C. At least your former Colleague M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin told me that your Government had <hi rend="italic"
								>latterly</hi> determined to pursue the policy of encouraging your
							own Seamen— A. But, My Lord, even this may be counteracted by the
							British Government— Since the discharge of the British Navy, it has been
							alledged that great numbers of your Seamen, have gone into foreign
							Services— Many to the Russian; many to the American; I know not what
							foundation there may be for this; but it is notorious that you have vast
							numbers of Seamen out of employ, and I have received two official
							requisitions from you, to send home from London and Liverpool, destitute
							American Seamen, most of whom came from your naval service, and many of
							whom have no proofs of being Americans— The second Requisition came to
							me, without any reply to the Answer, I had given to the first— I
							concluded that your Lordship had not seen my answer— I stated in it that
							many of the distressed American Seamen, who were according to the
								<persRef ref="wood-matthew">Lord Mayor’s</persRef> Representation,
							wandering about the Streets of London, had just been discharged from the
							British Naval Service, and had stronger claims for relief from the
							British than from the American Government— That others, had claims for
							small pensions from this Government, and if they went to America, were
							compelled to sell their annuities for two years purchase— I had
							represented that I thought, if those Persons were to be sent to America,
							Great-Britain ought to furnish them the means of receiving their
							Pensions there— I had also alledged that the Lord Mayor’s representation
							was in general terms—<hi rend="italic">numbers</hi> of American Seamen,
							and that when I was required to send Americans home, they must be named,
							and some proof given that they are really Americans— C. I have not seen
							your Note on this subject; for it was received while I was in the
							Country— But certainly these are very fair, and proper subjects for
							consideration— I will attend to them— It was impossible that so large a
							body of men, as was discharged from the British Navy, amounting to Sixty
							or Seventy thousand, should be thrown at once out of employment, without
							some inconveniences— London and Liverpool being our two principal
							Sea-ports, an extraordinary proportion of them naturally resorted there;
							and for a time there were multitudes who could not find employment—many
							became burdensome upon the public. But commerce is now very flourishing;
							those People are gradually finding employment, and the incumbrance which
							they have occasioned was very temporary, and has nearly passed over— The
							note founded upon the Lord Mayor’s Representation was a circular to the
							foreign Ministers— And the statement from the <persRef
								ref="barton-william4">Mayor of Liverpool</persRef> was of a number
							of Americans who had become burdensome to the Parish— A.— Yes, My Lord,
							the number mentioned was twenty-six— I immediately wrote to the <persRef
								ref="maury-james">American Consul</persRef>, requesting him to take
							measures for ascertaining who they were, and what their claims were as
							Americans— I have his answer— Of the twenty-six, sent by the Mayor to
							his Office, only nineteen presented themselves; and he had no means of
							compelling the attendance of the others— Of the nineteen, only five had
							any document of any sort, to shew that they were Americans.— It is
							obvious therefore that if I am required to send to the United States
							every Man who calls himself an American Seaman in distress, the chances
							would be that numbers of British Seamen might find their way there,
							contrary to the intentions of both Governments— C. I will attend to the
							subject; and take the sense of the Government upon it— As to the
							question respecting your Power; if you declare that your Government
							considers that heretofore produced by you, as yet in force, and you
							treat under Instructions from them, I should not suppose there would be
							any necessity for you to produce a new Power— A. The next subject, upon
							which I am directed to consult with His Majesty’s Government, relates to
							Canada; another source of disagreement heretofore; and which may be one
								<pb n="385" type="ms"/>of great and frequent animosities here after,
							unless guarded against by the vigilance, firmness and decidedly pacific
							dispositions of the two Governments— There are tendencies to continual
							dissensions, and even acts of hostility in that quarter, proceeding from
							three causes—the Indians—the temper of the British local authorities;
							and the British Armaments on the Lakes— The Post of Michillimackinac was
							surrendered, not immediately after the Peace; nor until late in the
							Summer, and some of the British Officers in Upper Canada, were so far
							from entering into the Spirit of their Government, which had in
							substance made a Peace for the Indians, that they took no small pains to
							instigate the Indians to a continuance of hostilities against the United
							States— The consequence was that it remained long doubtful whether the
							Indians in that quarter would accept the Peace that had been secured for
							them. <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe</persRef> represented these Circumstances in a Letter to
								<persRef ref="baker-anthony">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker</persRef>— I was instructed to repeat the representation here;
							and had interviews with <persRef ref="jenkinson-robert">Lord
								Liverpool</persRef> and Lord Bathurst for that purpose— They both
							gave me the strongest assurances that the intentions of this Government
							were sincerely pacific, and its earnest wish had been that the Indians
							should agree to the Peace— That no detention of Michillimackinac had
							been authorised by its orders, and no instigation of the Indians against
							the United States had been warranted by it— The fort was surrendered in
							July, and as soon as the Indians found they would not be supported by
							Great-Britain in War, they manifested a readiness for Peace, and I
							believe it has been with the tribes in that direction generally
							accomplished. Other and more recent instances however of an unpleasant
							nature have occurred— A <persRef ref="vidal-alexander">British
								Officer</persRef>, pursued, took and carried away from the Territory
							of the United States a Deserter from his Corps— The Officer himself was
							afterwards arrested within the American Jurisdiction, tried; and owing
							to the absence of a principal witness, was convicted only of a Riot, and
							moderately fined— An <persRef ref="akockis">Indian</persRef> with a
							party trespassing on the property of an American Citizen, at Gros Isle,
							was killed in a boat, in the act of levelling his own musket, at the
							American— And although this happened on the American Territory, the
								<persRef ref="james-reginald">British Commandant</persRef> at Malden
							offered a reward of 400 dollars, to any person for apprehending the man,
							who had killed the Indian.— An American merchant Vessel upon Lake Erie
							has also been fired upon by a British armed Vessel.— But a Circumstance
							of still more importance is the increase of the British Armaments since
							the Peace, on the Canadian Lakes— Such Armaments on one side, render
							similar and counter-armaments indispensible on the other— Both
							Governments must thus be subjected to a heavy, and in time of Peace a
							useless expence; and every additional armament creates new and very
							dangerous incitements to irritation, and acts of hostility— The American
							Government anxious above all for the preservation of Peace, have
							authorised me to propose a reduction of the armaments upon the Lakes, on
							both sides— The extent of this reduction, the President leaves, at the
							pleasure of Great-Britain, observing, that the greater it is, the more
							it will conform to his preference, and that it would best of all suit
							the United States if the Armaments should be confined to what is
							necessary for the protection of the revenue— C. Does your Government
							mean to include in this proposition, the destruction of the ships
							already existing there? As to keeping a number of armed vessells,
							parading about upon the lakes, in time of Peace, it would be ridiculous,
							and absurd— There can be no motive for it, and every thing beyond what
							is necessary to guard against smuggling is calculated only to produce
							mischief— The proposition you make is very fair, and so far as it
							manifests pacific dispositions, I assure you will meet with the
							sincerest reciprocal Dispositions of this Government— I will submit the
							proposal to their Consideration— But you know, we are the weaker party
							there— Therefore it was that we proposed at Ghent, that the whole lakes,
							should belong to one party— All the shores—for then, armaments would not
							have been necessary— Then, there would have been a large and wide
							natural separation between the two Territories; and those, I think are
							the best, and most effectual to preserve Peace. A. But the proposition
							at Ghent to which we objected was, that the disarming should be all on
							one side— There was indeed afterwards intimated to us by the British
							Plenipotentiaries, an intention to make us a proposal, so fair and
							reasonable, that it was thought no objection could be made against it—
							We did suppose that it was this identical proposition, which I am now
							authorized to make— It was not however brought forward— Nor was any
							explanation given by the British Plenipotentiaries of what they had
							intended by their offer. My Instructions now do not explicitly authorize
							me to include in the agreement to keep up no armament, the destruction
							of the vessels already there; but if this Government assents to the
							Principle, there will be ample time to concert mutually all the details.
							What I could <pb n="386" type="ms"/>now agree to, would be to have no
							armed force, actually out upon the Lakes, and to build no new Vessels.
							C. It so happened that just at the close of the War, we were obliged to
							make extraordinary exertions there, and to build a number of new
							Vessels, to maintain our footing there. A— But it is the new Armaments,
								<hi rend="italic">since the Peace</hi>, which have necessarily drawn
							the attention of my Government. C. You have so much the advantage of us,
							by being there, immediately on the spot, that you can always arm, in a
							shorter time than we can be prepared for defence. A— The stipulation to
							keep, or build no new armed force during the Peace, would therefore be
							in favour of Great-Britain; because, the very act of arming would then
							be an act of hostility. C. That is, there could be no arming until the
							War actually commenced; and then you would have such an advance of Time
							upon us by your position, that we should not stand upon an equal
							footing, for defence. A. Still the operation of the engagement, would be
							in favour of Great-Britain— We should have our hands tied until the
							moment of actual War— A State which it is impossible should suddenly
							arise, on our part— It is impossible that War should be commenced by us,
							without a previous State of things, which would give ample notice to
							this Country to be prepared— She might then have every thing in
							readiness to commence her armaments upon the Lakes, at the same moment
							with us, and we should be deprived of the advantage arising from our
							local position. C. Well—I will propose it to the Government for
							Consideration— A— At the other extremity of the United States, the
							Indians occur again, in an unpleasant manner— A certain <persRef
								ref="nicholls-edward">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Nicolls</persRef>, undertook, after the Peace, to make a Treaty
							Offensive and defensive and a Treaty of Navigation and Commerce, with
							some runaway Indians, whom he chose to style the Creek Nation and he
							formally notified these Treaties to the Agent of the United States with
							the Creeks, adding that he should hear more of them when they should be
							ratified here— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe complained of this
							conduct of Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Nicolls, in a Letter to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker— I was instructed to make the
							same complaint here— I mentioned it to Lord Bathurst, who in the most
							candid and explicit manner <hi rend="italic">verbally</hi>, disavowed to
							me the proceedings of Nicolls— He said that Nicolls had made a pretended
							Treaty Offensive and defensive with the Indians, and had even brought
							some of the Indians; but that he, Lord Bathurst had answered that
							assuredly no such Treaty would be ratified or sanctioned by the
							Government— I had given my own Government information of this assurance,
							which I knew would give them the highest satisfaction— I mentioned the
							same affair in a Letter to Lord Bathurst, of which no written notice has
							been taken— Whether any more formal disavowal of Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Nicolls’s proceedings has been given, in
							answer to the complaint through M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker, I
							do not know; but I speak of it now, because by the President’s Message,
							I perceive that the conduct of the Indians in that part of the United
							States, still threatens hostilities, and because there as in the more
							Northern parts, the Indians will certainly be disposed to tranquility
							and Peace, unless they have encouragement to rely upon the support of
							Great-Britain— C. I have no such Treaties as those you mention, among
							those that I am to carry down to Parliament. A— This affair has given
							the more concern to the Government of the United States, because they
							have received strong and confident intimations from various quarters,
							that there had been a Cession of Florida, by Spain to Great-Britain— C.
							As to that, I can set you at ease at once— There is not, and never has
							been the slightest foundation for it, whatsoever— It never has even been
							mentioned. A. Your Lordship knows that such rumours have been long in
							circulation, and that the fact has been positively and very
							circumstantially asserted in your own public Journals. C. Yes, but our
							public Journals are <hi rend="italic">so</hi> addicted to <hi
								rend="italic">lying</hi>!— No! if it is supposed that we have any
							little, trickish policy of thrusting ourselves in, there between you and
							Spain, we are very much misunderstood indeed— You shall find nothing
							little, or shabby, in our policy. We have no desire to add an inch of
							ground to our territories in any part of the world— We have as much as
							we know how to manage— There is not a spot of ground upon the globe that
							I would annex to our Territories, if it were offered to us to-morrow. A—
							What your views, in that respect may be generally, we do not think it
							our province to enquire, but we did think that with dominions so
							extensive and various as those of Great Britain she could not wish for
							such an acquisition as that of Florida, unless for purposes unfriendly
							to the United States, and hence it was that these rumours have given
							concern to the American Government— I am sure they will receive with
							much pleasure the assurance given me by your Lordship, that no such
							Cession has been made. C. None whatever. . . It has never been
							mentioned; and if it had, it would have been decisively declined by us.—
							Military positions may have been taken by us, during the War, of places
							which you had taken from Spain; but we never intended to keep them— Do
							you only observe the same Moderation— If we should find you hereafter
							pursuing a system of encroachment upon your neighbours, what we might
							do, defensively, is another Consideration. . . A. I do not precisely
							understand what your Lordship intends by this advice of moderation— The
							United States have no design of encroachment upon their neighbours, or
							of exercising any injustice towards Spain— C— You may be sure that
							Great-Britain has no design of acquiring any addition to her possessions
							there— Great-Britain has done every thing for Spain— We have saved, we
							have delivered her— We have restored her Government to her, and we had
							hoped that the result would have proved more advantageous to herself as
							well as more useful to the world than it has been— We are sorry that the
							Event, has not altogether answered our expectations— We lament the
							unfortunate situation of her internal Circumstances; owing to which we
							are afraid that she can neither exercise her own powers for the comfort
							and happiness of the Nation, nor avail herself of her resources for the
							effectual exertion of her Power— We regret this, but we have no
							disposition or desire to take advantage of this State of things to
							obtain <pb n="387" type="ms"/>from it any exclusive privilege for
							ourselves— In the unfortunate troubles of her Colonies in South-America,
							we have not only avoided to seek, but we have declined every exclusive
							indulgence or privilege to ourselves— We went even so far as to offer to
							take upon us that most unpleasant and thankless of all offices, that of
							mediating between the parties to those differences. We appointed a
							formal mission for that purpose, who proceeded to Madrid; but there the
							Court of Spain declined accepting our offer; and we have had the fortune
							of displeasing both the parties, by refusing to interfere in support of
							either— A.— The policy of the American Government, towards Spain, has
							been hitherto precisely the same— They have not indeed made any offer of
							their mediation, because the state of the relations between them and the
							Spanish Government neither warranted, nor admitted of such an offer— But
							they have observed the same system of impartial neutrality between the
							parties— They have sought no peculiar, or exclusive advantage for the
							United States, and I am happy to hear from your Lordship, that such is
							the policy of Great-Britain, as that of the United States may and
							probably will be influenced by it, and co-operate with it— C— I have
							always avowed it to be our policy, in Parliament. We have never
							acknowledged the Governments of the South-Americans, because that would
							not have comported with <hi rend="italic">our</hi> views of neutrality.
							But we have never prohibited the commerce of our People with them,
							because that was what Spain had no right to require of us— Our plan in
							offering the mediation which Spain rejected was that the South-Americans
							should submit themselves to the Government of Spain, as Colonies,
							because we thought she had the right to authority over them, as the
							mother Country— But that she should allow them commerce with other
							Nations— Nothing exclusive to us—we neither asked nor could have
							accepted any exclusive privileges for ourselves— We have no little or
							contracted policy— But we proposed that Spain should allow a <hi
								rend="italic">liberal</hi>, commercial intercourse, between her
							Colonies and other Nations, similar to that which we allow in our
							possessions in India. A. And what does your Lordship think will be the
							ultimate issue of this struggle in South-America? that Spain will subdue
							them, or that they will maintain their Independence? C. Every thing is
							so fluctuating in the Councils of Spain, and generally every thing is so
							dependent upon Events not to be calculated, that it is not possible to
							say what the result may be. Our policy must be founded upon the actual
							state of things, and be shaped according to Events as they may happen.—
							A. There is another Subject, not indeed for discussion upon a new
							Treaty, but relating to the Execution of that of Ghent, upon which my
							Instructions are very urgent. . . C. Stay. . . Let me take a minute of
							what we have been speaking about. . . There were . . . the
							Seamen-Impressment . . . and the Notes, on the distressed Seamen, now at
							London and Liverpool . . . Canada; and the proposal to disarm . . .
								Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Nicolls. . . There was something
							else, was there not?. . . A— Only my question, as to the Full-Power. . .
							C. Ah! Yes. . . (and after making the minute on the paper) As to what I
							have said to you with regard to Spain, and the situation of her internal
							affairs and the conduct of her Government, I have spoken with the most
							perfect freedom and openness; I wish you therefore to understand it as
							confidential; and if you report it to your Government, to give it as
							such. A. Certainly, My Lord, and I wish what I have said to you on the
							Subject, to be also received as confidential. . . The subject on which I
							wish now to urge the further Consideration of this Government, relates
							to the Slaves— There are three branches of it, which have formed points
							of discussion between the two Governments— First the Slaves carried away
							from the United States by the British Commanders, contrary, as the
							American Government holds to the express stipulation of the Treaty of
							Ghent— It was complained of by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker— I spoke of it to your
							Lordship, before you went to France— I afterwards addressed a Letter to
							you concerning it; to which I have received an answer from Lord
							Bathurst— It came to me at a time when I was confined by illness, and
							for several weeks could not write— I have not yet replied to it, but
							shall shortly. . . It seems indeed to intimate that this Government has
							taken its final determination, on the matter . . . but I hope it is not
							so . . . I hope they will give it further Consideration— It has given so
							much anxiety to my Government— It is urged so constantly and so
							earnestly in my Instructions—the language of the Treaty, appears to us
							so clear, and unequivocal—the violation of it in the carrying away of
							the Slaves so manifest; and the losses of property occasioned by it to
							our Citizens, is so considerable and so serious, that I cannot abandon
							the hope that you will give it further consideration, and ultimately to
							the United States, Satisfaction. C— I have not seen the Correspondence
							that has passed relating to it— I will have it looked up; and examine
							it. (he made a minute of it, on his paper.) A. There is a special
							Representation concerning eleven Slaves taken away from a <persRef
								ref="downman-raleigh">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Downman</persRef>, by the violation of a flag of truce sent ashore
							by <persRef ref="barrie-robert">Captain Barrie</persRef>. I have also
							received from Lord Bathurst, an answer to this complaint, to which I
							shall reply— The answer states that the <pb n="388" type="ms"/>complaint
							was referred to Captain Barrie, to report upon it, and gives the
							substance of Captain Barrie’s Report.— It does not disprove any of the
							facts alledged by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Downman— But Captain
							Barrie was himself the person who sent the flag of truce, and
							responsible for the violation if it— As a general principle, it can
							scarcely be expected that Satisfaction for an injury can ever be
							obtained, if the report of the person upon whom it is charged is
							received as a conclusive answer to the complaint. C— I suppose the
							complaint itself was only the allegation of an individual; and naturally
							reference must be made to the officer complained of for his answer to
							the charge. A— The documents that I furnished in Downman’s case, did not
							consist of his allegations only— There are affidavit’s of several other
							persons— Taken indeed ex parte, because they could not be taken
							otherwise— But they are full, and strong to the points, both of the
							violation of the flag, and of the carrying away of the Slaves. C. I do
							not know how we could proceed otherwise; unless, if the matter were of
							sufficient importance, a Commissioner from each of the two Governments
							might be authorized to examine . . . but I have not seen the papers. . .
							I will look into them. A. The other point, concerning Slaves, relates to
							the charge contained in the Instructions from the American Secretary of
							State to the Plenipotentiaries at Ghent, that Sales had been made in the
							West Indies, of Slaves taken in the United States— C. I do not think it
							was possible— The law prohibits it expressly— A— I am not now speaking
							with regard to the fact, but respecting the allegation of it— On the
							publication of the Instructions, the British Plenipotentiaries, applied
							to those of the United States, for the Evidence in support of the
							charge— <persRef ref="cochrane-alexander">Admiral Cochrane</persRef>
							addressed a Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe containing
							the same requisition— There was a Correspondence on the Subject, between
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Baker, and it was noticed here in Parliament— As the charge
							itself had been made in the midst of the War, the American Government
							had not expected that it would be a subject of discussion after the
							Peace— And as it involved many circumstances of an unpleasant nature and
							irritating tendency, they would have preferred that as between the two
							Governments it should be by mutual consent laid aside, and nothing
							further said about it— At the same time they were ready to communicate
							such Evidence, as they could collect, of the fact; if that course should
							be preferred by this Government— I made the proposal of both
							alternatives last Summer to the Earl of Liverpool, who appeared to
							prefer that the Evidence should be produced— I have now received a
							considerable mass of it, and if your Lordship also thinks it the best
							course I will furnish copies of it— But I would rather repeat the
							proposal of dropping the subject altogether. C. So far as there may be
							any thing of an irritating Nature in it, we have no wish or intention to
							pursue the enquiry any farther— If the American Government, in the heat
							of War, and under the feelings of that State have advanced a charge upon
							our Officers, beyond what the proof of facts will bear them out, we have
							no thought or wish to carry the discussion of it into the State of
							Peace, and in that point of view would willingly dismiss it— As between
							the Governments therefore, we set it altogether aside; and assure you
							that it shall have no effect whatever on our friendly dispositions. But
							with regard to the fact, we are obliged to ask for the Evidence of it;
							because if established it affects the character of our officers, and the
							observance of our Laws— Perhaps it may be well, if you and <persRef
								ref="hamilton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hamilton</persRef>, would go over the Evidence together— If the fact
							is ascertained, the Officers who have been guilty of it, should be
							punished; if otherwise it should be known for the vindication of their
							individual characters. A. In the charge, as made, by the American
							Secretary of State, no Individual Officer was named— In the Documents
							which I have received, several Officers are named—the Papers are
							voluminous, but I will have the copies of them made out as soon as
							possible. From one of the Papers it appears that Slaves taken as Prize,
							are actually sold. C. They are not sold as <hi rend="italic"
							>Slaves</hi>— By the Act of Parliament, all those that are taken in the
							Vessels that carry on the Slave Trade by contraband, are committed to
							the care of certain Conservators; but they are not Slaves A. The
							Documents that I possess may perhaps induce His Majesty’s Government, to
							pursue the investigation further. That which the American Government,
								<hi rend="italic">can</hi> obtain, in the places where the Sales
							were alledged to have been made, must be imperfect. It has no controul
							over the local authorities; but for a full and satisfactory
							investigation, the co-operation, of both Governments is necessary— The
							mode suggested to me, and already proposed by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker was that the
							American Government would furnish lists of the Slaves, taken, during the
							War, and in most instances the names of the Vessels, into which they
							were taken; and then. . . C. We can shew what disposal was made of them.
							Yes. I see no objection to that course. A. Another subject which I
							barely mention now, is that concerning the Fisheries— I left here a day
							or two since a Note in reply to one from Lord Bathurst, received while I
							was confined, and unable to write. C. I have received your Note and read
							it last Evening. A. I speak of it, because there was in Lord Bathurst’s
							Note a proposal to negotiate <pb n="389" type="ms"/>on this subject. C.
							Yes. . . We adhere to our Construction and Understanding in regard to
							the Treaty; because it involves our rights of territorial jurisdiction.
							But we do not wish you to be prevented from fishing, and shall readily
							enter into arrangements on this point.—* A. I have been requested to
							obtain authenticated copies, of certain papers in the Colonial Office—
							The Commission and Instructions issued to <persRef ref="dobbs-arthur"
								>Arthur Dobbs</persRef> as Governor of North-Carolina, some time
							before the American Revolution. C. Write me a private Note, mentioning
							what the Papers are, and I will speak to Lord Bathurst about it— A.
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef>, has
							lately arrived here, and will be desirous of being presented at Court,
							when the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef> returns to
							town. Will it be necessary to make a written application for that
							purpose? C. No! Bring him on the first levee-day with you to Carlton
							House. A. There may perhaps be other American Gentlemen, desirous of
							being presented. Will any application be necessary for them? C— None
							at-all. Bring them with you to the levee, and you may be always sure
							that any person presented by you will be well received.— To this I made
							my acknowledgments and took my leave, after a conference of nearly two
							hours. I walked to the Westminster Library, N 44. Jermyn Street, paid my
							annual subscription there of two guineas, and enquired for several books
							and Reviews; all of which were out, excepting two small Volumes of
								<persRef ref="foster-john3">Foster’s</persRef> Essays which I took
							with me. (* A. I wrote your Lordship a Note, respecting, a
							discrimination made in the Ports of Ireland, between British and
							American Vessels, in respect to the number of Passengers they are
							allowed to take. I received a Note from you in answer; to which I
							replied— C. Probably the regulation to which you refer may have been
							adopted before the Commercial Convention was concluded. We might however
							question the application of it to the case, as the Convention was not
							intended to interfere with any restrictions under which we may think
							proper to prevent emigration from Ireland. A. I hope I have not been and
							shall not be understood as objecting to the regulation at-all, as a
							restriction upon emigration— That must be entirely discretionary with
							the British Government. We have nothing to say about it— But it is the
							discrimination between the shipping of the two Countries, of which I
							complained— The allowance to British vessels to take five Passengers,
							for the same tonnage, which in American vessels is limited to two— I
							presume that an order to the Port-Officers, would remove the
							distinction. C. I dont know that— It may be made by act of Parliament—
							And we might question your right to consider Passengers, as Articles of
							Merchandize.— We may regard the discrimination itself, as a mode of
							restriction upon emigration. You do not want our people. A.— Not at-all.
							We increase fast enough, by the progress of our own native population.
							C. No! Our Seamen, and our People . . . you really do not want them; and
							when they <hi rend="italic">do</hi> go, you get only the worst part of
							them. A. Why, in that case, My Lord, you ought to be much obliged to us,
							for relieving you from them. C. I don’t know . . . however, we shall see
							what there is to be done.) N.B. This part of the Conference immediately
							followed that relating to the fisheries. I remained at Craven Street
							till four O’Clock— Sent <persRef ref="brant-richard">Richard</persRef>
							to engage five tickets at Covent Garden Theatre to see the Midsummer
							Night’s dream, next Monday. Read for the first time two or three
							Speeches of <persRef ref="phillips-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Charles Phillips</persRef>, a young Irish Orator, and a
							Criticism upon one of them, from the Edinburgh Review. Home about six
							O’Clock— Walked from Kew-Bridge— In the Evening I read part of Foster’s
							Essay, on a Man’s writing Memoirs of himself.— Settled the account of
							<persRef ref="messerandpage">Messer and Page</persRef>, the Coachmakers, at the Office.</p>

						<p><date>30. VIII:30. </date>The usual consequence of so late hours at
							Night; a loss almost entire of the succeeding day, for every sort of
							business— I had no morning, and accomplished nothing but a Letter to
								<persRef ref="maury-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Maury</persRef> at Liverpool, which should have been written last
							week— The weather was clear and cold, and 1 took the occasion for a
							longer walk than I have taken for several days, and also to pay a visit
							to my neighbour <persRef ref="dumouriez-charles">General
								Dumouriez</persRef>— We had much conversation, upon various topics.
							He appears to have abandoned his expectations, of being recalled to take
							upon him the administration of affairs in France, and he disapproves of
							what has been done and is doing there. His opinions with regard to the
							future, I think erroneous— He says there will be a great and concerted
							Insurrection there, within two or three Months “Et tout sera perdu; et
							là, et dans lereste de l’Europe— There is however no positive confidence
							to be given, that this is his real opinion. He spoke in the highest
							terms of the <persRef ref="louis-philippe">Duke of Orleans</persRef>,
							who, he said was a parfaitement honnête homme, of whom he boasted as of
							his Eleve, and whom he said he now saw every week. The Duke he said
							sometimes came to see him, and sometimes sent his carriage for him. The
							Duke had given him the fullest account of his own proceedings; of the
							motive upon which he had come over to England last, and of his still
							remaining here; all which he repeated over to me— The causes of it
							were—1. The general Jealousy, of all the reigning part of the Bourbon
							family against him— 2. The special jealousy of the <persRef
								ref="marietheresecharlotte">Duchess of Angouleme</persRef> against
							him and <persRef ref="marieamalie">his wife</persRef>, for having
							children while she herself is barren. 3. The disposition of all the
							discontented people in France to make him a rallying point, and the
							danger to which he must be exposed in that situation—and 4. his
							disapprobation of the system, now pursued by the Government, which
							brought him in opposition; from the first moment when he took his seat
							in the house of Peers.— The Princes his Cousins, who were stupid,
							insignificant men, and excessively disliked, had been in point of form
							civil enough with him, and told him that although they disagreed in
							opinions, they might yet remain very good friends.— But he very wisely
							had not trusted to their assurances; but had gone candidly to the
								<persRef ref="louis-xviii">king</persRef>; told him explicitly the
							dilemma of his situation; and informed him of his wish to return to
							England— Of which the king had fully approved. Dumouriez said that
							Monsieur, had given himself up entirely to devotion; but was universally
							disliked. That the <persRef ref="louisantoine2">Duke
								d’Angouleme</persRef> was a good sort of a man, totally
							insignificant. That the <persRef ref="berri-charles">Duke de
								Berri</persRef> was a mauvais sujet, addicted to the lowest and
							vilest debauchery; and had assumed a tone with the army, which had given
							universal disgust, and that the Duchess d’Angouleme, bigotted and

						<p><date>31. VI:30. </date>My business runs into continual arrears, which I
							struggle in vain to redeem— Although I rose this morning with the dawn,
							I was able to write little before breakfast owing to the coldness of the
							weather, and left the Journal of yesterday, for hereafter. I went into
							London with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef>, who took <persRef
								ref="hauel-lucy">Lucy</persRef> with her— We paid visits to <persRef
								ref="king-charles;king-eliza">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
									M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> King</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="aspinwall-thomas;aspinwall-louisa">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Aspinwall</persRef>,
							none of whom were at home. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams had
							written to <persRef ref="hewett-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Hewlett</persRef> on Monday, that if she was disengaged
							this day, she would go and dine with her; but not having received an
							answer, she did not go. We paid a visit however to <persRef
								ref="copley-susanna;copley-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> and
								Miss Copley</persRef>, whom we found at home. I enquired for the
							picture of <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> which is still
							at the engraver’s; and mentioned the wish of <persRef
								key="adams-abigail">my Mother</persRef> to have a copy of the
							picture of <persRef ref="smith-abigail">my Sister</persRef> which
								<persRef ref="copley-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Copley</persRef> painted for M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Copley—
							She said we might have the original itself, which we saw there; but the
							draperies of it are not finished. The head is a fine picture, and an
							excellent likeness— I asked M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Copley to
							fix a price upon it, and she said she would let me know what M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Copley used to charge for pictures of that
							kind. I told her I should be glad to send my fathers Picture to America
							next Summer, and would have it taken either from the engraver’s where it
							now is, or from her house, as would be most agreeable to her. She
							preferred sending for it, and said it would probably want new
							varnishing. She complained of the engraver who had undertaken to engrave
							it, but had never finished the work, although M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Copley had paid one third part of the expence of it— I paid
							likewise a visit to <persRef ref="delafield-john2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Delafield</persRef>, who some
							time since left at the Office a card, with a letter of Introduction,
							from <persRef ref="payne-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								Payne</persRef> of Boston, who married his Aunt— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Delafield received me— He is confined to
							the house by indisposition— He is a native of New-York, and married an
								<persRef ref="u">English Lady</persRef> here in London— She appears
							to be very amiable.— On leaving them I went to the <persRef
								ref="murray-charlotte2">Countess Dowager of Dunmore’s</persRef>,
							according to appointment. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and Lucy
							left me at the Corner of Harley Street, to go and see <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Mills</persRef>. Lady Dunmore
							is the widow of the <persRef ref="murray-john4">Earl of
								Dunmore</persRef>, the last Governor of Virginia before the American
							Revolution— Her daughter, <persRef ref="murray-virginia">Lady Virginia
								Murray</persRef> was with her, and also another Lady— But the object
							of Lady Dunmore’s requesting to see me was to enquire how they must
							proceed to obtain from the State of Virginia a grant to this her
							daughter, who was born there, and to whom the whole Legislative Assembly
							had stood Godfathers— <persRef ref="washington-george"
								>Washington</persRef> had held her at the font, and the Assembly had
							then promised that they would make her fortune. Lady Virginia had a
							Letter all prepared, addressed to <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>, as Secretary of
							State, and <persRef ref="nicholas-wilson">Governor of
							Virginia</persRef>; stating all the circumstances of her Birth; of the
							request of the Assembly of Virginia to stand as her Godfather’s; of the
							name of the Province, which they gave her, and of their promise to
							appropriate a sum, and put it out at interest to accumulate until it
							should amount to a hundred thousand Pounds Sterling, and then to make a
							present of it to her. And now, her father being dead, and having left
							all his Estate to <persRef
								ref="murray-george3;murray-alexander2;murray-leveson">her
								brothers</persRef>, and nothing to her, she has no resource, but to
							claim the fulfilment of the promise by the Assembly of Virginia— This
							Letter she intended to send to her brother, now Governor of Turk’s
							Island, and get him to send it to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe.
							But she afterwards asked me to forward it, which I willingly consented
							to do— But I told her that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, though
							Secretary of State of the United States, was not now Governor of
							Virginia— That it would be necessary to alter the letter to him,
							accordingly, and perhaps it would be necessary to send another Letter of
							the same kind to the present Governor of Virginia; together with a
							formal Declaration, signed by the Countess of Dunmore, to serve as a
							proof that the promise had been made. They enquired the name of the
							present Governor of Virginia which I could not immediately tell them;
							but said I thought I could ascertain, by recurring to my Papers at home,
							and would let them know— The old Lady, who must be at least
							seventy-five, and who is so deaf that she can hear only by an
							ear-trumpet, thought it would be best not to mention the particular sum,
							because it might be thought large, especially as the Country was not in
							such prosperous circumstances, nor so rich, as when the promise was
							made— But lady Virginia, thought it would be best to specify the sum, as
							it was promised, and I told them that naming the sum could do no harm,
							as it would not prevent the grant of a smaller one, if the <pb n="392"
								type="ms"/>Legislature of Virginia should be disposed to grant any
							thing. The Countess talked much of the politeness, which was shewn to
							her by the Virginians, at the time of the Commencement of the American
							Revolution, when Lord Dunmore was obliged to leave the Country. She also
							complained much of Lady Virginia’s being left totally destitute; and
							said she had nothing to expect from her brothers.— My next call was upon
								<persRef ref="chester-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chester</persRef> in South Audley Street. I asked him, if we were to
							attend to morrow, at the opening of the Session of Parliament. He said
							no—because the Speech would be delivered by Commission. The <persRef
								ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef> being still confined in
							consequence of his fit of the gout, at Brighton— In such cases there was
							no place reserved for the foreign Ministers, and no invitation sent to
							them to attend. He said the <persRef ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef>
							was now in town, but not for the transaction of business— He thinks the
							Prince will not return to town in less than a fortnight or three weeks.—
							I mentioned to him, that I should present at the first levee, <persRef
								ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> as
							the American Secretary of Legation, and probably <persRef
								ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef>. From thence I went to
							the Office in Craven Street; and immediately walked down to the
							Foreign-Office in Downing Street, and saw the Under Secretary of State,
								<persRef ref="hamilton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hamilton</persRef>— I gave him the Commission of <persRef
								ref="luke-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James Luke</persRef>
							as Consul of the United States at Belfast. He enquired if he was an
							American, or an Englishman— I told him I did not know; but I presumed a
							British Subject. He intimated that there might be some objection to
							approving such a person as Consul, although there was none to admitting
							British Subjects as Vice-Consuls or Consular Agents. I told him that it
							was the first time that I had heard any objection of this Nature
							suggested, and reminded him that there was already the example of
								<persRef ref="fox-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fox</persRef>, the Consul at Falmouth who was an Englishman— He said
							he thought it most probable that no objection would be made— I asked
							him, if <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>,
							had said any thing to him about papers that I had mentioned having
							received relative to the sale of American Slaves by British Officers. He
							said he had not— I mentioned the repeated offers, that I had made on the
							part of the Government of the United States, to drop the subject as
							between the two Governments, and the observation made to me last week by
							Lord Castlereagh that it might perhaps be well, for M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton and me to go over the papers
							together— He said Lord Castlereagh had perhaps not then recollected,
							that the American business was not now, in his Hamilton’s division of
							the Department; but in that of <persRef ref="cooke-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cooke</persRef>; though it had
							formerly been otherwise— But it would perhaps be best to put this matter
							in to the hands of <persRef ref="goulburn-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Goulburn</persRef>— I said I only wished to do what
							would be most agreeable to this Government, and now spoke of the
							subject, only in consequence of what Lord Castlereagh had said to me. I
							mentioned M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith’s wish to obtain
							admission to hear the debates in Parliament, and he gave me a Letter for
							him to <persRef ref="tyrwhitt-thomas">Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt</persRef> the
							Usher of the Black Rod. I then returned to the Office where I found M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams, who dined there— I wrote a short
							Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Luke, and at seven O’Clock went
							and dined with the <persRef ref="delachastre-claude">Duke
								Delachatre</persRef>, the French Ambassador. He introduced me to his
							successor the <persRef ref="eustache-rene">Marquis d’Osmond</persRef>.
							They have not been yet able to obtain their Audiences of the Prince
							Regent, owing to his illness and confinement at Brighton— The company at
							dinner were twenty-three— Six Ladies—among whom the Duke Delachâtre
							Sister in Law, and <persRef ref="bourke-maria">Madame Bourke</persRef>;
							the Lady of the <persRef ref="bourke-edmund">Danish Minister</persRef>.
							He also was there, and <persRef ref="u">Count S<hi rend="superscript"
									>t:</hi> Martin d’Aglie</persRef>, the Sardinian, <persRef
								ref="vonjacobikloest-konstans">Baron Jacobi</persRef> the Prussian,
							and the <persRef ref="freire-cipriano">Chevalier de Freire</persRef> the
							Portuguese Ministers. <persRef ref="u">Ramadani</persRef> the Turkish
							Chargé d’Affairs, and <persRef ref="u">Curtoys</persRef> the Spanish
							Secretary of Embassy were also there; and a number of Frenchmen, with
							whom I had no acquaintance— A <persRef ref="demontalembert-marc">Baron
								de Montalembert</persRef> was the only one whose name I caught. He
							appeared to belong to the house— After dinner the Bavarian Minister,
								<persRef ref="pfeffel-christian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pfeffel</persRef>, with his Secretary <persRef ref="jenison-franz"
								>Count Jenison</persRef>, and the Austrian Secretary of Embassy
								<persRef ref="neumann-philipp">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Neumann</persRef> came in. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Neumann
							spoke to me, about the ships of War at Venice and Trieste, which the
							Austrian Government have, and would like to sell to the United States—
							He said <persRef ref="esterhazy-paul">Prince Esterhazy</persRef> had
							wished to speak with me, on this business; and promised to send to my
							Office, a list of the ships, and of their present Condition— The
							Chevalier de Freire, gave me many particulars of the conduct of his
							predecessor here, the <persRef ref="desousacoutinho-domingos">Count de
								Funchal</persRef>, who though recalled refused to give up his place,
							and actually kept the house of the Legation nearly a year, in defiance
							of the orders of his Government— He is now gone to Rome, upon a Mission—
							Freire says he received from Rio Janeyro a very severe reprimand for his
							conduct. He told me also, that the <persRef ref="desodre-louis"
								>Commandeur de Sodré</persRef>, whom I saw here last Summer, had run
							away with a young Lady from Paris, and had been arrested and was now in
							prison in Spain— I had also some Conversation with the Duke Delachâtre,
							who told me that he proposed not to return to France, until the Spring—
							It was near eleven O’Clock when I left the Duke’s, and went to
							Craven-Street. There I took up M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams,
								<persRef key="adams-george">George</persRef> and Lucy; we reached
							home about half-past twelve.</p>
