						<p><date>1. VI: </date>There was a violent Storm of wind and rain last

							who is quite unwell. <persRef ref="milman-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Milman</persRef> read Prayers for the twelfth Sunday

							that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And all the People shall
							say, Amen.” When I heard the text I thought it would be a political
							sermon, and it was so in part— Among the leaders astray of the blind,
							were numbered those who instigate the poor and the ignorant to sedition.
							The allusion was however incidental, and was not dwelt upon with much
							earnestness. After Church we called at <persRef ref="nicholas-george2"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas’s</persRef>, where we
							met, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fletcher</persRef>

							proposal from the Government of the United States to negotiate a

						<p><date>2. VI: </date>The gale has abated, and the weather this day was
							part of the day fair; but with the decided character of Autumn; and so
							cold that we had a fire again in the Evening. The newspapers announce
							that there was on Friday last, Snow at Barnett within <pb n="67"

							of last week the weather had been so fine, that the prospects of a good,

								ref="davy-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William

								ref="cooke-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook</persRef> the

								<persRef ref="hamilton-william">Hamilton</persRef> is at

								Castlereagh</persRef> is at his Country seat at North Gray. Bidwell
							and <persRef ref="planta-joseph">Planta</persRef>, are the only persons
							in attendance— Bidwell enquired whether it was true as the newspapers
							announce, that an American Squadron was about to bombard Naples. I told
							him it was a ridiculous fable— He said he was about sending me answers
							to two or three of my Notes— One relating to the American ship at
							Glasgow, (concerning which I have already received a negative Answer
							from the <persRef ref="jenkinson-robert">Earl of Liverpool</persRef>;)
							another complaining of the conduct of a British naval Officer in Canada—
							It was referred to the admiralty for enquiry into the circumstances; and
							if it shall be found that the British Officer has behaved amiss, his
							conduct will be disapproved, and instructions will be sent to prevent
							the recurrence of the Offence. On returning to Craven Street I found
							there <persRef ref="connell-john3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Connell</persRef>, and a <persRef ref="u">Commodore
								Billings</persRef>, an Officer in the United States Navy, who has
							come here to endeavour to recover an Estate in Flintshire belonging to
							his family but which has fallen to the Crown by escheat. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Billings has brought with him a multitude
							of papers to prove his Genealogy, and to support his claim, which he
							requested me to peruse, and then to give him my advice how to proceed.
							He has also the armorial bearings of the family, carved in wood, which
							were carried over to America by his ancestor more than a century since,
							and which correspond exactly with the records in the herald’s office
							here— The original ancestor came to England with <persRef
								ref="williamtheconqueror">William the Conqueror</persRef>, and was
							his cup-bearer. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joy who came in again
							asked Billings whether he knew that the prosecution of such a claim in
							this Country required a large expenditure of money? Billings answered
							that he did not intend it should cost him any thing. <persRef ref="u"
								>His brother</persRef> had already commenced the pursuit, which was
							suspended by the late war, and by his brother’s death. An eminent lawyer
							had offered to undertake the management of the affair for five thousand
							pounds to be paid him after the recovery of the Estate which was worth
							seventy or eighty thousand Pounds. He proposed to apply to that lawyer
							or to some other who would conduct the business in the same manner— I
							took the papers out with me to look them over, and promised Billings to
							give him my advice upon them. Billings himself married a daughter of
								<persRef ref="quincy-samuel2">Samuel Quincy</persRef> of Lenox,
							Massachusetts. I took the Ladies up at a shop at the corner of
							Pall-Mall, and at Turnham Green left them and walked home. After dinner
							I read to them three Acts of the School for Scandal.— While in town I
							called at the engraver <persRef ref="silvester-richard"
								>Silvester’s</persRef>, and saw my Seal, which is not yet finished.
							Also at <persRef ref="u">Williams’s</persRef> the Stationer, and ordered
							the last Edinburgh and Quarterly Reviews to be sent to my Office. Left
							directions with <persRef ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								father</persRef>, by the Cordelia, a Vessel now at the Isle of
							Wight, ready to sail for Boston, and of which M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Joy gave me notice— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clement</persRef> did not make his appearance at the

								<persRef ref="u">Lussau</persRef>— Mother of <persRef ref="u">a

							the Officers of the customs, decline a return of the Extra-duties, in

								>Ladies</persRef> came in from their fishing party, a few minutes
							after me. In the Evening I read to them the <pb n="69" type="ms"/>first
							Book of the Dunciad, and the first Canto of the Lady of the Lake. The
							weather has been this day fine, and although cool needed no fire. It was
							the first evening since the month came in, that we had none—</p>
						<p>In the Grecian Mythology, <persRef ref="orpheus">Orpheus</persRef> is
							said to have charmed Lions and Tygers, the most ferocious wild Beasts,
							and to have drawn after him the very trees of the forest and the Rocks
							of the desert by the harmony of his Lyre. Its power was said to have
							triumph’d even over the tremendous deities of the infernal regions, over
							the monster Cerberus, the Furies and <persRef ref="pluto"
								>Pluto</persRef> himself. The meaning of this Allegory is explained
							by <persRef ref="horace">Horace</persRef> De Arte Poetica v. 390.
							Orpheus was a Legislator whose eloquence charmed the rude and Savage men
							of his age, to associate together in the State of civil Society. To
							submit to the salutary restraints of Law, and to unite together in the
							worship of their Creator— It was the Lyre of Orpheus that civilized
							Savage Man. It was only in Harmony that the first human political
							institutions could be founded. After the Death of Orpheus, his Lyre was
							placed among the Constellations— And there according to the Astronomies
							of <persRef ref="manilius-marcus">Manilius</persRef>; still possesses
							its original charm, constituting by its concords the Music of the
							Spheres, and drawing by its attraction the whole orb of Heaven around
							with its own revolution. It is the Application of this Fable, and of
							this passage of Manilius to the United States, the American political
							Constellation, that forms the device of the Seal. The following is the
							passage in Manilius with a translation.</p>
						<lg>
							<l>At Lyra deductis per coelum cornibus inter </l>
							<l>Sidera conspicitur, qua quondam ceperat Orpheus </l>
							<l>Omne quod attigerat cantu, manesque per ipsos </l>
							<l>Fecit iter, domuitque infernas carmine leges. </l>
							<l>Hinc coelestis honos, similisque potentia causae. </l>
							<l><hi rend="italic">Tunc</hi> silvas et saxa trahens,<hi rend="italic"
									>Nunc Sidera Ducit</hi>,</l>
							<l>Et rapit immensum mundi revolubilis orbem. </l>
							<l>Manilius Astronomicon 1.322 &amp;c. </l>
							<cb/>
							<l>The Lyre of Orpheus, with erected horns</l>
							<l>Next in the Sky, the starry world adorns; </l>
							<l>That Lyre which once with fascinating spell </l>
							<l>Tam’d the dread Lord, and tyrant Laws of Hell.</l>
							<l>With soft compulsion won the Master’s way </l>
							<l>From Death’s dire regions to the realms of day. </l>
							<l>Nor yet, transferr’d in glory to the skies,</l>
							<l>Has lost the power to draw, by kindred ties. </l>
							<l><hi rend="italic">Then</hi> Rocks and Groves, obeyed its magic
								force;</l>
							<l><hi rend="italic">Now</hi>, of the Starry Orbs, it leads the
								course;</l>
							<l>Extends its charm, to Heaven’s remotest bound, </l>
							<l>And rolling, whirls the Universe around.</l>
						</lg>
						<p>The modern Astronomers have connected a Vulture with the Constellation of
							the Lyre, and it is marked upon the Charts of <persRef ref="bode-johann"
								>Bode’s</persRef> Uranographia, by the name of Vultur et Lyra.
							Instead of that bird, by a slight poetical license I have assumed the
							American Eagle as the bearer of the Lyre. The thirteen original Stars
							form a border round the Seal. The Stars marked upon the Lyre and on the
							wings of the Eagle are placed in the relative positions, as they may be
							seen by the naked eye in the Constellation of Lyra. The motto from
							Manilius is upon the Lyre itself. The moral application of the emblem
							is, that the same power of harmony which originally produced the
							institutions of civil government to regulate the Association of
							individual men, now presides in the federal association of the American
							States— That Harmony is the Soul of their combination. That their force
							consists in their Union; and that while thus United, it will be their
							destiny to revolve in harmony with the whole world by the attractive
							influence of their Union— It is the Lyre of Orpheus that now leads the
							Stars, as it originally drew after it rocks and trees. It is harmony
							that now binds in its influence the American States, as it originally
							drew individual men from the solitude of Nature, to the assemblages
							which formed States and Nations.— The Lesson of the emblem is <hi

						<p><date>8. VI: </date>Received a Letter from <persRef ref="davy-william"
								>William Davy</persRef>, the appointed Consul at Hull— It is dated

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Milman</persRef> read prayers
							for the thirteenth Sunday after Trinity, and preached from 2. Peter
							III.3. “Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days,
							scoffers, walking after their own lusts”—it was the most sensible Sermon
							I have heard from this Gentleman; but the views that he presented of his
							subject <pb n="70" type="ms"/>were extremely limited. He divided the
							Scoffers, or the objects of scoffing into three classes— The Church, the
							Clergy, and the Bible— He urged the wickedness of scoffing at either of
							these, and the duty of shewing reverence to them all—to the Church as
							the house of God—to the Clergy as his Ministers; and to the Bible as his
							word—admitting however that the characters of the Clergy as men, were
							open to animadversion as much as others, and confining the duty of
							respect for them, to their official station. We had visits from <persRef
								ref="parish-david2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> David
								Parish</persRef>, and a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Ellis</persRef>, a Gentleman who lives in our
							neighbourhood, but whom I had never seen before. He appears to have
							resided in America, and has now connection with the British Colonies
							there— He spoke of the conflicting pretensions of <persRef
								ref="selkirk-thomas">Lord Selkirk’s</persRef> Colony and the Hudson
							Bay Company, and the question of the prerogative of the Crown to grant
							some of the Powers in their Charters; which he said the Government here
							would not suffer to be tried at Law, nor yet remedy by act of
							Parliament— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellis by his Conversation
							appears to be a whig. I walked before dinner to Brentford— <persRef

								>W. Plumer</persRef>; who is now again Governor of New Hampshire

							<persRef ref="addams-richard">Addams</persRef>, the Proctors at Doctor’s Commons, which I left
							with the Seal unbroken— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p><date>11. VII. </date>I walked four miles of the way to London, and was
							then overtaken by the Coachman with the Curricle. Went through S<hi
								rend="superscript">t</hi> James’s Park, and alighted below Charing
							Cross, at the Horse Guards— I went to the Palace Yard where there was a
							meeting of the inhabitants of Westminster, being householders, to
							consider of the present distresses of the Country, and of what is to be
							done to remedy the same— There was so great a crowd of People, that I
							found it almost impossible to see, and quite impossible to hear any of

								ref="cook-john4">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cooke</persRef> the

								Hardy</persRef>, the Shoemaker, who in 1794 was tried for High

							been all that time battling it in favour of America and the Americans— I
							was only a few minutes in Palace-Yard, and upon going to Craven Street,
							found at the Office, <persRef ref="u">Commodore Billings</persRef>, and
							a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kay</persRef> from
							New-York, who brought me a Letter of introduction from <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>. <pb n="71" type="ms"/>M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> M’Kay has been nearly a year in France; endeavouring without
							success to sell American Lands. He is now here with the same views, and
							having documents which he may want to have authenticated, stated that he
							might perhaps have occasion to refer to me for that purpose. I assured
							him of every assistance in my power. I told M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Billings that he must have other proofs, besides the mere
							genealogy from him to his Grandfather; to recover the Estate in
							Flintshire to which he has pretensions. I also intimated to him that it
							might be difficult for him to find an eminent lawyer who would prosecute
							his claim, upon a bargain that his compensation should depend upon the
							Event of the suit. I thought such a contract would be illegal in
							England, and that any respectable lawyer, to whom he should make such an
							offer might take offence at the proposal. He was alarmed at this
							suggestion; and said he would abandon his claim immediately. I advised
							him not to be over hasty in his determination, and recommended to him to
							consult <persRef ref="murray-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Charles Murray</persRef>, Sun Court Cornhill, which he said he would
							do. There was an old Scotch Lady who came to enquire if I could not send
							to America two infant Grandchildren of hers; the children of her
							daughter who had married an American named <persRef
								ref="williams-joseph3">Joseph Williams</persRef>, a first Cousin she
							said of <persRef ref="williams-samuel2">Sam. Williams</persRef>, and a
							relation of the Crowninshield family at Salem— Joseph Williams had been
							employed by a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Lellan</persRef> of Philadelphia, and by his failure had been
							ruined. He afterwards died, and her daughter had come back upon her with
							the two children which she being a poor widow with only a trifling
							pension from the Scotch exchequer, could not support.— Her daughter she
							said was in a consumption; dying, broken hearted— She also said that
								<persRef ref="u">Captain Norman</persRef> had recommended to her to
							come to me— I lamented that I could give her no assistance. She did not
							even know to whom the children could be sent. I advised her to apply to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sam: Williams, but she said her
							daughter had already applied to him by Letter, and had received no
							answer— And as she herself was a little hot-headed, if she should go to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams and meet with a rebuff she
							might say something to him that would not be prudent. She kept a small
							boarding house in the City; where many American Captains had resorted,
							and so both her daughters had married Americans. The other daughter
							lived in Baltimore and was very well married. But she had given mortal
							offence to all her relations, by permitting her daughters to marry
							Americans, and now it was utterly impossible, on the same account to
							obtain admission for either of the children, into any of the charity
							schools— This Lady was scarcely gone when <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ecky</persRef> came in, with a M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>of New-York; arrived this morning
							from Liverpool, and going immediately, Ecky to Sweden, and the other to
							France. Ecky sailed from New-York the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							of last Month— He asked me if <persRef ref="russell-jonathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Russell</persRef> had made a
							commercial Treaty with Sweden. I was not informed. He says the
							Subscriptions to the new Bank of the United States, amounted in the
							twenty-days, limited from the opening of the books to twenty-five
							Millions—which is three Millions short of the whole sum to be
							subscribed— But he thinks the remnant will be immediately filled up, on
							the reopening of the Books— Both these Gentlemen took Passports. I found
							at the Office Cards from <persRef ref="sinclair-john">Sir John

							was also a Note from the Wurttemberg Minister, <persRef ref="u">General
								Neuffer</persRef>, with documents enclosed, from America, which he
							wants to have authenticated. General Neuffer himself had been out here,
							to visit us while I was in town. After dinner, I read the Lady of the

							to 25 July. I find in them many marks of dissatisfaction among the
							people in various parts of the Union from various causes, some affecting
							the general, and some the State Governments— Some the popularity of
							individuals, and others arising from the extraordinary state of the
							Seasons— In New-York and New-England the prospects of the harvest were
							bad and many places were suffering by scarcity. The Province of Maine
							was in the process of separation from Massachusetts— In Virginia, the
							old leaven between the western and the atlantic part of the State was
							working more actively than ever, and an effort was making to call a
							Convention, to amend the Constitution. In Tennessee there was great
							agitation about a Treaty with the Cherokees, which was thought to have
							intrenched upon the Territory of the State; and in many parts of the
							Union great discontent at an act of the last Session of Congress
							changing the mode of compensation of the members from six dollars per
							day to 1500 dollars a year— The spirit of party must have something to
							act upon, and when it has no object of great and general interest, will
							spend its excitement upon trifles. It was half past five O’Clock when I
							walked out to Gunnersbury and Brentford and seven when I returned. My
							wife came in half an hour after; and brought me from J. A. Smith, the
							first of my brother’s Bill of Exchange, in favour of <persRef
								ref="shimmin-william">William Shimmin</persRef> dated 19. July, for
							£450. Sterling, at thirty days sight, and endorsed by Shimmin to
								<persRef ref="dickasonandcompany">Thomas Dickason and C<hi
									rend="superscript">o.</hi></persRef> or order. It was left at
							the office this morning, and will be called for again next week— After
							dinner I finished reading the Lady of the Lake. I have found of this
							poem as of Marmion; it pleases much less upon a second reading than upon
							the first— There is a glare of colouring upon <persRef
								ref="scott-walter">Scotts</persRef> Portraits, sentiments and

							which were known to no living person but the Prince and himself; and the
							weal or woe of this Nation must depend upon the Prince’s doing or
							omitting to do what he should say to him— He should tell him that there
							must be Peace between England and America; that we must have a free
							inland trade with Canada, and a free Navigation in the Bay of Fundy— In
							conclusion <pb n="75" type="ms"/>however, if he should not succeed in

							the <persRef ref="nicholas-ellen">Ladies</persRef> entertained us with
							Music— While riding in and out of town this day, I read <persRef
								ref="reeves-john">Reeves’s</persRef> two Tracts— A discussion and a
							reply— Shewing that Americans, born before the Independence, are, by the

							of England, an Alien is a person, born out of the king’s allegiance,
							which Americans born before the Independence are not—and that allegiance
							is indefeasible and indelible—from these two principles. Reeves’s
							inference does irresistibly follow— But the Law of England upon the
							subject of alienage and allegiance is one tissue of absurdity.</p>

							Officers of the Customs allow Passengers to be taken, in vessels going

							on tonnage occupied by the cargo; and allow passengers only for the

							of Parliament. I said nothing upon the other point, because by including
							both together I thought it probable Castlereagh would make a compliance
							upon one a sort of ground for refusal upon the other, and because the
							Officers not being warranted by the Law in their rule of proportionment
							to the unoccupied tonnage of the vessel, it will be less difficult to
							drive them from that Post by itself, than from the other connected with

							Gazettes an Ordinance of 3. March 1815. dated at Washington, by which
							the American Government proposed an equalization of duties to foreign
							Countries which would agree to the same rule— And that the Prussian
							Government would readily agree to a total exemption from all duties both
							of impost and tonnage, upon American Vessels coming to Prussian Ports,
							on condition of a similar free admission of Prussian Vessels and Cargoes
							in the Ports of the United States— The other Note contains enquiries
							respecting the new invented Steam-Battery or Frigate, which it supposes

							which together with his obstinate rejection of all honours and favours
							under <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Buonaparte’s</persRef>
							Government constitute the great topics of encomium upon him— But
							Fontanes and the majority of the Academy had accepted and courted
							honours and favours of Buonaparte, so that there was not a line of
							praise upon Ducis for his inflexibility, but was a line of Satire upon
							the Orator’s new Colleagues and hearers— Fontanes who at the death of
								<persRef ref="washington-george">Washington</persRef>, delivered
							under the form of a funeral eulogium upon him, an Oration of fulsome
							adulation to Buonaparte, now with equal readiness worships Louis 16. and

							Ducis was little more than a translator from <persRef

							see how these panegyrists toil, to cry him up and to run his model down—
							They repeat all the common-place French critical trash against

						<p><date>29. VII: </date>Michaelmas day. Storm of wind and rain the whole

								<persRef ref="carr-colston">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>

								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity were not read.
							Whence I conclude that when any of the fixed festivals happens on a
							Sunday, the Service of the festival is always substituted instead, of
							the regular service of the day as a Sunday.— The particular collect of
							the day is usually read twice; once in the morning prayer, before the

							this day, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carr read in the Morning prayer
							the Collect for the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after
							Trinity, and that of S<hi rend="superscript">t:</hi> Michael’s day, but
							omitted the third collect, for Grace, (in my judgment the best collect
							in the whole book) In the Communion Service, <persRef ref="milman-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Milman</persRef> read again the
							Michaelmas collect; but not that of the 16<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity. The day which is vulgarly called
							Michaelmas, is in the Book of Common Prayer denominated the festival of
								<persRef ref="michael">Saint Michael</persRef>
							<hi rend="italic">and all Angels</hi>.— The first Lesson of the day is
							the 32<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Chapter of Genesis—the account of
							Jacob’s wrestling with an Angel— The second Lesson is the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> Chapter of Acts, to verse 20. the
							narrative of <persRef ref="peter">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Peter’s</persRef> liberation from prison, by an Angel— But in
							neither of these places is the angel specially named. The Epistle is the
								12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of Revelations from verse
							7 to 12. of the War in Heaven; between Michael and his angels, and the
							dragon and his angels— The Gospel is the 18<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Chapter of Matthew, to verse 11. where Jesus Christ after
							warning his disciples to take heed, not to despise little children,
							adds, “for I say unto you, that in heaven, their angels do always behold
							the face of my father which is in heaven”— The collect prays God, that
							as his holy Angels always do him service in heaven, so by his
							appointment they may succour and defend us on earth, through Jesus
							Christ our Lord. It is worded cautiously to avoid prayer, or the
							appearance of prayer to the angels themselves— I should be glad to see a
							good Dissertation upon the true scriptural doctrine concerning Angels.—

								<persRef ref="ithuriel">Ithuriel</persRef> and <persRef ref="abdiel"
								>Abdiel</persRef>, I believe they are only poetical angels of
								<persRef ref="milton-john">Milton’s</persRef> creation— There
							appears to be some countenance for Milton’s assumption that many of the
							heathen idols were the fallen Angels. The opinion of the agency of
							guardian angels, which prevails both in the Roman Catholic and Greek
							Churches, has been much abandoned by the protestants, probably from its
							tendency to idolatry, and perhaps to the doctrine of purgatory, which is
							by no means irrational, and is to be rejected only because it has no
							warrant in the canonical Scriptures— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Milman preached the Sermon from Luke XVIII:13 “And the publican standing
							afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote
							upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.” It was the
							second part of his last Sunday’s discourse, and not much better— He
							founds the doctrine of his Sermon upon the supposition that the publican
							was an atrocious criminal, which the parable does not justify— The
							contrast is of the different tempers of mind with which the two men went
							to prayer— The pharisee was a character respected by the people—the
							publican was odious as a tax-gatherer— The pharisee was puffed up with
							spiritual Pride and Arrogance.— The publican was humble from the
							consciousness of his sins— The pharisee boasts that he is not a sinner;
							and sins in the very boast— The publican confesses that he is one; and
							expiates his sin by the penitence of the Confession. But when Christ
							says that he went down to his house <hi rend="italic">justified</hi>, it
							implies, that the sins of which he was conscious and repentant were not
							of a heinous nature— On the contrary the pharisee after thanking God,
							that he is not like other men, unjust, extortioners or adulterers, by
							adding or even as this publican, manifestly means to descend to a class
							of minor transgressions. The odium attached to the publican, fastened
							upon the individual, through his employment; the performance of
							ungracious duties. As a man might say, I thank God I have no great
							crimes to answer for, nor even the faults of a common hangman. It does
							not follow that the hangman is a criminal— And it is not safe to suppose
							that the crimes were highly aggravated, because it would lead to the
							conclusion that Christ had pronounced a deeply guilty man, justified, by
							a mere general confession of sin, coupled with a prayer for God’s mercy,
							and without atonement. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Milman views all
							his subjects <pb n="80" type="ms"/>through the glass of Fancy, without
							ever looking at them through that of judgment— I walked home from
							Church. The thanksgiving for fair weather was not read this day. We had
							a visit from <persRef ref="nicholas-george2">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Nicholas</persRef>, who came for his daughter <persRef
								ref="nicholas-ellen">Ellen</persRef>, but <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> persuaded him to
							leave her sometime longer— He told us of the City Election yesterday— By
							the shew of hands, the present <persRef ref="wood-matthew">Lord
								Mayor</persRef> and <persRef ref="combe-harvey">Alderman
								Combe</persRef> were returned to the Court of Aldermen, by the
							Livery; but <persRef ref="smith-christopher">Alderman Christopher
								Smith</persRef>, the man in rotation demanded a poll, which was
							granted of course. The Livery return two names to the Court of Aldermen;
							one of whom is chosen by them— That is the reason why Combe was returned
							with Wood. Combe is a whig, and has been Lord Mayor. But he is confined
							to his house by illness, and could not serve if chosen— Wood declared
							upon the hustings that if re-elected he would serve— But it is thought
							that upon the poll he will not succeed.— We had company at
