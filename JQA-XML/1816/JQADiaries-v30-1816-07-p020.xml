						<p><date>1. VII:45. </date>Monday. Wrote a short Letter to <persRef
								ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Aspinwall</persRef>, and Journalized upon the 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> of last Month— <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef>, went with our Sons <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>,
							to fish in the Paddington Canal. I was writing until past six O’Clock,
							and then walked as far as Ealing Church— In the lane just beyond
								<persRef ref="dumouriez-charles">General Dumouriez’s</persRef>
							house, I met a <persRef ref="cook-william">man</persRef> with a very
							wretched and squalid appearance, with a <persRef ref="u">girl</persRef>
							of about twelve, equally miserable— He had an empty pint Bottle, in his
							hand, and accosting me, asked if I could give him a little Elder Wine—
							He said he was a blacksmith by trade, and had been in comfortable
							circumstances and lived well— But he had been unlucky—had met with
							losses; times were hard down in Staffordshire where he had lived; and he
							had set out with his wife, and two children, all that survived of eleven
							that he had had, to walk to London, and see if he could get some work to
							do.— He had come from Stone, 160 miles from home; and when he got as far
							as Brentford, <persRef ref="u">his boy</persRef>, a fine boy about seven
							years old was taken sick—he complained his feet were sore and that he
							could not go any farther— At first he thought he had overwalked the poor
							boy, for they had walked as much as twenty miles a day; but he had taken
							him in at <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker’s</persRef>, who kept a public house at Brentford, and there
							he broke out with the small-pox, and was lying with it, very bad— The
							parish at Brentford had allowed him a Doctor to attend the boy—but the
							Doctor gave him very poor encouragement for the poor child— He the
							father had been round to every house in Brentford to see if he could get
							any work, but without success— He was obliged to pay eight pence a
							night, for the chamber where his boy lay, now entirely blind— He had
							sold most of his own Cloaths, and the gown off of the girl’s back— The
							Doctor had told him that Elder wine, would be good for the boy to keep
							his lips moist, and give him some sustenance, and he had now come out to
							see if he could beg any. I told him I had no elder wine, but gave him a
							shilling with which he could buy some; and passed on— As I was returning
							from my walk, in the lane just before my house I overtook again the same
							man, with the girl— He thanked me very gratefully for what I had given
							him; told me his Story over again; said he had not got any wine; but
							since I saw him he had met a Lady, who had given him six pence, and told
							him she would come and see the Child— I told him that I understood wine
							was a very doubtful and dangerous medicine for the small-pox— But he
							said the Doctor had ordered it, and said any kind of wine would do; as
							it was only to keep his lips moist, and give him sustenance— I called
							the man into the yard; had his bottle filled with wine; and asked his
							name, which he told me was William Cook— After dinner I walked with M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef> to Brentford, and after being directed to three
							other houses of persons named Baker, we finally found that where this
							poor man and his family were— We left George below as he has only passed
							the process of vaccination— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and I
							went up into the chamber, where the boy lay, covered in a fearful manner
							with the small pox. The chamber was not twelve feet square, with only
							one small window which was shut, and they had a fire at the foot of the
							boy’s bed, to make tea for him— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams
							directed them to open the window, to have the fire put out, and to keep
							the child cool, without exposing him to take cold— And she told the man
							to call at our house again to-morrow— It was between nine and ten when
							we came home.— By this Morning’s Post I received—A Note from <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, with
							information that a Bill has been brought into Parliament, for the
							exportation of Machinery for the use of the Mint of the United States— A
							Note of invitation to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and me to
								<persRef ref="lieven-dorothea">Countess Lieven’s</persRef> party,
							last Evening— It was dated on Friday; came doubtless to the Office on
							Saturday, too late to be sent out that Evening, and was thus kept until
							this morning— A Letter from <persRef ref="saunders-prince">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Prince Sanders</persRef>; enclosing a
							Card of invitation to our Son George to dine with him next Friday; and a
							Card of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanders “at Home” for M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and me, the same Evening— In the
							Letter he says he hopes we will come, as the celebrated <persRef
								ref="opie-amelia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Opie</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="marcet-jane">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Marriat</persRef>, authoress of Conversations on chemistry have
							promised to be there, and he hopes to have a pleasant, and intelligent
							Conversation.— By the Evening Post Letters—from <persRef
								ref="maury-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maury</persRef> at
							Liverpool—from <persRef ref="dentzel-george">George Dentzel</persRef>, a
							petitioning sailor—and from <persRef ref="smith-john">J. A.

						<p><date>2. VI. </date>I went into London, with <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef> immediately after breakfast and first called at
								<persRef ref="chester-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chester’s</persRef> House in South Audley Street, to enquire whether
							the Session of Parliament was to be closed this day, and whether the
							foreign Ministers were to attend— I met M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Chester in his Carriage, just starting from his door; dressed, and going
							to the House of Lords— He told me that he had written me a Note
							yesterday to give me notice of the Ceremony this day; and requested me
							to be at the House of Lords, about a quarter before two, as the <persRef
								ref="george-iv">Prince</persRef> would be punctually there at the
							hour. It was then a quarter past one. I went immediately down to Craven
							Street, where I found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chester’s Note, a
							Letter from <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>, recommending to me <persRef ref="sloo-thomas">M<hi

									>r:</hi></persRef> which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sloo had

							Literature, at Ghent, the Painter who took my Picture while I was there,
							enquiring how he shall send it to me. while I was dressing <persRef
								ref="patterson-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R.
								Patterson</persRef> of Baltimore called at the Office, with <persRef
								ref="glennie-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Glennie</persRef>. I sent them word that I was obliged to go
							immediately down to the House of Lords, and if it was convenient to
							them, should be happy to see them at four <pb n="21" type="ms"/>O’Clock—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson left two Letters of
							Recommendation, which he had brought—one from <persRef ref="smith-john2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Spear Smith</persRef>, and
							the other from <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">Christopher Hughes
									jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef>, and a Volume sent me
							by J. S. Smith—A Statistical View of the Commerce of the United States,
							just published by <persRef ref="pitkin-timothy">Timothy
							Pitkin</persRef>, a member of Congress from Connecticut— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson with <persRef
								ref="patterson-marianne">his Lady</persRef> and her <persRef
								ref="caton-elizabeth;hervey-louisa">two Sisters the Miss
								Caton’s</persRef> are travelling in Europe for pleasure— I had
							scarcely time to read the Letters and went immediately to the House of
							Lords which I just reached in seasonable time— The House was very much
							crowded, principally with Ladies— There were less than thirty Peers, in
							their Robes, among whom were the Dukes of <persRef
								ref="frederickaugustus">York</persRef> and <persRef ref="edward"
								>Kent</persRef>— The House was understood to be in Session— As I
							passed before the throne to go to the place assigned for the foreign
							Ministers, I met the <persRef ref="pery-edmund">Earl of Limerick</persRef>, who said to me, smiling—you see
							us here in our Robes— But “Robes, you know, and furr’d gowns, hide all—”
							“Your Lordship, at least, said I, has nothing to hide.”— <persRef
								ref="bathurst-henry">Earl Bathurst</persRef> told me that he had
							received a Letter, from <persRef ref="bathurst-lawrence">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence Bathurst</persRef>, asking to
							see him, and claiming to be his Relation; and that he had referred him
							to me, for testimony, of his being the person that he professed— I told
							the Earl that I had received a Letter, introducing this M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bathurst to me, from a person of the most
							respectable character, with whom I had served some years as a Senator of
							the United States— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bathurst had been to
							me, to enquire how he could obtain access to his Lordship— I had advised
							him to write a Note to him, stating who he was and his wish to see his
							Lordship; and told him I had no doubt the Earl would see him— Adding
							that he might refer his Lordship to me, for my knowledge of him— He had
							told me he was descended from a <persRef ref="bathurst-lawrence2"
								>brother</persRef> of his <persRef ref="bathurst-francis">Lordship’s
								Grandfather</persRef>, who had been one of the original settlers of
							Georgia. He had shewn me some of his Papers, and I had supposed His
							Lordship would have known something of the family, which might have
							served to ascertain the correctness of his Story.— The Earl said there
							had been not a brother of his Grandfather’s but a distant relation of
							the family, who went many years ago to America— And about seven or eight
							years since <persRef ref="bond-phineas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Phineas Bond</persRef> had made some application to him in behalf of
							an old man, who was descended from that person: but he had understood
							that this old man had no children; and that he was since dead— I told
							him that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bathurst had shewn me a Letter
							to him from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bond, and some other papers—
							The Earl asked me if I should have any objection to let him see the
							Letter that I had received, and to which I referred— I said, none—and
							promised to send it to him— Before the Regent came in, the <persRef
								ref="helyhutchinson-john">Earl of Donoughmore</persRef> referred to
							some Papers received from the <persRef ref="whitworth-charles">Lord
								Lieutenant of Ireland</persRef>, and gave notice of his intention
							early at the next Session of Parliament to move the taking into
							consideration the State of Ireland, particularly with reference to the
							Catholics, unless the Subject should be brought forward by better hands;
							he meant his Majesty’s Ministers— The Prince Regent entered the Hall two
							or three minutes before two. His escort was similar to that of last
							year; but the sword of State was born by the <persRef
								ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of Wellington</persRef>, who arrived
							yesterday from Paris— The summons was sent to the House of Commons, and
							the <persRef ref="abbot-charles">Speaker</persRef> immediately came to
							the Bar, with a number of the Members— He addressed a Speech to the
							Regent, the topics of which were the glorious establishment of general
							peace and tranquility by the restoration of legitimate Government, and
							by its being placed under the proper custody of the Duke of
							Wellington—the new coinage—the consolidation of the English and Irish
							Treasuries, the new Regulation of the civil list and the happy marriage
							of the <persRef ref="charlotte">Princess Charlotte</persRef> with the
								<persRef ref="leopold2">Prince of Coburg</persRef>— With a very
							slight notice of the distresses of the agricultural interest, to which
							he said they had given what immediate relief they could—but which was to
							be expected after a long war, and for the remedy to which they trusted
							much to the healing influence of Time— He concluded by presenting the
							Bill for the Appropriations of the year— The titles of that and of
							several other Bills, public and private, were then read by a Clerk, and
							another upon a nod from the Prince, pronounced the royal assent to them
							in old law French, in the three several forms mentioned by <persRef
								ref="blackstone-william">Blackstone</persRef>.— The Prince then read
							his Speech; seated and covered with an enormous three cornered military
							hat— He began by lamenting the continuance of <persRef ref="george-iii"
								>His Majesty’s</persRef> Indisposition—touched upon most of the
							topics, to which the Speaker had referred— Promised a continuance of
							Peace—announced that he had given the Royal Consent to a marriage
							between His Majesty’s daughter the <persRef ref="mary2">Princess
								Mary</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="williamfrederick">Duke of
								Gloucester</persRef>; and in bewailing the distresses of some
							Classes of the People, trusted that they would bear them with fortitude
							and energy; as they had their former difficulties; and that they would
							prove to be only temporary; and soon remedied by the increase of public
							credit, and the relief from burthens already granted— When he had
							finished, the <persRef ref="scott-john2">Lord Chancellor</persRef>,
							standing behind the throne, prorogued the Parliament to the 24<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August; and the Prince withdrew— A
							cannonade announced his arrival and his departure— As I left the Hall,
							to go to my Carriage I heard a loud shouting among the People, and was
							told it was for the Duke of Wellington— The crowds of Spectators in the
							Streets, <pb n="22" type="ms"/>were not so great as they had been upon
							the same occasion last year— I returned to Craven-Street, and there
							found a Seaman, named <persRef ref="dentzel-george">Dentzel</persRef>,
							applying for relief— He had written to me two or three days since— I
							sent him to <persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Aspinwall</persRef>— Then came <persRef ref="west-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> West</persRef>, the Man of
							Patents and Projects, who is now engaged in a manufactory of transparent
							Soap, of which he gave me some Samples— Then I had visits from <persRef
								ref="goodlet-a">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goodlet</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="sloo-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sloo</persRef>— The latter of whom is going immediately to Hamburg;
							to return through Holland and France in one or two Months—and the former
							is to return shortly to the United States— An American named <persRef
								ref="u">Baenninger</persRef> came for a Passport— He came over from
							New-York about two Months ago, fancying that he had discovered the
							perpetual motion— But when he arrived he found that his discovery was
							already known here— The <persRef ref="u">Abbe Humblet</persRef> came,
							and I dismissed him; with some ill-temper—requesting him not to trouble
							me with himself or his Poetry any more— These persons kept me at the
							Office until past five O’Clock— <persRef ref="smith-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> then gave me the Bills
							received upon the Bankers check that I had left with him; and we
							returned home. We walked from Brentford. Home at seven— Rain after
							dinner confined me at home.— The <persRef ref="cook-william"
								>man</persRef> who has the child confined at Brentford, with the
							small-pox, had been here while I was gone, and came again while we were
							at dinner. The <persRef ref="u">boy</persRef> is no better; but the man
							said he had earned a shilling by a job of work to day.— Read with George
							part of the fourth Act of <persRef ref="terence">Terence’s</persRef>
							Phormio.</p>

						<p><date>3. VII. </date>After employing the morning upon this Journal, and
							part of a Letter which I could not finish, I complied with a petition
							from my sons <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>. We dined at three O’Clock, and
							immediately afterwards all went to Covent-Garden Theatre, and saw the
							Jealous Wife; a Comedy by the elder <persRef ref="colman-george2">George
								Colman</persRef>, with a farce called Love, Law, and Physick; a
							Translation from the French Play, le Collateral, ou la Diligence de
							Joigny.— We arrived at the Theatre in good Season, and had after the
							first Act very good Seats— The rule at the Theatres here is that Seats
							may be engaged for any particular day, at any time before— The name of
							the person taking the seats is entered on the Box-keepers books, but the
							tickets are not then paid for.— A shilling is given for a man to keep
							the Seats, until the first act of the Play is over; but if the persons
							engaging the Seats are not then arrived, they lose their right to the
							seats engaged, and must take their chance for others— The first row of
							boxes, are called dress boxes; and those immediately over them are
							called the first Row— We could get no seats in the Dress boxes, and only
							the fifth bench in a box of the first Row.— But the first Act was over,
							before the company who had engaged the front and second benches
							appeared. The instant the curtain dropped, the occupiers of the third
							and fourth benches, advanced to the first and second; and we stepped
							forward to the third— We were scarcely seated when the party who had
							engaged the front seats, came in; but it was too late—they were obliged
							to put up with the seats behind us which we had left— The Comedy was on
							the whole very well performed; but in comparing it with the French
							Comedy of <persRef ref="desforges-pierre">Desforges</persRef>, which I
							saw when I was last at Paris, (18 March 1815) La femme jalouse, I think
							the French play the best of the two, and the performance of <persRef
								ref="leverd-jeanne">Mademoiselle Le Verd</persRef>, superior to that
							of <persRef ref="oneill-eliza">Miss O’Neill</persRef>. The general plot
							of the two plays, and the principal characters are the same—but the
							excitement of the wife’s suspicions, in the French Comedy, is more
							natural and less absurd that in the English— The French Jealous wife is
							pathetic—the English one is only ridiculous and contemptible— In the
							English Play, the young Gentleman, the successful lover, is degraded by
							a scene of beastly drunkenness—of that drunkenness which <persRef
								ref="comtesse-almaviva">Count Almaviva</persRef> calls l’ivresse du
							Peuple, and in the Barbier de Seville, refuses even to simulate— There
							is no drunken scene in la femme Jalouse— Great Part of this English
							Play, is evidently borrowed from Tom Jones— <persRef ref="ladyfreelove"
								>Lady Freelove</persRef>, <persRef ref="lordtrinket">Lord
								Trinket</persRef>, <persRef ref="squirerusset">Squire
								Russet</persRef> and his Daughter, and <persRef ref="charlesoakley"
								>Charles Oakley</persRef> are little more than copies of <persRef
								ref="ladybellaston">Lady Bellaston</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lordfellamar">Lord Fellamar</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="squirewestern">Squire Western</persRef>, his daughter <persRef
								ref="sophiawestern">Sophia</persRef>, and <persRef ref="tomjones"
								>Tom Jones</persRef>— Miss O’Neill’s performance was very good; but
							not so strikingly excellent as I expected— <persRef ref="young-charles"
								>Young</persRef>, <persRef ref="terry-daniel">Terry</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="kemble-charles">Charles Kemble</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="fawcett-john">Fawcett</persRef>, <persRef ref="u"

								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							<persRef ref="gibbs-maria">Gibbs</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="foote-maria">Miss Foote</persRef>, all performed well, but some
							of them might have done better— <persRef ref="mathews-charles">Matthews</persRef> and <persRef ref="liston-john"
								>Liston</persRef> provoked much laughter in the farce. <persRef
								ref="mathews-charles">Matthews</persRef> sung a song, describing the
							bustle at the Theatres on coming to them for a crowded Night the
							incidents within, disputes for Seats in the boxes and Pit; and the
							tumults at going out—mimicking the confused voices of men women
							children, box-keepers link-boys, footmen, Hackney-Coachmen &amp;c. with
							much humour— He was encored, and sung the song a second time with a
							total variation of the mimicking dialogue— The Play finished about
							eleven O’Clock— House crowded— We went and left George at Craven Street—
							His old schoolmate <persRef ref="chambre-walter">Chambré</persRef>
							having given him an invitation to go and spend some days with him at
							Hampstead.— We reached home about one in the Morning— I found
							Letters—from <persRef ref="maury-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Maury</persRef> at Liverpool—from <persRef ref="price-joseph">J. T.
								Price</persRef>, at the Neath-Abbey Iron-Works—and from <persRef
								ref="boteler-william">W. F. Boteler</persRef>, Recorder of the City

								>Cook</persRef>, the man who has the child ill at Brentford with the

							wet, to Barnett, to stop the Colliers that were coming up to London,
							with three loads of coals as a present to the <persRef ref="george-iv"
								>Prince Regent</persRef>; and a petition for relief— The rumour of
							the approach of these Colliers has been current in London these three
							days— They have been thrown out of employment, by the diminution of
							business in the Iron-works— Cook says, there had been some rioting among
							them before he came out of Staffordshire— I attempted a walk; but was
							twice overtaken with showers in going to Ealing Church and returning— I
							was obliged to write in the Evening—</p>

							with <persRef ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> to the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince

								>Lord Castlereagh</persRef>, to dinner, next Friday the 12<hi

							of <persRef ref="penn-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams, to a Dress Party, a Ball, at the

								<persRef ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef>— A Card to M<hi

							Adams, of the <persRef ref="petty-mary">Marchioness Dowager of
								Lansdowne</persRef>, at Home, Sunday, the 7<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="villiers-frances">Countess of Jersey</persRef> at
							Home, on Monday the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi
								rend="superscript">t</hi>— The Levee was more numerously attended
							than the last; but less crowded than the preceding one— The <persRef
								ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of Wellington</persRef> was there, and
							his brother, <persRef ref="wellesleypole-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wellesley-Pole</persRef>, introduced

								ref="fane-john">Lord Westmorland</persRef>, told me, that they had

									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Patterson</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="caton-elizabeth;hervey-louisa">Miss Caton’s</persRef>; they

									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Bagot</persRef>, who M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pole told me, he
							was happy to hear, were very popular in America.— <persRef
								ref="lieven-christopher">Count Lieven</persRef> asked me what was
							the explanation that had taken place between Lord Castlereagh and me,
							relative to the late transactions of <persRef ref="pellew-edward">Lord
								Exmouth</persRef> at Algiers and with the Barbary States; I told him
							the substance of what had passed between us— <persRef
								ref="nicolai-pavel">Baron Nicolaï</persRef> told me that in the
							course of eight or ten days, he should embark for S<hi
								rend="superscript">t</hi> Petersburg; and that the <persRef
								ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> had appointed him, Minister at
							Copenhagen.— The Levee was soon over— The Prince Regent, passed me,
							simply saying, “How do you do, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Adams”—which is the same thing he always says, on these Occasions— He
							seldom says any thing more, to others; but he was peculiarly gracious to
							the Duke of Wellington; and complimented him upon the cheerings of the
							People, with as much apparent satisfaction, as if they had been bestowed
							upon himself.— The Dukes of <persRef ref="edward">Kent</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="williamfrederick">Gloucester</persRef>, and the Earls
							of <persRef ref="jenkinson-robert">Liverpool</persRef> and Westmorland,
							spoke to me, the two former about the weather, and the latter, about the
							distresses of the commercial interest in this Country, and in America—
							It appears they are as great in the United States, as here— From the
							Levee, I returned to Craven-Street, where I found <persRef
								ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi>
								Aspinwall</persRef> the Consul, who gave me a despatch from the
							Secretary of State, dated 24. May— I gave Col<hi rend="superscript"
								>l:</hi> Aspinwall, the Letter which I received yesterday from
								<persRef ref="sparks-henry">Henry Sparks</persRef>, with all the
							enclosures, requesting him to make the necessary enquiries concerning
								<persRef ref="masoner-matthias">Matthias Masoner</persRef>, at the
							Admiralty— <persRef ref="patterson-robert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> R. Patterson</persRef> soon afterwards came in— He and
							his family are going in a few days to Cheltenham, and from thence in the
							Autumn to France— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson had brought
							the despatches, which I received the 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
								ult<hi rend="superscript">o:</hi> from <persRef ref="grubb-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grubb</persRef>, to whom they
							had been delivered by the Master of the Virginia Coffee-House— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson, on landing from the Vessel, at
							one of the outports, gave the despatches into the charge of the Captain,
							and they were doubtless given by him to the Master of the Coffee-House—
							When Col<hi rend="superscript">l:</hi> Aspinwall and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson left the Office, I went with
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams to <persRef ref="thomas-tycho"
								>Thomas’s</persRef> Hotel Berkeley-Square, to visit M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Patterson, and the two Miss Caton’s her
							Sisters— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Patterson who has been unwell,
							had a fire— The young Ladies, when <pb n="24" type="ms"/>we went in,
							were gone out; but came in while we were there; quite enchanted with
							having witnessed the transports of the People at the sight of the Duke
							of Wellington— <persRef ref="u">Lady Morven</persRef> also came in, upon
							a visit to the Ladies, and brought a Card for them to the Countess of
							Jersey’s Route, next Monday— As we came away M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Patterson, and especially the Miss Catons were extremely
							anxious in their enquiries, whether they could not be presented at
							Court; which we assured them they might be, without difficulty, at the
							Queen’s first drawing-room—and I offered to present M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson at the first Levee; which
							according to the etiquette should precede the presentation of the
							Ladies— But he appeared to have an aversion to the whole affair— He
							proposed to postpone it all until their return here, next Spring; but
							the Ladies were very earnest in their purposes, and insisted by all
							means upon being presented at Court—because it was one of the things, to
							be seen in this Country— A Show, and they wanted to see it, like other
							Shows— On leaving them I left Cards at the <persRef
								ref="villiers-george2">Earl of Jersey’s</persRef>, and then called
							at the lodgings of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Balk-Oleff</persRef>, the Russian Minister going to Rio de Janeiro.
							He was not at home, and I left my Card, with the Letter for <persRef
								ref="sumter-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sumter</persRef>—
							We called at the House of <persRef ref="allston-washington">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Allston</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="leslie-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Leslie</persRef>; neither of whom was at home; but we saw the Picture of
								<persRef ref="king-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								King’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="king-eliza2;king-esther;king-rufus2">three
								children</persRef> which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Leslie is
							painting— Thence we returned to Craven Street, where I found <persRef
								ref="joy-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G.
								Joy</persRef>—<persRef ref="bathurst-lawrence">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> L. Bathurst</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="macky-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
							Macky</persRef>. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Macky had been at the

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, Secretary of State, from <persRef
									ref="dallas-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dallas</persRef>, Secretary of the Treasury, and from <persRef
								ref="stgeorgetucker-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> H. S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> George Tucker</persRef>, a Member of
							Congress from Virginia— He has business here in which they suppose I can
							assist him; and I offered him every service in my power— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bathurst has received no answer from the
								<persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Earl</persRef>, to the Letter he
							wrote, requesting to see him; and came to ask me to do something for
							him. I had taken the Letter from <persRef ref="gregg-andrew">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gregg</persRef>, with me to London,
							expecting to meet Earl Bathurst at the Levee, but he was not there.— I
							told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bathurst I would send the Earl the
							Letter this Evening; and was persuaded he would shortly receive his
							answer— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joy, had made some enquiries,
							about wine, in the London Docks, and recommended the same he had
							mentioned to me in a Letter— It was six O’Clock when these Gentlemen
							left the Office— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chitty</persRef> the Tailor was in waiting, and I settled his Bill.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith and <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef> went and dined with <persRef ref="saunders-prince"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanders</persRef>— M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams and I dined at the Office; after
							which we sent Cards of invitation to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Patterson, and the Miss Caton’s to
							dine with us next Tuesday— They answered a previous engagement. I
							answered the Card from Lord Castlereagh—enclosed M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gregg’s Letter with a Note to Earl Bathurst, and wrote an
							order upon the <persRef ref="baringbrothers">Brothers Baring and C<hi
									rend="superscript">o.</hi></persRef> in favour of <persRef
								ref="williams-samuel2">Samuel Williams</persRef>, on account of
								<persRef ref="maury-james">James Maury</persRef>, the Consul at
							Liverpool, to be charged to the Seamen’s fund— Wrote also a Letter of
							recommendation for <persRef ref="goodlet-a">A. G. Goodlet</persRef>, to
								<persRef ref="jackson-henry">H. Jackson</persRef>, Chargé d’affaires
							at Paris.— Left copies of those Papers at the Office to be copied by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith, and at nine in the Evening
							went with young Chambré to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Sanders’s—there was there an assembly of sixty or seventy persons,
							strangely collected together.— Among them were <persRef
								ref="opie-amelia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Opie</persRef>,
							the Novelist, a <persRef ref="burgoyne-john2">General
							Burgoyne</persRef>, <persRef ref="marcet-jane">M<hi rend="superscript"

								Beresford</persRef> now at Berlin, <persRef ref="amory-nathaniel2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Amory</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="u">Captain Magee</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Prescott</persRef>, the young man who
							brought me Letters of Recommendation, <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bryden</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="clarkson-john">John Clerkson</persRef>, and others. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanders, made me an apology, for having by
							mistake omitted to send me a Card, for his dinner— There was a Band of
							Music, and an intended Ball, which partly failed.— About eleven, we left
							the party, and went to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Penn’s, where we
							found another Ball, and a company, perhaps of three hundred persons,
							scarcely a soul of whom we knew.— After some time however we met
								<persRef ref="west-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								West</persRef> the Painter, and had much Conversation with him— His
							original Picture of the foundation of Pensylvania by <persRef
								ref="penn-william">William Penn</persRef> was also there— We came
							away soon after one in the Morning; went to Craven Street and took up
							Lucy.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith and George were returned
							from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanders’s, and just in bed— We got
							home, just at three in the Morning; with broad day.</p>

						<p><date>6. XI:15. </date>The journal of yesterday was the business of this

									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> to Brentford, and
							just returned to escape a shower of rain, which prevented the

							could be called warm weather— By this Evening’s Post I received a Letter
							from <persRef ref="fox-robert2">R. W. Fox jun<hi rend="superscript"

							inoculated with the vaccine matter, by <persRef ref="u">D<hi

							<persRef ref="u">partner</persRef>— Two other men, came from different

							famished— At the shop where we stopped in Brentford there was a woman
							who came from Basingstoke in the same condition— The distress of the
							Country, about which so much has been saying these nine Months, is just
							beginning to shew itself here, in this shape. The Colliers who were on
							their way to London, have been stopped by Magistrates, sent out for that
							purpose; who purchased their Coals, persuaded them to return home, and
							gave them money for their journey back. The effect of this example
							remains to be seen— The ministerial newspapers praise it as an act of
							great wisdom in the Home Department.</p>

							Craven-Street, I found <persRef ref="smith-john">M<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="birkbeck-morris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Birkbeck’s</persRef>, at Guilford, thirty miles from London— I went
							to the Covent-Garden theatre Box-Office to engage a seat for this

							without engaging it— I called at the Auction Office of the <persRef
								ref="robins-henry;robins-george">Robbins’s</persRef>, and settled their bill for
							some wine purchased lately of them.— Then at <persRef
								ref="silvester-richard">Silvester’s</persRef> the engraver, where I
							found a new design for the Seal which I bespoke—the Device from the
							Constellation of Lyra— I gave some further directions and am to call
							again before he begins to engrave the seal— Returning to the Office, I
							wrote a Letter to the <persRef ref="deliagno-alvar">Chevalier de

							received from him; which I left with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Smith to copy, and send to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beresford.— An

								ref="eustache-rene">Marquis d’Osmond</persRef>, the French
							Ambassador, for a Genevan named <persRef ref="u">Joly</persRef>, to go
							to the United States— I received the following Cards, Notes and Letters—
							A printed Card, dated Carleton House, the 4<hi rend="superscript"

							Covent-Garden theatre— The <persRef ref="charlotte">Princess Charlotte
								of Wales</persRef>, and <persRef ref="leopold2">her
								husband</persRef> were to have been there; but she was indisposed
							and could not come; a notice of which was placarded on the walls of the

							behind the dress Row.— The Play was the Opera of Artaxerxes—<persRef

								>Miss Stephens</persRef>, <persRef ref="artaxerxes"
								>Artaxerxes</persRef> by <persRef ref="duruset-john"
								>Duruset</persRef>, <persRef ref="arbaces">Arbaces</persRef> by
								<persRef ref="sinclair-john2">Sinclair</persRef>— The Air’s and

							and performed these thirty years, but I had never seen the Play before—
							It is an Italian Opera of <persRef ref="metastasio-pietro"
								>Metastasio</persRef>, translated, and the music composed by
								<persRef ref="arne-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Arne</persRef>. As a drama, every thing in it is out of nature, it
							is by the plot a horrible tragedy in which all the Passions are
							sacrificed to the Music; and the music is all sweet and warbling,
							without any exhibition of Passion— Miss Stephens was encored in “The
							Soldier tir’d,” but yet did not sing it so much to my taste as I have
							heard it— The performance altogether did not equal my expectations— It
							was succeeded by a farce, called killing no murder—I know not why— It
							was one of the low and vulgar pieces in which <persRef
								ref="mathews-charles">Matthews</persRef> displays his humour, by
							personating five or six characters, and mimicking as many persons, and
								<persRef ref="liston-john">Liston</persRef>, by burlesque imitation
							of the style of Opera-dancing— The <pb n="26" type="ms"/>closing piece
							was Blue-Beard, or female curiosity; of which I saw only the first Act—
							There were behind me two men, one of whom had just returned from Paris,

							should appear in British Manufactures— They said they had— That the

							Ministers, for whom Pfeffel said they could not be intended as they were
							neither Nobility nor gentry.— <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord

							<persRef ref="arbuthnot-robert">Arbuthnot</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="hamilton-william">Hamilton</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="planta-joseph">Planta</persRef>, and nearly an equal number of
							persons whom I did not know—in all a company of thirty persons—no
							Ladies— The company were received before dinner in Lord Castlereagh’s
							Cabinet— They were more than half assembled, when he appeared— The
							varieties of dress made a motley appearance, and before dinner was
							announced, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Planta went round among the
							Diplomatic guests, and requested that they would not all sit together;
							but would scatter among the others; to avoid the appearance of two
							distinct companies.— Lord Castlereagh told me that they had just
							received despatches from <persRef ref="bagot-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bagot</persRef>, by the Packet from
							New-York; but he had not yet read them— I mentioned to him that I had
							received instructions from the Government of the United States, to
							propose an additional commercial Treaty or Convention— I should soon
							address a Note to him on the subject, and should be glad to have some
							previous conversation with him, when it might suit his convenience— He
							said he should go out of town to-morrow for some days, and appointed
							next Thursday at one O’Clock to see me at the foreign Office— He
							enquired what were the objects upon which the American Government were
							desirous of treating— I said, in the first place, the old
							subject—Seamen— The President had at two successive Sessions of Congress
							recommended the passing an act for excluding foreign Seamen from our
							naval Service— An act to that effect would probably have passed at the
							last Session, but it was thought best to make the proposal to establish
							the principle with this Country, by Treaty, which would make the
							arrangement reciprocal.— It was thought by the American Government that
							the present time was peculiarly favourable for such an arrangement, as
							by a mutual exclusion of each others Sailors at present during peace,
							the questions upon which there was a difference of principle between the
							two Governments, would be altogether avoided, and a system might be
							concerted which in the Event of a future maritime War would prevent the
							collisions which were so strongly to be deprecated by both Nations— He
							said, they would be ready to receive our proposals, and to agree to any
							thing which might tend to <hi rend="italic">diminish</hi> the
							inconveniences heretofore experienced— Another subject of the proposed
							Negotiation, I said was the commerce between the United States and the
							British Colonies in the West Indies, and in North-America. By the
							operation of the Commercial convention, of 3. July 1815—connected with
							the regulations subsequently adopted by the British Government, the
							whole of that trade was exclusively carried on by British Vessels—the
							operation of which was so injurious to the United States, that it could
							not continue long in its present State— The American Government were
							desirous that it should be regulated by an amicable arrangement, and had
							therefore instructed me to propose this negotiation, in preference to,
							adopting in the first instance legislative measures to counteract the
							exclusive British measures,—He said that those exclusive measures arose,
							from the long established colonial system— It was the essential
							character of that system to confine the trade of the colonies to the
							mother Country— To admit foreigners therefore to trade with them was an
							indulgence, for which it would be necessary to expect some equivalent;
							and as the United States had no Colonies it did not appear how any
							arrangement of that nature could be made reciprocal— He enquired as with
							an air of doubt, whether there was any considerable Commerce between the
							United States, and the British Colonies in the West-Indies?— I told him
							there was a great deal, and that its present condition was such, as left
							the United States no alternative but either the regulation of it, by
							concert with Great-Britain; or by internal measures of legislation— He
							said we would converse further upon the subject at our meeting.— I
							enquired of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Planta, whether any
							Press-warrants had recently been issued— He said no; at least not to his
							knowledge— <persRef ref="aspinwall-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l:</hi> Aspinwall</persRef> had written me that there were
							rumours to that effect in circulation, and requested me to make the
							enquiry, as if it should prove true, some measures of precaution would
							be necessary for the protection of American Seamen— The dinner at Lord
							Castlereagh’s was very light— Served upon Plate and Porcelain of many
							different kinds, looking as if they had been collected from a
							pawn-broker’s shop. The Servants were all out of livery. I sat at table
							between the Chevalier de Freire the Portuguese Minister and Lord<space/>the
							latter of whom spoke French to me half the dinner time; for which he
							apologized when he finally discovered that I could speak English.— The
							hour appointed for the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince
								Regent’s</persRef> Ball was ten O’Clock, at which time, I went to
							Carlton House, by the entrance at the Horse Guards— Happening to arrive
							just at the time when the <persRef ref="charlotte2">Queen</persRef> was
							passing, the Carriage was stopped some time, before it could obtain
							admission. I was shewn immediately into the building where the Ball was
							given—a Rotunda, adjoining Carlton House, and connected with it, by a
							covered Stair-case— A large Rotunda in the form of a Marquee, with a
							Roof in the Umbrella form— It was erected two years ago, for the purpose
							of entertaining the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor of
								Russia</persRef>, the <persRef ref="frederick-william-iii">king of
								Prussia</persRef>, and the other Imperial and Royal Guests of <pb
								n="29" type="ms"/>that time— It is upwards of 100 feet in diameter;
							and would easily contain one thousand persons— There were not more than
							seven hundred present this Night— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Bourke, and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams were there already
							when I arrived. The company in general were not so punctual to the hour,
							and it was past eleven when the Queen went round the circle, arm in arm
							with the Prince Regent— The <persRef ref="charlotte">Princess Charlotte
								of Wales</persRef> was not there, having been confined the whole
							week to her chamber by indisposition— The dancing, Waltzes and
							Cotillions began about twelve O’Clock, and at half past one, the party
							went to supper— There were special tickets for the Queen’s table, to
							about one hundred and fifty persons, including the Ambassadors, but not
							the foreign Ministers of the second order. They were generally
							dissatisfied at this, and agreed to go away, without waiting for the
							supper— We assented the more readily to this, not being in the habit of
							supping. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Bourke, the Chevalier de Freire, M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Pfeffel, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams and I came
							away, together; but were obliged to wait a full half hour, before our
							Carriages could be brought up— While there, we walked to and fro about
							the Hall, occasionally meeting, and having scraps of Conversation, with
							almost all our courtly acquaintance. The most extraordinary attentions
							were shewn to <persRef ref="lieven-dorothea">Countess Lieven</persRef>,
							who was seated at the Queen’s right hand, and with whom Lord Castlereagh
							danced a Waltz— He introduced <persRef ref="u">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l:</hi> Gordon</persRef> to me, and M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bourke in the Antichamber as we were going away introduced
								<persRef ref="parker-john6">Lord Morley</persRef> to us— After some
							difficulty and delay, we obtained our Carriage went and took up Lucy at
							Craven Street, and reached home at four in the morning just before
							Sunrise.</p>

							I attempted to write in the Evening, but without success. This Evening’s

							Adams) to see the house and Garden— Lord S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
							Helen’s observed in the Note, that General Taylor mentioned the usual
							hours for seeing the house to be from ten to twelve, and from three to
							five. We left home at eleven O’Clock, and arrived at the Castle Inn at
							Windsor, before two. We found <persRef ref="joy-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joy</persRef> and his company there
							just returned from Slough where they had seen <persRef ref="herschel-william">Sir William Herschell</persRef>—
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Adams remained at the Inn while we
							went over the old uninhabited part of the Castle, and the Round Tower—
							There are a number of spacious Halls, but they have a deserted
							appearance; almost entirely stripped of furniture, and having scarcely
							any thing in them worth seeing, excepting some pictures, most of which
							are Portraits.— There are most of the kings and Queens from <persRef
								ref="henry-viii">Henry the Eighth</persRef> down to the present
							time—the Portraits by <persRef ref="holbein-hans">Holbein</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="vandyke-anthony">Vandyke</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="lely-peter">Sir Peter Lely</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="kneller-godfrey">Sir Godfrey Kneller</persRef>, are the most
							interesting— The heads of <persRef ref="erasmus-desiderius"
								>Erasmus</persRef> and of <persRef ref="luther-martin"
								>Luther</persRef> by Holbein, particularly. The flag by which the
								<persRef ref="churchill-john">Duke of Marlborough</persRef> holds
							Blenheim was displayed in one of the Halls, and the man who shewed it
							told us that the <persRef ref="wellington-arthur">Duke of
								Wellington</persRef>, had sent his tricoloured flag on the 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of June— Some of the Halls are hung
							round with old armour, muskets and swords; and among the exhibitions are
							the armour, real or pretended of <persRef ref="john-ii">John King of
								France</persRef>, and of Malcolm king of Scotland the prisoners of
							the <persRef ref="edwardofwoodstock">Black Prince</persRef>— From the
							top of the round-Tower there is an extensive view of the Country
							around—they say fourteen Counties. We went back to the Inn, between
							three and four O’Clock, and immediately proceeded to the Queen’s house
							at Frogmore.— Miss Pohl the housekeeper admitted us, on receiving
							General Taylor’s Letter, and shewed us the various apartments of the
							house from the billiard room to the dairy. The Queen never sleeps at
							this House, but comes here once or twice a day when she lodges at the
							Castle. There is nothing very remarkable in or about the house— A great
							quantity of porcelaine, principally from China— Portraits of all the <pb
								n="30" type="ms"/>Queen’s children, and of many of her Relations—
								<persRef ref="hastings-warren">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hastings’s</persRef> present of the ivory bed-stead, and three ivory
							Chairs, a present from the <persRef ref="wellesley-richard">Marquis of

								ref="elizabeth">Princess Elizabeth</persRef>—drawings by the
								<persRef ref="charlotte3">Queen of Wurtemberg</persRef>, and the
							other Princesses— A dead dwarf Oak Tree, and two round Card tables made
							of British Oak— Several collections of Books in various apartments,
							among which I particularly remarked a Junius—much handsome furniture,
							the most striking article of which was a bronze Clock, with a figure of
							the <persRef ref="titus">Emperor Titus</persRef>, and the inscription
							“Diem Perdidi.” Among the Portraits we noticed those of <persRef
								ref="darcy-mary">Lady Holdernesse</persRef>; of Lady<space/>who went to
							bring over the Queen from Germany and of <persRef ref="perceval-spencer"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Perceval</persRef>— Before we
							got through the house it was five O’Clock— We returned again to the
							Castle Inn; and thence immediately home. We took our Sons <persRef
								ref="adams-george">George</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> into our Carriage and stopped at Eaton, with the
							view to see, <persRef ref="brown-fanny">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								Brown</persRef>, with whom we were intimately acquainted at Berlin
							during our residence there. But as she was at dinner, we left Cards, and

							hour we had ordered dinner. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joy and
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Prescott</persRef>
							dined with us and then returned to London. It rained almost incessantly

						<p><date>18. VII:30. </date>The journal of yesterday employed me until
							breakfast time— Immediately after, I went to town with <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> who took <persRef
								ref="hauel-lucy">Lucy</persRef> with her. I went immediately to
							Downing Street, and was there precisely at one. <persRef
								ref="castlereagh-robert">Lord Castlereagh</persRef> was not there,
							and the Servants, attending there told me that he had sent a Note to me
							last Evening, to Craven Street— I went there and found the Note, which
							stated that the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent</persRef> had
							directed Lord Castlereagh to attend him this day between twelve and one
							O’Clock, and as he might be detained, requested me to call at the
							Foreign Office at half past one O’Clock, instead of One. After returning
							to <persRef ref="silvester-richard">Silvester’s</persRef>, and looking
							at the Seal upon which he is to engrave my device, which he says will be
							ready in three weeks, I returned to Downing Street— It was forty minutes
							past one, but Lord Castlereagh had not come in. I waited until two when
							he arrived, and received me.— I told him I had mentioned at his house
							last week, in general terms, the subject upon which I had requested this
							conference. I shewed him the Letter from <persRef ref="monroe-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>, Secretary of
							State, to me, of 21. May last, containing the authority and Instruction
							from the <persRef ref="madison-james">President</persRef> to negotiate a
							new Commercial Convention, if the British Government should be disposed
							to such a Negotiation— I said that the first and most urgent subject to
							be treated of, in the View of my Government, was that of the trade,
							between the United States, and the British Colonies, in North America,
							and the West-Indies— He enquired, and said he did not recollect how that
							had been left, by the Convention of 3. July 1815— I said that the
							British Government, had at that time declined to include it, in the <pb
								n="32" type="ms"/>Negotiation. But said Lord Castlereagh, was there
							not then some discussion concerning it?— A. [“]There was— But it was
							before I arrived in England— The conferences, your Lordship will
							recollect had commenced by Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>
							<persRef ref="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">Gallatin</persRef>; and they had proposed that
							there should be an Article in the Convention, to regulate this part of
							the trade; but it had been declined by the <persRef
								ref="robinson-frederick;goulburn-henry;adams-william">British
								Plenipotentiaries</persRef>, so that after my arrival nothing was
							said about it— The state of things however in relation to the trade
							between the United States and those Colonies was however very different
							then, from its state now— The Commerce then was allowed in the vessels
							of both Nations.— The Convention, equalized the duties upon British and
							American vessels in the intercourse between Europe and the United
							States, and thereby admitted British Vessels, into the Ports of the
							United States, upon terms of equal competition with American vessels.—
							But since that time, the exclusive system of colonial regulations had
							been resumed in the West-Indies, with extraordinary rigour— American
							Vessels had been excluded from all the Ports; and some Seizures have
							been made with such severity, that are cases upon which I shall be under
							the necessity of addressing this Government in behalf of individuals who
							have suffered and who consider themselves entitled to the restitution of
							their property. The consequence of these new regulations, as combined
							with the operation of the Commercial Convention is, that British Vessels
							being admitted into our Ports upon equal terms with our own, and then
							being exclusively received in the British West-India Ports, not only
							thus monopolized the trade between the United States and the
							West-Indies, but acquired an advantage in the direct trade from Europe
							to the United States, which defeated the main object of the Convention
							itself, of placing the shipping of the two Countries upon equal terms of
							fair competition.— In North America, the same system is pursued, by the
							Colonial Governments, and I was specially directed to notice the
							measures of the Government of Upper Canada— An Act of the Colonial
							Legislature was passed at their last Session, vesting in the Lieutenant
							Governor and Council of the Province, the power of regulating their
							trade with the United States; and immediately afterwards a new Tariff of
							duties was issued, by an order of the provincial Council dated the 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April, laying excessively heavy
							duties upon all Articles, imported into the Province from the United
							States, with the exception of certain articles of provisions of the
							first necessity; and a tonnage duty of twelve and sixpence per Ton, upon
							American vessels, which is equivalent to a total prohibition”— C. [“]I
							have not been in the way of following the measures adopted in that
							quarter; and was not aware that there had been any new regulations,
							either in the West-Indies or in North America. In time of war, I know it
							has been usual to open the Ports of the West-India, islands, to
							foreigners, merely as a measure of necessity, and it was not until your
							attempt to starve them, by your embargo acts, that they were driven to
							the resort of finding out resources from elsewhere. But in time of Peace
							it has been usual to exclude foreigners from them— What is the nature of
							your trade with them? And is it very considerable”?— A. [“]It is, my
							lord; and even in time of Peace; highly necessary to the Colonies—in
							respect to some of the imports, indispensible to their subsistance; and
							by the exports extremely advantageous to the interests of Great-Britain
							by furnishing a market for articles which she does not take herself and
							which could not be disposed of elsewhere— At the very time of which your
							Lordship speaks, during our Embargo, the Governors of the Islands, so
							far from adhering to the principle of excluding our vessels issued
							proclamations, inviting them, with promises even that the regular papers
							should not be required for their admission and encouraging them to
							violate the laws of their own Country, to carry them supplies— I mention
							this now only to shew how necessary to the Colonies this trade was felt
							to be then.— In time of Peace, it is undoubtedly not so necessary— Still
							however it is so in a high degree. The mother Country can supply them in
							part— But she does not produce some of the most important articles of
							their importation. Rice, for example and indian corn whi<unclear>ch are</unclear> the
							best and cheapest articles for the subsistance of the Negroes.— Even
							wheat and flour, and provisions generally were much more advantageously
							imported from the United States than from Europe, being so much less
							liable to take damage, in those hot climates, by the comparative
							shortness of the voyage— Their other importations from us, are of
							lumber; which is necessary for buildings upon the plantations, and which
							after the hurricanes to which the islands are frequently exposed, must
							be had in large quantities— But it is not now on the usual ground of
							your necessities, that the American Government propose that those Ports
							should be opened to American Vessels— Neither do they ask for a
							participation of the British trade with them— Great-Britain may still
							prohibit the importation from the United States, of such articles as she
							chuses to supply, herself— But they ask that American vessels, from the
							United States may be admitted, equally with British vessels, to carry
							the Articles which can be supplied only from the United States, or which
							are supplied only to them— The effect of the new regulations that I have
							mentioned, has been so injurious upon the shipping interest in America;
							and was so immediately felt, that the first impression upon the minds of
							many, was that they should be immediately met, by counteracting
							Legislative measures of prohibition—a proposal to that effect was made
							in Congress; but it was thought best to endeavour in the first instance
							to come <pb n="33" type="ms"/>to an amicable arrangement of the matter
							with the British Government if possible—immediate prohibitions would
							affect injuriously the British Colonies— They would excite irritation in
							the commercial part of the British community— The consideration
							therefore of enacting Legislative regulations was postponed, and I was
							instructed by the Government to make this proposal of a new
							Convention—[”] C. [“]The subject shall be taken as soon as possible into
							Consideration, and you may be sure, it shall be with the most earnest
							disposition in this Government, to concur in the general purpose of
							promoting the harmony, between the two Countries— But I cannot be now
							prepared to enter upon the particular points of the question, owing to
							the absence of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robinson—[”] A. [“]There
							is no immediate urgency, to enter upon the details of the Negotiation;
							and my object now is merely to give your Lordship, a general outline of
							the general objects which the American Government is desirous of
							embracing in the Negotiation— That the determination may be taken,
							whether the British Government is disposed to the discussion of those
							objects or not.— This subject of the trade with the British Colonies is
							the most pressing of any; but the great anxiety of the American
							Government, to guard against the recurrence of those causes of
							dissension which heretofore unfortunately terminated in hostility, makes
							them extremely desirous of settling if possible, by Treaty all the
							points of collision between neutral and belligerent rights, which in the
							event of a new maritime War in Europe might again arise— Blockade—
							Contraband— Visits and Searches at Sea— Colonial Trade; and that between
							the Ports of Enemies— But most of all, the case of the Seamen— The
							proposal is that each party should stipulate, not to employ in its
							merchant or naval service, the Seamen of the other—[”] C. [“]But how
							shall we avoid falling into the old difficulty of the disagreement
							between us, who we are to understand by the Seamen of the other?—do you
							propose to include in the stipulation, only native Citizens and
							Subjects, and if not how is the question to be escaped whether any act
							of naturalization can avail to discharge a man from the duties of his
							original allegiance?[”] A. “It is proposed to include in the arrangement
							only natives, and those who are on either side naturalized, already—so
							that it would not extend to any person hereafter naturalized— The number
							of naturalized persons included in it would of course be very small; for
							our Laws respecting naturalization that there are excessively few
							British Sailors, who have taken or could take the benefit of them.— So
							few, that it could be no object to Great-Britain to except them.”— C.
							[“]But by what regulation would you propose to carry the stipulation
							into effect?—[”] A— [“]If the principle be agreed to, there can be no
							difficulty in concerting regulations which would carry it into
							execution. I can now only say, that I shall be ready to agree to any
							regulations which Great-Britain may think necessary to secure the bona
							fide fulfilment of the engagement, and consistent with individual
							rights—[”] C. “Is it expected by the American Government, that by
							agreeing to this stipulation, we should abandon the right of search
							which we have heretofore used; or is the stipulation to stand by itself;
							leaving the rights of the parties as they were before?[”] A. [“]It is
							undoubtedly the object of the American Government, that the result of
							the Stipulation should ultimately be the abandonment of the practice of
							taking men from American Vessels—[”] C. [“]But then, how shall we escape
							the old difficulty— The People of this Country consider the remedy which
							we have always used hitherto, as the best and only effectual one.— I am
							not sure that it is so— With all its advantages and all its
							inconveniences, I am not myself certain that it would not be better to
							substitute something else. But such is the general opinion of the
							Nation, and there is a good deal of feeling connected with the
							sentiment. If we give up that how will it be possible to devise any
							regulation depending upon the performance of another state, which will
							be thought as efficacious as that which we have in our own hands?”* A.
							[“]I am not prepared to say that an Article could not be framed, by
							which the Parties may stipulate the principle of mutual exclusion,
							without at all affecting or referring to the rights or claims of either
							Party— Perhaps it may be accomplished, if the British Government will
							assume it as one of the objects to be arranged by the Convention—[”] C—
							[“]In that case there will not be so much difficulty— If it is a mere
							agreement of mutual exclusion, tending to diminish the occasion for
							exercising the right of search; and undoubtedly if it should prove
							effectual; it would in the end operate as an inducement to the
							forbearance to exercise the right entirely—[”] A.— [“]There is one
							point, upon which there has been much discussion between the two
							Governments, and upon which Notes have passed, between me and <persRef
								ref="bathurst-henry">Lord Bathurst</persRef>, as well as between
							your Lordship and me— It relates to Slaves carried away from the <pb
								n="34" type="ms"/>United States, by British Commanders, after the
							Peace.[”] (*N.B. The following part of the dialogue should come,
							immediately before the asterisk in the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							line from the bottom of the last page, after the word “hands”[)]— C.
							continues. “I am for myself convinced that in this respect the policy of
							the American Government has changed— That its policy formerly was to
							invite and encourage our Seamen to enter your service; but that at
							present their policy is rather to give every encouragement to your own
							Seamen; and I was in hopes that the effect of their internal,
							Legislative measures would be to diminish the necessity of our resorting
							to the right of Search—” A— “Your Lordship has made a similar
							observation to me, on a former occasion; and as it is now repeated, it
							is my duty to take particular notice of it— I do not know that any thing
							I can say will have the effect of removing the impression from your
							mind— I am nevertheless under the most perfect conviction that it is
							erroneous. The American Government never did in any manner invite or
							encourage foreign Seamen generally, or British Seamen in particular to
							enter our Service”— C— [“]I meant only to say, that their policy arose
							naturally from the circumstances—from the extraordinary, sudden and
							almost unbounded increase of your commerce and navigation, during the
							late European Wars, you had not native seamen enough to man your ships,
							and the encouragements to foreign seamen of which I spoke, followed from
							that state of things—[”] A. [“]I understand your Lordship perfectly; but
							what I assert is, my profound conviction that you are mistaken on the
							point of fact— That without knowing whether any thing I can say will
							change your opinion, I must in the most earnest manner assure you that
							it never was the policy of the American Government to encourage British
							Seamen to enter our Service. I know not how the policy of any Government
							can be manifested otherwise than by its Acts—now there never was any one
							Act, either of the Legislature, or of the Executive, which could have
							even a tendency to invite British Seamen into the American service—[”]
							C.— [“]At least then, there was nothing done to prevent them.—[”] A.
							[“]That may be, My Lord— But there is a very material distinction,
							between Giving encouragement, and doing nothing to prevent them— Our
							naturalization Laws certainly hold out to them nothing like
							encouragement. You naturalize every foreign Seaman, by the mere fact of
							two years service on board of your public ships.— Ipso facto, without
							cost or form of process.— We require five years of residence in the
							United States— Two years of <unclear>it.</unclear> notice in a Court of Record before the
							Act of naturalization is granted, and a certificate of character— Thus
							far only may be admitted: that the great and extraordinary increase of
							our commerce, to which you have alluded, had the effect of raising the
							wages of seamen excessively high—our government certainly gave no
							encouragement to this—neither did our merchants, who would surely have
							engaged their seamen at lower wages if possible— These wages, no doubt
							operated as a strong temptation to your Seamen to go in to the American
							Service; your merchant service could not afford to pay them so high— The
							wages in the king’s ships were much lower, and numbers of British Seamen
							accordingly find their way to America, and into American Vessels; but
							encouragement from the American Government they never had, in any
							manner.— They were merely not excluded—and even now, in making the
							proposal to exclude them; it is not from any change of policy, but
							solely for the purpose of giving satisfaction to Great-Britain; and of
							stopping the most abundant source of dissension with her— It proves only
							the earnestness of our desire, to be upon good terms with you.—[”] C.—
							[“]In that general disposition, it is impossible for the American
							Government, to be more desirous to promote the harmony between the
							Countries than we are—[”] A— [“]With regard to the proposal for
							excluding each other’s Seamen, I am not prepared to say &amp;c.”] “C—
							After the Peace? you mean between the signature of the Treaty of Peace,
							and the ratification of it, do you not?”— A— “No, My Lord— I mean
							Slaves, which had been taken during the War, and which after the
							ratification of the Peace, were carried away by the British Commanders,
							contrary, as the American Government conceive, to the first Article of
							the Treaty— But as the British Government appear to be decidedly of a
							contrary opinion I am directed to propose that the question be referred
							to the determination of a third party to a sovereign the common friend
							of both; a mode of arrangement already agreed upon, by the Treaty of
							Ghent, in the Event of a final difference between the parties upon other
							questions—[”] C— [“]By an Arbitration?— I was not aware that there had
							been any Slaves carried away from the United States, after the Peace;
							and as to the supposed sales by our Officers, of those that were taken;
							there are several answers of Officers, who have been referred to, of
							which I have requested <persRef ref="hamilton-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton</persRef> to send you copies.
							They are indeed expressed in very strong terms; but you will consider
							them as having been addressed to their own Government only— To the
							Admiralty, in answer to Letters sent them for their Reports upon the
							complaints— They all deny the charges in the most positive manner.—[”]
							A. [“]My Lord, the charges were of a nature to be denied; but in the
							papers which I transmitted to you, several officers were signalized by
							name—the statements implicating them were attested upon Oath; and so
							long as they are not brought to trial, their denials however positive,
							are no more than the denial of any other man—[”] C— [“]I cannot help
							thinking, that by our Laws, it was impracticable that they could have
							effected such sales as were alledged—[”] A— [“]I lately addressed to
							your Lordship, a Note, I am sorry to say a very long one, which perhaps
							you have not had time to read, but in which, I think it is proved that
							the Law for the abolition of the slave <pb n="35" type="ms"/>trade were
							neither applicable, nor applied to the slaves taken in America— And the
							copy of the decree of the Vice-Admiralty Court in Jamaica, which I
							likewise sent you proved not only an actual sale, but a mode by which
							real sales of any numbers might be effected—[”] C— [“]I do not recollect
							any such decree of the Vice-Admiralty Court; what decree was it?—[”] A.
							[“]It related to several American Slaves, taken at Sea— They were
							libelled in the Admiralty Court, with the vessel in which they were
							captured— They were delivered upon a Bail-Bond, to certain persons who
							presented themselves as Claimants, and when afterwards condemned as
							prize, the sentence of the Court directed that the penalty of the
							Bail-bond should be paid, and the Slaves were of course left in the
							possession of the claimants—that is they were substantially sold to
							them.—[”] C— [“]I have no recollection of this case; and I think it
							cannot be so—for if it were, our Philanthropists would have seized, and
							sounded it forth, that we should have no end of it.—[”] A— [“]Perhaps
							not— Your philanthropists might not chuse to notice transactions,
							connected with the operations of Government in a War, with America— They
							might not wish to appear to take part, against Officers of the Navy—[”]
							C— [“]Oh! that would not have restrained them! War or Peace; Navy or no
							Navy, the moment the slave trade became concerned, they would have had
							neither scruples, nor respect for Persons—[”] A— [“]But, as it was, My
							lord, the philanthropists at the late Session of Parliament, did press
							you very hard, to account for the increase of the black population in
							the island of Jamaica; and this Evidence to which I now refer you was
							not in their possession— It has never been published— But this is not
							the subject which the American Government proposes to refer to a
							friendly Sovereign— The whole correspondence since the Peace, on this
							subject has been very reluctantly entertained by them; nor do I see that
							it can lead to any useful result.— The impression in the United States
							with respect to some individual Officers, is indelible; and all the
							evidence hitherto collected tends to confirm the allegation originally
							made— It is not therefore the disposal of the slaves after they were
							carried away, but the carrying them away after the Peace; which it is
							proposed to refer— And these are all the subjects comprized in my
							instructions relative to a new Convention— There are other topics which
							I was desirous of noticing at this interview— Your Lordship was good
							enough to communicate to me for the information of my Government, the
							proceedings of <persRef ref="pellew-edward">Lord Exmouth</persRef>, upon
							his first visit to Algiers; and until his arrival at Tunis. You also
							informed me that he was to return to Algiers, and make a protest there
							against one Article of the Algerine Treaty with us— Since that time, the
							Public Newspapers have announced the return of Lord Exmouth to
							England—that he had made his second visit to Algiers—that circumstances
							of a hostile nature had subsequently occurred; and that a new expedition
							under Lord Exmouth is now fitting out, and soon to sail for the
							Mediterranean—[”] C— [“]I have not the least hesitation in telling you
							every thing that has occurred since our last communication to you.— Lord
							Exmouth returned after having been to Tunis and Tripoli, to Algiers— He
							made then the protest against that Article of your Treaty— <persRef
								ref="agha-omar">The Dey</persRef> fully admitted the validity of the
							prior Treaty with us, and said that he could easily settle that matter
							with you— He said that Treaty with you was suspended; on account of some
							Ship that had not been sent to him— But what is the state of your
							relations there now?—[”] A. [“]The Treaty, as he said, is suspended.—
							The ship, of which he spoke, was an Algerine Brig, taken by an American
							Squadron off Carthagena last Summer— There was a frigate and a brig
							taken; and both were sent into Carthagena— At the peace it was agreed
							that they should be restored; precisely in the state, in which they
							were, at Carthagena. They were restored, but the Spaniards for some time
							detained the Brig, on the allegation that she had been taken within the
							Spanish Jurisdiction— They did however afterwards give her up—[”] C.
							[“]Well, but if he has now got the vessel, what difficulty can
							remain?—[”] A. [“]I suppose the pretence of delay— But after the first
							visit of Lord Exmouth to Algiers, the Dey, thinking his Treaties had
							settled him in Peace, with Great-Britain, Naples and Sardinia, concluded
							that it was time to put it an end to his Treaty with the United States,
							and it was accordingly the very next day that he first refused to
							acknowledge it—[”] C— [“]Well— He acknowledged the validity of the
							Articles in our Treaty, and said that he would settle it accordingly
							with you— That transaction therefore was all finished.— But afterwards,
							Lord Exmouth, having obtained from the <persRef ref="mahmudibnmuhammad"
								>Beys of Tunis</persRef>, and of <persRef ref="qaramanli-yusuf"
								>Tripoli</persRef> those declarations that they would not in future
							make Slaves of Christian Prisoners, demanded a similar declaration of
							the <persRef ref="hassan-bashaw">Dey of Algiers</persRef>— This was
							entirely a new and unexpected thing, and the Dey said that he could not
							make such an engagement without the consent of the Grand Seignor, whose
							interests as well as those of the Dey’s Government would be deeply
							affected by it— After this the Dey appears to have had the impression
							that Lord Exmouth intended to enforce his demand <pb n="36" type="ms"
							/>by measures of hostility—perhaps because the English Consul had gone
							on board the fleet— Some English Officers were insulted and exposed to
							ill-treatment at Algiers— Orders of hostility were sent to Oran and to
							Bona— But Lord Exmouth thought he had gone as far as his Instructions
							would warrant— That he could not commence hostilities without further
							authority from his Government.— He therefore renewed the Negotiation at
							which it was agreed that the Dey should have time to consult the
								<persRef ref="mahmudii">Sultan at Constantinople</persRef> upon the
							proposal for abolishing Christian Slavery— He made many apologies for
							the orders sent to Oran and Bona— Counter-orders were immediately sent.
							The vessels taken at Oran were immediately restored— But Bona, being
							more to the Eastward, the counter order unfortunately arrived too late.—
							The first order had been to secure the persons of the Christians, and it
							is said their resistance to it, produced the unfortunate Event, of which
							you have seen the account— Since that Lord Exmouth has returned to
							England— We are now fitting out an expedition for the Mediterranean,
							under his command— We expect he will soon sail; it is not in my power to
							communicate at present the precise tenour of his Instructions, but from
							all these circumstances that have occurred our regard for the general
							interest, and the cause of the other European States has been manifested
							in the clearest manner—[”] A.— [“]I have mentioned this subject, My
							lord, because, the former proceedings of Lord Exmouth having had an
							immediate and powerful effect upon the state of our Relations with
							Algiers, and supposing that his future Operations there may again have
							an effect upon them no less powerful, I thought it proper to suggest to
							you, that the Government of the United States would take it as a mark of
							good-neighbourhood, if you would communicate to me from time to time so
							much of his movements and of the measures of this Government directing
							them, as there may be no particular motive for withholding.—[”] N.B. To
							this Lord Castlereagh made no reply, but drew up his feet, as if he was
							about to rise from his chair— The servants had told me that he was to
							attend a Cabinet Council, ordered at two O’Clock; and it was now near
							three— One of the red-morocco despatch-boxes, had been brought to him by
							a servant a few minutes before, which he had opened, and taken a paper
							from it, at which he had frequently cast his eyes while we were talking.
							I saw his impatience, and rising from my Chair, said—[“]I have received
							a Letter from Liverpool, complaining that there are still levied upon
							Merchandize sold at Auction, when imported in American Vessels a duty of
							five per Cent which is not levied when the Goods are imported in British
							Vessels.—[”] C— [“]I agreed with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Robinson, before he left town, that is, six days ago, that this should
							be remitted, and he was to write to the Treasury accordingly— If not,
							send me a Memorandum of it, and I will attend to it— We consider that
							and the matter of the Iron, as standing much on the same foundation, and
							we are determined to do every thing on our part, to give the Convention
							its full effect on the most liberal principles, trusting that the same
							disposition exists on the part of the American Government—[”] A.—
							[“]What does your Lordship particularly refer to, concerning Iron.—[”]
							C— [“]a discrimination of duties in the United States, between hammered
							Iron, and rolled Iron.— The preparation of the Iron in Sweden, it seems
							is usually by hammering; in this Country it is performed by rolling— The
							duty upon rolled iron, being heavier than upon the hammered iron, falls
							therefore upon the locality more than upon the Article; and operates to
							the disadvantage of the British Manufacture, and to favour that of
							Sweden—[”] A. [“]I had one thing more to mention— Your Lordship
							recollects the case of an American, named <persRef ref="cooke-george"
								>George Cook</persRef> (C. A very bad fellow, I believe) whose
							Establishment in Africa, was broken up by an English Military party from
							Sierra Leone, and concerning whom; at the instance of his agent, a
								<persRef ref="page-w">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Page</persRef>,
							I addressed you a note.—[”] C. [“]Yes.—[”] A. [“]I received an answer
							from your Lordship, that this Government had determined to leave him to
							his remedy at Law, against the <persRef ref="maxwell-charles">Governor
								of Sierra-Leone</persRef>—[”] C— [“]You did—[”] A. [“]A process was
							accordingly served upon Governor Maxwell in the month of April, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Page now applies again for my Offices— He
							says there is a British Officer named <persRef ref="u"
								>Appleton</persRef> now at the Island of Guernsey, whose Evidence is
							material to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook’s cause, and who he
							apprehends is going away— Page therefore has written a letter to Lord
							Bathurst to ask that Appleton may not be permitted to go, until Cook can
							have had an opportunity to obtain his testimony, and he requests me to
							support him in this demand—[”] C— [“]I shall see Lord Bathurst
							immediately and will speak to him on the subject.—[”] A— [“]And with
							regard to the proposal for negotiating a new commercial Convention, I
							shall take it as a favour, if your Lordship will let me know the
							determination of his Majesty’s Government, as soon as it may be
							convenient—[”] C. [“]You may rely upon having it, without one moment of
							unnecessary delay.—[”] I took my leave, and on passing through the entry
							of the Office, saw by the Clock that it was just upon the stroke of
							three— I returned to Craven Street, where I found a Letter from <persRef
								ref="maury-james">J. Maury</persRef>, Consul at Liverpool, enclosing
							an account for postage.— The Carriage was to come for us at a quarter
							past four— I went and paid a visit to <persRef ref="bollmann-justus"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bollmann</persRef> at N. 16.
							Buckingham Street, intending to walk from thence, and expecting the
							Carriage would overtake me in Hyde Park— I found D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bollmann with one of <pb n="37" type="ms"/>his daughters
							whom he introduced to me. By his Conversation I found that he was
							mortified and soured by the disappointment of the projects with which he
							went to the United States last Autumn— He spoke of the dreadful state of
							Affairs in the United States, in relation to the finances, the
							circulating medium, and the overwhelming floods of depreciated bank
							paper; in which he concurs too well with all the other accounts that I
							have heard of late—but he considers the evil as irretrievable, which I
							hope it is not— He says that <persRef ref="dallas-alexander">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dallas</persRef>, the Secretary of the
							Treasury, was foiled in the principal object of his Bank; which was a
							Secret design to introduce Treasury Notes, as the circulating medium of
							the Country— But Congress took the alarm, and struck out that part of
							the plan, by which he would have accomplished that, the consequence of
							which will be that the Bank, when organized will be able to do no
							business, and then will come with a petition to Congress, to have their
							powers enlarged— But a redemption from the depreciated paper, he holds
							to be utterly impracticable. He said the Government had declined the
							offer from Austria about the ships at Trieste—preferring to build 74 gun
							ships at an expence of 500,000 dollars each, to purchasing them at
							100,000. He told me he had now come here, upon some new project of a
							manufacture; and that he should stay at least two years in Europe— I
							doubt whether he intends ever to return to the United States again— On
							leaving him I walked nearly to the Hammersmith Turnpike, when concluding
							that the Carriage must have started before me, I mounted upon the Dicky
							of a Windsor Stage, and rode to Kew-Bridge— From thence I walked again,
							reached home at half past six; found M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Adams had got home, and that our Company for dinner were all arrived—
							They were Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi>

							this prophecy had alarmed so many weak people, that the Police of the
								<persRef ref="pius-vii">Pope’s</persRef> Government had found it
							necessary to interpose, and the prophet had been imprisoned— The effect
							and agitation of this Story has been very considerable both in France
							and England.— The churches and Chapels have been unusually crowded; at
							Paris, public Prayers have been ordered for favourable weather; and not
							ten days since in the City of London, a Coroner’s inquest found a

							aged 62. a Cook maid, who hung herself in a fit of melancholy, at the

							to the soul— The first of these only were now considered, and the sequel
							was promised for a future occasion— Our <persRef

							obtained without the presence or residence of both parties, and

								Wallington</persRef> came in while we were there; and spoke of
								<persRef ref="penn-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William

							daughters— He was this day less ill humoured in his Conversation about

							of the <persRef ref="george-iv">Prince Regent’s</persRef> intention to
							be divorced; of an expected change in the Ministry, and the like— He
							promised to send me his pamphlet about Banks, circulating medium &amp;c—

							introduced to me, as his Cousin a <persRef ref="ward-john">M<hi

							of some distinction, who Lord Limerick told me was self-educated. For he
							said that although in the theory the sons of Peers ought to be better

								ref="ward-william2">Lord Dudley</persRef> and Ward, and at the age
							of seventeen, discovering that he was perfectly ignorant of every thing
							worth knowing, had commenced his application with great assiduity and
							had educated himself— The Duke of Cumberland spoke to me and asked me to
							introduce him to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams— The Duke and
							Duchess both spoke to her, and treated her with much politeness; on
							first going into the Hall, <persRef ref="stewart-amelia">Lady
								Castlereagh</persRef> was sitting at the side of the Duchess on a
							Sopha— Count Jenison at my request asked Lady Castlereagh to present

							and consequently arrived at the Palace by the side entrance door. We
							were just in Season.— The Company, and the ceremonies were as nearly as

							received at the Queen’s Court— The <persRef ref="augustusfrederick">Duke

							keeps her confined to her chamber. The <persRef
								ref="vonjacobikloest-konstans">Prussian Minister</persRef> was

							interested himself in favour of the Duchess, who was sister to his
								<persRef ref="louiseauguste">late Queen</persRef>, and first married

							hour. The Duke and Duchess then went off in a travelling Chariot for his
							seat at Bagshot, and the Queen returned with the Regent, the Princes and
							Princesses, and walked round the Circle in the Hall, receiving the
							Congratulations of the company.— After this the company passed into an
							adjoining room, called the Japan chamber, where refreshments were
							served— At half past ten we came away, with the company generally, and
							as we descended the great staircase a large slice of wedding cake,
							rolled up in paper was given to every person to take home. We reached

								>Captain Cunningham</persRef>, in the King’s Bench Prison— Walk to

							this day, made the ground so damp, that we were almost immediately
							compelled to take refuge in the house— <persRef ref="cook-william"

								<persRef ref="u">His daughter</persRef> is recovering fast from the

							pledge from <persRef ref="bathurst-henry">Earl Bathurst</persRef>, that
							if a subpoena was served upon Appleton, he should not be prevented from
							obeying it, by absence on the public service. But Appleton is in
							Guernsey, out of the local jurisdiction of the Court of King’s Bench, in
							which the cause of Cook against <persRef ref="maxwell-charles"
								>Maxwell</persRef> is to be tried. Page therefore this day, with the
							advice of his Solicitor, has this day written to Earl Bathurst, and
							enclosed to him the subpoena to Appleton, with a copy for service, to
							accompany the order which may be sent for his obedience to it— Page had
							some suspicions, owing to my not having received until Monday Lord
							Castlereagh’s Note, dated last Thursday; and owing to the condition set
							by Earl Bathurst, of the service of a Subpoena, where he knew the Court
							had no jurisdiction; but I assured him I was convinced the delay of the
							note was accidental, and that I had no reason to suppose, from any thing
							that had ever before passed between this Government and me, that it was
							meant to evade the promise to detain Appleton, by affixing a condition
							to it, which it was known could not be performed— But I told him that
							the impression upon the Ministers, was, that Cook had been in fact a
							slave-trader of the worst kind. That his Establishment was solely for
							that traffic, and that the only wrong of the British Officers in
							destroying it had been the trespass upon the Jurisdiction. Page said
							that Cook’s innocence could be proved, and that would be the object of
							his suit— Maxwell was unable to pay large damages even if a jury should
							give them; but he would have the whole trial taken down in short-hand,
							and then appeal to the justice of the British Parliament.— On going away
							he told me that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith had charged him
							with a message of a very painful nature; which was that he had this
							morning received Letters with information of the decease of <persRef

						<p><date>26. V:45. </date>Anniversary of my Marriage day— Since which
							nineteen years have passed away— I brought up at last the arrears of my
							Journal in May and closed the fourth Volume.— The increasing difficulty
							that I experience in writing with my own hand, has sufficiently
							convinced me that it cannot be long before I shall be compelled either
							to cease keeping this Diary altogether, or of reducing within the
							smallest compass the record of every day.— The idea occurred to me, of
							beginning to keep a separate minute; allotting one line to every day,
							and by an arrangement which would give one page to every Month— A
							subsequent idea was, to carry this abstract backwards as well as
							forwards and to make it as far as I may be able an Index to all my
							Journals.— In November 1779. in the thirteenth year of my age, I first
							began to keep a Journal— It was upon embarking on board the French
							Frigate la Sensible, at Boston for Brest, though we landed at Ferrol in
							Spain. But easy as this practice of journalizing appears to be, it
							requires one quality not very common among men; and yet scarcer among
							boys—Perseverance— I had it not— My journal soon became irksome and I
							dropped it— Not however for any length of time— I resumed it again in
							1780. in July, on leaving Paris with <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>, to go to Holland—but soon drop’d and resumed it
							again— At various periods of my life I did the same; and from my first
							effort in 1779 until 1795, I believe there was never at any one time six
							months of intermission, and seldom six Months of unintermitted journal.—
							It was kept sometimes on loose sheets of paper, sometimes in paper
							covered books and sometimes in bound volumes of various dimensions.
							Several years I followed the practice which I now expect will be my last
							resort, of giving one line to every day, and one page for each Month— At
							other times I attempted to note only the days upon which something
							remarkable occurred; once or twice a week for example— This I soon found
							the most impracticable of all—that is it soon slided into total neglect.
							My last attempt was on the first of January 1795. Since which I have
							kept my journal, I think without intermission of a day. I began it
							however in a small duodecimo, leather covered book, which I ran through
							in two Months. I then concluded to use Volumes of the small Quarto form—
							Small enough to be portable, and large and thick enough to contain a
							considerable portion of time—several years, in each Volume— The first
							and second of these Volumes containing the Diary from 1. March 1795. to
							4. August 1809. I left in a trunk in the charge of <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef> at Boston, when I sailed for
							Russia— The preceding loose sheets, Sybil leaves, interleaved Almanacks,
							and motley volumes of all sizes, are many of them lost, and the rest, in
							that same trunk— On the first of this Month I began in a separate
							Volume, at page 301. the Index to my Diary for the future— And this day
							after closing my late arrears I commenced the retrospective Index,
							beginning with the immediately preceding Month, and proposing to allow
							five days to make out the Index for each previous month— I wrote Letters
							also to <persRef ref="cresswell-richard;addams-richard">Cresswell and Addams</persRef>
							the Proctors at Doctors Commons, returning them the note from <persRef
								ref="jamesandjohndunlop">J. &amp; J. Dunlop</persRef> to them, which
							they had sent me—to the <persRef ref="monroe-james">Secretary of

							dinner to Ealing, and across the fields, returning by Hanwell, and after
							dinner in the garden.</p>

						<p><date>28. VIII: </date>Our Breakfast hour was this morning so late that
							on going to attend Church at Ealing, I found the Clock at forty minutes
							past eleven— As it begins precisely at eleven, it was too late for
							attendance at the Morning service. I came home, and attended in due
							Season at the service of the afternoon.— Prayers for the seventh Sunday
							after Trinity were read by <persRef ref="carr-colston">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Carr</persRef>, and with them the
							Prayer for fair weather— This prayer has been prescribed in this
							Country, and a similar prayer has been ordered in France. The Sermon was
							preached by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Warry</persRef>, from Philippians IV:4. “Rejoice in the Lord alway:
							and again I say rejoice.” The prayers of the afternoon service are read
							in forty minutes— The sermon about twenty— The Morning prayer, with the
							Litany and the portion of the Communion which is read every Sunday,
							usually takes one hour— Many of the prayers of the Church of England are
							very good; but others are susceptible of reformation— The repetition of
							the same prayer four or five times in one service, even though it be the
							Lord’s Prayer, is more tedious than edifying— The collect of the day is
							always read twice in the morning, and once in the afternoon service.— If
							regular forms of prayer should be used at all, in public worship, they
							should be drawn up with so much variety that no one prayer should be
							twice read on the same day. The only use that I can perceive in the
							perpetual variations of posture, kneeling, standing and sitting, is its
							tendency to guard the auditory from falling asleep. The part which the
							People take in the reading of the service may have the same effect, but
							in practice it falls into a mere mechanical operation. Sometimes the
							People, repeat over the Priests words, immediately after him; sometimes
							as in the Litany and Communion they come in with an ejaculation at the
							close of each supplication which he reads—and sometimes as in reading
							the Psalms, the Te Deum &amp;c. the Priest and People alternate with
							each other, he reading one verse and they the next— In all these cases
							the part read by the People is and must be, like the chattering of
							monkies; a chaos of confused, inarticulate sounds. The only predominant
							effect upon the ear is that of a canting whine. For however well the
							clergyman may read his part, the Clerk, and parish boys and girls the
							only persons who actually answer for the People, read it and can read it
							no otherwise. It often happens that the Priest or People, or both are
							impatient to get through, and then they encroach upon each other’s time;
							so that while the People are reading one verse of a Psalm, the Priest is
							reading the next; or while they are saying Lord have mercy upon us, and
							incline our Hearts to keep this Law, he is reading the next Commandment—
							This occurs in a striking manner here, when <persRef ref="u">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bond</persRef> reads the service;
							though he himself affects to be a reader of the first order— But it is a
							very common fault. The attendants at Church generally do not join in
							reading aloud the People’s part— Many of them also dispense with
							kneeling, in- <pb n="43" type="ms"/>instead of which they sit, so that
							the prayers intended to be marked with the greatest reverence, are
							attended with the least— There are two odd usages at the English Church
							service, which I have observed in no other Country—one is that every
							person kneels or puts himself in an attitude as if he was saying a
							private prayer of his own, for about half a minute— The men generally
							stand, and hold their hats up before their faces—whisper a prayer into
							their hats— The other is a slight genuflexion, or bowing of the head, at
							the naming of our Lord Jesus Christ in the creed.— A sign of worship
							never shewn at the name of the father or of the Holy Ghost— The Church
							this afternoon was thin— <persRef ref="nicholas-george2">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholas’s</persRef> family were
							there, having returned from their visit to Monmouthshire. <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> has been troubled
							with a cough, from the morning after the <persRef ref="williamfrederick"
								>Duke of Gloucester’s</persRef> wedding— The <persRef
								ref="sophiamatilda">Princess</persRef> immediately after the
							Ceremony had a faint turn— The window and the door behind her were
							thrown open, while the heat in the room was excessive. This must have
							occasioned M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams’s cough, for which she
							was this day bled, and did not go out. We walked in the Garden after
							dinner.</p>
