						<p><date>1. V:45. </date>Tuesday. The Letter which I received last evening
							from <persRef ref="bellesandharold">Belles and Harrold</persRef> made it
							necessary for me to go this morning to London— Just before leaving home
							I received Letters from <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="adams-abigail">mother</persRef>, and with the latter
								<persRef ref="norton-jacob">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Norton’s</persRef> funeral Sermon, upon the death of <persRef
								ref="tufts-cotton2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tufts</persRef>—
							The Letters are dated 2. and 3. May, and appear to have been brought by
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks</persRef>. He
							perhaps thought them only Letters of introduction, and did not think it
							necessary to forward them upon his arrival in England— I went to London
							in the Curricle, and read the Sermon upon the way. Went first to the
							Foreign Office. Met in the Anti-chamber, the <persRef
								ref="freire-cipriano">Chevalier de Freire</persRef>, with <persRef
								ref="desousaholstein-pedro">Count Palmella</persRef>, and a
							Secretary of the Russian Embassy.— After waiting a full half hour I saw
							the <persRef ref="hamilton-william">Under-Secretary of State
								Hamilton</persRef>. Spoke to him about the warrant for the
							exportation of machinery for the Mint of the United States. Hamilton has
							just returned after an absence of two or three Months, and knew nothing
							of the state of the business of the Office— <persRef ref="planta-joseph"
								>Planta</persRef> is gone with <persRef ref="castlereagh-robert"
								>Lord Castlereagh</persRef> to Ireland— I mentioned my first Note to
							Lord Castlereagh, about the mint machinery—the Act of Parliament, passed
							in consequence of that application; a printed copy of which I had with
							me, and shewed him— My second Note to Lord Castlereagh after the act,
							and the verbal answer of Lord Castlereagh and Planta that the answer had
							been given. But I had no written answer; the intended exporters had now
							written to me to ask for the warrant for exportation, and I came to
							enquire whether the order was now in possession of the Officers of the
							Customs at Liverpool, and if not that it might be immediately
							despatched; as the machinery would be there in a day or two; and the
							vessel in which it was to be exported, would be ready to sail by the
							sixth or seventh of this Month— Hamilton told me that according to their
							forms <pb n="81" type="ms"/>of business, the warrant for the exportation
							must be issued from the Home department, and signed by <persRef
								ref="addington-henry2">Lord Sidmouth</persRef>. I observed that the
							Act of Parliament authorized anyone of the Secretaries of State to issue
							the warrant— He said that although the authority was general, it was
							exercised only by the Secretary for the Home Department. In this however
							Hamilton was mistaken— He sent to several of the Clerks, to enquire what
							had been done upon my application; at last <persRef ref="bidwell-john"
								>Bidwell the Son</persRef> came, and he sent him to the Treasury to
							ascertain whether the order to the Customs had been issued there. My
							Note to Lord Castlereagh could not be found, nor any record in the
							Office, relating to it— While Bidwell was gone, I spoke to Hamilton
							about the Notes which I had lately sent to Lord Castlereagh, and to
							which I had not received answers— He said he had just been reading my
							note proposing the negotiation of a commercial Treaty. I told him I had
							received a Letter from Lord Castlereagh, postponing the answer to that;
							but the Notes to which I referred were one respecting the refusal of the
							Officers of the Customs to return the extra Tonnage duties levied upon
							American vessels, unless they came directly from, or were bound directly
							to Ports of the United States— And one to request that the destitute
							American Seamen, shipped by order of the Consul on board of American
							vessels for conveyance to America may not be counted as part of the
							number of passenger’s limited to one person for every five tons of the
							vessels burthen— He said this case was so clear that he wondered there
							should have been a necessity for any application about it. I told him
							there was another practice of the Officers of the Customs on the subject
							of which I had not yet addressed a written Note, because I thought it
							best to mention it in the first instance verbally— I thought they were
							not warranted in the practice by the Law. I had been inclined to advise
							the parties interested to contest it at Law, by a process I supposed in
							the Court of Exchequer— But before giving this advice, I had preferred
							stating the case to the Government; so that if they thought proper they
							might issue an order to the customs to alter their practice, and make it
							conform to the Law—which would save the trouble and expence of a suit.
							The practice was, of allowing only one passenger for every five tons, of
							a vessel of what they call the unoccupied tonnage—that is, of the part
							in which there is no Cargo— I shewed him the two Acts of Parliament, and
							pointed out to him how the Officers of the Customs had unwarrantably
							applied the restriction in one Section of the first Act, to another
							Section, where it was not included— It was sometime before he understood
							me. He thought at first I meant to contend that by the new Act American
							Vessels were placed on a more advantageous footing than British Vessels;
							and said that if the Custom-house should be now obliged to alter their
							practice, it would only make it necessary to pass a new Act of
							Parliament at the next Session. When I had fully explained to him the
							real question, and he had attentively read over the provisions of both
							the Acts, he took minutes of them; and requested me to send him a
							Memorandum, not in the form of an official note; but exhibiting my view
							of the proper Construction of the Acts, and said he would attend to it—
							I enquired also about the exequatur for <persRef ref="visger-herman">H.
								Visgers</persRef> Commission as American Consul at Bristol; and
							after much research was told it was ready, and would be delivered if I
							would send for it to-morrow. Bidwell at length returned, and said the
							order from the Treasury to the Custom-House, for the exportation of the
							Mint Machinery had been sent on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							August. but it was still doubtful to me, whether it had been received by
							the <persRef ref="swainson-john">Collector at Liverpool</persRef>; so at
							the recommendation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamilton, I went
							myself with Bidwell to the Treasury-Office, where a Clerk shewed me the
							record of the order from the Treasury to the Commissioners of the
							Customs, issued the 16<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August, upon a
							Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Planta. So it seems no
							signature of Lord Sidmouth, nor even of Lord Castlereagh was necessary
							in this case. The proxy of Planta’s name was sufficient. Still I had no
							certainty that the order had been sent to the Collector at Liverpool—
							Bidwell said it must have gone of course; but the Treasury Clerk
							referred me to the Secretary of the Commissioners of the Customs, at the
							Custom-House in the City. It was now close upon four O’Clock, and too
							late to go down there this day— After calling at two shops for the Bills
							of the Articles to be sent to <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">T. B.
								Johnson’s</persRef>, at a shoemaker’s and at <persRef ref="u"
								>Williams</persRef> the Stationer’s for his Bill, I went to my
							Office in Craven-Street— The Coachman complained of being ill, and
							requested me to let him wait, and return home without putting up the
							horses. I found at my Office <persRef ref="cook-john4">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook</persRef>, the Navy
								chaplain—<persRef ref="colburn-abia">E. Colburn</persRef> the father
							of <persRef ref="colburn-zerah">Zerah</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="connell-john3">Connell</persRef>. D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Cooke wanted to borrow money of me again— I told him that I
							wished him to wait until I shall know that his former Bill has been
							accepted— He will call upon me again— Colburn wanted me to aid him in a
							plan to get subscriptions for the memoirs of Zerah, to contain the
							disclosure of his secret, in the United States— He has he says at last
							found patronage here. <pb n="82" type="ms"/>At the recommendation of a
							gentleman who is himself a mathematician, and to whom Zerah’s secret was
							disclosed, the <persRef ref="hervey-frederick">Earl of Bristol</persRef>
							has subscribed seventy five pounds a year for five years to complete
							Zerah’s education at Westminster School, where he is now placed, and has
							promised to double that subscription to carry him through the University
							of Cambridge— But the father wishing to obtain subscriptions in America
							for the Book, begged me to recommend persons to him in America who would
							be willing to promote the subscription, and to whom as well as to myself
							he would consent to have Zerah’s discovery made known. I declined for my
							own part the communication of the secret, and advised him to apply to
							respectable booksellers in the Cities of the United States to promote
							his subscription and to make it payable at the delivery of the book— He
							will call upon me again. Connell complained of being quite unwell. He
							said he saw it stated in a Philadelphia Newspaper, that <persRef
								ref="girard-stephen">Stephen Girard</persRef>, had filled up the
							subscription to the Bank of the United States, by taking three Millions
							of the Stock which were wanted to complete it, upon the returns to the
							first subscription— I requested <persRef ref="smith-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> to ascertain to-morrow
							whether the order for the exportation of the mint machinery has been
							dispatched from the Custom House to Liverpool, and to let me know.—
							There was a small packet containing three numbers of <persRef
								ref="cobbett-william">Cobbett’s</persRef> New-York Register, marked
							as a ship-Letter from Portsmouth, with a charge upon it of more than
							thirteen shillings for Postage.— <persRef ref="reeves-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Reeves</persRef> had been at the
							Office— It was about seven O’Clock, when I reached home, where I found
								<persRef ref="nicholas-george2">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Nicholas’s</persRef> eldest daughter <persRef
								ref="nicholas-caroline">Caroline</persRef>. She dined and spent the

						<p><date>2. VI:45. </date>My Journal engrossed so much of this day that
							until dinner time I could write nothing else. It was half past five when
							I walked out; yet I had not completed the Journal of yesterday. The
							weather was bad almost all the day; which prevented <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> from going to London
							as she had intended. Nevertheless we had visits from <persRef
								ref="lieven-christopher;lieven-dorothea">Count and Countess

							are passing some days. The Count told me that he expected the <persRef

							this month or the beginning of the next; and <persRef
								ref="nicolai-pavel">Baron Nicolaï</persRef>, the late Secretary of
							his embassy was coming with him— The Count said he was much gratified at
							this; for Nicolaï having been so long in this Country, would take off
							from his hands much of the trouble which would otherwise have fallen to
							his share— He spoke as if had been sufficiently weary of his attendance
							upon the <persRef ref="alexander-i">Emperor</persRef> when he was here;
							and much disgusted with that upon the <persRef ref="catherinepavlovna"
								>Grand Duchess Catherine</persRef>; who he said was here so long—who

							here that profound respect of etiquette, to which she had always been
							accustomed on the Continent, and to which she was tenaciously attached
							was continually imagining she was slighted, and then he was called upon
							to explain and to remove her dissatisfactions.— The Count also enquired
							what was the state of our relations and negotiations with Algiers and
							with Naples.— I received this morning a Letter from <persRef

								ref="baker-david2">Baker</persRef>, and our Sons <persRef

							after half an hours walk in the rain, which compelled me to return home,
							I took up <persRef ref="maury-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Maury’s</persRef> account, with the vouchers which occupied me until
							the Ladies returned. <persRef ref="rotch-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rotch</persRef> came out with <persRef
								ref="u">his Son</persRef>, whom he introduced to me, and who he said
							had something to communicate to me of so secret a nature that he
							himself, could not be present at its disclosure— He therefore went out
							and walked in the garden while the young man was unfolding to me, his
							mystery. It was a proposal from a person now an officer in the British
							Artillery; but not born a British subject; and in principle an ardent
							republican— He has a great mechanical genius, and has invented an
							improvement in fire arms which has been approved by the Board of
							Ordnance, and adopted, but for which, by the report of a Committee of
							Officers appointed to examine it, but every one of them utterly ignorant
							of the first principles of mechanics, he had received a compensation, of
							only five hundred pounds, a sum in his own opinion so inadequate to the
							merit of the invention that it has given him extreme disgust. But he had
							another, and a far more important invention in reserve. Its principal
							use would be in the naval department, but it might also be made useful
							for war by land. He had written a private Letter to the <persRef
								ref="frederickaugustus">Duke of York</persRef>, proposing it in
							general terms; to which the Duke had answered, by requesting of him a
							communication in his official capacity— That having been made, the Duke
							finding that the chief use of the invention was to be for the Navy had
							referred him to the Lords of the Admiralty, and there, <persRef
								ref="croker-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Croker</persRef>
							had referred him back to the board of Ordnance, where he would be sure
							to fall again into the hands of the Committee of ignorant Officers, who
							had so much undervalued his former invention— He had therefore
							determined to offer his invention to the Russian Government; but young
							Rotch having met him, and conversing with him upon the subject had
							prevailed upon <pb n="83" type="ms"/>him to make the proposal to me, of
							offering it to the Government of the United States. He came therefore to
							enquire if I, should be willing to transmit the offer to the American
							Government. The invention, is a projectile, upon a new principle; but of
							such simplicity that an idea of it could not be given without disclosing
							the secret; yet of such prodigious effects, impossible to avoid, that
							with it any sloop of war would be more than a match for any line of
							battle ship. I told young Rotch that the very magnitude of promise, in
							such an invention, was a motive for distrusting it. After seeing what
							had been accomplished by the Steam-engine, it was scarcely possible to
							say what could not be effected by an application of mechanical powers;
							but great projects were so common, and great discoveries so rare, that I
							should not incline to make even a proposal of this kind known to the
							American Government, without some further knowledge of the person
							proposing it; and something specific as to the nature and extent of the
							compensation which he would require or expect— He said that the inventor
							had been a major in the British service; but having been twice
							unfortunately involved in duels, and consequently twice compelled to
							quit his regiment, and rise again from the lowest rank, he was now only
							a lieutenant. He could not leave the British Service, without having a
							certainty of employment elsewhere; and he had told him that if his
							invention should be approved and adopted by the American Government, he
							thought he might fairly expect for it the rank of a lieutenant Colonel
							in their army. I said that would be very difficult, as he must be aware,
							how ungracious it would be to the Officers of our Army to have a
							foreigner thus promoted over their heads— However, I said if the
							character of the invention could be specified so that its probable
							usefulness could be fairly judged of, and the inventor would state
							specifically what he would demand for his compensation, I would mention
							it to the Government; particularly with the consideration that the
							inventor though now an officer in the British service, is not a native
							British Subject— For had he been such, I should not consider it as a
							fair procedure, from one Government to another, to hold out any
							encouragement to him in the design of withdrawing him from one service
							to enter the other. Rotch is to report to him my answer, and I shall
							hear from him again— But it is another of the projects from the Limbo of
							Vanity— <persRef ref="smith-john">J. A. Smith</persRef> enclosed me a
							Letter from <persRef ref="grubb-james">Grubb</persRef> to him;
							mentioning that he had ascertained at the Custom-House, that the order
							to Liverpool for the exportation of the Mint Machinery was dispatched on
							the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August. Spent the Evening at

							degree, (posco gradum) as of right.</p>

						<p><date>6. VII: </date>I attended Church this morning, alone. Prayers for
							the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after Trinity were read by
								<persRef ref="wallington-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wallington</persRef>; the Communion service by <persRef

							and the Sermon was preached by <persRef ref="milman-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Milman</persRef>, from Psalm CXLIV:3.
							“Lord, what is Man.” the drift of the discourse was to urge the peculiar
							propriety of calling upon the Lord to say what is man, instead of asking
							the same question of Earth, or of Ocean, and the preacher told his
							auditory in some detail what Earth and Ocean would answer, if the
							question should be asked of them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Milman
							passes for a Genius, because he has written a laughable tragedy, and a
							lampoon against <persRef ref="bonaparte-napoleon">Buonaparte</persRef>—
							He certainly has a fanciful, though it appears to me a fantastic turn of
							mind. His Sermons are all his own— But there is nothing in them— The
							prayer against the plague of waters was this day read again, and seems
							to be more necessary than ever. The rains have scarcely any cessation.
							The road between this and London was yesterday deeper than I found it
							any one day, the whole of last Winter— It rained the greatest part of
							this day. The <persRef ref="adams-john2;adams-charles2">boys</persRef>
							went to the Boston Terrace Chapel, and afterwards walked to Richmond
							Hill— I walked out before dinner, but was obliged to return from
							Brentford by the Rain. After dinner <persRef

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook</persRef> the Musician was

							Chiefly sacred music. There was thunder and lightening this Night.</p>

							Stopped at the British Gallery in Pall Mall and enquired for <persRef

							both of them have been urging me for some time to write something for

							indispensable— In my walk of the day before yesterday, I strained from
							hard bound brains, two Stanza’s of eight lines, in the amatory style;
							and as with a serious turn, they would have been ridiculous from me to
							her, I closed the second Stanza, with a hyperbolical and burlesque idea—
							Yesterday Morning at breakfast I gave them to her— She was pleased with
							them; and my wife told me I had never written any, half so <pb n="86"
								type="ms"/>pretty for her— But not being satisfied with them myself,
							I added several Stanza’s while riding from Town yesterday, and one this
							morning to conclude, prepared as I was rising from bed— For I can allow
							to this trifling, only times in which I can do nothing else— But there
							is an incongruity in the lines, because the additional Stanza’s, instead
							of the ludicrous character of the second are too serious and even
							solemn—written, as if from a youthful and ardent lover, and expressing
							Sentiments which I neither do nor ought to feel, for her. The Love is
							all merely poetical, but has so much the appearance of reality, that I
							scruple to shew the lines now they are written— I wrote a short Letter

							few prosaic lines, and some expressions not lofty enough for Lyric
							Poetry— I shall leave them for the sake of their energy— After dinner I
							wrote off the five Stanza’s; and the remainder of the Evening listened
							to the Music of the Ladies— The Sky became clear, and I had again the
							opportunity of examining the principal Stars in the head of the Whale—
							But the trees which surround our house prevent me from seeing more than

							erroneous premises, bad motives— 2, It was not in good taste— It was
							incongruous with the rest of the book; which was cool, moderate and
							argumentative— That passage alone was angry and intemperate. 3. It
							disqualified us for a cool and friendly discussion of the principle— For
							it manifested a temper, with which it must be useless, and might be
							unsafe to reason upon that topic— He certainly did not relish these
							remarks; and was aukward and ungracious in his attempts to parry them—
							At first he said Oh! that’s only my mobbing of the pamphleteer. It is

							very attentively and could assure him it was a very pointed attack upon
							the policy of the United States— <persRef ref="hay-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hay’s</persRef> pamphlet with which I
							was also well acquainted would not bear him out in these charges.—and
							said I, in the next edition of your work, I expect you will strike out
							that passage.— But said he, if all the rest is cool and moderate, and
							logical, with only the exception of that half page, I shall yet come
							well off. Ay, but said I, that is precisely the point which we should
							have to discuss; so that the temperance of all the rest is of no avail—
							But as to your principle itself said I, you acknowledge that you have
							your authorities against you—<persRef ref="woodeson-richard"
								>Woodeson</persRef>, and <persRef ref="gwyllim-henry"
								>Gwyllim</persRef> in his Edition of <persRef ref="bacon-matthew"
								>Bacon’s</persRef> Abridgement—“All Nonsense,[”] said he— The
							Lawyers all talk nonsense as well as others— But let it come to
							Westminster Hall—there it would not last five minutes— I doubted whether
							the Judges in Westminster Hall would be exactly of his opinion, and told
							him of the case of <persRef ref="crosby-william">Crosby of
								New-York</persRef>, whose Estate had escheated in the Island of
							Jamaica, and then granted to distant collaterals— He had no reply ready
							for this. I asked him where he got his principle. He appeared to me to
							have drawn it altogether from <persRef ref="coke-edward">Lord
								Coke’s</persRef> report of <persRef ref="calvin-robert"
								>Calvin’s</persRef> case. But what analogy could there be between
							the consequences of a king of Scotland’s coming to the crown of England,
							and those of a Revolution by which the People of North America were
							separated from the British Empire?— He said he did not want Calvin’s
							case at all. He took his principle from the definition of the term
							Alien, in all the Books—“a person born out of the King’s allegiance.”— I
							asked him if he took a Hanoverian to be a British Subject—entitled to
							the rights and privileges of an Englishman— At first he said that might
							be a question— But afterwards he said no— Because the King was Sovereign
							of Hanover by another title, and not as king of England— I told him that
							the Common Law was made before England had Colonies— There was nothing
							like Colonies in it— He said there were the Provinces in France— He had
							Ladies waiting for him at the gate, which shortened our conversation— He
							asked me to come some day and dine with him— He always dined, not at
							those newfangled hours; but at four O’clock; he drank tea at half past
							five; and at six was seated at his books; to put down these
							pamphleteers— When he had got half way to the gate, he came back to
							congratulate me, upon the re-election of our friend the Lord Mayor—
							That’s what I told him said he, when the Ministers did not go to his
							dinner. The way for you, said I, is to be the best Magistrate that the
							City ever had— And that is what they have rechosen him for— Politics
							would not have done it— He had also talked much about the good-fortune
							of <persRef ref="pellew-edward">Lord Exmouth</persRef>— He had finished
							a War, in a single day— He had been completely successful— The object
							was the abolition of Christian Slavery in Africa—and now it was
							finished, every body was of his side— Nothing could be more fortunate—
							On this article I fully agreed with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Reeves, but I expected he was going to take to himself the merit of Lord
							Exmouth’s success, as he seemed to ascribe to himself, the re-election
							of the Lord Mayor— I do see the bottom of this Justice Shallow. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Reeves is a lawyer, of a contracted <pb
								n="88" type="ms"/>understanding, active industry and stubborn
							temper; always a useful instrument in the hands of the Government, but
							sometimes troublesome by his obstinacy, and sense of his own importance—
							For he imagines himself to be the main Spring of the Universe— This
							doctrine of his that Americans born before the Revolution, are not
							Aliens in England is as crafty, as it is absurd— The absurdity is in the
							pretended common Law principle of unalienable allegiance; but the craft
							is his own. He knows that by pushing the Tory principle to its
							consequences, while he flatters the passions, prejudices, and mortified
							vanity of the Government and People, they will take special care that it
							shall never practically operate otherwise than as it shall suit
							themselves; and that they will take all the advantage of his argument
							when it operates in their favour. This pamphlet indeed displaced him
							from the alien Office; but the Government have always good hold of him
							and he of them. I told him that the charge he had brought against us of
							seducing foreigners from their allegiance, might be retorted much more
							forcibly upon his own doctrine; but he said he only reasoned from the
							Law as it is— He advanced no new doctrine— He only adhered to the old
							established maxims of the Law of England— The Ladies returned from
							London before six. The Evening was fine— I finished reading the Chances;
							and began the Road to Ruin.— Received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="smith-john">J. A. Smith</persRef>, asking for a paper; and one
							from <persRef ref="brown-william7;brown-james7">W. and J.
								Brown</persRef> at Liverpool; complaining of extra Tonnage duties
							for Light-Money and Pilotage still levied upon American Vessels.

							left imperfect so large a proportion of the rhymes that I had some
							difficulty to recollect them— I was painfully engaged the whole Evening,
							in tackling anew the rhymes together, and they are yet fearfully bad.—
							At the Office in Craven Street, I received a Note from <persRef

							recommended and desired that the Nobility and Gentry, and all persons
							attending upon these occasions will appear in Dresses entirely of
							British Manufacture. The same notification has been published in the
							Gazette, and Newspapers, and I suppose the object of issuing it six
