						<p>Heard <persRef ref="little-robert">Little</persRef>— Psalm 51.11. “Cast
							me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy Spirit from me.”—
							The text was far more affecting than the discourse— The weather was bad,
							and the Snow deterred me from going out afternoon or evening. I wrote a
							short Letter to my Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, and
							another to <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef>. Read a
							multitude of Papers about <persRef ref="dinsmoor-silas">Silas
								Dinsmoor</persRef> once a deputy Surveyor, and <persRef
								ref="davis-george">George Davis</persRef> one of the Surveyor’s
							General— Also about the removal of a Land-Office from Delaware to Tiffin
							in the State of Ohio. A distracting question of State, upon which
							perhaps depends the political standing and election of two or three
							members of Congress— And I signed the Message to both Houses of Congress
							upon the Surveys made by authority of the Legislature and <persRef
								ref="troup-george">Governor of Georgia</persRef>, upon Lands secured
							by Treaty to the Creek Indians— This is the most momentous Message I
							have ever sent to Congress, and it is to go in to morrow— Well may I say
							Cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy Spirit from me—
							Measures like this demand deep meditation, before determining upon them;
							but when once fixed, the less they are thought of perhaps the better—
							The Solitude of this day has somewhat reconciled me to the rapid
							succession and endless variety of subjects which absorb and distract my
							time almost every day during the Session of Congress— Visitors,
							Petitioners and Solicitors; heads of Departments, Calls of Congress and
							Despatches engross every moment of almost every hour, and at least keep
							off brooding Cares— These are vain and idle; but in Solitude they crawl
							upon one like a nest of Spiders— And now let me wait in patience and
							self-possession the issue of these Events and say there’s a Divinity
							that shapes our ends</p>
						<lg>
							<l>Rough hew them, how we will.</l>

							which imported a departure on his part from public duty; without

							forth the General’s Letter—and without noticing the insidious allegation
							of the General, imputing to the <hi rend="italic">Government</hi> of the
							United States, the Sentiments expressed on a casual topic of
							conversation at a dinner table— I observed if Jackson should be content
							with the denial of all imputation upon his character, the controversy
							would cease there with Southard’s answer; but if Jackson intended to
							make a public quarrel of it, these outrages of decency and delicacy on
							his part, might be discussed more usefully to the public, than with him—

							discourse upon Industry— Full of moral Instruction, and sound principle;
							addressed as much to the females of his auditory as to the men, and
							urging with great cogency the necessity that every one should <hi
								rend="italic">work</hi>, as well as eat— There were some satirical
							remarks interspersed with his argument—he said that even <persRef
								ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul</persRef>, would not
							allow widows to be provided for till they were 60 years old; nor then
							without a great many <hi rend="italic">ifs</hi>— 1. Tim: 5.10.</p>
						<p>Afternoon I went to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s, and instead
							of <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef>, unexpectedly heard a black man, from Mark
							2:14—“Follow me.” He read the Evening prayer for Sexagesime Sunday, and
							read a Sermon, rambling in argument, not below mediocrity in
							composition; and quite upon a level with the average of Sunday
							Discourses from white preachers— There was in his manner both ease and
							solemnity— The Galleries were stocked with numbers of black and coloured
							men and women, to whom the preacher specially addressed much of his
							Sermon— He made no allusion whatever to their colour; but appealed to
							motives for following Jesus Christ applicable eminently to the <hi
								rend="italic">poor</hi>— He appeared to be in the scale of
							intellectual being, a step above <persRef ref="saunders-prince">Prince

						<p>In the Evening I attended again at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Little’s, and heard him, from Acts 17.11—“and searched the Scriptures
							daily, whether those things were so.” He digressed from the historical
							narrative of the rise and progress of Christianity to discuss the
							question whether the doctrine of the Trinity had any warrant in
							Scripture— He chiefly considered Matthew 28.19. and the first Chapter of
							John’s Gospel— But neither this nor any other argument that I ever heard
							can satisfy my judgment, that the doctrine <unclear>of</unclear> the Divinity of Christ
							is <hi rend="italic">not</hi><hi rend="italic">countenanced</hi> by the
							new Testament— As little <unclear>. . .</unclear> I say that it is clearly revealed— It
							is often obscurely intimated sometimes directly, and sometimes
							indirectly asserted—but left on the whole <unclear>in</unclear> a debateable State; never
							to be either demonstrated or refuted, till <unclear>an</unclear>other Revelation shall

							is to give the President a power to interdict the British shipping from

							asked if that would not answer as well as a contingent interdict by Law.
							I said no— Because the measure taken by the Executive alone, would not
							have the weight of an Act of Congress— If however they meant to shift
							the responsible burden upon the Executive I would take it upon me— It
							seems extremely doubtful, whether any Act of Congress upon the subject
							will pass at this Session— Webster said he would call upon me again this
							Evening.</p>
						<p>In the afternoon, I heard a Stranger at <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi

							of our Relations with the Indian Tribes since the Revolution—and the
							origin of the Army—with its progressive increase— This examination like
							many others leads me deeper and deeper in research till I am compelled
							to stay my enquiries for want of Time to pursue them— In the controversy
							with Georgia, the powers of the General Government, and those of the
							Government of Georgia, are in conflict, and it is indispensable to know
							the whole History of our Indian relations of Peace and War, to
							understand the ground upon which we stand— It was debateable ground far
