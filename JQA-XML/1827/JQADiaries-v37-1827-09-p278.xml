						<p><date>1. IV.</date> Fishing party, from Newcomb’s Wharf— return to
							Quincy.</p>
						<p>I rose at four— Lighted my lamp and wrote Letters to the <persRef
								key="rush-richard">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, and to
								<persRef ref="gaillard-theodore">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> T.
								Gaillard</persRef> at Newport— Breakfasted, and rode with <persRef
								ref="giusta-antoine">Antoine</persRef> to Newcomb’s wharf, near the
							Bent’s point Bridge— At half past seven our company were assembled.
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">Thomas</persRef> and <persRef

								>John</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph</persRef>,
							and my Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>— We embarked in
							a small Sloop belonging to Quincy, with    <persRef ref="u"
								>Hardwick</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-josiah2">Josiah Adams
									jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> upon a fishing party
							below the Boston Light House— The weather was all day fine— We left the
							wharf with a light and favourable breeze, and within an hour had run two
							thirds of the way to the Light-House; but it then fell to a flat calm,
							and for four hours we barely drifted with the tide—passed the Light
							about noon, and reaching the first fishing ground not before two— Here
							one good sized Cod—one Haddock, and one or two other fish were caught;
							but with some delay, and a fresh breeze springing up the vessel drifted
							too much for cod-fishing— We twice changed our fishing ground without
							success, and as at our former party, by three in the afternoon were
							obliged to make sail homeward— With alternate calms and light heading
							breezes we reached at the dusk of Evening the wharf from which we had
							taken our departure, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf
							took me home— While the vessel was under way, we fished for mackerel, of
							which I caught about 30. I had taken with me a map of Boston and its
							vicinity ten miles round, belonging to my brother; and viewed the
							islands in the bay, between Quincy, and the Light-House— It added very
							little to my knowledge of the topography of Boston Harbour and Bay. But
							the map was very imperfect, and I had no pocket compass— I have now
							within the last eight years been upon five fishing parties below the
							Boston light— Always favoured with fine weather— Always baffled with
							calms— A cod, and a mackerel fishing line, I now had, but they were new,
							ill adjusted and useless— New lines require a thorough soaking in Sea
							water, before they can be used— A pocket compass, a good telescope, and
							a Sailors dress are suitable equipments for such a party— We had a very
							good Chowder— My Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							went to Boston this day, and returned this evening.</p>

						<p>My Sons <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> came to Boston in the Stage.
								<persRef ref="beach-asa">Asa Beach</persRef> was an old man of 68. a
							straggling traveller from Fleming near Auburn in the State of New-York.
							He came to see me for mere curiosity, and talked about politics and the
							prison at Auburn. He closed his visit by asking <persRef ref="u">Miss
								Sparhawk</persRef> to play a tune for him on the Piano, which she
							did— The <persRef ref="osgood-thaddeus">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Osgood</persRef> had
							sent me yesterday a Letter enclosing two printed papers—proceedings of a
							Society formed in London for the civilization of the Indians in Canada—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Osgood solicited assistance from me
							to the funds of this Society, which I declined; observing that the
							United States considered it a principle of political obligation that the
							British Government should in no form whatever interfere in the concerns
							of Indians within the territories of the United States— And I deemed it
							my duty to pursue that course with regard to the Indians within the
							British Dominions— I said the objects of the Society, appeared to me to
							be altogether laudable, and I approved of their plan of civilizing the
							Indians, by conciliating them to the British Provincial Government and
							Laws— We were now suffering much inconvenience from having attempted to
							civilize Indians upon the plan of leaving them when civilized, as
							Independent Societies, within our Territories, which we were now finding
							to be utterly impracticable— The only manner of making their civilized
							state contribute to their own benefit or to ours would be to bring them
							within the pale of our own Government and Laws; and I was pleased to see
							this Society formed under the countenance of the British authority,
							proceeding upon that basis— I added that I had a personal acquaintance
							of many years standing with the <persRef ref="augustusfrederick">Duke of
								Sussex</persRef>, who had presided at the formation of the Society
							and had great esteem for his character— The <persRef ref="u">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frere</persRef>, is one of the Missionaries to our Indians at
							Mackinaw, in the Michigan Territory. He said he had come out with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Osgood, at his request, but having no
							connection whatever with his purpose— But he said that the plan pursued
							by him and our missionaries with the Michigan Indians, was founded
							entirely on the principle of bringing them by civilization, under the
							government of our Laws— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Osgood at the
							close of our conversation thanked me for the interview, and expressed no
							dissatisfaction at my determination— I bathed at the creek with <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas">my brothers</persRef><persRef
								ref="adams-isaac;adams-john3;adams-joseph" type="multi">three
								Sons</persRef> and <persRef ref="giusta-antoine">Antoine</persRef>,
							and came with him into Boston to the Exchange Hotel. I took a Hack, and
							paid visits to <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="lloyd-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
								Lloyd</persRef>. I saw them both, and <persRef
								ref="lincoln-penelope;lloyd-hannah" type="multi">their
								Ladies</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lloyd has sold his
							house, and proposes to pass the winter at Philadelphia, and perhaps
							partly at Washington. He probably intends a definitive removal from this
							State to a warmer climate— I told Governor Lincoln, that since seeing
							him I had received several despatches from <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>; and that in one of them incidental notice was
							taken of the state of the Negotiation relating to the Northeastern
							boundary. There were several other despatches upon other subjects, and
							thinking the perusal of them might be interesting to him, I had brought
							them with me; and I put them into his hands requesting that after
							reading them he would send them this Evening or to morrow morning to the
							Exchange Hotel— He said he would and expressed his gratification at this
							mark of confidence— I returned to the Exchange and immediately went with
							Antoine to Medford, and dined at <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> P. C. Brooks’s</persRef>— The party

								<persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> went this Morning out to
							Quincy: came back and departed upon their return to Lebanon; intending
							to go this Evening as far as Worcester— <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy</persRef> called on me
							with a <persRef ref="lieber-francis">Doctor Lieber</persRef>, a German
							who has recently established a swimming school in this City— He had sent
							me an invitation to come and see it, which he now repeated— I
							accordingly walked with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy to the
							Avenue, where we found D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lieber, and went
							with him in a boat to the scaffolding which he has erected for his
							school— It is a floating Platform, in hollow square, with a surface of
							water within of about an acre; with small rooms at the four corners, for
							undressing and keeping his furniture at the centre of the three sides of
							his platform, are stands, four feet high, from which his scholars leap
							or dive into the water and on the fourth side is a spiral Staircase,
							perhaps forty feet high, with stands at different elevations, from which
							the pupils may leap or plunge— There were ten or twelve boys taking
							lessons while we were there— He says his complete course is of
							twenty-one lessons, teaching the pupil to swim a full half hour; but
							many learnt in less— Some in five or six lessons— He has two assistants,
							and sixty-six pupils. His first lessons are given with a matted belt
							slung under the arms, and held by a long rope, in the hand of an
							assistant— At a more advanced Stage he lays aside the belt, and
							substitutes a long pole, with a rope, floating so near to the swimmer
							that he can seize it at any moment— The boys there were at different
							stages of their progress, but none of them had yet learnt to dive well—
							Most of them jumped in from the low stands one from the stair stand as
							high as twenty feet— At the Doctors invitation I went in to the bath
							myself and swam about ten minutes— The Doctor went in at the same time.
							I then returnd with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy to the
							Exchange Hotel— He left me, and came again with his chaise at one. I
							rode out with him to Neponset Bridge, and dined with the Directors at
							the Inn upon the Dorchester side. The company were M<hi

							<persRef ref="miller-edward">Edward Miller</persRef>, and <persRef ref="foster-james">James H.
							Foster</persRef>. We had a sumptuous dinner and at the dusk of Evening,
							I returned with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy to Boston. I there
							found at <persRef ref="hamilton-james2">Hamiltons</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="selden-sarah">Miss Selden</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u">Miss
								Hanson</persRef> of Washington, and a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>I had received last evening from <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef>, before I came out from Boston a large mail of
							despatches and Letters, which having then no time to read, I put into my
							small trunk, and brought with me to Medford— I found here the 71<hi
								rend="superscript">st</hi> number of the English Quarterly Review,
							published last June which contains an Article upon my Report on Weights
							and Measures— I read that last Evening, before going to bed, and this
							morning rose before day-light, and with the help of a flint and steel,
							given me by <persRef ref="perkins-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> T. H. Perkins</persRef>, lighted my candle, read the
							Letters and despatches that I had received last Evening, and wrote
							nearly an hour before I was called to breakfast— <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Everett</persRef> came at 7. and after breakfast he and I went with
								<persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brooks</persRef> in his carriage, through Woburn and Billerica to
							Lowell— The distance is 19 miles, and we reached the Inn at eleven. This
							town, was a part of Chelmsford, incorporated in    and consists almost
							entirely of manufacturing establishments for making Cotton Callicoes—
								<persRef ref="boott-kirk">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kirke
								Boott</persRef> is the Superintendent, and there are three other
							persons by the name of <persRef ref="moody-paul">Moody</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="colburn-warren">Colburn</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="u">Prince</persRef> employed in various ways in directing the
							concern— The proprietors are an incorporated company <pb type="ms"
								n="281"/>and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boott says have invested
							two Millions and a half of dollars in the establishment. There are now
							several Mills, brick buildings 155 feet long; each with a water wheel of
							30 feet diameter. Turning on several floors a number of spinning,
							carding, dyeing, weaving and printing machines. From the raw Cotton in
							the bag, to the printed Callico in the Bale, for exportation, we
							witnessed all the processes; as also the establishment for making the
							machinery— The spinning Jenny of <persRef ref="arkwright-richard">Sir
								Richard Arkwright</persRef> is the first, but there is a succession
							of machines for each of the other operations, the mechanism of which is
							quite unknown to me— We saw them all, and among them two, invented by
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Moody, and unknown in England. There
							are twelve hundred persons employed in these works, about two thirds of
							whom are girls from sixteen to twenty-five years of age. They earn upon
							an average, one dollar 75 cents a week; and work from Sunrise to the
							dusk of evening, with an interval of half an hour for breakfast, and the
							same time for dinner— They are boarded in houses built by the company,
							and rented at an interest of four per cent upon the Capital spent in
							erecting them— There are already a Stone Episcopalian Church, 70 feet
							long and 58 feet wide, built for ten thousand dollars, a wooden Meeting
							House; and another commenced— One Stone Hotel; and another of wood— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Boott’s house is a square, and handsome
							mansion—elegantly furnished— There is another company of Merrimack locks
							and Canals, from whom the water power and much of the land has been
							purchased. The cotton factory company, are enlarging their works, and
							their plan embraces the erection and constant employment of fifty Mills;
							for all which they have a sufficiency of water power— We took from two
							to three hours in visiting the various buildings, including that where
							the machinery is made— This is chiefly of cast iron, and Oak timber— The
							printing is done by copper rollers, the only article, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Boott says, which they can not procure
							here, and are obliged to smuggle from England— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Boott accompanied us over the buildings— About two we
							returned to the Hotel and dined. Paid a visit to <persRef
								ref="boott-anne">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boott</persRef>, a
							young and elegant English woman and after going to the junction of the
							Merrimack Canal, with the river, to which place M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Boott accompanied us we returned to Medford— We met at the
							Hotel, <persRef ref="mills-elijah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> E. H.

							and <persRef ref="blake-joshua">Joshua Cabot</persRef>, who had gone out from Boston, yesterday, and this
							afternoon returned; with their Ladies— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Mills told me that he had taken a cold, which had put him back a little—

							<unclear>and</unclear> they had frequently been at a loss to know whether a person was or

						<p><date>7. V:30.—</date> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Buzzy’s Roxbury—

						<p>At half past ten this morning, I went with <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef> to <persRef ref="bussey-benjamin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Buzzy’s</persRef> at Roxbury; and
							after a collation at his house, with him in his Carriage to his
							manufactory of blue Broadcloth at Dedham— There are two separate sets of
							buildings; one of wood, purchased of an old, broken down cotton factory.
							The other of brick, chiefly built by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Buzzy himself. They are perhaps half a mile distant from each other, and
							are situated upon Neponset River. We saw here several of the same
							processes upon wool, which at Lowell we had observed upon Cotton—and
							several others— The first operation upon the wool is washing, which is
							performed by water and steam— Then follow the dyeing, spinning and
							carding weaving, fulling, napping, steam brushing, hot and cold
							pressing, and packing in Bales of six pieces of twenty yards each—six
							quarters wide— Their dyeing stuff is Indigo for the Cloth, and
							Quercitron bark for the yellow listing. They use no other colours. They
							sell their cloth according to its various qualities from 2 dollars and 3
							quarters to 3 dollars and a half a yard, and have a constant demand for
							more than they can supply— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Buzzy was
							originally the sole proprietors, and gave eighty thousand dollars for
							the land, buildings and water power. <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Kuhn</persRef> is his agent for the
							management of the business— He gives him a Salary of 1500 dollars a
							year, and allows him one fifth part of the profits of the establishment,
							loaning him that portion of the capital employed, with a deduction of
							the interest on the same amount. The cost of the machinery is forty
							thousand dollars, and they make about 3000 pieces of Cloth in a year.
							Their water <pb type="ms" n="283"/>power and their buildings, if fully
							occupied would be competent to the making of one hundred pieces a week.
							They employ about sixty girls, between 15 and 25 years of age, and as
							many men. There is besides M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kuhn, a
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barrows</persRef>,
							having much of the direction of the business. The machinery is inferior
							to that of the cotton manufactory at Lowell—much of it old, and made of
							wood instead of Cast-iron— The profits upon the business M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Buzzy admits are very small— The general
							opinion is that they are at present nothing, and that the proceeds do
							not indemnify for the expenses— The prices of the Cloths are low, but
							the competition of foreign broad cloths keeps them down— We returned and
							dined at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Buzzy’s— <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas">My brother</persRef> was to have been of our

							this undertaking upon patriotic motives, still cheers himself with a

							wealthy, but supposed by many to have involved his estate by this
							undertaking— He told me this day that there was another object of public
							interest, upon which he had it in contemplation, to make a provision by
							his Will—and upon which he wished to consult me for advice— I said I
							should very cheerfully give him the best advice in my power upon any
							subject interesting to him, upon which he should consult me— He asked me
							to fix a day upon which he might call at Quincy; and converse with me,
							and we agreed upon next Thursday afternoon. I returned with George to

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitney</persRef>, this Morning from Job 19.25. [“]For I know that
							my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the
							Earth: 26. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my
							flesh shall I see God: 27. Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes
							shall behold and not another: though my reins be consumed within me.”
							This was a funeral discourse, preached on the occasion of the decease of
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Arnold</persRef>, a
							Sister of <persRef ref="adams-ebenezer">Ebenezer</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-josiah">Josiah Adams</persRef>, and who died the week
							before last— In commenting upon the text however, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney observed that although this <pb
								type="ms" n="284"/>passage had been understood by some as having
							reference to the immortality of the soul, that construction of it was
							probably not correct— That the author of the Book of Job was unknown,
							some supposing it to be <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>—others
								<persRef ref="ezekiel">Ezekiel</persRef>, but if one of the Hebrew
							Books, it was among the most antient of the Scriptures— That under the
							old testament dispensation, the Hebrews had no knowledge of a future
							State— Life and immortality having been brought to light by the Gospel
							of Jesus Christ — He gave then an exposition of the text, as he
							understood it, considering it as a part of Jobs discourse, and
							applicable exclusively to his own condition, without reference either to
							a future State, or to Christ as the Redeemer— In the 23<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> verse of this same chapter, <persRef
								ref="job">Job</persRef> expresses the wish that his words were
							printed in a Book from which there would be as much reason to infer that
							the art of printing was practised in those days, as that Christ the
							Redeemer, or the immortality of the Soul, are revealed in M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney’s text— The words <hi
								rend="italic">though</hi>, <hi rend="italic">worms</hi> and<hi
								rend="italic">body</hi>, in the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							verse, are supplied by the English translators, and give a meaning
							altogether conjectural to the original passage—the true explanation of
							which is very difficult— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney’s
							afternoon Sermon was from Matthew 6.5. “And when thou prayest, thou
							shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in
							the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen
							of men— Verily I say unto you they have their reward. 6. But thou, when
							thou prayest, enter into thy closet; and when thou hast shut thy door,
							pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in
							secret, shall reward thee openly.” The doctrine from this text is
							obvious, and it is one of the admirable precepts of Christian morality—
							Immediately after the Afternoon service I went with <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> into the Cellar of the
							Temple, now building to examine the place for the tomb of <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail">mother</persRef>—upon which however I did not
							finally fix. I then rode with <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef> to <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">General H. A. S.
								Dearborn’s</persRef> at Roxbury— I visited his Garden, which is very
							tastefully laid out, on the side of a barren and rocky hill. He has beds
							sown from the seed or acorn, of rock maple, elm, white Oaks and English
							Oaks; the Illinois or Pecane Nut, the Button wood, and the Honey Locust.
							He has also many other trees, indigenous and exotic, most of them very
							flourishing— He uses to cover the wounds of trees a composition made of
							a quart of tar, and a pound of beeswax melted together and then mixed
							with a pound of red Ochre. He gave us some fruit, fair but not highly
							flavoured— One nectarine of which I preserved the stone— On returning
							home I found <persRef ref="marston-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="bates-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John A.

							promised to bring me the certificate of Shares transferred to me, and a

						<p>I sent for <persRef ref="wood-h">Henry Wood</persRef>, who called on me
							this Morning— I went with him and examined again the cellar under the

							I took with me the two plans of a Tomb which he had furnished me last
							Summer; but found there must be a variation from them to adapt the
							construction to the cellar as it has been made— I marked two places
							without deciding positively between them, and requested M<hi

							cost for which he would undertake the work, which he promised to do. I
							also visited with him the burying yard, and the monuments there erected

							marble Slabs on which the Epitaphs are engraved, and soldered into the

							grave-stones in the yard of granite; and all had the marble slab <pb

						<p>I began an examination of the Papers of reference to the Execution of

							October last, with the plans then taken by <persRef

							the plans, that of the Quincy Woodlot missing. There is however a plan
							of the same lot, one of the five on the Survey of <persRef
								ref="bass-jedidiah">Jedidiah Bass</persRef> taken in 1785— There
							appear to be four lots which were not sold last year, and which are yet
							to be appraised, and a return of the appraisement to be made at the
							probate Court— But the bounds are not yet fully ascertained, nor can
							they be without further surveys— Great part of this morning was absorbed
							in examining these Papers with <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef>, and I found much to be done for which I shall not
							now have time— I set apart the plans of the Lots yet to be sold— Visit
							from <persRef ref="thorndike-israel">M<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Thorndike</persRef>, with whom I engaged to dine at Beverley on
							Wednesday the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month—from
								<persRef ref="brooks-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
								Brooks</persRef>, who applied for Appointment of Purser in the Navy,
							and brought Letters of Recommendation from <persRef ref="chauncey-isaac"

								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> and <persRef ref="everett-edward">E.

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Price Greenleaf</persRef> called after
							dinner and <persRef ref="bussey-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Buzzy</persRef>, who communicated his intention to appropriate by
							Will a portion of his Estate, to the establishment of a Literary
							Institution, for the improvement of Agriculture and Horticulture, and as
							connected with them of Manufactures and Chemistry. He told me that
							having no Son; and only one <persRef ref="davis-elizabeth"
								>daughter</persRef>, a widow with <persRef
								ref="head-eleanor;davis-maria;davis-eliza" type="multi">three
								daughters</persRef>, the idea had become very unpleasant to him that
							the Estate which he had so painfully acquired would after his decease,
							like some others which he named be scattered to the four winds of
							Heaven. That about a year since, being alarmed at the state of his own
							health he made and executed his Will: in which he had expressed his own
							intentions— But that being now restored to health he had given it to
								<persRef ref="shaw-lemuel">Lemuel Shaw</persRef>, a lawyer to draw
							it up again in technical form, so that his purposes may not be defeated
							by the want of any legal formality— His object was to secure to <persRef
								ref="bussey-judith">his wife</persRef> during her life the income of
							all his Estate, real and personal, she paying to his daughter an annuity
							of 3000 dollars a year—after the decease of his wife he reserved to his
							daughter an annuity of 5000 dollars a year during her life and after her
							decease 2000 dollars a year to each of her daughters— He proposed to
							vest the whole Estate in seven Executors and Trustees who after carrying
							into effect those provisions for his family, and sundry small bequests
							should together with the judges of the Supreme Court for the time being
							should apply the remainder <pb type="ms" n="287"/>of it to the public
							purposes above mentioned— He asked my opinion of the whole design—and
							whether I was willing to be named as one of the Executors and Trustees
							of the Will— I said that with regard to the provision to be made for his
							family, particularly his daughter and Grand daughters, I thought he
							should himself be the exclusive judge— Advice upon that subject from
							others, might be liable to objection, as an interference with prospects
							and expectations, which should be exempt from all external influence—
							That the sufficiency of a provision for a person in the situation of his
							daughter was a matter of <hi rend="italic">relative</hi>
							consideration—to be compared not with the mere wants of necessity, but
							with the Style in which she had been accustomed to live as his daughter,
							and with the expectations which she might reasonably form from the
							extent of his wealth— But assuming that point as settled in his mind,
							and that he had resolved to apply to public uses a portion of his
							Estate, I knew of no object more laudable, or which would redound more
							to his own reputation, and lead to useful results than that which he
							proposed. That I thought he would do well to consider the expediency of
							separating the mere Execution of his Will, from the Trust to which he
							meant to devote a part of his Estate— That he might if he pleased name
							the same persons upon both; but the Executors must be under Bonds— Their
							duties would be temporary, and their transactions sanctioned by the
							probate Courts of the several Counties in which his real Estates are
							situated— But the Trust would be a permanent thing: destined to survive
							all the individual Trustees, and which might perhaps require an Act of
							incorporation, to give it legal succession and perpetuity. As to the
							proposal that he should name me as one of his Executors and Trustees I
							wished to take a few days to consider of it, and would then answer him.
							The only objection that now occurred to me, was my public situation
							which while it continued would make it impossible for me to act as his
							Executor— This however would cease after a short time, and when once
							released from the Public Service, should my life and health be preserved
							I shall be master of my own time, and could have no greater happiness
							than to devote it to such purposes of public beneficence as he proposed.
							He said he had intended to have brought his Will with him for my
							perusal; but it was in the hands of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaw,
							and was not yet quite finished. That before my return to Washington he
							would come over again and bring it with him— He said <persRef
								ref="williams-reuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ruel
								Williams</persRef> whom he considered as one of the first Lawyers in
							the State of Maine: and who was the Agent of his Lands there would be
							one of his Executors and Trustees. He considered his lands in Maine as
							worth at least 150000 dollars; and they had cost him 300000— He had
							eight Stores in Boston— A dwelling House and Land in Summer Street, for
							which he had been two years since offered 100000 dollars. His house and
							lands in Roxbury—and his manufacturing establishment at Dedham, which
							had hitherto yielded him no profit— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Buzzy’s daughter M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Davis was with him, and
							went to visit <persRef ref="cutler-harriet">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Cutler</persRef>, but did not come in— <persRef
								ref="russell-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph
								Russell</persRef> called, and I engaged to dine with him in Boston,
							next Saturday week. I rode with George to the Railway; intending to
							visit <persRef ref="perkins-thomas">Col.<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>
								Perkins</persRef>, but he was not there. We went up to the Stone
							pyramid that he is building on the highest summit of the Railway ledge—
							But in returning we missed our way, and got into a cart way which led us
							nearly three miles through the woods; and brought us out at the corner
							West of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rowe’s</persRef>
							house in Milton. We had then upwards of a mile walk to get back to the
							Railway Stone house where I had left my Horse and Chaise. When we
							reached there it was completely dark, but we got home without accident
							about 8. in the Evening. I gathered about a Quart of Black Oak and
							Gray-Oak Acorns to plant.</p>

								ref="brooks-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks</persRef>
							of Hingham this morning from Hebrews 2.9. “But we see Jesus, who was
							made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned
							with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death
							for every man. 10. For it became him for whom are all things, and by
							whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the
							Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.” An argumentative
							unitarian discourse, urging the mere human nature of Christ, from the
							direct assertion in the text that Jesus was <hi rend="italic">made</hi>,
							lower than the Angels, and from the motive assigned that he might be
							made perfect by suffering death for the salvation of man. The argument
							most forcibly put was, that the death of Christ having been effected as
							an example to the rest of mankind, it could bear that character, and
							answer that purpose, only in as much as his nature was the same as
							theirs— For that if his power was of a different nature from <pb
								type="ms" n="289"/>that of other men, his endurance of suffering
							could not operate as an example to them. The afternoon Sermon was from
							Luke 24–46. “And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved
							Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: 47. And that
							repentance, and remission of sins should be preached in his name among
							all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. 48. And ye are witnesses of these
							things.”— The drift of this Sermon was to shew from the text and from
							the peculiar character of the Christian religion that it was adapted to
							all mankind and worthy of universal acceptance— M<hi rend="superscript"

							years since by <persRef ref="wadsworth-alexander">Captain

							fishing for the market— They call them dories. It was about eight miles

							would split in two his most valuable meadow land, and require him to

							over the ground again some day when the sky should be clear. He spoke

							disadvantageously, and offered me his own share in it; but asked the

							would be best— But the lofty Spire to be descried at a distance and

						<p><date>23. V:15.</date> Lamplight</p>
						<p>Heard <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Whitney</persRef>, in the morning from Matthew 13.24. “Another
							parable put he forth unto them, saying, the kingdom of Heaven is likened
							unto a Man which sowed good seed in his field. 25 But while men slept,
							his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 26.
							But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared
							the tares also. 27. So the servants of the householder came and said
							unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence
							then hath it tares? 28. He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The
							servants said unto him, wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?
							29. But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also
							the wheat with them. 30. Let both grow together until the harvest: and
							in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, gather ye together
							first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the
							wheat into my barn.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney commented
							upon this parable, and also upon the explanation of it given by Jesus
							himself to his disciples as afterwards recorded in the same chapter. He
							declared however that he did not understand it as importing the eternity
							of future punishment— He argued against this not from his text but
							because he thought it inconsistent with the goodness of God— The text
							certainly gives me countenance to the idea that the punishment of the
							wicked hereafter will ever end. The term of punishment is as unlimited
							as the term of reward— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney’s
							afternoon Sermon was from 1 Thessalonians. 5.17. “Pray without ceasing.”
							And this precept he said was to be received with some qualification— It
							meant that prayer should be frequent and fervent; and in behalf of
							others as well as of the suppliant himself. He also indicated the
							purport of the prayer adapted to the characters and circumstances of
							those for whom it is made—and especially of vicious and criminal
							persons. A Christian preacher discoursing upon prayer, might find his
							ideas much enlarged and improved by reading the dialogue of <persRef
								ref="plato">Plato</persRef> upon that subject— <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy</persRef>
							came home with me, from the afternoon meeting, and we had conversation
							upon the further execution of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father’s</persRef> will— I shewed him the draft of an Account N. 4
							to be settled at the Probate Office next week, which he examined and
							approved. I also shewed him the Plans of the Woodlots not sold <pb
								type="ms" n="293"/>last year, and proposed that in order to trace
							effectively their boundaries, so that the Executors may safely sell them
							and give good titles, a new survey should be made of the whole tract of
							the 600 Acres— But he thought this would prove too troublesome, and that
							the boundaries might be found by a shorter process—that is by calling
							for the deeds of those who have encroached upon our bounds— This subject
							was therefore left for further consideration— In the Evening there was a
							meeting of the Supervisors of the Temple and School fund; all the
							members present— My draft of an Agreement for the construction of a
							Tomb, with an obituary tablet was read and discussed; and with an
							amendment proposed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy, approved.
							The formal meeting of the Supervisors for the acceptance of it, is to be
							tomorrow morning— My Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> was
							quite unwell this day; and I was so in the Evening, and retired early to
							bed.</p>

						<p>I had an indifferent night; afflicted with the sore throat and some
							fever: I found myself better this morning but threatened with a return
							of the Catarrhal cough—which tormented me last Summer— <persRef
								ref="wood-h">Henry Wood</persRef> called this morning and brought a
							model of the monuments for <persRef ref="adams-john">my Father</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="adams-abigail">Mother</persRef>, and an Estimate of
							the Expense of constructing the Tomb: with the Monuments amounting to
							more than 400 dollars— I engaged him to undertake and finish the work,
							and took his papers to draw up a written agreement to that effect.
								<persRef ref="spear-daniel">Deacon Spear</persRef> came, and spoke
							of the land offered for Sale by <persRef ref="bracket-lemuel">Lemuel
								Bracket</persRef>; and also offered me sixty Acres of Wood land in
							the 600 Acres at 30 dollars an Acre— I told him I could not come to a
							determination until I should have viewed the Land; nor without a survey
							by which its boundaries should be ascertained. He thought M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bracket would object to the expense of the
							survey, unless I would agree to take the land, before it should be made—
							I said I could make no positive promise; and from the difficulties we
							were experiencing in ascertaining my father’s Lands I had been warned
							never to purchase any woodland without a Survey and a Plan. He said he
							should at all Events have a survey of the lands that he offered, but it
							cannot be made before I go away. He spoke also of the Temple, said they
							were wanting to borrow more money; and did not know where they should
							get it unless I would lend them further— I said there was a balance of
							about fourteen hundred dollars in the hands of the Executors of my
							father, which could not now be distributed, and which we might lend— He
							spoke with some anxiety about the expense they were incurring in the
							building of the Temple—said many persons were dissatisfied with it; and
							he expected several would go off. I am not without much concern upon
							this subject myself— I rode to the Railway and met <persRef
								ref="perkins-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> T. H.
								Perkins</persRef> at the Stone house. He shewed me the plans of a
							Hotel for which he has already contracted, to be built at the <unclear>Road</unclear>,
							and I rode with him down to the wharf on Neponset River— I met three of
							the Cars carried by one horse going to the wharf, and saw the new Car;
							with an improvement invented by <persRef ref="bryant-gridley">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bryant</persRef> for suspending the
							plank upon which the Stones rest, under the Car— I rode home with Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Perkins— In the afternoon <persRef
								ref="whitney-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John
								Whitney</persRef> came, and paid me for the rent of my pew in the
							Meeting House N. 1 for the last year, and the agreement for his
							occupation of it was continued for another year— In the Evening I wrote
							some notes for the Executors of my father’s Will; related to the Lots of
							Woodland, not yet appraised or sold.</p>

							the invitation of <persRef ref="u">General Lyman</persRef>, on condition
							that I should be considered as a private Citizen; present only as a
							visitor— We met in the Tent of the Brigadier General. The Governor
							passed in review the third Brigade, drawn up in line— We then returned
							to the tent and dined with the Brigadier General and a number of the
							Officers— After dinner various evolutions were performed, by the Corps
							upon the field, till near Sunset when they were discharged— The Governor
							returned, escorted by the Cadets to the Council Chamber, and I attended
							him. We then went to tea at <persRef ref="austin-james">Col<hi

							whole day. <persRef ref="hatch-israel">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Hatch</persRef> of Attleborough came to say that he was growing old
							and falling into poverty and would be glad to have a place—any one that
							I might have it in my power, and feel disposed to give him— He pleaded
							his revolutionary services, and said he might though he never had

							had carried through with the aid of <persRef ref="ames-fisher">Fisher
								Ames</persRef>. <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Askins</persRef> was also a claimant. She is the widow of a <persRef
								ref="u">man</persRef> who served in the Revolutionary War— She
							brought with her two newspapers, one containing a narrative of a gallant
							atchievement of her husband during that war in capturing as Lieutenant
							of the Lincoln Galley, with twelve men, the Post of Annapolis Royal, in
							Nova-Scotia, and 150 Men— The other was a paragraph announcing his
							death, at Alney in the State of Maine, on the 4<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> of March last, and referring more briefly to the same
							exploit. She said her husband at one period of his life had been wealthy
							but in his last days had met with misfortunes, become poor and died of a
							broken heart— She herself had come to Boston, and to support herself had
							taken a house and received boarders, but was not successful. Her husband
								<pb type="ms" n="295"/>before his death had petitioned Congress for
							a pension— <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> had given encouragement to expect that an Act
							would be passed in his favour— But it had gone over from Session to
							Session three or four years, and now since the death of her husband she
							thought herself entitled to obtain, whatever should have been granted to

							and also <persRef ref="gorham-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gorham</persRef>, now the Member of Congress from the District, and
							ask their assistance to get the act for her relief through Congress—and
							promised any aid that it might be in my power with propriety to give—
							She said her claim amounted to about twenty-three hundred dollars— A man
							by the name of <persRef ref="slack-edwin">Slack</persRef> wrote me a

							clothing as a Soldier in the army, about which I told him he must write

							Folsom</persRef>, who has been the Chargé d’Affaires of our Consulate at

								ref="nuttal-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nuttall</persRef>
							attended us over the grounds— The garden is small, and in some decay.
							The spot is said to be not well chosen, and to lack water—there is
							however a small stagnant pond about the centre of it— The Green house is
							very small; but there is a considerable collection of exotic Plants
							chiefly from India. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and <persRef
								ref="fuller-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Fuller</persRef>, and <persRef ref="fuller-sarah">their
								daughter</persRef> joined us at the garden— This institution is much
							neglected, yet contains many vegetable curiosities, for which I should
							be glad to repeat many times my visit. Returning, I called at D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hill’s, and saw <persRef ref="u">his
								wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="u;u;u;u">four daughters—</persRef> Then again at President
							Kirkland’s; who was just finishing his dinner, and who introduced to me
							his newly espoused <persRef ref="kirkland-elizabeth">wife</persRef>— He
							had a few days before his marriage a very severe paralytic attack, from
							which he is very much recovered. I spoke to him of <persRef
								ref="hellen-thomas">T. J. Hellen’s</persRef> leaving the University,
							and asked if he could obtain a certificate of honourable dismission. He
							said not while under suspension; but he must first return and be
							readmitted— I went home with D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Waterhouse,
							and had some conversation with him upon his advice to me to renounce
							cold bathing which he thinks not salutary in old age— On my return
							towards Boston, I stopped at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller’s as
							he had requested, and was introduced by him to several of his friends
							who had called there for the purpose— I then came in to the city, and at
							four went to <persRef ref="hubbard-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								J Hubbard’s</persRef> to dine— Found I had mistaken his hour which
							was five. I had engaged to attend the federal Street Theatre this
							Evening, at the invitation of the manager <persRef ref="finn-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Finn</persRef>— Their hour of
							beginning was half past six, and foreseeing that I could not so soon
							leave the table, I returned to the Hotel where my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> wrote a note to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Finn, requesting him not to delay
							commencing the performance from the usual hour— There were at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hubbard’s dinner; besides <persRef
								ref="hubbard-unknown2">his wife</persRef> and <persRef

								Richmond</persRef> this morning from Exodus 20.5.— I the Lord thy
							God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the

							in the afternoon from John 3.16. “For God so loved the world, that he
							gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him, should not
							perish but have everlasting life.” D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Richmond’s manner of delivery is cold, without impropriety— The
							character of his Sermons is purely argumentative— That of this morning,
							after stating the objection as having been urged against it of its
							extreme severity, set forth successively all the considerations by which
							it may be justified—viewing it as applicable only to a single offence;
							as bearing upon the Nation rather than upon individuals; and as
							conformable to the moral order of the world by which the vices of
							Parents must be the cause of suffering to their children, and
							descendants. The afternoon discourse was an explanatory commentary upon
							the meaning of the text, which he understands in a sense different from
							that of the Calvinists— <persRef ref="amory-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Amory</persRef> was here between the

								ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy</persRef>
