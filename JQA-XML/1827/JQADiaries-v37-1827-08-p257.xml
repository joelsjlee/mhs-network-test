							and a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spencer</persRef>
							the husband of one of them. We arrived at half past eleven at
							French-town. I took for myself a Stage to Newcastle; and by my
							invitation, General Williams, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bankhead, took seats in it with me—
							About three in the afternoon we arrived at Newcastle and embarked in the
								Steam-boat    <persRef ref="jenkins-abasha">Captain

							landed about 6 in the Evening, and I took lodgings for the Night at

								ref="sergeant-john">J. Sergeant</persRef>, informing him of my
							arrival, and requesting him to call, which he did— He has very recently
							returned from Mexico, and spoke to me of the failure of the Congress of

								<persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Joel R. Poinsett</persRef>, in which he

							was excessively beclouded with dust, and scorched with heat— While on

							and authorised him to assure M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stockton,
							that my sentiments of regard, and respect for him had undergone no
							change— That the considerations upon which I had considered it my duty
							to appoint another person judge of the U.S. District Court in

							which needed no explanation to him— That I could only say, <persRef

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Stockton, who had been hurt at not
							receiving the appointment of District Judge, and had been strongly
							apprehensive that some disservice had been done to him, in my mind—

						<p><date>4. V.</date> From Steam-boat Washington. Long Island Sound, to
							Quincy.</p>
						<p>There arose soon after Midnight a thick fog, which chilled the
							atmosphere, and slackened the speed of our progress. On going upon deck
							I found they were sounding for bottom, with a heavy swell, and many of
							the passengers Sea-sick. They continued sounding about an hour longer,
							when the Light-house 7 Miles below Newport, was discovered about half a
							mile distant— At half past seven, <persRef ref="u">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Keith</persRef>, <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lamb</persRef>, and their
							families, with several other passengers landed at the wharf at Newport—
							At ten, the remainder of the Passengers landed at Providence, just
							nineteen hours from New-York— Had the fog not arisen, our passage would
							have been two hours shorter— As the morning advanced the fog dispersed,
							and at the time when we landed at Providence, the Sun was again blazing,
							with all his fierceness— A signal had been made from the boat for eight
							Stages, which were ready at the landing, and one of them was engaged for
							me, to go round, and leave me at Quincy— We had therefore no other
							company in it. We all dined at <persRef ref="fuller-stephen"
								>Fuller’s</persRef> Tavern, at Walpole. Parted from the other Stages
							at Dedham; and at five in the afternoon, 26 hours from New-York, arrived
							at <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef> Residence in
							Quincy— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> proceeded in the
							Stage to Boston. <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> remains
							with me— At 9 in the Evening; the tide serving I bathed with my brother
							at <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">D. Greenleaf’s</persRef> wharf—
								<persRef ref="brown-goold">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Goold
								Brown</persRef> this morning gave me a copy of his Grammar— <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Winchester</persRef> a
							distinguished Victualler was one of our passengers from New-York to
							Providence; introduced himself to me, and held much conversation with
							me, upon the packing of Beef and Pork— For the time I have been upon
							this journey, it has been uncommonly fatiguing; and the heat and dust
							more annoying than I ever felt them before— But the increase of
							traveling on this road from Washington to Boston, within my memory, is
							more strongly marked every year— I believe that the number of travellers
							from Boston to New-York in the year 1789. the first that I went down the
							Sound, did not in the whole Summer, exceed that of the Passengers in the
							Steam-boat Washington for this single trip— Even after the Steam-boat
							Navigation had been 8 years in practice, when in 1817 and 18 I travelled
							in them between Boston and New-York, the passengers were certainly not
							half so numerous, and there were only two Boats in the trade—navigating
							three times a week, and only between New-York, New-Haven, New-London,
							and Norwich— There are now eight or ten Boats plying between the same
							Ports; more than one of which departs every day— The voyage from
							New-York to Providence is performed in less time than was then taken
							between New-York and New-London—and it is now not unusual to pass from
							New-York to Boston, within the 24 hours— These are among the pleasing
							proofs not only of the great increase of the population of this Country,
							but of the improvement in the condition of the People. The invention of
							the Steam-boats has on the average shortened the time of travelling
							between Washington and this place by one half. It has given facilities
							to the Water-passages between Baltimore and Philadelphia, and between
							New-York and Providence in a still greater proportion, besides the
							almost certainty of effecting the passages in the purposed time, instead
							of the former dependence upon the chances of the winds.</p>

						<p>The Night was comfortably cool, and I rose this morning refreshed and
							recovered from all the fatigue of my Journey. Heard <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef>
							in the morning from Acts 10.40.41. “Him God raised up the third day, and
							shewed him openly;— Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen
							before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose
							from the dead.” It was communion day, and I remained and participated in
							that service. The afternoon Sermon was from Proverbs 9.12. “If thou be
							wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone
							shalt bear it.” I had heard this discourse before; and the text had
							remained deeply impressed upon my mind; as among the most excellent of
							moral maxims. I came home at the close of the afternoon service, with
								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Quincy</persRef>, the Mayor of Boston. He proposed to me, the
							immediate repayment of a sum of money which he had borrowed some Months
							since; a small balance of <persRef ref="adams-john">my
								father’s</persRef> Estate, remaining in the hands of the Executors—
							Not having the papers at hand, I proposed to postpone this Settlement
							for the present. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy returned this
							Evening to Boston. <persRef ref="degrand-peter">Degrand</persRef> came
							out, and spent the Evening here— Brought out a number of Newspapers, and
							was as usual full to overflowing of politics— He asked me why I had not
							nominated him a Director of the Bank of the United States, and I gave
							him candidly the decisive reason, that he was a broker— An objection
							which I told him had been urged by some of his warm friends, and even by
							the <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">President of the Bank</persRef>, who
							I told him had assured me that he would take opportunities that might
							occur, to give him aid, in his business— He said that was so far so
							good, and asked if there had been other objections: I said there had;
							but of a nature which it would be useless for me to explain to him— They
							were founded upon prejudices, and were made by some of his friends as
							well as others— He asked how it would be if he should discontinue his
							business as a Broker, and be only a Commission-merchant— I told him I
							could not say— That it was not my custom to explain to candidates for
							public office, my motives for selecting others; but I had done it to him
							from the regard I had for him; and I could only add that I had acted
							under a sense of duty and of my official obligations— He complained much
							of the Custom-house Officers at Philadelphia, and particularly of the
							Deputy Collector, whom he represented as devotedly hostile to the
							Administration, and as abusing his Official power to injure the friends
							of the Administration, and to favour their opponents— And he spoke of
							him, as peculiarly hostile, and oppressive to him— He said that such
							conduct from the Officers of Government towards the friends and
							supporters of the Administration, made it their interest as individuals
							to go over to the enemy— Well, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Degrand,
							said I—do so— He said no—he should certainly not do so— I said that if
							the Deputy Collector, or any other Officer at the Custom house, did him
							injustice, he should immediately address the Secretary of the Treasury,
							state the fact he complained of, and demand redress— In that case the
							Officer would be immediately called upon to answer to the complaint, and
							if that should be substantiated, I would answer he should never have
							cause to complain of that Officer again— He mentioned two instances of
							petty vexations that he had endured, one of which I thought not very
							important, and in the other he had complied with an exaction of the
							Officer, which if he had inflexibly resisted, the Officer must have
							yielded— But he said what is indeed true, that an Officer, disposed to
							be partial, may in many ways favour his friends and annoy his
							adversaries, without coming exactly within the verge of responsible
							official misconduct— I said this was irremediable— I could not dismiss
							an Officer, for that which could not be charged as misconduct; and as to
							the political preferences of public Officers, in relation to the
							Presidency, I could take no cognizance of them— This conversation was
							painful to me, and mortifying to Degrand; but what I said to him, was
							due to candour and he recovered his good humour before he went away.
								<persRef ref="marston-john">Marston</persRef>, <persRef ref="u"

							of private conversation with me for which I fixed to-morrow Morning at
							seven O’Clock. George was unwell this Morning; but recovered his tone in
							the after part of the day— The morning threatened another day of intense
							heat. But about ten there came up a very light easterly breeze, which
							through the day barely tempered the fervid effulgence of the Sun— It
							continued through the Evening, and as darkness came it grew so damp, and
							chilly, that we retired from the porch into the Parlour, and on going to
							bed I was prompted to close all my bed chamber windows but one, and left
							that only a few inches open.</p>

								Whitney</persRef>, brother to the <persRef ref="whitney-peter"
								>Minister</persRef>, and now the Representative of the town, in the
							Legislature of the State, and from <persRef ref="parkman-george">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Parkman</persRef> of Boston.
							And in the Evening, from <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel Greenleaf</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Price Greenleaf</persRef>. I had sent for <persRef
								ref="turner-elisha">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elisha
								Turner</persRef>, who came and I bespoke a Waistcoat and pair of
							Pantaloons. <persRef ref="adams-thomas">My brother</persRef> and my Son
								<persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> went in to Boston in
							the Stage— My brother came out in the afternoon with <persRef
								ref="foster-james">James Foster jun<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi></persRef>, and a horse upon trial; as I propose to purchase
							one— James Foster returned to Boston with my brother’s horse, and my
							Chaise, leaving those, in which they had come out here— I bathed with
								<persRef ref="giusta-antoine">Antoine</persRef> at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf’s wharf at 11 this morning, and
							again this Evening at 10. with my brother, his two Sons <persRef
								ref="adams-john3">John Quincy</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-joseph">Joseph Harrod</persRef>, and Antoine— The day was
							one of the hottest that I ever experienced. At 1. P.M the Mercury, in
							the porch fronting the House, was at 101. I found myself utterly unable
							to write; and after dinner threw myself on the bed, from which I was
							soon compelled again by the heat to rise. I took from my brother’s
							Bookcase the two Volumes of <persRef ref="heron-robert"
								>Heron’s</persRef> Junius, and read in a desultory manner, many of
							his Notes— Junius is a writer of great power, but the extraordinary
							curiosity excited by his Mask, has given him greater celebrity than he
							would ever have attained without it— His secret has hitherto been kept,
							perhaps the better, for the multiplied, and in many cases, absurd
							attempts to detect him— Heron after poring over him like a Dutch
							Professor over an antient Classic, fixes upon <persRef
								ref="dunning-john">Dunning</persRef> as the author— <persRef
								ref="woodfall-henry">Woodfall</persRef>, who published the Letters
							thought <persRef ref="boyd-hugh">Hugh Boyd</persRef> was the man— It has
							been almost demonstrated that <persRef ref="francis-philip">Sir Philip
								Francis</persRef> was the culprit, and <persRef
								ref="waterhouse-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Waterhouse</persRef> in solacing his old age with a volume of
							ingenious non sequiturs to prove that it was <persRef ref="pitt-william"
								>Lord Chatham</persRef>— The Speeches, and avowed writings, of Lord
							Chatham, bear the stamp of a mind, not unequal to the composition of
							Junius. <persRef ref="burke-edmund">Burke’s</persRef>, are in my opinion
							of a higher order— Were it ascertained that either of these was the
							political assassin who stabbed with the dagger of Junius, I should not
							add a particle of admiration for his talents, and should lose all my
							respect for his morals— Junius was essentially a Sophist— His Religion
							was infidelity— His abstract ethics, depraved—his temper, bitterly
							malignant, and his nervous system, timid and cowardly— The concealment
							of his name at the time when he wrote was the effect of dishonest fear.
							The perpetuation of it could only proceed from the consciousness that
							the disclosure of his person would be discreditable to his fame— The
							object of Junius, when he began to write was merely to overthrow the
							Administration then in power— He attacked them in a mass and
							individually—their measures, their capacity, their characters public and
							private—charged them with every crime and every vice— Afterwards he
							followed up his general assault, by singling out successively the
								<persRef ref="fitzroy-augustus;russell-john" type="multi">Dukes of
								Grafton and Bedford</persRef>, <persRef ref="murray-william">Lord
								Mansfield</persRef>, <persRef ref="blackstone-william">Sir William
								Blackstone</persRef> and the <persRef ref="george-iii"
								>king</persRef> himself— He magnified molehills into Mountains,
							inflamed pin scratches into deadly wounds; and at last abandoned his
							cause in despair, at the very time when he might have pursued it with
							most effect— But while he was battering the Ministry, upon paltry
							topics, that had neither root nor stem, he had declared himself
							emphatically and repeatedly on their side upon the only subject on which
							their fate, and the destiny of the Nation, altogether depended; the
							controversy with America— The cause that he took in the early stage of
							that conflict, and his disappearance from the theatre of politics, at
							the time when it was ripening into the magnitude of its nature, have
							marked Junius in my mind, as a man of small things, a splendid trifler,
							a pompous and shallow politician— His commentator Heron is just deep
							enough to admire his profundity— There is some information concerning
							the men and things of the time in Heron’s Notes, and dissertations, with
							an abundance of Scottish self-sufficiency, and prejudices— His
							philosophical and critical Essay upon the rise and progress of
							Eloquence, with its division into four Periods, has some merit, and
							might lead to a more profound investigation of the subject—but his
							overestimate of the powers and Eloquence of Junius, and the slighting
							manner in which he ranks him above Edmund Burke, is to me supremely
							ridiculous— It must however be acknowledged that in his enthusiasm for
							Junius, he is not alone.</p>
						<p>The weather this Evening after the excessive heat of the day, became
							delightfully temperate and cool.</p>

						<p>On rising this morning, I visited the spot of ground over which the

							up. One of the walnuts but just out of the ground— We also planted lime
							seeds, none of which have come up— All the Oaks appear from the leaves
							to be of the same kind—the Chesnut Oak— After Breakfast I rode with
								<persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef> down to the Mount

							and <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="appleton-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Appleton</persRef> and <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef>. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Appleton made some enquiries concerning
							the renewal of the commercial Treaty with Sweden, now in the hands of
								<persRef ref="appleton-john">his Son</persRef>, Chargé d’Affaires of

							the Treaty he might not be the bearer of it himself on a leave of

								ref="lunt-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lunt</persRef>, and
							the young Ladies and gentlemen with her were here at tea— <persRef
								ref="u">Miss Sigourney</persRef> is a daughter of the late <persRef
								ref="sigourney-charles">Charles Sigourney</persRef>, an acquaintance
							of mine at Amsterdam in 1781— <persRef ref="sigourney-charles2">His
								eldest Son</persRef> was at Washington in the Spring of 1825. with
								<persRef ref="sigourney-lydia">his wife</persRef> who is a Poetess
							of some renown. <persRef ref="drury-luke">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Luke Drury</persRef>, late Collector of the Port of Bristol,
							Rhode-Island, was here this Evening He brought me Letters recommendatory
							from <persRef ref="pitman-john">John Pitman</persRef>, judge of the U.S.
							District Court in that State, and from three other respectable persons,
							one of them, Rector of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Michael’s Church,
							at Bristol. Drury was a few days before I left Washington, dismissed
							from his Office of Collector, for delinquency long continued, and
							increasing, after repeated warnings— His appointment had originally been
							made under no good auspices, through the influence of <persRef
								ref="dewolf-james">James D’Wolf</persRef>, then a Senator from
							Rhode-Island, and by the rejection of an honest man, named <persRef
								ref="bates-barnabas">Bates</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Drury now acknowledged and deeply lamented his delinquency—
							Seemed desirous of imputing it to domestic misfortunes, and his having a
							numerous family to support; and rather intimated than affirmed that if
							time had been allowed him he would have paid up his arrearages by next
							May— He spoke of the ruin of his fortune; of the wreck of his
							reputation; of the distress of his family, professed religious
							compunctions, and shed some tears— I thought his religion, and his tears
							out of place— He appeared apprehensive of further measures of rigour
							against him, to recover the monies due from him as Collector— I told him
							that if he had any proposals to make, soliciting an indulgence of time,
							he must address a Letter to the <persRef key="rush-richard">Secretary of
								the Treasury</persRef>, who would do everything consistent with his
							public duties, to accommodate him— That I lamented his misfortune, and
							had with great reluctance resorted to the measure of removing him. That
							I could individually do nothing for him, but would readily assent to any
							indulgence of time, which the Secretary of the Treasury might think
							proper to allow— He asked if I thought he should be more likely to
							succeed in his application by going to Washington and addressing the
							Secretary in person— I said it would make no sort of difference— That if
							he went in person, he must still make his application in writing; and
							the Secretary would decide upon it in the <pb type="ms" n="263"/>same
							manner, whether he should see him or not— I wrote little this day.
							Bathed at the wharf at Noon, with my Son Charles, <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas2">T. B. Adams j<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi></persRef><persRef ref="adams-john3">J. Q. j<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-joseph">Jos. H.</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="giusta-antoine">Antoine</persRef>— After dinner I took out from
							the Town Library <persRef ref="colbert-jean">Torcy’s</persRef> Memoirs
							and dallied away perhaps two hours in examining the passages relating to
							the bribe offered by <persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis the 14<hi
									rend="superscript">th.</hi></persRef> to the <persRef
								ref="churchill-john">Duke of Marlborough</persRef>, and which Junius
							says was only not accepted. They are in Vol. 1. p. 141— Vol. 2. p. 15. 62.
							67. 79. 89. and 158. The last is the explicit authority from Louis to
							Torcy, to promise the Duke two, three or four Millions of Livres,
							according to a graduated scale of terms favourable to France, upon which
							by the Duke’s influence peace might be concluded— Torcy represents the
							Duke, as greedily avaricious, and personally interested in the
							continuance of the War— As having a commanding influence, and entire
							controul over the result of the Negotiations; but insincere, and full of
							dissimulation: professing an ardent desire for Peace, and a profound
							reverence for and personal attachment to Louis 14— Torcy says that he
							had at a prior period, quietly listened to proposals flattering to his
							passion for unbounded wealth, and intimates that they had been made
							through the Duke of Berwick, and the Marquis d’Allegre. Louis says that
							he had caused a promise of reward to be made to Marlborough, if he
							should deserve it by his conduct, and that he was surprised at the
							obstacles he had thrown in the way of the Peace, after the assurances
							that he had given of his wish to contribute to that event— Torcy shews
							that the Duke sought private interviews with him—and affectedly referred
							to his previous intercourse with the <persRef ref="fitzjames-james">Duke
								of Berwick</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="dalegre-yves">Marquis
								d’Allegre</persRef>, with all the particulars of which Torcy let him
							know that he was acquainted— He adds that the Duke most earnestly
							repeated the protestations of his desire to deserve the protection of
							the king of France, after the peace—but that he Torcy receiving no aid
							from the Duke, made no positive engagement with him, but held with him
							such discourse as was suited to confirm the expectations he had formed—
							But that when he spoke to the Duke about his private interests the Duke
							blushed, and appeared to wish to turn off the conversation— It appears
							on the whole, that Marlborough was willing enough to receive Louis’s
							money; but was not prepared to give him any equivalent for it, but
							heartless protestations and indefinite professions. Charles went this
							afternoon to Boston—</p>

							she goes about like a virago errant in enchanted armour, and redeems

								<persRef ref="woodward-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="dalverme-jacques">Count dal Verme</persRef> introduced himself
							as the Son of a <persRef ref="dalverme-francisco">man</persRef> of the
							same name, an Italian who travelled in this Country in 1788. He produced

									>r.</hi> Ezra Stiles</persRef>, then President of Yale College,
							to the Count himself announcing to him that a degree of Doctor of Laws

							a list of names of persons of distinction in this Country, from whom he
							states that he had received numerous kind attentions, and the note
							advises the Son to visit the Survivors of that list. M<hi

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy</persRef> called, and I rode
							with him in his Carriage to the Railway. We found <persRef
								ref="perkins-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> T. H.
								Perkins</persRef> at the Stone House which the Company built there
							the last Autumn— We walked with him to the Quarry were overtaken by a
							thunder Shower and took shelter under the shed where the Stone-cutters
							were at work upon the Blocks for the Bunker Hill Monument. The Railway
							has been about nine Months in full and successful operation, but it
							appears to me that there has already some impression been made on the
							iron tire of the way, and still more on the pine wood rail beneath it—
								Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Perkins and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Quincy think not, but the Colonel has made
							an experiment for a small space of substituting, a granite rail, in the
							place of the Pine-wood— This will be more durable, but may occasion the
							more rapid wearing out of the iron— The question still to be solved is
							the result of this undertaking with reference to profit— Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Perkins has great means, ardent public
							Spirit, and pertinacious enterprize— It is generally <pb type="ms"
								n="265"/>thought that the greater part if not the whole of the
							expense of the work is sustained by him; and that he is liberal even to
							profusion in expense upon it— It has already been of great advantage to
							the town of Quincy, and promises to be of still more— But the danger
							that the Railway may prove a bill of expense to its owners casts a shade
							over the whole enterprize, and rather increases than diminishes— Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l. </hi>Perkins is now about commencing to build
							a large Hotel near the Railway— The blocks of Granite at the shed near

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="harris-thaddeus">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Thaddeus Mason Harris</persRef>, Minister of a Church at Dorchester,
							and just forty-years since, a graduate with me at Harvard University—
							His morning text was Psalm 31:19. “Oh how great is thy goodness, which
							thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for
							them that trust in thee, before the sons of men.” That of the afternoon
							was 1. Corinthians 16.13. “Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you
							like men, be strong.” The former of these Sermons was upon the goodness
							of God, and the latter upon the duties of men— Both were well written
							and impressive. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Harris came home with me,
							and dined with us. In the afternoon, I had a visit from <persRef
								ref="waters-isaac">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Isaac
								Waters</persRef>, who had come out from Boston— He mentioned that
							the papers from New-York, arrived this day, announced the decease of
								<persRef ref="holley-horace">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Horace
								Holley</persRef>, late President of the Transylvania University; at
							Lexington, Kentucky— He had some months since resigned that office, and
							had formed a project of going to Europe; as a traveling preceptor to ten
							youths, whose Parents were to furnish each a thousand dollars a year for
							three or four years to defray the expenses of this itinerant Academy—
								<persRef ref="caldwell-charles">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Caldwell</persRef> had told me some months since of this scheme,
							which I then thought somewhat romantic— In pursuance of it however, D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Holley descended the river to New-Orleans
							in June or July. There he found obstacles to the execution of his
							European tour, which led him to abandon it, and he projected opening an
							academy in the neighbourhood of New-Orleans— Probably this undertaking
							had also failed, for he had embarked with his family for New-York and
							died on his passage, of the yellow fever, on the 31<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> of last Month— He was a man of Genius,
							Learning, and eloquence; so conscious of his powers, as to be
							discontented with the profession he had chosen; but without the Address
							or good fortune, like <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward
								Everett</persRef>, after stepping from the pulpit into the
							professor’s Chair, to make the second and larger Stride into the forum.
							Waters says he was coming back to be the Pastor of a congregation now
							building a new Church at the South end of Boston— I spent an hour of the
							Evening with my Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> at
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Daniel Greenleaf’s</persRef>— I have had made four small wooden
							seedling tubs, and this afternoon planted 5 tamarind Stones and eight
							Pear seeds in N. 1. and 5 Tamarind stones and 6. Pear-seeds in N. 2—
							There is a question whether the seeds or stones from fruit of grafted or
							budded trees will germinate; and finding nothing upon the subject in any
							of the Books I have read, I am inclined to bring it to the test of
							experiment— In my Summer house Nursery two more of my Shagbark walnut
							trees have come up, making now twelve, within the Walls— The Horse
							Chesnuts and the Oaks appear to have come up, all nearly at the same
							time; but both here, and at Washington the walnuts seem to come up in
							succession all Summer through— In this branch of Natural History, my
							experiments have commenced so late in life, and are yet so little
							governed by a system pointing directly to useful ends that they may
							perhaps end in mere trifling; but that is not my intention— On the 8<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October 1804. I planted perhaps 40
							walnuts in this garden, several of which came up; the ensuing Summer—
							One of them was transplanted to the garden of the house where <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> was born, and lives but is not
							yet in bearing, one only remains on the spot where the nut was planted,
							and at the age of 21 years, last Autumn bore perhaps 200 nuts— Most of
							these I planted here, or at Washington, and there are now 13 of them
							here, and 12 at Washington growing— But last year was my first
							experiment of planting acorns, and that has been partially successful
							here and totally failed at Washington. <persRef ref="perkins-thomas"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Perkins</persRef> told me
							yesterday, that he thought our <hi rend="italic">Pasture</hi> White Oak,
							well salted, as good for Ship building as the best Live Oak— This is
							encouragement for me to persevere in my experiments, which I would leave
							as at once a charge and an inheritance to my Children.</p>

						<p>The morning was uninterrupted and I employed it in writing. <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa Smith</persRef> dined with us. After
							dinner I walked to <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> T. Greenleaf’s</persRef>, and went
							with him to the Temple; to examine the cellar under it with a view to
							fix upon the spot where the vault is to be constructed for the tomb of
								<persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail">mother</persRef>— Before going there, I visited
							the garden opposite to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf’s house,
							where he has a number of rare plants, and trees not of the natural
							growth of this part of the Country— He is, as I propose to be, curious
							upon this subject, but he has already been many years in a course of
							experiments, and I have never been able to pursue with perseverance any.
							He has two flourishing Catalpa trees, and has so trained them, that they
							are erect and with branches well directed for growth and shade. He has
							the Laburnum, double flowered Althea’s, the Judas tree, and several
							others but has failed with the Magnolia. His English walnuts and others
							in this neighbourhood, were last Spring attacked by a bug which
							threatens them all, with destruction— I found on the back of one of the
							leaves, a cluster of about forty small yellow worms, each about one
							third of an inch long, which I intimated to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Greenleaf might be the larva, of that pernicious bug. He
							said if it was, by tracing its transformations, perhaps some hint might
							be collected, from which a remedy against his depredations might be
							devised— I therefore plucked the leaf, brought it home, and placed it
							under a glass Rummer. On examining the cellar of the Temple several
							places were pointed out to me, where I might at my option locate the
							Tomb, but before fixing upon it, I determined to take further time for
							consideration, and to consult friends. The estimates of the cost of the
							Temple, amount to 32000 dollars—but M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							Greenleaf thinks the actual expense will fall short of 30000— This will
							require good fortune to be well carried through. The prospects as yet,
							are fair— The town and the parish have proceeded with great unanimity in
							the undertaking— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Greenleaf gave me copies
							of the votes of the Town, and of the Society, both of 6. November 1826.
							accepting the proposal I had made, by my Letter of 8. September 1826. to
							the Supervisors, and authorising them to make the contract with me as I
							had suggested— At the temple I met and recognized my Classmate <persRef
								ref="prentiss-nathaniel">Nathaniel Shepherd Prentiss</persRef>; and
							also an old inhabitant of the town whom I remember from the days of my
							childhood, <persRef ref="marsh-wilson">Wilson Marsh</persRef>. After

								>Tucker</persRef> and <persRef ref="dwelle-elisha">Dwelle</persRef>
							are inhabitants of Boston, and inventors or proprietors of a new
							invented hydrometer, for measuring the strength of Spirituous liquors—
							Three or four years since they petitioned Congress representing that
							their hydrometer was much superior to that of <persRef ref="dicas-john"
								>Dycas</persRef>, the use of which is prescribed by Law, at the
							Custom houses of the United States and praying that theirs might be
							substituted in its place. A Bill to that effect was introduced into the
							House of Representatives; but in its progress rival inventors appeared
							and laid in claims, so that the act of Congress was modified— It
							authorised the Treasury to cause examinations to be made, and to direct
							the substitution of the hydrometer which upon trial should be found the
							best— Experiments were accordingly made by direction of the <persRef
								key="rush-richard">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> at Boston,
							New-York and Philadelphia at the respective Custom-houses by the
							Collectors, assisted by scientific men. The report from the examination
							at Boston was altogether favourable to the hydrometer of Tucker and
							Dwelle: but at New-York there was a competitor named <persRef
								ref="southworth-elijah">Southworth</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="macneven-william">Professor M’Neven</persRef> had received
							another hydrometer from France invented by <persRef
								ref="gaylussac-joseph">Gay-Lussac</persRef>, which he thought
							preferable to all the rest; while at Philadelphia, one of the examiners
								<persRef ref="hare-robert">Professor Hare</persRef>, had an
							invention of his own, and was about to publish a dissertation upon the
							subject himself. The Reports therefore from New-York and Philadelphia
							were rather unfavourable to the instrument of Tucker and Dwelle. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush then had experiments made at
							Washington under his own inspection— But the results upon the trial of
							all the hydrometers was so nearly the same, that he saw no justifiable
							cause for setting aside the hydrometer of Dycas— Tucker and Dwelle
							however still persisted— A second examination was directed at Boston
							about two Months since, the Report upon which was as favourable to them
							as the first had been— They came here this morning to enquire what had
							been done further in the matter; of which I was not informed, but
							advised them to write to the Secretary of the Treasury— I mentioned to
							them the untoward circumstances which had hitherto operated against
							them: that as there had been some prejudices and perhaps individual
							interests to influence the reports from New-York and Philadelphia,
							unfavourably, it was supposable on the other hand that a disposition to
							favour them might have influenced the Reports from Boston— They said
							there had been prejudice and no goodwill to them in the examinations at
							New-York and Philadelphia— That <persRef ref="swift-joseph">General
								Swift</persRef> had in a very marked manner shewn his partiality for
							Southworth—as D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hare had done for his own
							intended publication. That the professors and scientific men with the
							exception of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Neven, appeared not to be
							so familiar with the use of the instruments, or so capable of judging of
							their relative value as the Distillers— That the superiority of their
							instruments to the others, was not in producing different results, but
							in the facility of using them, and in their durability. That twenty-two
							of the Distillers in Boston, that is all in the City but two had adopted
							their instrument for use in preference to that of Dycas, and one or more
							distillers in New York had done the same, though by a Law of the state
							it exposed them to a prosecution— I told them that I should very
							cheerfully sanction the substitution of their instrument when that
							measure could be justified by adequate evidence in its favour— But as it
							would necessarily cause expense it could not otherwise be done— Tucker
							said that although it would in the first instance occasion some expense
							it would be more than saved by the greater durability of their
							hydrometer— <persRef ref="raguet-condy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Raguet</persRef> is upon a Summer excursion with his family, and
							while here expressed a wish to see the house at the foot of Penn’s hill,
							where <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> was born; to find
							which I gave him the necessary directions— The other visitors came in
							the morning except <persRef ref="hammond-jabez">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hammond</persRef> who called at the dusk of evening, and
							told me he was going to New-Bedford his native place, but that <persRef
								ref="hammond-jabez2">his father</persRef> had removed from it when
							he was a child, and he had never been there since— <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston this morning;
							and he and <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> came out in the
							Stage this afternoon. The Sun rose clear, but clouds were gathering all
							the morning. Before noon it began to rain, which continued copiously
							till Bed time, and with the weather so cold that we had a fire in the
							dining parlour— I put under a glass two small white worms, of those, one
							of which feeds at the core, of almost every jargonelle Pear.</p>

								ref="whitney-caroline">Caroline</persRef>, with myself in all
							twenty-nine. There was scarcely a breath of wind, and we were towed to
							the mouth of the canal, which is 3/4 of a mile-long. There we entered
							the town near by a lock, and passing by the Monatiquot and Weymouth
							rivers at the right hand and the Mount Wollaston farm, and Germantown at
							the left, we crossed over between Pethicks Island and Hull, and down
							through the Light House Channel, below Egg Rock, the Brewster’s and the
							Graves, about six Miles due East of these are the best fishing grounds,
							but we could not reach them— The weather was fair and moderate; but
							calm, with occasional very light easterly breezes— It was one O’Clock
							before we reached the Light-house and three before we came to a ground
							where cod were found— We lay to for fishing not more than half an hour,
							and caught about half a dozen cod, all very small but two of moderate
							size— One dozen of very small mackerel, and two or three other small
							fishes— Of the Cod, a Chowder was made; a plentiful <hi

							found myself so unwell on returning home this Evening that I immediately
							retired to bed; leaving part of the despatches that I had received on
							board the Boat this morning to be read tomorrow— Put a large worm dropt
							from the barren vine at the Summer Garden, under a glass. The two small
							white worms that came from the Jargonelle Pears, have rolled themselves
							up in Cocoons, side by side, at the edge of the Rummer under which they

						<p>After a feverish and painful night I found myself this morning somewhat
							relieved, but suffered with a remnant of rheumatism, through the day.
							Heard <persRef ref="fiske-thaddeus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fiske</persRef> of Menotomy, in the morning from Hebrews 10.39. “But
							we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that
							believe to the saving of the Soul.” and in the afternoon from Romans
							15.13 “Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,
							that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.” The
							two Sermons appeared to be parts of one discourse, and although M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Fiske is one of those who pass under the
							denomination of liberal preachers; yet his comments upon the terms
							perdition, and saving of the Soul, gave no countenance to the doctrine
							of universalism— Without recurring to the usual common place arguments
							of the Calvinistic School, upon Faith, he dwelt impressively upon the
							joy, and peace and hope of believing—without however specifying any
							particular article of belief— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fiske was a
							very old acquaintance of mine, and two years before me at the University
							I had not seen him for many years; and sent him an invitation to dine
							with us, but he was engaged. <persRef ref="adams-thomas">My

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cruft</persRef> called with his two
							Sons <persRef ref="cruft-samuel">Samuel Breck</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="cruft-william">William Smith</persRef>, and I walked with them
							down to the Marine Railway; a recent invention for hauling up ships on a
							cradle, to repair them instead of the old practice of heaving them down.
							There are two of the ways, which are of Cast-Iron and Oak-timber from
							New-York—brought down the Canal from Lake Erie— The reason assigned for
							which was that no Oak timber of sufficient size could be obtained here—
							There was a Schooner upon one of the ways and a brig upon the other—
							They told me that This Railway was first put in operation last December
							since which they had already taken up and repaired 57 vessels besides
							the two now on the ways— But the establishment, with the land they have
							purchased and the buildings they have erected has cost them near a
							hundred thousand dollars; and the profits of their business, make no
							adequate return for this expenditure. We walked round, by the old
							Winisimet Ferry, Charles river Bridge, the site of the filled up old
							Mill-Pond, and back by the magnificent new Market House the Long-wharf
							and State-Street, back to my lodgings— The improvements in the City are
							very great and very costly— They are the proofs of prosperity, which may
							a good Providence continue, and of a Spirit of enterprize, that deserves
							its reward— After breakfast I remained till 2. P.M. at the Exchange, and
							received the visitors named in the margin, and two or three others, not
							known or not remembered. I then rode out with <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks’s</persRef>
							at Medford; having engaged to pass the Sunday with him— He resides at a

							from Boston. There were here at dinner, <persRef ref="gorham-benjamin"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Benjamin Gorham</persRef>,
							brother of <persRef ref="brooks-ann">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

							he can be admitted to the Bar, their marriage was postponed until that
							time. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks has living seven sons and
							three daughters; none of whom except Abby, now reside with them— The

							which are well cultivated, and ornamented with more regard to usefulness
							than show— The Middlesex Canal passes through his garden, and serves as

							also the benefit as if it were part of his own Estate— He has a Shower
							bath, conducted by a pipe from the waters of the Canal; and numerous
							fruit and forest trees of his own raising— The day was lowering so that
							we walked but partially over the grounds. We attended at Meeting, and
							heard a young man named <persRef ref="burnap-george">G. W.
								Burnap</persRef>, a nephew of the late <persRef ref="brooks-john"
								>Governor Brooks</persRef>—in the morning from Psalm 122.1. [“]I was
							glad when they said unto me Let us go into the House of the Lord”— The
							Sermon was well composed and divided considering successively the
							propriety, the advantages, and the pleasures of public religious
							worship. The afternoon Sermon was from Galatians 6.7. “Be not deceived:
							God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
							8. For he that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption:
							but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life
							everlasting.” The discourses were both short— Soon after our return from
							the afternoon service, <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi

							brought in my Chaise and left it at <persRef ref="gragg-oliver">M<hi

								<persRef ref="foster-louisa">Louisa</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa Smith</persRef>— After waiting near two

							determined at all Events to come out before dinner to Quincy. M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Foster sent to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gragg’s stable a boy who brought me the Chaise, but I was
							obliged to return to the Stable for my trunk and Night-bag. I then came

							them; but having intended to come out to dine, I could not brook the
							feeling of being locked up in Boston. I found <persRef

								<persRef ref="harrod-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles

						<p>At half past six this morning, <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my
								brother</persRef> with his Son <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac
								Hull</persRef>, and myself with <persRef ref="giusta-antoine"
								>Antoine</persRef>, in two Chaises went to Hingham, and stopped at
							the House of <persRef ref="loring-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thomas Loring</persRef>, where we saw him, and <persRef
								ref="whittemore-sophia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Whittemore</persRef>; and <persRef ref="loring-thomas2">his
								Son</persRef>— <persRef ref="loring-joanna">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Loring</persRef> was confined to her chamber by
							Indisposition. We then immediately proceeded upon our party to Cohasset.
							I went with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring the son in his Chaise
							and his servant-man, rode with Antoine in mine— <persRef
								ref="thaxter-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Thaxter</persRef>, and his Son in Law <persRef ref="thaxter-edward"
								>Edward Thaxter</persRef>, <persRef ref="thaxter-norton">Norton
								Quincy</persRef>, Son of <persRef ref="thaxter-quincy">Quincy
								Thaxter</persRef>, <persRef ref="lincoln-martin">Martin
								Lincoln</persRef>, a Son of the old Revolutionary General <persRef
								ref="lincoln-benjamin">Benjamin Lincoln</persRef>, deceased, and
								<persRef ref="fiske-robert">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fiske</persRef>, and <persRef ref="gay-ebenezer">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ebenezer Gay</persRef>, constituted
							our company. We went to the Houses of the two Nicholls’s on the Cohasset
							Sea-Shore, and thence in a boat to the outer of the two Rocks called the
							Black Rock, from which we fished about three hours, and caught about
							eight dozen Sea perch, and a very few other small fishes— We then
							returned in a very leaky boat to the shore, and dined at the further
							Nicholls’s <persRef ref="brooks-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brooks</persRef> the Minister of Hingham <unclear>then</unclear> joining the party—
							An unfortunate accident, marred its pleasures, my horse having kicked
							the servant man named <persRef ref="nelson-william">William
								Nelson</persRef>, who was with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Loring— He was struck on one arm, and on the lower stomach, but by the
							saving mercy of Providence, not severely wounded— He fell at the first
							shock; but soon recovered, and was not disabled from attending the
							horses, and returning with us to Hingham. On that return we rode over
							about two miles of the Nantasket Beach, the tide being nearly high— It
							was the first time I had ever visited this magnificent Scene: but a low
							tide, and a stormy day, are the times for seeing it, in its highest
							sublimity— On reaching Hingham I visited M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Quincy Thaxter, whom I saw with <persRef
								ref="thaxter-anna;thaxter-susannah" type="multi">his two
								daughters</persRef>, and their aged <persRef ref="thaxter-celia"
								>Aunt Celia</persRef>— Then at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
							Thaxter’s where I saw <persRef ref="thaxter-anna3">his wife</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="u">daughter</persRef>, the wife of Edward Thaxter:
							after which I joined again the fishing party who took tea at M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brooks’s— Then at the dusk of Evening we
							came home to Quincy; I with my brother in his Chaise, and his Son Isaac
							with Antoine in mine— In riding this afternoon with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Loring we met at a narrow passage of the
							road a Chaise, in which were three Ladies and so unskilfully driven that
							the wheels of the two Chaises became interlocked before the horses could
							be stopped, and two seconds more would have produced a shock and a crash
							which must have endangered the lives and limbs of all who were in either
							Chaise— Two most deplorable accidents were thus most narrowly escaped in
							this day, and I had two solemn warnings of the numberless incidents by
							which a party of pleasure is often converted into an irreparable
							calamity. Praise the Lord O my Soul, and be not unmindful of his
							benefits— <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> went to Boston
							this morning and returned at Night.</p>

							of Charlestown, and Poem by <persRef ref="bradford-gamaliel">D<hi

							says that young trees will not thrive in the same places where old ones

							Dorchester to visit <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript"

								Mills</persRef> the late Senator of the United States with <persRef
								ref="welsh-harriet">Harriet Welsh</persRef> coming to visit me— I
							turned back and received them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mills,
							appears to be more recovered from his illness than could have been
							expected last Spring when he left Washington, but he is still <pb
								type="ms" n="277"/>much emaciated, and very feeble— At the second
							trial to go with <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> to
							Dorchester we had scarcely passed by <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Beales</persRef> House, when we
							met <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Levi Lincoln</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="dewolf-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
								D’Wolf</persRef> heretofore a Senator from Rhode-Island, and
								<persRef ref="sumner-william">General William H. Sumner</persRef>,
							in a Coach— I turned back again, and gave up the visit to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey for this day— Governor Lincoln has
							been some days at Boston, to attend the annual Commencement at
							Cambridge— He spoke of the late correspondence between his brother
								<persRef ref="lincoln-enoch">Enoch Lincoln</persRef> the Governor of
							Maine, and the Secretary of State, relating to our controversy with
							Great-Britain, concerning the North-Eastern boundary, and expressed much
							regret at the temper which the Governor of Maine had exhibited in it—
							Apologised for his brother with proper brotherly regard, and said he had
							informed him that there was no participation here in that excitement
							which he had shewn; or in the pretension which he seemed to have
							advanced, that all the documents of a Negotiation with a foreign
							Government should be communicated to him, as Executive of a State
							interested in the issue, even while the Negotiation was pending— I said
							I had perceived with much regret the earnest apprehensions which the
							Governor of Maine had expressed in the Correspondence alluded to, as to
							the progress and result of the Negotiation— That with regard to the
							documents, the greatest objection to furnishing him with copies of them
							all was the great mass of them comprizing many folio Volumes— That there
							had never been the slightest disposition to conceal any one of them from
							the Government of Maine, and that they had been at all times open to the
							inspection of every member of the delegation in Congress from the State—
							That the solicitude felt by the Governor of Maine for the issue of the
							Negotiation, was duly appretiated by me as arising from an anxious sense
							of his own duty and the deep interest of the State in the Event— That
							assuredly no sacrifice of that interest would ever be sanctioned by me;
							but that from the present temper of the British Government, shewn not
							only in this but upon every other point in discussion with us, the
							prospects of an early and satisfactory result were absolutely desperate.
							It was extremely doubtful whether even the Commercial Convention of 1818
							would be renewed. As to this North-eastern boundary there was an express
							engagement which bound the parties to refer the question to the decision
							of a friendly Sovereign; but the Commissioners had disagreed upon the
							facts, as upon every thing else; and there was and could be no issue
							made up, until a statement of facts could be agreed upon between the two
							Governments to be submitted to the arbitrator— <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef> was now engaged in effecting this with the
							British Plenipotentiaries, but whether it could be accomplished was
							altogether uncertain— The Spirit of the present British Administration
							was so inveterately hostile, that unless some change should take place
							there I could not promise myself any favourable termination to the
							negotiations with them— The Governor said that the reference itself of
							the question of boundary to any foreign Sovereign, was a subject of
							great aversion to the State of Maine; but that he himself had entire
							confidence in the Constitutional organ of negotiation. That he proposed
							in a short time to visit Portland in Maine, where he expected to see his
							brother, and should converse freely with him upon these concerns, and
							hoped to remove some of the apprehensions which he had harboured— He
							invited me to visit him again at Worcester, in the most friendly manner,
							observing that he might not have another opportunity of seeing me here,
							before my return to Washington. I assured him of the great satisfaction
							which I had enjoyed in my visit to him last year, and of the pleasure,
							which I should take in repeating it; but observed that the illness of
								<persRef ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Boylston</persRef> rendered it doubtful whether I could go this year
							by the way of Princeton, and in that case it might not be in my power to
							go by the way of Worcester. He then said he would endeavour to see me
							again here before my return— He spoke with regret of the unfavourable
							issue of the Elections for Congress in Kentucky, the information of
							which has been first received this day— I had notice of it by a Letter
							from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay. After the Governor went away I
							walked with <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth</persRef> to
								<persRef ref="marston-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Marston’s</persRef>, where with my brother’s family I passed the
							Evening— We were in going overtaken by the skirts of a thunder shower
							and took a slight sprinkling. There was at M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Marston’s a <persRef ref="u">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Goodwin</persRef> of Pawtucket; and the young Ladies of
