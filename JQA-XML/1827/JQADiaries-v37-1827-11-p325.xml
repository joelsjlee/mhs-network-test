							brought back the Clock I had given him to repair, and took my
							Chronometer to clean— As it has twice stopped I can place no reliance
							upon it, until the cause of its irregularity shall be removed— <persRef
								ref="thumblert-william">Thumlert</persRef> is the man who has been
							to me several times, and who is yet unable to authenticate the marriage
							and deaths of <persRef ref="thumblert-george">his father</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="u">mother</persRef>, and his own birth. He now brought
							a Letter from himself to <persRef ref="crommelin-daniel">Daniel
								Crommelin</persRef> and Son at Amsterdam, containing a statements of
							facts, with copies of two certificates, one from the Clerk of the County
							Court at Baltimore that in Nov<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1782. a
							licence was issued from that Court to a German Clergyman named, to marry
								<persRef ref="thumlert-john">John Martin Thumlert</persRef>
								and    <persRef ref="u">Miller</persRef>, and the other from the
							present minister of the German Lutheran Church at Baltimore, that the
							person named in the above certificate was at that time Pastor of that
							Church— But he has no positive Evidence of the Marriage, and no evidence
							either of the deaths or births— He had also signed the Letter as well
							for his brother <persRef ref="thumblert-george2">George</persRef>, who
							he says lives at Philadelphia, as for himself. I advised him to take
							back his Letter and strike out the name of his brother from the
							signature; and add to it that authenticated copies of the Certificates
							will be forwarded if necessary. And I said I would then send the Letter
							through <persRef ref="hughes-christopher">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hughes</persRef>, our Charge d’Affaires to the Netherlands, who he
							says must have known his father at Annapolis— <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> and <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> were
							here together— The Governor had a Letter from a friend of his named
								<persRef ref="u">Stewart</persRef> who has been for thirty years or
							more, one of the Electors of President and Vice President; and who gives
							him some account of electioneering movements in Virginia, favourable to
							the Administration, and some advice to avoid controvertible matter in
							the Message to Congress— Which I told the Governor I was disposed to do;
							believing that the first, and perhaps the last of my annual Messages
							would be the only occasions proper for an avowal of general principles.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay spoke of the despatches last
							received from <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, which inform us that he has agreed
							upon another Convention with the British Government, which is to
							regulate the reference to a friendly Sovereign of the question relating
							to the North-eastern boundary. He said M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin would come home—and that he regretted his omission to present
							the formal claim of our right to navigate the S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Lawrence river— <persRef ref="hagan-james">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Hagan</persRef> came to apply for an
							appointment of Surgeon’s mate in the army, and brought with him several
							Letters of recommendation— I took a walk of three hours in the
							woods—gathering Acorns, and few <unclear>Nuts</unclear>— The white Oak Acorns are in
							great plenty, lying on the ground, and have almost all germinated. All
							others are exceedingly scarce, and I found not one that had germinated.
							I went particularly to seek for acorns of the Post Oak, and found a few,
							upon and under several trees— But they are very small. I also discovered
							westward of the rear of the College, growing nearly together, three
							Willow Oaks—two of them beautiful trees at least forty feet high, and
							nine or ten feet in circumference. Their acorns, of which I gathered a
							handful, some upon the ground and some from the trees, are still smaller
							than those of the Post-Oak— Their leaves have begun to fall, but those
							upon the trees are yet green; as are those of the black and grey
							Oaks—while those of the white Oaks have turned to the darkest crimson— I
							found three unknown seeds which I propose to plant, and gathered two
							Persimons— This fruit is sometimes eaten; but is in so little esteem,
							that the boys and the negroes, are not even tempted to pluck them from
							the trees— They are hanging thick upon them the leaves having all
							fallen— <persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef> and

						<list><item>Dickens— Asbury </item></list>
						<p>Mistaking Moonlight for the dawn, I rose this morning at 4. O’Clock and
							after writing the Diary of Yesterday, found time for an hours walk
							before Breakfast— <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Dickens</persRef> came, and took back the proof sheet of
							his circular as Secretary to the Columbian Institute, in which I had
							made some verbal alterations— He readily adopted them and spoke of the
							employment of a Gardener to attend occasionally at the garden of the
							Institute— There is little to do, and a man had been employed, at the
							price of 5. dollars a Month— But he died last Summer, and <persRef
								ref="foy-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Foy</persRef> the
							Gardener at the Capitol had offered if I should express the wish that he
							should, to superintend the Garden, and to employ an occasional workman
							by the day as might be needed—which I approved— At one O’Clock I went
							into the Woods with my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>, to
							gather Acorns and Nuts for planting. In ranging nearly three hours
							through the forest, I found upon the ground a great profusion of Chesnut
							Oak and White Oak Acorns, and scarcely one other— Of the Post-Oak and
							Black Jack, which I was particularly solicitous to obtain, although I
							found multitudes of the Trees, I did not obtain a single Acorn— Very few
							of the Black, grey and Spanish Oaks, the trees of which abound but none
							of them appear to be in bearing— We gathered about a peck of the white
							and Chesnut Oak Acorns, and might have gathered bushels. They differ
							very much in size, upon different trees; and the size of the acorn is
							not at all proportioned to that of the tree— Some of the Chesnut Oak are
							of the largest size, and equal to the Acorns of the English Oak— They
							also differ somewhat in form some being more oblong, and some
							oblate—approaching the shape of the Black Oak Acorn— We also gathered a
							few Persimmons for the seed— They are not yet all ripe, although there
							have several successive Nights of Sharp frost. I found also a few Shag
							barks a few pignuts but not more than three or four Chesnuts— The Acorns
							have almost all germinated— They should be gathered the las week in
							September, and first week in October. While we were out, the Rev<hi

						<p><persRef ref="stewart-nancy">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Stewart</persRef> is an old widow Lady, with a family of grown up
							children—several daughters and two Sons— <persRef ref="u">One of
								whom</persRef> is employed in the Indian Agency in the Territory of
							Michigan, and the other, was a <persRef ref="stewart-william"
								>Clerk</persRef> in the Department of War. She came to me this
							morning in great distress; and shewed me a Letter from the <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Secretary of War</persRef>, to him who was the
							Clerk; simply saying in two lines that his Services were no longer
							required in that Department. She complained in the agony of her heart,
							that this dismission had been sent abruptly, and without a word of
							previous notice to her Son, who was now, and had been for several days
							confined to his bed with sickness— That she had yesterday morning gone
							herself to the War Department; to give notice of this cause of her Sons
							absence; and was met by his terrible <pb type="ms" n="328"
							/>notification— That she had seen the Secretary of War, and was informed
							by him, that the cause of her Son’s dimission was intemperance— That she
							had told the Secretary that the cause of her Sons absence from the
							Office now was sickness—which Governor Barbour said he had not known—
							That she had intreated him to reinstate her Son whose Salary was almost
							her only dependence for her support and that of her daughters— The
							Governor told her it was too late, as he had already disposed of the
							Office to <persRef ref="taylor-robert3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Taylor</persRef>, late a member of Congress from Virginia. She
							therefore implored me to speak to the other heads of Departments in
							behalf of her Son, for any vacancy of a Clerkship that may occur or any
							occasional employment that may be wanted— She said she was a relation, a
							second Cousin of <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Monroe</persRef>, at whose instance this appointment had
							been given to her Son, upon the express understanding that the Salary
							should be applied to her support and that of her family— That her Rent
							was now due, and she was indebted for ten Cords of Wood, purchased for
							her winter’s supply. She knew not where to look for the means of
							payment, her son’s Salary being cut off. He was a kind and affectionate
							Son. He was also as faithful and efficient a Clerk as any one in the
							Department, though he was occasionally imprudent—but it did not often
							happen. Sometimes not for Months together, then only for a few days;
							followed by the severest penitence— She had last fall spoken of it to
							Governor Barbour, and intreated him to bear with her Sons infirmity— She
							had promised as far as she was able to reclaim him, and she had great
							influence over him— But his head was weak, a Single glass would unsettle
							him; and then without knowing what he was about, he would drink more.
							But he had been treated more harshly than others, and she named to me
							three or four persons, who she said had killed themselves with liquor,
							who had yet been suffered to retain their offices till the last days of
							their lives, and then they had been given to their Children— I told her
							that I would speak to the heads of Departments, of her Son; but it could
							only be an expression of my feelings. The appointment of Clerks was by
							law vested in the Heads of the Respective Departments; and they
							appointed and displaced them under their own responsibility and often
							without consulting at all the President. Governor Barbour had not
							mentioned to me his dimssion of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stewart
							or its cause— And I myself had once been compelled to dismiss a Clerk
							from the Department of State for the same cause; and had done it without
							consulting M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe. M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stewart also pleaded with me in behalf of
							her Son, in Michigan, who she says has no vice, and is now upon a Salary
							of only 500 dollars a year— I heard this morning at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church <persRef
								ref="bedell-gregory">M<hi rend="superscript">r
							</hi>Bedell</persRef>, from Revelations 2.17. “To him that overcometh
							will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone,
							and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth, saving he
							that receiveth it.” And from this text he gave one of the most
							ingenious, learned and eloquent discourses that I ever heard— The hidden
							manna, and the white stone, the tessera hospitalitatis he illustrated by
							historical and critical explanations—with citations of a commentary upon
							the Medea of <persRef ref="euripides">Euripides</persRef>, and an
							extract from the Poenulus of Plautus. He who overcometh is the Christian
							conqueror of the world and of himself—the white stone is a compact of
							friendship formed by Christ with him for Time and Eternity; and the
							application is to the auditory themselves— There is a diversity of
							opinion upon the preaching of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bedell— It
							is highly pleasing to me— His matter is elaborate—his manner thoroughly
							studied, and his elocution and action, dramatic— But the substance of
							his discourse is momentous, his doctrines impressive, his delivery
							solemn, and he leaves altogether an indelible impression upon the memory
							of his hearers— This afternoon the quarterly meeting of the Sunday
							School Union was at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church— It
							was opened with a prayer by <persRef ref="laurie-james">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Laurie</persRef>— Addresses were made
							to the Children by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bedell— To the
							teachers by <persRef ref="milnor-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Milnor</persRef> and to the auditory by <pb type="ms" n="329"/>by
								<persRef ref="allen-ethan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Allen</persRef>. That of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bedell was
							admirable— Something in the form of a catechism. He gave notice that he
							should consider himself as being with the children only, and as having
							no other auditory— He then told the children that he would read to them
							a verse from the Bible which he wished them all to remember— It was the
								9<hi rend="superscript">th. </hi>verse of the 28<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Chapter of the first Book of Chronicles—
							“And thou, Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve
							him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the Lord searcheth
							all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if
							thou seek him he will be found of thee: but if thou forsake him he will
							cast thee off forever.” He commented upon every part of this text, in
							language entirely suited to the comprehension of the children, and asked
							them several questions, such as scarcely any of them could be unable to
							answer— Some one or more of them did in fact answer every question,
							although this sort of dialogue had not been practiced here, before. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bedell said it was in Philadelphia— I
							attended again at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s in the Evening,
							and heard M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Milnor, from 2. Peter 3.14.
							“Wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that
							ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless”— A plain
							and sensible Sermon— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Milnor was formerly
							a member of Congress from Philadelphia—but is now an episcopal
							clergyman; settled at New-York. The prayers read were for the 21<hi
								rend="superscript">st. </hi> Sunday after Trinity, and the Communion
							was administered in the morning— I remained to witness, but without
							taking it— <persRef ref="hellen-johnson;hellen-mary" type="multi"

								>John</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail</persRef>

								M’Kinnon</persRef> is the wife of a <persRef ref="u"
								>Tailor</persRef> at Baltimore, who came here to solicit a place of

								>r</hi> M’Kinnon— <persRef ref="elgar-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Elgar</persRef> called, and I enquired
							about the paving of the North side of the square, North of the
							President’s House— He gave me his reasons for commencing it narrower
							than that of the adjoining Streets, in a written paper— But the
							difference being only between 15 and 17 feet, for the sake of uniformity
							and to accommodate the inhabitants of that vicinity, I told him, I
							thought it would be best to widen the pavement to the same dimensions
							with that of the adjoining Streets— He assented; but said it could not
							then be finished this year. He also observed that there was a similar,
							and greater contraction of the pavement on the Capitol Square, to that
							which he had proposed here. I told him I had determined to have a stove
							put up in this house, similar to those lately built under the Rotunda,
							at the Capitol; and asked if it could be paid for from the appropriation
							for the public buildings— He said he was sorry that it could not— I said
							I would then pay for it from the appropriation for furniture—although it
							is an expenditure more properly chargeable to the other— <persRef

							perform the duties of the late Secretary of the Territory, who he said
							was always absent. Of the present Secretary <pb type="ms" n="331"

									>l.</hi> Amory</persRef> as Navy Agent at Pensacola, and of the

							speak with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush on the subject of his
							Accounts, and if we found they could be paid from any existing
							appropriation it should be done. I also conversed with him upon the
							measures which may be necessary for the preservation of the Live Oak,
							upon the Public Lands in Florida. He thought with me that there should
							be a person whose special duty it should be to inspect and superintend
							them— He says there is much wood upon the grounds, which ought to be
							taken off; and much waste, and depredation in other places which ought
							to be prevented. <persRef ref="raguet-condy">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Raguet</persRef> late Charge d’Affaires at Rio de

							him— The enclosures he left with me. They are orders from the Brazilian
							Government to their <persRef ref="lobo-rodrigo">Admiral Lobo</persRef>
							in 1825. not to take neutral vessels for breach of Blockade until after
							warning. From the date of these orders, immediately after a Note
							addressed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Raguet to the Brazilian
							Government, he inclines to ascribe it all to himself— The Letter from
							his friend that upon the exhibition of these Orders to the Admiralty
							Court all the captured netural vessels must be acquitted, and Raguet
							says that the copies of these orders never could be obtained until after
							he came away— <persRef ref="worthington-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Worthington</persRef> called for a morning visit; and
							said he was here in behalf of claimants before the Slave-indemnity
							Commission. At one O’Clock, <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi

								<persRef ref="rumpff-vincent">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							signed by the <persRef ref="bartels-johann">Burgomaster
								President</persRef> of Hamburg and Lubeck and by the <persRef
								ref="u">President</persRef> of the Senate of Bremen. He has the
							character of Minister Plenipotentiary from the Hanseatic Cities upon a
							special Mission to negotiate a Treaty of Navigation and Commerce— In
							delivering the Letters, he addressed to me a very few words, expressive
							of the desire of the Governments of the Hanseatic Cities, to cultivate
							the friendship of the United States and their Government; which I
							answered as briefly by assuring him of our reciprocal feelings; of my
							own regard for the Hanseatic Republics, and of my determination to
							foster and promote to the extent of my power our commerical intercourse
							with them. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay read me a Letter from
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> written at New York on Monday Morning the first
							day of their elections for the State Legislature: and he left with me a
							Letter from <persRef ref="rochester-william">W. B. Rochester</persRef>,
							also at New-York, of the Evening before— It is apparent from these
							Letters, that the opposition, under the management of <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef>, have carried the
							elections in the City, and throughtout the State— Rochester’s Letter is
							however remarkable in several other Respects— He urges M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay most vehemently to be a Candidate at
							the next election for the Vice-Presidency— He declares that if I had
							been so inconsiderate as to offer him the appointment of Minister
							Plenipotentiary to the Republic of Colombia, he would have rejected it,
							and he wants a passage in a public Ship, to go and patch up his Crazy
							Constitution at Guatemala, till the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							March 1829. He also very distinctly intimates that if I had offered the
							Plenipotentiary Mission, he should have refused it to remain at home,
							and be a Candidate for the Office of Governor of New-York next year,
							because in that event there would have been a possible chance of
							success— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay also renewed his complaints
							against the <persRef ref="mclean-john2">Postmaster General
								M’lean</persRef>, whom he charges with using perfidiously the
							influence and patronage of his Office, which is very great, against the
							administration. In these New-York elections it appears that the

							Post-Office has been violently hostile. <persRef ref="barbour-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour</persRef> made the same
							complaint, but there is no specific fact mentioned which could be
							distinctly laid to the charge <pb type="ms" n="332"/>of any one—

							and Walnuts, round the whole border—leaving the other spaces for
							planting the seeds of various other trees domestic and exotic— And he

								Law</persRef>, with his old argument upon the distresses of the
							Country; the low price of wheat and tobacco, and the indispensable

							made by Congress. This they were willing to do, and they had been
							engaged with an expectation on their part till the building should be

							the time at the Capitol, which would reduce the encroachment upon the

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> took back signed

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan</persRef> maintains him

							consult the Books and ascertain if there was any; and also to call upon
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan, for his authority in

							before completing it, <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi

							during a time when they were not in actual service. I told him that my

							from Rhode Island; urging the appointment of a young man of Newport,
							whom he had recommended as a Purser; and bitterly complaining that he

						<p>Heard this morning <persRef ref="burnap-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Burnap</persRef>, the same whom I had heard at Medford
							the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August last. His text this day
							was from Ecclesiastes 9.10. “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it
							with thy might.” The doctrine he drew from it was that man was made for
							action: and that all virtue consisted in action— This I believe to be
							true, generally—though temperance is a virtue rather of omission than of
							action; and fortitude is rather passive than of action— These are
							however virtues, the great and immediate operation of which is upon
							their possessor, in which they may be termed selfish virtues— All social
							virtue consists in action—in <hi rend="italic">doing </hi>good— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Burnap’s discourse was ingenious and
							eloquent, but his delivery is not pleasing. He has acquired more
							confidence than when I heard him at Medford, which was only his second
							appearance in <unclear>the p</unclear>ulpit. His composition is good, and there appears
							to be no barrenness of thought in his mind— He has received a Call, from
							the Congregational Society at Baltimore, and is now exchanging for three
							Sundays with <persRef ref="motte-mellish">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Motte</persRef>. There is in <persRef ref="smith-adam"
								>Smith’s</persRef> Theory of Moral Sentiments, some disquisition
							upon this principle that virtue consists in action; with remarks upon
							the moral perversion of the opposite doctrine, which is one of the
							dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church—and Smith criticises the sentiments
							on this subject expressed by <persRef ref="massillon-jean"
								>Massillon</persRef>, in a Panegyric upon some Saint— Retirement
							from the world, and communion with God, are good, only as like sleep to
							the body, they refresh and fortify the mind for active exertion— <pb
								type="ms" n="336"/>In the afternoon, I heard <persRef
								ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>
							from Genesis 4.8. “And Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to
							pass when they were in the field, that <persRef ref="cain"
								>Cain</persRef> rose up against <persRef ref="abel">Abel</persRef>
							his brother, and slew him”— The Sermon was an exposition of that and the
							two following verses, and the passage upon which he dwelt with the most
							emphatic iteration was the question what hast thou done?—which he warned
							all vicious and guilty persons that God would address in the day of
							account to each of them— I did not go out this Evening.</p>

							1814. In the Report of which the whole doctrine of Consular privilege
							was examined— There was no such usage as that claimed for Inerarity in

							some case within his personal knowledge, and in which he had understood
							it to have been allowed in Spain— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							said he would send me the Book containing the decision of Lord
							Ellenborough— He spoke also of a draft of an Instruction which he had
							prepared to send to <persRef ref="poinsett-joel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Poinsett</persRef>, and of Letters that he had written
							to <persRef ref="lincoln-enoch">Governor Lincoln</persRef> of Maine and
							to <persRef ref="sprague-peleg">P. Sprague</persRef>, one of the
							Representatives from that State, upon the disturbances on the

							stirred up to increase the difficulties of the Administration and excite
							a popular clamour in the Eastern Country against it.— <persRef

							took back the papers relating to the quarrel between <persRef
								ref="smith-john7">Captain Smith</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u">M<hi

							approved of his proposal to order Smith upon another service, to avoid
							bloodshed between them; but thought Manney was not sustained in his
							allegations by the Report from <persRef ref="macomb-alexander">General
								Macomb</persRef>— Governor Barbour spoke also of the continued
							adverse intelligence, of the Elections in the State of New-York, and
							with great discouragement of the Prospects of the Administration— There
							is a combination against it of all the leaders of the local parties in
							the State, and the result is proportionably disastrous. He spoke of the
							Vice-Presidency concerning which <unclear>he</unclear> asked my opinion— I observed that
							it was a matter of much delicacy for me to interfere in at all; but that
							my own inclination <pb type="ms" n="337"/>was for himself— He mentioned
							that it had been in the first instance proposed to him by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay—that he wished every personal
							consideration to be put out of the question; and such person to be
							selected, as would give most strength to the cause. He thought that this
							would not be the effect of the nomination of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay— <persRef ref="foy-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Foy</persRef> was here and I finished with him the planting of the
							border round my enclosure—with Oaks, White, Rock Chesnut, Post, and
							Willow—Shag barks, Pignuts and Black Walnut—Chesnut, Persimmon,
							Tulip-tree and Lime— I indulge the imagination and the hope that this
							border will outlast many Presidents of the United States—but who can
							look into futurity for the natural life of a row of Oaks? and who can
							tell how soon they may be uprooted? I asked Governor Barbour for his
							Report and the Documents from the War Department for the preparation of
							the Message; but they were not ready— I therefore intermitted this

							has been arrested by a bilious fever on the road, and gives a dismal

							That he was told that in Twiggs County, Georgia not less than a thousand
							persons, or a tenth part of the population died last year, and in the

							through which he had passed in North Carolina— And of the contrast in

							the labour of Slaves— <persRef ref="cook-thomas2">Thomas Cook</persRef>
							was an Englishman, who has been about two Months in this Country, and

							Commander in Chief then the <persRef ref="frederickaugustus">Duke of

							there were so many applicants Citizens of this Country for every Office

								Southard</persRef> brought me the record of proceedings of a General
							Naval Court Martial, sitting at Philadelphia, upon the trial of
							Lieutenant <persRef ref="sands-joshua2">Joshua R. Sands</persRef> of the
							Navy, for an assault upon <persRef ref="chauncey-isaac">Commodore
								Chauncey</persRef>, his Commander; at Brooklyn Long-Island on the
								2<hi rend="superscript">d. </hi>of July last— It was a personal
							collision and altercation, on a conflict of claim to part of the
							Navy-Yard, between the United States and <persRef ref="sands-joshua"
								>Joshua Sands</persRef>, the Lieutenant’s father, and a mutual
							setting up, and pulling down of fences. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Southard requested my immediate attention to this case, which I
							accordingly gave. There were three Charges upon all which the Court
							found Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Sands gulity, and sentenced
							him to be cashiered— A majority of the Court in consequence of the
							peculiar circumstances appearing upon the record of the proceedings,
							recommend Lieutenant Sands to the Mercy of the President of the United
							States— I read the papers and subjoined to the Sentence of the Court,
							the following decision—“The Sentence of the Court is approved, and in
							consideration of the peculiar circumstances appearing upon the Record,
							and of the recommendation of the majority of the Court the penalty is
							remitted.” <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Colvin</persRef> came to solicit a loan of money, to enable her to
							purchase a printing Office, for the publication of her weekly newspaper,
							which I declined. She spoke in a deeply affecting manner, of the
							incorrigible intemperance of <persRef ref="colvin-john">her late
								husband</persRef>, and of its consequences, fatal to himself, and so
							distressing to her. I sent to <persRef ref="hagner-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hagner</persRef> the third Auditor,
							the papers of <persRef ref="tharp-william">William Tharp</persRef>, and
							requested a Report from him upon the facts of the case— Hagner came, and
							said that there had been a correspondence between him, and the
							Committees of the two Houses of Congress to whom Tharp’s Memorial had
							been referred—a copy of which he would send me, with the Statement of
							facts— He said every indulgence had been extended to Tharp in adjusting
							his Accounts, consistent with the indispensable and universally
							applicable Rules of the Offices— He asked me for the first of two
							Reports he had made to me, on the claims of <persRef
								ref="mckenney-thomas">T. L. M’Kenney</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> called and took the
							draft of his annual Report with the accompanying documents— <persRef
								ref="bulfinch-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bulfinch</persRef> introduced <persRef ref="burnap-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Burnap</persRef>, the young preacher,
							about to settle at Baltimore. <persRef ref="roberdeau-isaac">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Roberdeau</persRef> called to

								ref="elliot-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Elliot’s</persRef>— <persRef ref="nourse-charles">Major
								Nourse</persRef>, brought me a comparative Statement of the
							Estimates for the Service of the War Department, in the years 1827. and
							1828. which I had requested Governor Barbour to send me— Their total
							amount for 1827. was short of 5,200,000. and for 1828. exceeds 4,800000
							dollars— The average is five Millions. <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> introduced <persRef
								ref="carroll-charles2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Carroll</persRef> a member of the Senate of New-York, who says he
							left Albany last Sunday— He is a brother of the <persRef
								ref="carroll-henry">young man</persRef> who was with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay at Ghent— He said he had an account
							to settle at the Treasury Department, upon which he found it necessary
							to appeal to me from a decision of <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>; and asked me when it
							would be convenient to me to examine the papers— I told him at any time—
							He confirmed the account of the issue of the Elections for the New-York
							Elections for the State Legislature, which are in favour of the
							opposition, almost univerally. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay left
							with me, a Note from <persRef ref="rebello-silvestre">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rebello</persRef>, the Chargé
							d’Affaires from Brazil, with a translation sent by himself, and another
							made at the Department— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said it
							would require immediate attention, and that he would call concerning it,
							to-morrow morning. It is in langugae highly offensive; complaining of
							the partiality of the People of the U.S. against the <persRef
								ref="pedro-iv">Emperor of Brazil</persRef> in his War with
							Buenos-Ayres; and of Republican intolerance. <persRef

								<persRef ref="handy-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Charges of partiality, against the People of the United States, and
							criminations of Republican intolerance— I advised M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay to see M<hi rend="superscript">r
							</hi>Rebello, to point out the objectionable passages in his Note, and
							to give him the opportunity to take it back, and alter it so that it
							could be received. I desired him to suggest to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Rebello, that the People of the United States, were the
							Sovereign authority of the Country— That reflections upon them as a
							People, by a Minister to their Government, were as offensive, as
							personal reflections upon the conduct and character of the Monarch,
							would be from a Minister of the United States to a king or Emperor to
							whom he should be accredited that all reflections upon the nature of the
							Government, were in like manner inadmissible. That any complaint against

							Citizens for injury to Brazilians in violation of the Laws of Nations,
							would be received and duly considered but that if he declined taking
							back and altering his note; it should be sent back to him; and he should
							be informed that no answer would be given to it—and a demand should be
							made upon his Government to recall him— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay’s views, perfectly concurred with mine— He spoke also of these
							disturbances in Maine—said he had written to <persRef
								ref="sprague-peleg">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Sprague</persRef>; and although he did not exactly know what to do
							further—yet thought something further should be done— I thought the

							in <persRef ref="lincoln-enoch">Governor Enoch Lincoln’s</persRef>

							also a Letter from a friend of his in Virginia, complaining of the
								<persRef ref="mclean-john2">Postmaster General’s</persRef> political

								>Commissioner</persRef> of the General Land Office; and from the

							the Treasury Department, and of what has been done, under them. All
							which he promised to have made out as soon as possible— He read me a
							Letter that he had received from <persRef ref="stewart-andrew">Andrew

							urging that internal improvement and domestic manufacturers should again
							be earnestly recommended <pb type="ms" n="341"/>in the Message—but Rush

						<p><date>18. V—</date> Snow.</p>
						<p>Heard this morning <persRef ref="burnap-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Burnap</persRef> from Matthew 5.23— [“]Therefore if thou
							bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath
							ought against thee; 24. Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go
							thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy
							gift.” The discourse was a continuation of one, delivered before, and
							which I did not hear— It was a dissertation upon the benefits of public
							worship— Sensible and eloquent, but in which there seemed to be a
							connection rather remote between the commentary and the text. In the
							afternoon I heard <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hawley</persRef> from Revelations 1.17. “And when I saw
							him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me,
							saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: 18. I am he that
							liveth, and was dead; and behold I am alive for evermore. Amen; and have
							the keys of hell and of death.”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley
							considered this text as conclusive demonstration of the Divinity of
							Jesus Christ—which is indication enough of what he is willing to take
							for evidence. He read the Evening prayer for the 23<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> Sunday after Trinity, and said he had
							proposed to commence this afternoon a series of discourses, upon the
							Scriptural Characters of the old Testament who were Types of Christ; and
							to have considered now Adam in this typical character. But the auditory
							was so thin that he should postpone this design, till next Sunday— The
								13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm was sung; and not without
							deep impression upon my mind, and heart— It snowed the greater part of
							the day, but cleared off cold in the Evening. I arrived, belated at the
							church and heard only the close of the Sermon— Scarcely enough to know
							what his subject had been— I took up at <persRef ref="elliot-william2"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elliot’s</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S. Adams</persRef>, who had walked with
							me to Church in the Morning before the Snow began— In the vacant time of
							the day I read a couple of the Lettres Provinciales, and a few Sections
							of <persRef ref="murphy-arthur">Murphy’s</persRef><persRef ref="tacitus"
								>Tacitus</persRef>. This writer is utterly untranslatable— Murphy’s
							English is more smooth but his version is not so near to the Original as
								<persRef ref="gordon-thomas">Gordon’s</persRef>— It is impossible to
							convey the meaning of Tacitus without circumlocution and paraphrase; and
							that must necessarily loose his sententious brevity— I looked
							particularly for Murphy’s translation of a passage in the History:
							2.53—which had struck me much a few days since in the Original— Tacitus
							says that <persRef ref="liciniuscaecina">Licinius Caecina</persRef>, a
							new man, lately admitted in to the Senate attacked <persRef
								ref="epriusmarcellus">Eprius Marcellus</persRef>—ut magnis
							inimicitiis claresceret: which Murphy translates by saying that Caecina
							“thought to rise by encountering powerful enmities.”— Gordon has it
							“that he might by thus declaring enmity against men of great name,
							signalize his own.” This is much nearer to the thought of Tacitus; but
							neither of the Translations marks the vivid force of the verb ut <hi
								rend="italic">claresceret</hi> or the full meaning of the words
							magnis inimicitiis— That he might brighten by great enmities, would be
							literal but affected—</p>

							whether Officers in the Public Service or not, they would receive all
							due consideration, and the terms in which such complaints might be
							couched, would be left to the sense of delicacy of the foreign Officer
							making them— But no paper from a Diplomatic Agent of a foreign State

						<p>The Oil in my glass lamp failed me this morning, and the other giving

							hinted at a cession of the Lands in each State, upon certain Conditions
							of <pb type="ms" n="344"/>payment to be guarantied by the States— I said
							this so far as related to the Public Lands would bring us back to the

							to the States within which they were situated— He observed that it was
							unconditional, and he therefore did not approve of it— He thanked me for

								<persRef ref="roberdeau-isaac">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

						<p>The weather has set in unusually cold for the Season, and my walk of

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hand</persRef>, one of the Members of

								<persRef ref="smith-richard">Cashier</persRef> of the U.S. Branch
							Bank here, informing them that the Directors had determined to sell the

							countenance by heading a subscription list— This I declined, upon the

							debt from the Society to me. The time and manner in which I had advanced
							the money— The pressing want of the Society, for which it provided, and
							the promise of repayment to me in quarterly payments of 100 dollars each
							now nearly two years in arrear, principal and interest— I added that
							having heavy debts of my own to discharge, I could not in justice to my
							creditors, go further than I had done for the satisfaction of
							theirs—excepting; that while they were making their effort to pay their
							other debts I would so long as I should not be pressed by absolute
							necessity myself, forbear to press upon them for their debt to me— They
							acknowledged the failure of the Society in their promises to me; and
							pleaded their poverty— I observed that the Letter from the Cashier of
							the Bank was in a very peremptory tone, and as if the Bank had cause of
							complaint against them. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hand said they
							had remarked it with surprize; as no dissatisfaction had been manifested

							versification is regular, but perfectly easy— The only difference
							between the measured lines and the prose is that the verse has always

								Burnap</persRef> this morning from John 20.31. “But these are
							written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God;
							and that believing ye might have life through his name.” The argument of
							the Discourse, was the position of the text; that John’s Gospel was
							written to induce the belief of the disciples, that Jesus was the
							Christ—the Son of God—and that this belief should be to them the pledge
							of immortality. He dwelt upon the character of <persRef ref="john"
								>John</persRef>; upon his intimacy with Jesus—upon the force of his
							testimony, and upon the weight of this express declaration of the
							purpose for which his gospel was written— This was indirectly an
							unitarian Sermon— The inference from simple reason is that the Son of
							God cannot be God himself— That the Christ, the Messiah, the anointed,
							the king of Israel, is and must be subordinate to the Deity— In the
							afternoon, <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> read prayers at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							John’s Church, for the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> which this year
							is the last Sunday after Trinity. He preached from 1. Corinthians 15.22
							“For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” It
							was the first of the promised series of discourses upon the characters
							of the old Testament, considered as Types of Christ— He ran a parallel
							between the disobedience of <persRef ref="adam">Adam</persRef>, and the
							perfect obedience of Christ, and between their respective consequences
							the ruin and restoration of the whole human race— And he gave notice
							that the next Sunday he should consider the typical character of the
							sacrifice of <persRef ref="abel">Abel</persRef>— In the Evening I heard
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burnap again from Psalm 4.4. “Commune
							with your own heart.” upon the advantages of religious meditation— The

								>Governor Barbour</persRef> was here, and I gave him the Letter of
							Resignation of <persRef ref="polk-leonidas">Leonidas Polk</persRef>,
							brevet 2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Lieutenant of Artillery, and late
							a Cadet at West-Point— Governor Barbour spoke of a recent publication in

								Randolph</persRef>, upon the opinions of <persRef
								ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef>, relating to the late Presidential Election, and
							proposed to me the publication of his Letter to <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>, on that subject, which I
							declined— I said I had not the Letter here, but that if I had, I would
							not publish it—possessing it only as my father’s Executor, and it having
							been confidential— That the Executors of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Jefferson’s Will undoubtedly possess a copy of the Letter, and as the
							depositaries of his confidence are the only persons who can with
							propriety authorise its publication— He said he had written about it to
							T. J. Randolph, but had received no Answer— Morning visits from <persRef
								ref="amory-nathaniel">N. Amory</persRef>, appointed Navy Agent at
							Pensacola, <persRef ref="white-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>Captain Downes</persRef> of the Navy, who is going to Norfolk, to
							take command of the Line of Battle Ship Delaware, going out to the

									>r</hi> Carroll</persRef> came again to enquire if I had decided

							late this Evening by <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Rush</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White
							asked concerning the appointment of a Marshal in West Florida— I told
							him I had fixed upon <persRef ref="wilson-henry2">Henry
							Wilson</persRef>; though his Commission had not yet issued— <persRef
								ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef>
							took some papers belonging to the Department of State— I sent for
								<persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pleasonton</persRef>, to direct the appointment of <persRef
								ref="hinton-joseph">Joseph B. Hinton</persRef> as keeper of a
							floating Light at Ocracoke, North Carolina; but Pleasonton informed me,
							that this man, a Methodist Preacher, and hot electioneering partizan,
							upon both which capacities he values himself in his importuning Letters
							to me, is a debtor to the United States, for 1500 dollars received nine
							or ten years ago, as Clerk of a Court, and never paid over, which seems
							a Checkmate upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hinton’s floating light
							keeping— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush read to me his annual
							Report upon the finances which he has already prepared— It is very long;
							very well written; and enters largely into the discussion of the policy
							of encouraging and protecting our domestic manufactures. It will of
							course be roughly handled; in and out of Congress— But the policy that
							it recommends will outlive the blast of faction; and abide the test of
							time. <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							been suspended at the request of <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">D. J.
								Pearce</persRef><persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef> also called, and took back a draft of a
							Letter he had written to <persRef ref="lincoln-enoch">Governor Enoch
								Lincoln</persRef> of Maine— I advised him to modify it, so as to
							avoid all the expressions which might be personally offensive— Lincoln’s
							own Letters are absurd, and provoking— And he is deeply infected with a
							disease which many of the Governors of the States, are apt to
							catch—wanton assailing of the General Government— Overweening zeal for
							the interests of the State, stimulated by the Ambition to brighten by
							the magnitude of their enmities— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							spoke also of a Note from <persRef ref="vaughan-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Vaughan</persRef> complaining of a Law
							of the State of New-York, giving to the local magistracy, authority in

							from Joseph B. Hinton, similar to those I have received from him—
								<persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dean</persRef> of New-York, came

								ref="cass-lewis">Governor Cass</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="mckenney-thomas">Thomas L. M’Kenney</persRef> with the Winebago
							and Menominie Tribes, and wherein the Peitioners say that Lands which
							rightfully belonged to them were ceded to the United States without

							give due attention to the Petitions, but that he must apply to the
							Secretary of War for the decision upon them— <persRef ref="u"
								>Tippet</persRef> applies for any small Office; but I have none to
							bestow— He said he was in great trouble. <persRef ref="halliard-william"
								>Hilliard</persRef> is returning home to Boston, from Virginia,

							construction at the different Custom-Houses, of the impost duty upon
							foreign books published before 1775.—at Boston and New-York, the duty
							was levied of 16 cents the pound weight; and at Philadelphia, only four
							Cents the Volume: which he observed made on a folio Volume weighing 25
							Pounds the difference of four cents from four dollars—and the duty by
							weight amounted often to more than the cost of the book itself— I
							advised him to speak of it to the Secretary of the Treasury— At one
							O’Clock there was a meeting of the Members of the Administration; and I
							read to them my draft of the Message— Very few Observations were made
							upon it— And no objection was made to any part of it— Some additional
							paragraphs were spoken of as perhaps expedient—and particularly one
							relating to the State of Affairs with Georgia, and the Creek Indians—
							This I had postponed, waiting for the arrival of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> M’Kenney who <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor

							to-morrow— <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> remarked upon the view taken of the established
							system concerning the Public Lands; which he thought correct, though
							there were parts of the Country where it would not be approved— But as I
							had recommended the revival of the Law of May 1826. for the relief of
							purchasers on credit, he thought it might be advisable to add another
							recommendation, remitting forfeitures actually incurred; at least under
							certain guards and restrictions. There was also a paragraph upon the
							Madawaska War, of the expediency of which he expressed some doubt—
								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> noticed the detailed exposition of internal
							improvements, which I was myself inclined to abridge— I had presented a
							Summary of the Recommendations in the Report of the Secretary of War,
							but of those in the Report of the Secretary of the Navy, had noticed
							only that of the Naval Academy— <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> remarked this
							difference, with some sensibility. They took the draft of the message;
							to examine it to-morrow at a meeting among themselves— <persRef

							communicated to Congresss with the Message. The members of the
							Administration were here from one till three O’Clock: having examined it
							yesterday among themselves— I had requested them particularly to mark
							passages for retrenchment; wishing to shorten the paper, which is too
							long. They did accordingly propose several omissions, all judicious, and
							some verbal alterations, all which I approved. I determined also to
							strike out, one or two passages upon which there was a difference of

							one short paragraph at the suggestion of <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi

							was much objected to— This Officer who came into that place in 1823, has
							given great satisfaction in the Administration of it— For three or four

							Appropriations of nearly a hundred thousand dollars a year— Its
							condition since then has been constantly improving, and this year the
							receipts exceed the expenditure more than a hundred thousand dollars—
							The accomodations to the public, and the facilities in the
							transportation of the mail have at the same time been multiplying in
							<unclear>li</unclear>ke proportion— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’leans Report is not
							backward in setting forth all these improvements and my paragraph in
							restating the facts upon which he celebrates his own efficiency, did him
							ample justice— But as respects the Administration, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean’s conduct is worse than equivocal—
							He hates M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and is devoted to <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>, to whom he justly gives credit
							for his appointment, first as Commissioner of the <pb type="ms" n="352"
							/>Land-Office, and afterwards as Postmaster General. Before the last
							Presidential Election, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean was
							professedly favourable to me—but under Calhoun’s influence, and secretly
							inclined in favour of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>.
							His conduct since the election has been at variance with his
							professions. To me he has protested the most friendly disposition to the
							Administration and to myself; but he has placed in the Post-Office
							persons of infamous character, tools of Calhoun; his appointments of
							Postmasters, and his management of contracts are said to be insidiously
							partial to the opposition; and his conversation is marked with a Spirit
							of hostility exceedingly offensive to the friends of the Administration—
							He is accordingly courted by the Opposition, and keeps on the best terms
							with them— This was the main reason which induded <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> to object to my
							paragraph upon the Post-Office, which he thought too complimentary to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’lean, and he thought importing some
							censure upon his Predecessor— I abridged a little the paragraph on the
							Post-Office, and made every other alteration proposed by them— Governor
							Barbour brought two additional paragraphs to his report one relating to
							the Ordnance Department and the Lead mines— The other to <persRef
								ref="mckenney-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								M’Kenney’s</persRef> indian negotiations— There was some
							Conversation upon the question of boundary between the State of Georgia
							and the Territory of Florida—upon which I had received a Letter,
							documents and a <unclear>Map</unclear> from <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Governor
								Forsyth</persRef>— Governor Barbour said the claim of Georgia was
							preposterous; but thought that if I should notice it to Congress at all,
							it should be in a separate message— I gave the amended message to
								<persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>, to make out two Copies of
							it, for the two houses of Congress next Tuesday. There was a Stranger
							from New-York, whose name I have perhaps not correct, and three from
							Maryland, names unknown, who came to see the President’s House, and the
							President. <persRef ref="martindale-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Martindale</persRef> of New-York was here an hour this
							Evening. He was extremely desirous that I should introduce into the
							Message, an earnest recommendation of protection to domestic
							manufactures. He said that my sentiments upon the subject were
							misrepresented in the Western part of New-York. That it was pretended I
							had never expressed any Sentiment favourable to the manufacturing
							interest— I told him that the friends of the Administration in the
							South, were equally urged that nothing should be said upon the subject,
							and on full deliberation I had concluded that would be the safest
							course— Particularly as to take side prematurely, would appear to
							interfere improperly for the purpose of exercising an influence over the
							house— I added however that the Report of the <persRef
								key="rush-richard">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> upon the
							finances would with my entire approbation recommend the protection of
							the manufacturing interest, in the most effective manner— I examined
							this evening the papers relating to the claim of <persRef
								ref="carroll-charles2">Charles H. Carroll</persRef>; and began
							writing a decision upon it.</p>

							however a great drawback upon the interest of the Correspondence that

							and much selfishness in Voltaire’s Letters— A warm disposition to serve
							his friends, and yet a frequent disposition to speak slightingly of
