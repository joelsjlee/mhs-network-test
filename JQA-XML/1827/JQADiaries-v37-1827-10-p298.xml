						<p><persRef ref="wood-h">Henry Wood</persRef> came this morning, and took
							with him the agreement which I had drawn up for the building of the Tomb
							for <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail">mother</persRef>— He had omitted to include the

							ascertain what the additional charge will be for it. He is to come and
							execute the deed on Thursday Morning— <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> went into Boston in the Stage— I went with
								<persRef ref="giusta-antoine">Antoine</persRef> to attend the
							Probate Court, and present for allowance, the fourth account of the
							Executors of my father’s will; but no Court was held. <persRef
								ref="robbins-edward">the judge</persRef> and Register were both
							absent, and a man, whom I found at the Office shewed me an advertisement
							by the judge published a fortnight since in the Dedham Newspaper that he
							should not hold a Court this month— The Register of Deeds was likewise
							absent in Boston: but I left with the Clerk of the Courts, to be given
							the Register to be recorded, the two copies of the Indenture of
							Agreement, between the Town, and Congregational Society of Quincy, and
							me, for the building of the Tomb, and the cession to me of the spot on
							which it is to stand— The Clerk also found upon the files, my father’s
							Deed to me of the Mount Wollaston farm; dated 23. September 1819— On the
								9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October of that year, I left
							this Deed with the Register to be recorded— A few days since I made out
							a list of my Deeds and vouchers, and discovered that this deed was
							missing— I had deposited at the same time with it, another deed, from
								<persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef>, which I had after
							it was recorded taken out from the Registry. I had no recollection of
							the omission to take this— But so it was: and now at the end of eight
							years, it was found on the Register’s file— I found also the Record of
							it in his books— This incident shews the importance of keeping a correct
							list of Deeds, Vouchers and Securities and of revising it from time to
							time— It shews also the necessity of attention to my own concerns. <pb
								type="ms" n="299"/>From Dedham I proceeded to Boston, stopping at
								<persRef ref="bussey-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bussey’s</persRef> at Jamaica Plains. But he was himself in the

						<p>I rode with <persRef ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="adams-ebenezer">Ebenezer</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-josiah">Josiah Adams’s</persRef>, and viewed the ground
							near their dwelling where their Land is adjoining upon mine— There is a
							brook upon which we border, which they wish to have made straight— It is
							swampy, and was formerly overflowed by the Mill Pond— The fence is now
							on their land, at some distance from the brook— They wish to have the
							brook made to run in the direction of the fence; and for me to purchase
							the land of theirs upon which the brook would then encroach— About an
							acre and a half of Swamp— But they could not bring themselves to name a
							price they would ask for the land. We also went to the Pasture grounds
							behind my houses, at the foot of Penn’s Hill They advised me to sell off
							the wood from a great part of my land upon Pine Hill; and offered either
							to buy a pasture of mine adjoining theirs, or to sell me theirs; but
							could not name a price at which they would either buy or sell— We thence
							went to <persRef ref="white-nathaniel">Nath<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> White’s</persRef>; then to <persRef
								ref="hardwick-henry">Henry Hardwick’s</persRef>—to <persRef
								ref="field-harvey">Harvey Field’s</persRef>, and again to White’s,
							where I found <persRef ref="curtis-noah">Noah Curtis</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="french-asa">Asa French</persRef> the Surveyor— White
							is a shoemaker and lives in a house next Northerly to that in which my
							father was born— But he is much straitened for land, and wants a small
							strip of mine to square off his yard and give him room to build a barn.
							The amount was 14 1/2 square rods— I told him he should have it, but he
							like the Adams’s could not tell what he would give for it; he said, he
							would let me know in the Evening— Henry Hardwick, and Noah Curtis, both
							wanted also some of my land and Hardwick wanted me to join in ditching
							some saltmarsh adjoining upon his. I postponed these matters, not having
							time to attend to them at present. Harvey Field wished me to remove the
							Wall upon my Belcher pasture, so as to straiten the road; the effect of
							which would be to improve the street, and to give him some additional
							land upon which to build his house. He also wants me to lease to the
							town, land enough to build upon it a School House—which I readily
							promised to do— On returning home, I found <persRef
								ref="bussey-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Benjamin
								Bussey</persRef>, to whom I gave back the draft of his Will— Had a
							long conversation with him concerning it; and concerning his intended
							bequest for a Lyceum at Roxbury. I told him I would cheerfully act as
							one of the Trustees; but advised him to name all the Trustees himself—
							To appoint seven—empower three to act upon the business of the trust, by
							majorities, and in the event of the death or resignation as a Trustee,
							to authorise the remaining Trustees to fill his place; but requiring a
							majority of the whole number to make a choice— I advised further that as
							the location of the Establishment was at Roxbury, he should appoint
							three or four of the Trustees residents at that place, or so nearly in
							the vicinity that they might always at a short notice be able to hold
							meetings for managing the ordinary business of that trust— And as the
							disposal of the property was to be permanent, I recommended that he
							should appoint young men, for some of the Trustees— He said he should
							make his dispositions accordingly, and that he should appoint as one of
							the Trustees, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Kuhn</persRef>, his agent and associate in the factory at Dedham— I
							told him again that I thought an Act of incorporation might become
							indispensable for the continuance of the trust; and that difficulties in
							obtaining it might arise from the large amount of real Estate, he
							intended they should hold: and advised him to consider the <pb type="ms"
								n="300"/>expediency of authorizing the Trustees in case of necessity
							to sell the real Estate; excepting that, the occupation of which he has
							secured to his <persRef ref="davis-elizabeth">daughter</persRef> and <persRef ref="davis-maria;davis-eliza">grand-daughters</persRef> for their respective lives.
							He said he thought the object of the trust would be so much approved by
							the Legislature that no obstacle would be opposed to the act of
							incorporation and he was peculiarly solicitous for the continuance of
							his manufacturing establishment at Dedham, as a part of the property of
							the trust— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bussey had brought with him
								<persRef ref="holley-horace2">Horace Holley</persRef>, a boy six or
							seven years old, son of the late <persRef ref="holley-horace"
								>President</persRef> of Transylvania University; whom he said
								<persRef ref="holley-mary">his mother</persRef> wished to obtain at
							a suitable age the appointment of a Cadet at West-Point. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> White came in the Evening, and said M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> French had told him I should ask him two
							dollars a Rod; for the land which he wanted to build a barn upon, and
							square off his yard— I told him he should have it for that price; and I
							filled and signed a Deed accordingly— There was an Evening party at
								<persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Quincy’s</persRef>, which I attended— I have laid off a small stirp
							of Land, from the North-west corner of the garden, for a nursery of
							trees— It has been fenced off, and a gate has been opened into it from
							the garden— This afternoon I planted in it twenty rows of Acorns, Nuts,
							Stones, and Seeds— The time for planting was bad and we were much
							interrupted by the Rain— My Son <persRef ref="adams-george"
								>George</persRef>, and <persRef ref="giusta-antoine"
								>Antoine</persRef> were with me— We planted Acorns, of English, and
							of Black, White, and grey Oaks— Peach, Plum and Cherry Stones. apple,
							and Pear seeds— Whole Peaches and Apples, and Horse Chesnuts— Also 10.
							Pennsylvania Walnuts of the last year.</p>

								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> and

							much agitated, and distressed, even to shedding of tears, for which he

							I referred him to the Navy Department for his application, assuring him
							of my own favourable disposition to him— <persRef ref="ammidon-philip"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ammidon</persRef> brought me a

							said that the chief of the Hong Merchants, had been extremely reluctant
							in transmitting to the Viceroy the Letter from the Department of State—
							That he had finally taken it, and the next day, delivered this paper, as
							the answer of the Viceroy. This answer he said was insulting; but he

								<persRef ref="giusta-antoine">Antoine Michel Giusta</persRef>— The

							Turnpike— We had reached Framingham, before I discovered the mistake. We
							soon after turned off the Turnpike, and came through Westborough, and
							Southborough to Lancaster—lengthening the distance of our road about
							seven Miles— It rained when we left Boston, and continued to rain till

								>Davis’s</persRef> Inn, at Lancaster— While I was there <persRef

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="clarke-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clarke</persRef> in the Morning from 1. John 1.1. “That which was
							from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our
							eyes which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the word
							of life; 2. For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear
							witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the father,
							and was manifested unto us.”— In the afternoon his discourse was from
							Leviticus 11.44. “For I am the Lord your God: ye shall therefore
							sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy.”— There were
							six children baptized; four of one family of different ages— The eldest
							apparently eight or nine years old the youngest three or four— The other
							two were infants from nine months to a year old. The Congregation was
							very thin; part of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clarke’s parish having
							left him, for a preacher of harsher doctrines— Of <persRef
								ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Boylston’s</persRef> family, his Son <persRef ref="boylston-john"
								>John</persRef> only attended with us— We dined as usual after the
							services of the day— I received by express from <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> an invitation, as
							President of the Agricultural Society of the County of Worcester, to
							attend their Cattle Show, and dinner next Wednesday; which I declined,
							informing the Governor that I would call at his house, on my passage
							through Worcester to-morrow. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clarke
							called after dinner. This is the fifth successive annual visit that I
							have paid to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston at Princeton. The
							first was in 1821. with <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef>:
							and this in all probability will be the last— The visits have all been
							short; and all until the present one much alike— Until now M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston has always been in health while I
							was here, and full of pleasant Conversation— He is now confined to his
							chamber and easy Chair—having watchers in his bed-room every night; and
							though for the moment relieved from immediate danger, in constant terror
							of sudden death, and with little hope of surviving the Winter— His
							cordial hospitality remains unchanged, and this house will remain upon
							my memory, for the few days I have myself to continue on earth; as one
							of those which have contributed to the enjoyments of my life— Its
							retirement is one of its charms; there being no other visitable house in
							the Town; and the vicinity of Wachusett Hill, which though three miles
							distant, seems as if always ready to enter the door, and carries with it
							a forethought of eternity, solemnizes the Scene, till melancholy mellows
							into pleasure— To the mansion and to the Hill I am now to give the last
							parting salutation.</p>

						<p>We took leave of <persRef ref="boylston-ward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Boylston</persRef> and left Princeton, at 8 O’Clock this
							morning; immediately after breakfast— He had been seized in the night
							with the cramps in the stomach; with which since his last illness, he is
							frequently afflicted, and which keep him in constant alarm— When I
							parted from him, he said it was for the last Time, and when I said I
							hoped not; but that I should visit him again next year, he shook his
							head but made no reply— <persRef ref="lessing-gotthold"
								>Lessing</persRef> says that it was a part of the philosophy of the
							antient Romans to look at Death always under cheering aspects—“Nullaque
							ei tristis imago.” The true Christian looks forward to it with deep
							anxiety but with elevated hope— The man of the world considers it as a
							part of the destiny to which he is doomed, and for which it only
							behooves him to be always prepared— Animal nature alone shrinks from
							extinction, and dreads the approach of Death, as much on the verge of
							four score, as at twenty-five— I rode with grave thoughts to Worcester,
							where, after stopping with the Carriage at <persRef
								ref="thomas-unknown3">Thomas’s</persRef>, I called on <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> at his house, and
							spent an hour with him— Saw <persRef ref="lincoln-penelope">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lincoln</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Waldo</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="davis-john4">J. Davis</persRef> the member of Congress from the
							district, <persRef ref="fiske-oliver">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Fiske</persRef>, my old Classmate, <persRef ref="pliny-merrick"
								>Pliny Merrick</persRef>, <persRef ref="lincoln-william">W.
								Lincoln</persRef> the Governor’s brother; <persRef ref="earle-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Earle</persRef>, editor of the
							newspaper; who mentioned the issue of the recent elections at Baltimore
							for the Legislature of Maryland, and in Delaware for a member of
							Congress, vicissitudes of fortune— The Governor had missed of seeing
								<persRef ref="lincoln-enoch">his brother</persRef> the Governor of
							Maine, on his recent visit to Portland; and could therefore add little
							to what he had heretofore said to me concerning the Eastern boundary
							question with Great Britain; but he said he had conversed with several
							persons of distinguished character and influence in Maine, concerning
							it; and found them all reasonable, and well disposed— At half past
							twelve we proceeded upon our Journey; the Governor having walked with me
							to the Inn; where we parted— We rode through Leicester and Spencer to
							Brookfield; at which place we dined—and then continued through Western
							to Ware— We arrived just at the dusk of evening, and took lodgings for
							the Night at <persRef ref="u">Phelps’s</persRef> tavern: a house with
							comfortable and even elegant accommodations— In almost all the towns
							through which we passed, we saw new buildings for manufactories.
							Whatever there was of flourishing appearance any where was of this
							character. Ware itself is a new town; and like Lowell, almost a new
							Creation— The manufacturing Establishments here, are large, and
							apparently very flourishing— But they are owned in Boston; and the heavy
							depretiation of the Stock, in the Companies owning them casts ominous
							conjecture upon the future prospects of this smiling village.</p>

						<p>We took an early breakfast at Ware, and left it a quarter before seven;
							and after riding 24. Miles stopped at <persRef ref="u">Phelps</persRef>
							tavern in Springfield. <persRef ref="calhoun-john2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Calhoun</persRef> the
							Representative of this Town, in the Legislature of the State had written
							to my Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>, expressing an
							earnest wish that I would pass through Springfield, and make a short
							stop there on my passage— George had answered him that I should probably
							be there this morning; and he was expecting me. We arrived there just
							before eleven, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun came in a few
							minutes after we had alighted. Numerous other Visitors afterwards came
							in, among whom were <persRef ref="lee-roswell">Col<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Lee</persRef> Superintendant of the United States
							Armoury. My old Classmate at Harvard, <persRef ref="phelps-john"
								>Phelps</persRef>, now Sheriff of the County of Hambden, <persRef
								ref="lathrop-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lathrop</persRef>, member of the last Congress <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Shepherd</persRef> of the manufactory:
							and several <pb type="ms" n="304"/>of the inhabitants of the town. I
							visited with Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Lee the public armoury,
							and saw the workmen employed at all the successive operations of making
							muskets— Forging, turning, filing, stocking, browning, and proving the
							barrels are the principal processes; to which are added the making of
							the locks, pans, ramrods, bayonets, trickers and guards, Stocks, and the
							screws and pins by which the instrument is compounded— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee told me there were fifty two pieces to
							each musket, and one hundred and ninety seven operations in making it—
							There are 270 workmen, constantly employed at this armoury— The number
							of Mills which I visited, and where the works are carried on was eight
							or ten, besides the Arsenal where the arms are deposited, and the
							building where they are proved— A Salute was fired when I came to the
							Arsenal, from the Square before it. The Superintendent invited me to
							visit his quarters, but I declined for want of time— He told me that a
							whole day would barely suffice to view all the works minutely, and I
							thought that a whole week of repeated re-examination might be usefully
							devoted to the inspection— But I had not more than two hours in which I
							hurried through the whole, and during which the rain was falling in
							floods. The objects passed so rapidly before me that I had scarcely a
							moment for making enquiries which might have suggested themselves upon a
							more deliberate view— Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Lee told me that
							the Iron of which the muskets are made was from Connecticut. The Stocks
							of Black Walnut from New-Jersey and Pennsylvania— Each musket costs 10
							dollars, and weighs 10 1/2 lb— I left these works with regret that I had
							not more time for surveying them, and returned to Phelps’s tavern, where
							my Classmate of that name, Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Lee, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun, and two or three others dined
							with us— The town of Springfield is one of the most flourishing in the
							Commonwealth; to which not only the national armoury, but the
							manufactures in it and in the vicinity essentially contribute. Its
							aspect has so changed that I should not have known I had ever been there
							before; which I had, several times— The last on the 27<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of January 1809— At half past two, we
							resumed our Journey, and rode without stopping more than five minutes,
							26 miles to Hartford; the rain pouring down the whole time, as it had
							done from the moment of our leaving Ware, this morning. The country over
							which we travelled, especially from Springfield is fine, but the sear
							and yellow leaf of autumn is falling from the trees; the rain made our
							travelling very heavy, and the storm cast a gloom over the whole day— We
							reached Hartford about half past seven, of a dark and dismal night, and
							found excellent accommodations and a cheerful fire at <persRef ref="u"
								>Ripley’s</persRef> U. S. Hotel. <persRef ref="bailey-unknown4">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef> of the Eastern Shore
							of Maryland, <persRef ref="daggett-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Russ</persRef> heretofore a member of Congress, <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parsons</persRef>, and some
							other gentlemen called in the course of the Evening. To beguile the
							dreary hours of my three days ride from Boston to this place; two of
							which have been of almost continual rain I have read through the third
							number of the American Quarterly Review with exception of the last
							Article in it, written by myself. Some of the Articles are amusing, and
							some instructive— Those upon the Construction of Ships, upon the
							judicial right to pronounce Legislative Acts unconstitutional, and upon
							the Law of Marriage and Divorce, engaged much of my attention— That upon
							German Literature, and that upon Florida were not altogether
							satisfactory.— The weather has intercepted the views of Nature, which
							might otherwise have occupied a large portion of my time with
							observation, and the face of the Country has only led me to the
							conclusion that the establishment of manufactures alone preserves it
							from decay.</p>

						<p>I lighted my candle, and wrote this morning two hours before breakfast—
							From that time a succession of numerous visitors called upon me; among
							whom was <persRef ref="terry-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Terry</persRef>, the Mayor of the City, heretofore a member of the
								15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Congress, who told me that he came

							three years ago at Philadelphia— Some of the professors and Students of

							rained heavily all the morning— The proprietors of the Steam-boat Oliver
							Ellsworth sent me a Letter, offering her to my disposal for to-morrow:
							which I declined, under the determination to proceed this day. The
							departure of the Boat was postponed an hour, but the rain continued

								<persRef ref="hull-isaac">Commodore Hull</persRef> came on board,
							and informed me he was on his way to Boston. He took leave immediately,
							as we left the wharf, descending Connecticut river 50 miles to its mouth
							at Saybrook— The continued rain intercepted the pleasing view of the
							succession of landscapes on the banks of the river, but we stopped to
							land passengers at Middletown and Saybrook, and viewed as we past them,
							Weathersfield, and East and South Haddam, and other flourishing
							villages— If the foul weather had continued Captain Beebe’s intention
							was to have stopped for the night at Saybrook, rather than enter upon
							the Sound; but it cleared off about four in the afternoon, and the

								>Parsons</persRef>, two, and <persRef ref="u">Edwards</persRef> came
							with us, as companions to my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef>— One or two left us at Middletown, one or two at

							in the boat a Letter to my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> that I had begun at Hartford, but had not

							to overtake M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard— I received also a

							and some with the <persRef ref="thompson-jonathan">Collector</persRef>
							of the Port, upon the prospects of the Revenue, which continue at this

								<persRef ref="u">Captain Jenkins</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> King accompanied me to the boat, and there introduced to me

						<p>At six this morning we embarked in the Steam-boat Burlington. Capt<hi
								rend="superscript">n</hi>    <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Pugnet</persRef> went ashore at
							Bordentown— At ten we landed at Philadelphia—a very great crowd of
							People were assembled on the wharf, who as I passed through them greeted
							me with three hearty cheers— Great numbers of them followed me to the
							United States Hotel, where upon my entering the house this cheering was
							repeated— Of my acquaintance <persRef ref="vaughan-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Vaughan</persRef> only had met me
							at the boat— I found at the Hotel several others, and <persRef
								ref="sergeant-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sergeant</persRef> immediately afterwards came in— They insisted
							with extreme earnestness on my remaining here this day, and told me that
							that house being fully they had engaged apartments for me at the Mansion
							House, now kept by <persRef ref="head-joseph2">Head</persRef>, and newly
							fitted up— Finding that <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> was in the City, I
							sent a request to him to call upon me, and in a few minutes he came— He
							informed me that the Letter from <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, on the receipt of
							which, he had left with <persRef ref="sullivan-george">George
								Sullivan</persRef> the message for me, which induced me to come on
							without stopping at New-York, was written under the apprehension of an
							impending War with the Winebago Indians; and an impression that some
							decisive step should be taken which would require a deliberate
							consultation of the whole Cabinet— But by advices since received it
							appears that the two Indians who had committed the murders which it was
							expected would kindle the war have surrendered themselves up to the
							authorities of the United States; and that the danger of further
							immediate hostilities has subsided. The necessity for my immediate
							return to Washington being thus removed I consented to remain here this
							day, and came to the lodgings which had been engaged for me at the
							Mansion House. The <persRef ref="bonaparte-joseph">Count de
								Survilliers</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="bonaparte-charles"
								>Prince de Musignano</persRef> visited me before I left the United
							States Hotel; and I met <persRef ref="white-william">Bishop
								White</persRef>, going to call on me, as I was passing from one
							house to the other— From the time when I entered the mansion house, till
							3 O’Clock, there was a constant stream of visitors <pb type="ms" n="307"
							/>the greater part of whom were unknown to me— Among them was <persRef
								ref="moore-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore</persRef>
							the director of the mint, who brought with him a small sealed box,
							received from <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, containing a brass pound Troy
							Weight, made after the standard Imperial Pound Troy, proclaimed by Act
							of Parliament. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore said he had received
							this some time since, and had kept it till now, to open it in my
							presence; and he wished me to sign a Certificate of this operation; to
							which I readily consented— Upon which he broke the Seals, opened the
							box, and drew out the Troy Pound, which had been made with great care—
							There was with it a certificate of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin, annexed to one of verification from <persRef ref="kater-henry"
								>Captain Kater</persRef>, who at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin’s request had performed the comparison with the imperial
							Standard Pound— The Superscriptions on the box were in M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s handwriting, and the Seals were
							with his Seal at arms—both well known to me— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Moore had drawn up the form of a certificate to be signed
							and sealed by me, to which I suggested a slight addition, by inserting
							the inscription engraved upon the Pound— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Moore will bring it to be executed to morrow— I dined with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard, and my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Sergeant’s: and early in the Evening called on <persRef
								ref="hopkinson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hopkinson</persRef>— Found him and his family in deep affliction;
							having within this week received intelligence of the death of his Son
								<persRef ref="hopkinson-alexander">Lieutenant Alexander H.
								Hopkinson</persRef>, upon Service in the Mediterranean Squadron— He
							spoke to me of the desire of the Count de Survilliers, that his Son and
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-zenaide">daughter</persRef> might have a
							passage in our Ship of the Line, Delaware, which is soon going out to
							the Mediterranean. I returned to the Mansion House, and received
							visitors again till after ten— <persRef ref="degrand-peter"
								>Degrand</persRef> remained with me till Midnight—talking of
							politics and complaining of the deputy collector— I told him he must
							address his complaints in form and in writing to the <persRef

								Bache</persRef>, the Postmaster, yesterday delivered to me, a
							Letter, which I found was a duplicate of the invitation from Baltimore,
							which I had received at New-York— Thinking I had made no adequate excuse
							for declining this manifestation of kind feeling, from my friends in
							that place I wrote this morning an answer, accepting it, and promising
							to pass the day there on Monday—which I sent to the Post Office—
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> breakfasted with us and immediately afterwards, I
							went with him and visited the Navy-Yard, where we were received by
								<persRef ref="bainbridge-william">Commodore Bainbridge</persRef>,
							and by <persRef ref="miller-samuel">Major Miller</persRef> with his
							Guard of Marines— A Salute was fired on our arrival. We went on board of
							the Line of Battle Ship Pennsylvania now on the Stocks building to carry
							136 guns, and said to be the largest ship that will float upon the
							Ocean— She is built chiefly of Live Oak, and looks like a City in
							herself. She is under a permanent covered building, as are a frigate and
							a Sloop of War, building at her side— Commodore Bainbridge introduced to
							me the other Officers in service at the yard, and shewed me all the
							Offices connected with it— From the Navy-Yard we went to the Asylum for
							Seamen, a Marine Hospital building under the superintendance of <persRef
								ref="strickland-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Strickland</persRef>. It is 384 feet front, and 80 feet deep, and
							will be when finished a magnificent edifice— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Strickland shewed us the plan of the building, and went with
							us over the parts of it that are finished. They have here, some granite,
							resembling, though much inferior to that of Quincy. They build here also
							much of marble; of which they have fine quarries, not far distant— We
							returned to the Mansion house shortly before eleven and I received
							visitors again till near twelve. <persRef ref="moore-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Moore</persRef> the director of the
							Mint came, and I signed and Sealed the certificate of opening the box
							containing the Troy pound weight from England— <persRef
								ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Biddle</persRef>, the President of the Bank, brought me the books of
							dividends on the U.S. Bank Stock, on which I signed receipts for the two
							last. <persRef ref="jones-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jones</persRef> the Collector gave me a statement <pb type="ms"
								n="308"/>of the accrueing Revenue of the present year at this Port—
								<persRef ref="lowndes-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowndes</persRef> introduced to me several persons from
							South-Carolina— Among the visitors was <persRef ref="u">Captain
								Wills</persRef>, who was master of the ship America, in which we
							came from Hamburg to Philadelphia, in the year 1801— The old man had an
							appearance of decay, and of poverty, and asked me if I could not give
							him a place— <persRef ref="washington-bushrod">Judge
								Washington</persRef> is holding the U.S. Circuit Court here— Among
							the visitors I should have named <persRef ref="randall-josiah">Josiah

								ref="sergeant-john">J. Sergeant</persRef> took leave being obliged
							to attend the Eulogy to be delivered upon the late <persRef
								ref="tilghman-william">Chief of Justice Tilghman</persRef> by
								<persRef ref="binney-horace">H. Binney</persRef> at Noon— At the
							same hour I came on board the Steam-boat Delaware, <persRef
								ref="wheldon-wilmon">Captain Wheldon</persRef>— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones and several other of my friends
							accompanied me to the boat on the wharf, a crowd of several thousands of
							people were assembled; many of whom followed me into the boat, and
							thronged the deck till it became almost impassable— I then addressed
							those of them nearest to me, and told them I should be glad to shake
							hands with them all, if they could make a passage for one another to
							come to me; which they immediately did, and between two and three
							hundred of them shook hands with me, and passed off till the signal
							bell, which had been a full half our delayed, rang for the departure of
							the boat. All but the Passengers then left her except <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">Degrand</persRef> who lost the moment for
							stepping on to the wharf and came with us to Newcastle— Saying he would
							pay a visit to his friend <persRef ref="dupont-eleuthere"
								>Dupont</persRef> at Wilmington. As the boat left the wharf three
							hearty cheers were given by the assembled multitude, which were repeated
							when she passed down before the wharves after fetching a sweep round the
							upward stream— I returned their salutation by a bow; waving the hand,
							and saying, “God bless you all.” There was not the slightest disorder—
							These shadows of good will from my fellow-citizens I hope affect me
							suitably—grateful to them and to heaven, for their benevolence;
							imploring aid for the fulfilment of the duties, which they reward and
							impose, and mindful of the pinnacle from which they warn me to prepare
							for descending I trust that no vain or unworthy sentiment of exultation
							mingles with the cheering glow of the thoughts, and the solemn
							reflections which they excite in my mind— The excitement and confidence
							of my friends at Philadelphia, is at this moment in the flood, from
							their success last Tuesday, in carrying the election of John Sergeant,
							as their Representative in Congress, against <persRef
								ref="hemphill-joseph">Joseph Hemphill</persRef>. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard goes with me to Baltimore; and

							Committee, in the morning that I was there. I turned into a birth early
							in the Evening, and at half past two was awaked by my Son <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> with the notice that we were at the
							wharf. We came immediately to <persRef ref="barnum-david"
								>Barnum’s</persRef> Hotel, where I went again to bed and slept till

								<persRef ref="hoffman-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> David
								Hoffman</persRef><pb type="ms" n="309"/>a member of the Committee
							came in— I told him that I had answered their invitation at

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson</persRef> would
							receive my answer by the mail this morning, and that I had agreed to
							pass the day here to morrow. He said that an unexpected and embarrassing

								>Colonel Howard</persRef> on Friday Night; as his funeral was fixed
							for tomorrow, and would necessarily occupy a great part of the day—and
							he asked if I could without inconvenience remain one day longer— I said
							that under such circumstances, and with a view to show my respect for
							the memory of Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Howard, I should readily
							attend the funeral, and would also remain here on Tuesday. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Hoffman then went to the meeting of the
							Committee, and they all called upon me after breakfast— They proposed to
							give notice that I would receive the Citizens of Baltimore, that I would
							receive their visits to-morrow and on Tuesday publishing to-morrow
							morning, their Letter of invitation and my answer to which I assented. I
							attended public worship, in the morning with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Patterson at the first Presbyterian Church, and heard
								<persRef ref="nevins-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nevins</persRef>, from Luke 13–30. “And behold, there are last which
							shall be first, and there are first which shall be last”— After the
							service I spoke to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nevins, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Patterson introduced me to <persRef
								ref="patterson-edward">his Son</persRef>, and to his grandson
								<persRef ref="bonaparte-jerome">Jerome Buonaparte</persRef>— M<hi

								ref="hillen-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hillen</persRef>,
							at the Roman Catholic Cathedral— The service consisted of singing
							Selections from the Psalms with accompaniment of the organ; and a short
							Sermon upon the lesson of the morning, the parable of the Royal banquet—
							After the Service, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tiernan shewed me the
							two large pictures presented to this Church by the late and the present
							kings of France— All the members of the Committee took tea and spent the
							Evening with me, and introduced several of their friends. It rained
							heavily with little interruption the whole day; notwithstanding which
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> went on to Washington— I received a note from the

							with some allusion to the political hostility to me of Col<hi

						<p>The invitation of the Committee with my answer were published in the
							newspapers this morning: with notice to the Citizens, that I should
							attend the funeral of <persRef ref="howard-john">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l</hi> Howard</persRef>, and would receive
							visitors from 3 to 4 this afternoon, and from 7 to 10 this Evening—
							Before the funeral I received the visits of the members of the

								ref="smith-john2">John Spear</persRef> one of their number— <persRef
								ref="patterson-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Patterson</persRef> went with me in my Carriage to Belvidere the
							late residence of Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Howard, and thence
							in procession to the place of interment. The procession was very long,
							and attended by the militia of the City in military array, as well as by
							great multitudes of the Citizens. It made a circuit through the
							principal Streets of the City, and the day being fair the whole
							population of the City appeared to be in the procession or witnessing it
							from the sides of the Streets and the windows of the Houses— The funeral
							service, according to the forms of the episcopal church, but abridged,
							was performed partly by <persRef ref="kemp-james">bishop Kemp</persRef>,
							and partly by another Clergyman— The procession was not renewed in
							returning from the grave-yard— I had seen Col<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi> Howard when living only two or three times—the last on the
							day of <persRef ref="lafayette">General La Fayette’s</persRef> entry at
							Baltimore, three years since. I this day took a last view of his
							lifeless face before the procession moved from his house— It was near
							three in the afternoon when I returned to <persRef ref="barnum-david"
								>Barnum’s</persRef> tavern, and from 3 to 4. I received in the large
							Hall of the house a great number of Visitors— Then dined with the
							Committee and a small party of friends invited by them—about thirty— On
							retiring from them after dinner, I gave them for a toast, “the <pb
								type="ms" n="310"/>the living, and the dead— <persRef
								ref="carroll-charles">Charles Carroll</persRef> of Carrollton, and
							John Eager Howard.” and returning to the great Hall received visitors
							from 7 till 10 O’Clock in the Evening— They came in a continual
							unceasing stream to the number it could be scarcely less than of two
							thousand. The Hall was much crowded nearly the whole time, though few if
							any remained there more than ten minutes— I shook hands with them all;
							and among them all there were not twenty whom I had ever seen before—
							There were people of all classes, and all political opinions— There was
							last week an election for members of the State Legislature, in which the
							friends of the administration both in the City and County of Baltimore
							were unsuccessful; and it was followed by a duel, between two of the
							Candidates— The excitement remaining here was not less than I found it
							at Philadelphia; but it was not equally cheering— Among those who came
							there were no small number of my political adversaries, but with the
							exception of three or four, all of whom were intoxicated, they gave no
							manifestation of it— One man was noisy and boisterous and noisy for two
							or three minutes; and upon being asked his name answered that it was
								<persRef ref="u">M’Mahon</persRef>; a brother of the Candidate— One
							said to me that although opposed to me, he was glad to see me well—and
							to take me by the hand— I answered him “we are all friends <hi
								rend="italic">here</hi>;[”]—and thanked him for his good will— One
							very much in liquor said while shaking my hand said—M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> President, I hope the Constitution will
							never be broken— I answered “I concur with you heartily in that wish;
							and hope also that <hi rend="italic">your </hi>Constitution may never be
							broken.” By far the greater number barely came up, shook my hand, and
							passed off—some said a few words expressive of their cordiality, and
							many told me they hoped I should be re-elected— About ten O’Clock the
							Hall was nearly cleared, and I retired somewhat exhausted to bed.</p>

						<p><date>16. VI.—</date> North-Point. Battle ground.</p>
						<p>I rose this morning refreshed by sleep, but later than usual, and anxious
							for the issue of the day. Immediately after breakfast I went,
							accompanied by the Committee, and by a few others to the Battle-ground
							near North-Point— <persRef ref="patterson-william">M<hi

								rend="superscript">r</hi> W. W. Barney,</persRef> the Naval Officer, <persRef
								ref="williams-nathaniel">N. F. Williams</persRef>, and several
							others followed in carriages, and on horseback— The distance is about
							nine miles from the town, over a barren country, covered great part of
							the way with forest trees, now undressing for the Winter. General
							M’Donald, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> McCulloch, Barney and Williams
							had been in the Battle— M’Culloch and Williams, both wounded, and
							M’Culloch taken prisoner.— He had gone out as a volunteer though already
							then past the usual fighting age, and I was much entertained with his
							account of the incidents which occurred to him upon this expedition— He
							was wounded very near to the spot where <persRef ref="ross-robert"
								>General Ross</persRef> was killed. There is a small monument
							erected by the company of first Mechanical Volunteers, attached to the
								5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Regiment of Maryland Militia, to
							the memory of <persRef ref="randall-aquilla">Aquilla Randall</persRef>,
							one of their number, who fell in the same action of the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September 1814— It is a pyramid of
							white stone, about four feet high resting on a pedestal with suitable
							inscriptions on its four sides— These inscriptions, with an account of
							the erection of the monument on the 28<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							July 1817. and the address of <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Captain B.
								C. Howard</persRef>, commander of the company at the time are
							contained in Niles’s Register of the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of
							August of that year. Vol. 12— p. 367. There are no other traces of the
							action there at present though M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barney
							shewed me an Oak tree, in which he said more than twenty of the enemy’s
							musket bullets had lodged— We returned to the City about one O’Clock,
							riding round by the way of Fell’s point— I picked up under the wounded
							tree half a dozen white oak Acorns to plant them at Washington. After
							returning to the City, I received visitors again in great numbers till 4
							O’Clock— Among them <pb type="ms" n="311"/>were <persRef

							the foreign Consuls; the <persRef ref="small-jacob">Mayor</persRef> and

							Vice-President <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Eccleston</persRef> read to me a very handsomely written, and highly
							oratorical address; which I answered extemporaneously with great
							brevity; first to himself, and then by a short exhortation to the
							students— Among the visitors were also <persRef ref="glendy-john">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Glendy</persRef>, his Colleague
								<persRef ref="breckinridge-john2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Breckenridge</persRef>, <persRef ref="nevins-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Nevins</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="burnap-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burnap</persRef>,
							whom I heard last Summer at Medford, and who is now preaching at the
							unitarian Church here— There were also <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilson</persRef> of Charleston S.C.
							whom I had seen at Quincy; <persRef ref="gales-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales</persRef>, one of the Editors of
							the National Intelligencer, and <persRef ref="salazar-jose">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Salazar</persRef> the Minister from
							the Republic of Colombia, who introduced to me, <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Velez</persRef> as Chargé d’Affaires
							from that Government, he being himself recalled, and shortly to return
							home— These were all yesterday or this morning from Washington, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Salazar told me that <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> had been unwell— He spoke also of a complaint which
							by order of the <persRef ref="santander-francisco">Vice President
								Santander</persRef> he had addressed to <persRef key="clay-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, against <persRef
								ref="watts-beaufort">Beaufort S. Watts</persRef>, our Charge
							d’Affaires at Bogota, for a very strange Letter which he wrote to the
								<persRef ref="bolivar-simon">President Bolivar</persRef>, and which
							he published— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Salazar that that
							Letter had been unauthorised, and was disapproved by me— He said M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had given him the same information—
							And he wished as much as possible to soften the complaint against M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Watts, whose Letter he said had been
							attributed to indiscretion rather than to any evil intention— He said
							that on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July last M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Watts had given a public dinner, at which
							the Vice President Santander had attended, and he hoped the
							misunderstandings between them had been then in a great measure healed—
							I dined again with the Committee, and a party of about 30 persons,
							consisting of the members of the Cincinnati, and of the persons wounded
							at the battle of North Point— <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">General S.
								Smith</persRef> sat at my right hand, and the Collector M’Culloch,
							at my left— The dinner was short— A single toast was given by the
							Committee— “The United States of America— May other Countries learn from
							them, that the easy access of the People to their Rulers, is the means
							of confidence on the one side, and of right Government on the other.”
							Soon after which I gave “Ebony and Topaz”— Gen<hi rend="superscript"
								>l.</hi> Ross’s posthumous Coat of Arms, and the Republican
							Militiaman, who gave it.”—adding a short explanation of the allusion in
							the sentiment to the Tale of <persRef ref="voltaire-francois"
								>Voltaire</persRef>— Upon retiring from the Table I offered my final
							thanks to the Committee and to the Citizens of Baltimore for the
							kindness of the reception they had given me and proposed as a toast
							“Baltimore—the monumental City— May the days of her safety be as
							prosperous and happy, as the days of her danger have been trying and
							triumphant.” I then received visitors again from 6 to 8 O’Clock—and
							after once retiring was obliged to go down again, and receive a fresh
							stream. On finally withdrawing, I addressed those remaining in the room,
							and requested each and every one of them, who had at home a wife, or a
							mother, or a sister, or a daughter, to shake hands for me with her, and
							tell her that in shaking hands with him I did in heart the same with
							her— I then went to <persRef ref="coale-e">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> E. J. Coale’s</persRef>, where there was a musical party
							and heard two Glees— The Zuyderzee, and the Derby Ram— Thence we went to
								<persRef ref="hoffman-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> David
								Hoffman’s</persRef>, where a party of Ladies were assembled, and
							where we had also music. <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cornelius</persRef> performed on the Guitar, and Violin: and
								<persRef ref="u">Miss Donaldson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="pinkney-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								Pinkney</persRef> sung Italian Songs— Among the Ladies, besides
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hoffman</persRef>
							there were <persRef ref="skinner-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs.</hi> J. S. Skinner</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">M<hi

								ref="spear-nancy">Miss Spear</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">Miss
								Stuart</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">Miss Meredith</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="u">Miss Pinkney</persRef>, and some others. With M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Williams I had some conversation, and was
							much pleased. Between ten and eleven I returned to my lodgings, and
							sought the repose of night, grateful for the kind and friendly
							entertainment that I have experienced here—grateful to a higher power,
							for the expiration of the term that I have consented to remain here, and
							for the fulfilment of the promise which I had made in passing through
							this place two years since, when I missed receiving the invitation then
							intended for me.</p>

							meet them on returning here. But they end with life, and it is time for
							me to prepare earnestly for the end of life. I find creeping upon me an
							aversion to labour, the reverse of that devotion to it which has
							hitherto sustained me in all my trials— This is the most alarming
							symptom of my present moral condition— The remedy is in the hands of him

						<p>I found on my table yesterday, a great budget of Letters, the seals of
							which I left unbroken— This morning, from the moment of my rising till
							breakfast, I was employed in opening, and reading them without getting
							through the task— Setting aside applications and recommendations for
							office there was nothing in them worth the time consumed in the perusal
							of them—a reflection, which I find myself very often under the necessity
							of making— Of the immense multitudes of Letters that I have received and
							been doomed to read, since I have held my present Office; one small file
							would embrace all that are worth preserving— The visitors of this day
							noted in the margin, amounted I suppose to about 150. including the mail
							contractors— The first of them, the <persRef ref="u">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dugan</persRef> came to solicit a contribution for a Roman Catholic
							Church at Brownsville— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Black</persRef> for a subscription for a Chart of the Coast of the
							United States to be published by <persRef ref="blunt-edmund">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Blunt</persRef>— Next came two men
							claiming a reward for taking <persRef ref="anderson-willis">Willis
								Anderson</persRef>, a man charged with murder, and for the
							apprehension of whom, a proclamation issued on the 10<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September, offering a reward— He was
							taken in Pennsylvania, brought to the District, and lodged in jail
							yesterday. I referred the men to the Department of State where they
							received the reward— <persRef ref="graham-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham</persRef> came with two persons
							from the State of Ohio, <persRef ref="u">Drake</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="u">Chafey</persRef>, still remonstrating against the fixing of
							the Land Office at Tiffin— The time at which it had been determined that
							this should be done was the first of November next; but upon their
							representation, that the unhealthiness of the place has been confirmed
							even by the experience of the last Summer, and of the present time, I
							agreed that the final decision should again be postponed till the
							meeting of Congress— This subject <pb type="ms" n="313"/>is contested,
							as if the fate of the Union depended upon it— <persRef key="clay-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> came and
							introduced the Committee of the Mail Contractors who had passed a
							written resolution, that they would in a body visit the President, and
							the Secretary of State— And they enquired at what time I could with
							convenience receive them. As some of them were going away to-morrow
							morning I fixed upon four O’Clock this afternoon— They then came in
							procession; upwards of a hundred in number— I received them in the
							Winter Parlour; shook hands with them all; and at the suggestion of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, who said they would perhaps be glad
							to see the house, shewed them, the rooms on the lower floor, and those
							above with the exception of the bed-chambers— There was cake and wine
							served to them, and I drank success to them all through Highways and By
							ways. Their visit was over in about half an hour— These are persons from
							all parts of the Union who at this time of the year come to offer
							proposals of contracts for carrying the Mail— Each contract is for three
							or four years, but a certain proportion of them expire every year, and
							this is the time for the renewal of them— As the Post roads, and the
							number of the mail conveyances increase this body of men increases every
							year with them— This I believe is the first time, that they have
							assembled and acted as a body. Besides them, the visitors of this day
							were principally the Officers of the Government— <persRef
								ref="darby-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Darby</persRef>
							the Geographer brought a Gazetteer that he has recently published.
								<persRef ref="rodgers-john">Commodore Rodgers</persRef> I saw for

							is the Governor of the Territory of Florida— <persRef
								ref="roberdeau-isaac">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

							on surveys in Vermont, and he afterwards sent me an old rusty remnant of
							a Coat of Mail, found there, underground— <persRef ref="huger-francis"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Huger</persRef> called with
								<persRef ref="huger-benjamin">his Son</persRef>, a Lieutenant in the
							army; for whom he wishes to obtain a furlough to visit France— In the
							Evening I went to <persRef ref="cranch-william">Judge
							Cranch’s</persRef>, and delivered to him a Letter from <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-lucy">his Sister Greenleaf</persRef>— Found there
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James

						<p>I feel already inconvenience from the intermission of my usual morning’s
							exercise, though it has not of late been efficacious to the preservation
							of my health— This morning I walked to the race-ground, and there
							gathered about a quart of white oak acorns, which had fallen from the
							trees, and many of which had already germinated as they laid on the
							surface of the Earth— After Breakfast, I planted in the Southern
							Seedling bed in the Garden 50 white Oak Acorns in one Row— 50 Chesnuts
							in one Row and in the Eastern bed 50 black muscle Plums in one Row and
							6. Battle ground white Oak Acorns in the centre of a Row, about the
							middle of the bed— Of my former plantations I find in the Southern bed,
							planted last November and December 21 Walnut trees up and living the
							stems from one to four inches long; the leaves of those that first came
							up, in June, fallen or falling— They have been coming up the whole
							Summer; as at Quincy. There are also about 15 wild cherry trees, and ten
							Althaeas self planted— Some of the cherry trees are about nine inches
							high, and the Althaeas are three or four feet, though the first came up
							in July. The leaves of most of the Cherry trees, and of all the
							Althaea’s are still in full verdure. In the Eastern Seedling bed, There
							are 20 Walnut trees, the nuts of which were planted the 20<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> of April last. They have also been coming
							up all Summer, and are as much grown as those which were planted in the
							Southern bed the November and December before. None of the Stones or
							seeds which I planted in the Eastern bed last May June and July have
							come up— In my Seedling Pots the two Apple trees, the pippins of which
							were planted the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May are living,
							three Oranges and one Tamarind— In the two Tumblers, a dozen Oranges,
							but no others— They exhibit their Roots running down the sides of the
							tumblers, through the glass in a very curious manner. Young <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Elliot</persRef> who was
							graduated last Winter at the Columbian College came to solicit an
							appointment as a Clerk, in any of the Departments; but I knew of no

							say he was obliged to go off immediately to Virginia, where <persRef
								ref="u">his youngest Son</persRef> lies very dangerously ill of an
							inflammatory fever— He takes <persRef ref="lovell-joseph">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lovell</persRef>, the Surgeon General
							with him, but was so deeply alarmed by the Accounts from <persRef
								ref="barbour-lucy">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Barbour</persRef>, that he had little hope of finding <pb type="ms"
								n="315"/>the child alive. <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi

							East Tennessee— I desired him to send me a Commission to <persRef
								ref="plumer-william2">W. Plumer j<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi></persRef> for New-Hampshire; though I know not whether he
							will accept the appointment— <persRef ref="bulfinch-charles">M<hi

						<p><date>21. VI:30.—</date> Up in the Night— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> ill.</p>
						<p>About half past one O’Clock this morning, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Adams was seized with illness: sudden and violent in the extreme. When
							she first found herself ill she left the bed and went into the adjoining
							chamber to the bed where <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary
								Hellen</persRef> usually sleeps— I was soon after awakened by her
							groans; and leaping out of bed, followed the sound, till I found her in
							the bed in the other chamber, in great suffering, and unable to speak. I
							immediately roused the servants in the house, and sent for <persRef
								ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt</persRef> who
							shortly afterwards came, and administered an emetic, and applied mustard
							blisters to her feet arms and breast— In about two hours the emetic
							operated, and she obtained some relief. The Doctor then retired, and I
							left two of the woman Servants with her and returned to bed— This day
							she has been extremely feeble and exhausted, but without much fever.
								<persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">Her Sister Smith</persRef>
							came and will pass the night here. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt
							called several times in the course of the day. I heard this morning
								<persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawley</persRef> at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church,
							from Matthew 11.15. “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear”— And he
							read prayers for the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Sunday after
							Trinity— In the afternoon I heard a Stranger at <persRef
								ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker’s</persRef>,
							from James 2.19. “The devils also, believe and tremble.” And in the
							Evening I walked with <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail
								Adams</persRef>, to the Unitarian Church, and heard <persRef
								ref="motte-mellish">Mellish Motte</persRef>, from Deuteronomy 6.5.
							“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God”— This young man was the Classmate and
							Chambermate of my Son <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef> at
							Harvard— His Sermon was very well written, and in discoursing upon the
							Love of God, he naturally connected with it topics of goodwill to men,
							benevolence and Charity, congenial to the true Spirit of Christianity—
							His delivery is not so good as his composition—and in hearing him I
							could not defend myself from the reflection how severe a loss this
							church, and the whole community have sustained in the decease of
								<persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert
								Little</persRef>. He was perhaps over zealous in the peculiar
							doctrines of his sect, to many of which I do not assent, and he
							introduced them into his pulpit oftener, and more in the Spirit of
							controversy than was agreeable to me— But with this exception he was the
							most instructive and I will add the most entertaining preacher upon
							whose public ministration I ever permanently attended— His discourses
							were replete with ecclesiastical learning and biblical criticism— His
							moral doctrines devoted to the best feelings of the heart; and he could
							occasionally add to the kind and affectionate precepts of brotherly
							love, the sting of wit and the scourge of Satire to promote the cause of
							Virtue— I knew not how much I should feel the vacuum made by his loss
							until he was gone. He died at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on the 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of August last. I have this day begun
							the attempt to retrieve the arrears of this Journal which in my late
							journeying have run up to the amount of 16 days. I have however
							constantly kept the minutes of a diary— Steam-boat and Stage travelling
							will not admit of more. I have great difficulty in effecting so
							much.</p>

								Adams</persRef> is better; though still confined to her bed. I
							yesterday told my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef>, that I
							should not persist in objecting to his marriage with <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary C. Hellen</persRef> but that it should be

							him the means of supporting a family. Mary Hellen returned here from
								<persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye’s</persRef>— I went up this morning to the Capitol, and viewed
							the furnaces under the Rotunda with <persRef ref="u">Major
								Queen</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Marden</persRef>— And I determined upon making the experiment of
							having one erected in the President’s House— Soon after I came home it
							began to rain, and continued raining with a heavy gale, with little
							intermission through the day and evening— <persRef ref="southard-samuel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> was my only
							visitor— I shewed him a Letter that I had received from <persRef
								ref="hopkinson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hopkinson</persRef> of Philadelphia; repeating a request about which
							he had spoken to me, in behalf of the <persRef ref="bonaparte-joseph"
								>Count de Survilliers</persRef>, that <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-charles">his Son</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-zenaide">daughter</persRef> might have a passage, on
							board the line of Battle ship Delaware, going to the Mediterranean. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard said he had received a direct
							application to the same effect— That they might have the passage; unless
							there were political considerations for declining to comply with the
							Count’s request. I thought there were none of sufficient importance to
							justify the refusal— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard said it
							would be necessary for him to ascertain where they would wish to be
							landed, and that some arrangement should be made to provide for the
							expenses on their passage without occasioning a charge on the public
							funds— We spoke also of the appointment of Commissioners of the Navy
							board— <persRef ref="rodgers-john">Commodore Rodgers</persRef>, since
							his return from the command of the Squadron in the Mediterranean has
							been recommissioned to the board. But <persRef ref="tingey-thomas"
								>Tingey</persRef> is extremely desirous of withdrawing from the
							board, and of going back to his command at the Navy yard here—
							Particularly as there is an unsettled question of Rank, between him and
							Rodgers, which may slumber unless they are brought together as members
							of the same Commission— We looked over the list of Captains in the Navy,
							for me to substitute in the place of Tingey, and found none among those
							of early date, who could without inconvenience be selected— The practice
							has been to confine the appointments at the board, to the officers of
							the longest standing—and who have commanded Squadrons: I suggested to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard the Consideration, whether
							it might not be proper in future to appoint one of the three, from among
							the junior Captains, in which event we should now have no difficulty in
							making a choice— I signed an order for the discharge from prison of

								Johnson</persRef> is a young woman of pleasing personal appearance,

							assured me of the everlasting gratitude, of the whole family, if I would
							give an Office to her husband— It is among the heaviest burdens of my

							several times in a day, and scarcely ever to have it in my power to
							administer the desired relief— There is no pleader of this cause so
							eloquent as a young and handsome woman; and none who ought to be more
							firmly resisted— I told M<hi rend="superscript">rs </hi>Johnson that the
							Law gave the appointment of Clerk’s in each Department, to the Head of
							the Department itself, and that any interposition on my part unless
							desired by them, was unusual and perhaps improper. I advised that her
							husband should apply personally to the heads of Departments, and furnish

							few days been found— No positive proof of his death had been till now

							destroying him, the consequence has been a universal excitement and
							popular fermentation in that vicinity which has extended throughout
							New-York, and has at length brought a mass of obloquy upon the

						<p>This morning, as I was dressing, in the dark, standing by the table on

							had not touched it, nor has any violence happened to it from which I

							me more than it ought to have— It was like the desertion of a friend
							upon whose fidelity you have leaned with unsuspecting confidence. My

							contributions of seeds, plants, and specimens of animals, or minerals;
							to which is annexed a Report from a Committee of the Institute
							containing directions for the preservation, and transmission of
							specimens in the various branches of natural History. This procedure of
							the Institute corresponds with the project I am endeavouring to carry
							into execution of importing foreign useful plants for cultivation— I
							told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickins that I had not yet applied
							to the Columbian Institute for their aid to carry my plan into effect;
							because my first object was to procure some seeds and plants— If that
							shall be effected the co-operation of the Institute will become
							important, and then will be the time to call upon them, for their aid.
							Dickins himself will give all the assistance in his power— <persRef

							brought me back a remnant of blanks which I had left signed last Summer;

							not received the appointment before, complained that too many
							appointments were given to foreigners, and that due attention was not
							paid in the distribution of Offices to natives, and to the families of

								Son</persRef> a high salaried Clerk in the Department of State—and
								<persRef ref="thruston-charles">one Son</persRef> an Officer in the

							intimated to the judge that I sometimes heard complaints, that too many
							places were accumulated in families— He felt the remark, and I told him
							that I should favour the application of his Son, as far as I could
							consistently with propriety.</p>

						<list><item>Vail— Eugene and Aaron</item></list>
						<p>Attended with <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail Adams</persRef> at
							the Unitarian Church this morning and heard <persRef ref="motte-mellish"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Motte</persRef>, from Ephesians
							2.8. “By grace are ye saved”— The discourse was divided into two parts,
							considering the words of the text with reference first to <hi
								rend="italic">grace</hi>,<hi rend="italic"/>and secondly to
							salvation— The doctrine was <pb type="ms" n="321"/>Anti-Calvinistic, but
							rather declamatory than argumentative. The preacher left out from his
							text the greater part of the verse, of which it forms a part, and that
							upon which the Calvinists chiefly rely—the whole verse is [“]For by
							grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the
							gift of God[”]— To meet the argument of the Calvinists the whole verse
							must be taken, and to answer it, the context of the whole chapter, and
							the purpose of the whole Epistle should be discussed. The Epistle to the
							Ephesians, written by <persRef ref="paul">Paul</persRef> when a prisoner
							at Rome, consists itself of two parts: The first closing with the third
							chapter, where there would seem to be a formal termination of the
							Epistle— It begins by blessing God, that from before the foundation of
							the world he had predestinated <hi rend="italic">Us </hi>that is Paul
							himself and the Ephesians, to enjoy the blessings of Christianity, by
							their faith in Christ and their practice of his moral precepts— But Paul
							was a Jew, of the seed of <persRef ref="abraham">Abraham</persRef>, the
							elect of God, and the Ephesians had been Gentiles, without hope and
							without God in the world— The object therefore of the first half of the
							Epistle is to convince them, that by the special favour of God,
							preordained before the creation of the world, Jews and Gentiles were all
							included in the purpose of salvation, and destined to the blessings of
							immortality, by their common faith in Christ, and the performance of
							good works taught by him, and to which they were in like manner fore
							ordained— To this course of reasoning, chiefly concentrated in the
							second Chapter, the verse from which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Motte took his text belongs— The tenor of the Epistle countenances the
							doctrines of Election and Predestination, but it urges a predestination
							of good works, and the last three chapters of it are devoted entirely to
							the inculcation of morality in the various relations of human life— How
							it is possible to reconcile the principle of predestination with the use
							or efficacy of prayer I know not; but it is vain to deny that the
							Epistles of Paul, and this to the Ephesians in particular lay down the
							doctrine of predestination, in the most unqualified terms: enjoining at
							the same time with equal earnestness the practice of fervent prayer, and
							the performance of good works— In the afternoon I heard from <persRef
								ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef> an
							exposition of the first Psalm. I did not attend Church this Evening,
							having past the last night almost sleepless. I had a visit at noon from
							the <persRef ref="vail-eugene;vail-aaron" type="multi">brothers
								Vail</persRef>; who informed me that <persRef ref="lovell-joseph"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lovell</persRef> had returned
							from <persRef ref="barbour-james">Gov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Barbour’s</persRef>, and that the Governor’s <persRef ref="u"

							asking whether I should be willing to receive from them, and answer
							certain direct enquiries, in relation to my public accounts, and also
							relating to my conduct as a member of the Senate, upon the acquisition
							of Louisiana— He observed that the misrepresentations with regard to my
							accounts, which had been circulated from Speeches in Congress, and in
							the newspapers, had been of the most pernicious influence upon the late
							Elections in Kentucky— I told him, that I was aware of the uses which
							had been made and were making of these misrepresentations; but that <pb

							corresponding with an electioneering Committee on these Subjects. I was

							conferred by the suffrages of the People to offer themselves and solicit
							votes—a natural consequence of which is that they are called to account
							before the people, and to answer any charges against them, or enquiries
							made of them respecting their conduct or principles. But this has not
							been customary with reference to the Office of President of the United
							States, and I should not be willing to set the Precedent. As to my
							accounts, I had partly prepared a statement of them to be laid before
							Congress at the next or the succeeding Session— This appeared to me the

							Gales left with me a Resolution of the Boards of Aldermen and of Common

							establishing and endowing public Schools, and for erecting a Town House
							or City Hall, in the City of Washington. Which requires the approbation
							of the President of the United States— Also a request for my decision,
							upon the laying of the pavement on the North side of the Square, North
							of the President’s House— The Commissioner of the Public Buildings,
							having in my absence, commenced laying the pavement two feet narrower
							than the adjoining Squares, but suspended the work at the request of the
							Citizens interested in the neighbouring property, for my decision— He
							spoke also of a Resolution of the Corporation which was sent me last
							year, soliciting an allowance from the funds of the U.S. of 500 dollars
							a year; towards the Salary of a City Surveyor—with which, although I
							thought the request reasonable and proper, I had declined complying,
							from a doubt of my authority legally to do so— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gales I would look into the subject again,
							but believed I should continue doubtful of my power— He said he would
							consider it as so settled, and that the Corporation would apply to
							Congress— He added that the necessity for a regular and responsible City
							Surveyor was indispensable; and that for the want of such an Officer
							confusion was already creeping into the location of new buildings— It
							had been only last week discovered that a house the building of which
							had cost six thousand dollars encroached eight feet upon the Street—
								<persRef ref="calvert-george2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							of political Economy, more than has been done by any of his Predecessors
							since <persRef ref="hamilton-alexander">Hamilton</persRef>— He concurred
							with me in the marked superiority of Hamilton’s Reports over those of
							his Successors; his own, form the first exceptions, and his intention is
							that the next shall be still more distinguished by a discussion of
							principles and deduction of consequences applicable to the revenue— He
							also promised me in about ten days the minutes from the Treasury
							necessary for the preparation of the Message. I had intended to go into
							the woods to gather Acorns at one O’Clock; but was detained by visitors
							till near three; and had scarcely got upon the ground when there came up
							a heavy shower which drenched me with rain, and drove me home so wet
							that I found a complete change of cloathing necessary. I visited however
							the Rock Creek Church Yard, and there saw the tombs of my wife’s mother
								<persRef ref="johnson-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

							alternate white Oak Acorns Shellbarks and black Walnuts with two
							Chesnuts that I found in the woods yesterday.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> The first half of this month, was consumed in
							travelling from Quincy to this place— That life is always irregular, and
							especially interferes with my habit of daily writing— Its next
							consequence is to produce an arrearage of my diary, and at the same time
							an accumulation of matters to be recorded— It is impossible to write in
							Stages; and so difficult in Steamboats that I scarcely ever attempt it.
							At Taverns it is not much more easy— Even at home, whether in Quincy or
							here; the day is so constantly absorbed by visitors or business that I
							have only the morning before breakfast and the evening after dinner for
							writing— On my return to this place my Diary was a full fortnight in
							arrears; but I had kept the minutes for it without intermission— It was
							three days after my return, before I recovered the regular course of my
							occupations; but during the last twelve days I have written a morning
							and an Evening page in this Book, and I am at this moment bringing up
							the last Lines of arrears— To accomplish this however I have been
							obliged to suspend my morning walks and thus to intrench upon the
							regularity of my daily exercise. This must be restored; and as the
							Session of Congress approaches I must expect interruptions of visitors
							in the Evening as well as in the day. I bless the giver of Good that my
							health continues to improve; and deeply mourn that my wife’s appears to
							decline, and becomes more and more alarming. The heart knoweth its own
							bitterness, and a stranger intermeddleth not with its joys— I ought this
							day to have begun upon the draft of my Message, for the Commencement of
							the first Session of the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Congress; but
							postpone a painful task to the last moment.</p>
