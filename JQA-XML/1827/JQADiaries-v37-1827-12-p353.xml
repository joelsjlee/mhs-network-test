						<p>The names in the margin arranged in alphabetical order are those of
							members of Congress, who called in the course of this day and Evening.
							37 members of the House and three Senators— They occupied so large a
							portion of the time, that little was left me for writing, and none for
							attention to other business— Of these visitors about one third are
							moderate opposition men, whose votes will always be against the
							administration; but who are yet willing to be upon terms of social
							intercourse with me. At the first Session of the last Congress there was
							only one Senator, and not more than three members of the House, who
							declined coming to the house— Everyone, without exception was invited—
							The besotted violence of John <persRef ref="randolph-john"
								>Randolph</persRef> at that Session excluded him thenceforward from
							all right to personal civility from me. Half a dozen other frequenters
							of gin lane and beer alley, after dinner Speech makers, in the House put
							themselves into the same position, and two or three Slanderers, drunk
							with faction, though not with Alcohol, must be added to the gang—
							Besides these, whom I have disdained to notice, there were at both the
							Sessions of the last Congress a number of members of both Houses, bitter
							as wormwood in their opposition, indulging themselves, in the warmth of
							debate in personal reflections as ungenerous and they were unjust, who
							yet came to the drawing Rooms, and when invited, to the dinners; always
							ready to introduce their friends to the President; to partake of his
							hospitality; and to recommend candidates for every vacant appointment.
							The highest Class of opposition, consisted of men, whose personal
							deportment was always courteous and respectful—who abstained from all
							insulting personalities, both in their public Speeches, and their
							private conversations, but applied all their faculties to opposition of
							measures— Of those there are very few— <persRef ref="drayton-william"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Drayton</persRef> of
							South-Carolina who called this day was one of them. They are more
							formidable enemies than the foul mouthed Scavengers of the party— But
							some of them under the courtesies of life conceal a rancour of heart as
							corrosive as the rabid foam of Randolph. The conversations this day
							burned upon indifferent subjects, excepting with <persRef
								ref="newton-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newton</persRef>,
							who was in good Spirits, and has high expectations of the support of
							Virginia— <persRef ref="bell-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bell</persRef> is equally confident of New-Hampshire— Of the other
							visitors, <persRef ref="montandon-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Montandon</persRef> took my Penelope Clock to repair, and regulated
							that belonging to the house, in my bed-chamber— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Marden</persRef> has come on from
							Boston, to put up the stove for which I had written to <persRef
								ref="safford-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Safford</persRef>; but the stove itself, though shipped more than a
							fortnight since at Boston, has not yet arrived— <persRef
								ref="mccaine-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Cain</persRef> is a methodist clergyman, who brought subscription
							papers for an Edition of the Bible with <persRef ref="henry-matthew"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry’s</persRef> Commentary;
							and for a book of progressive lessons of drawing; with Plates— I
							declined subscribing, but agreed to take the Books. Another Clergyman,
								<persRef ref="cooper-unknown6">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cooper</persRef>, brought me a copy of an Edition of <persRef ref="virgil">Virgil</persRef> that he
							has published with English notes— <persRef ref="u">Reinhart</persRef>
							was a lad, who came with <persRef ref="connor-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Conner</persRef> of North-Carolina.
								<persRef ref="doty-james">Judge Doty</persRef> of Michigan came with
								<persRef ref="wing-austin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wing</persRef>— <persRef ref="roberdeau-isaac">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Roberdeau</persRef> called to give me
							the time of a meridian observation which he took this day with <persRef
								ref="elliot-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Elliot</persRef>; and <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef> came this Evening to
							bear testimony in favour of a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Howard</persRef>, who had written to me from the State
							of Indiana, and referred to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye for his

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="burnap-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Burnap</persRef> this morning from Psalm 4:6. “Who will shew us any
							good?” This is part of a verse, from the whole of which <persRef
								ref="sterne-lawrence">Sterne</persRef> took the text of one of his
							Sermons— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burnap treated it in a
							different manner— Under the question who will shew us any good, he gave
							a picture somewhat melancholy of the destiny which in this world usually
							attends the benefactors of mankind— He read the 73<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> Psalm, and gave out to sing the 9<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> hymn, of the collection of this Church— After the morning
							service I had a visit from <persRef ref="sergeant-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sergeant</persRef>; but had little
							conversation with him— In the afternoon, I heard <persRef
								ref="tyng-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyng</persRef> at
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church. He read the Evening
							prayer for the first Sunday in Advent, and preached from Romans 14:17.
							“For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and
							peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.” He explained, what he understood to
							be meant by the words “kingdom of God” here; and in three other
							different significations which he said it had in other parts of the New
							Testament— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tyng read only a part of his
							Discourse— Then abruptly stopped short, and said as it was growing late,
							he could not finish it— In the Evening I heard M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Burnap again—from Romans 1:16. [“]For I am not ashamed of
							the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every
							one that believeth.” <persRef ref="sprague-peleg">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sprague</persRef> of Maine called on
							me this Evening; and spoke of the troubles about our North-Eastern
							boundary. He had little additional information to that which we had
							before received—and thinks of <persRef ref="lincoln-enoch">Governor
								Enoch Lincoln’s</persRef> conduct on this subject as we do—that it
							is neither wise, nor patriotic; nor adapted to the interest of his

							to thank the respective <pb type="ms" n="355"/>houses for this
							notification, and inform them that I proposed to make a communication to
							them in writing, to-morrow at twelve O’Clock— After the joint Committee
							had left me, Everett came back, and informed me of the issue of the
							Election in the House— There were 207 members present; and only 6
							absent—205 votes given—of which <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Andrew

						<p>My third annual message to Congress was sent this day at 12. O’Clock. It
							was first printed as the two former had been, by <persRef
								ref="force-peter">Peter Force</persRef>, publisher of the National
							Journal—and printed copies of it were furnished yesterday to the
								<persRef ref="green-duff;gales-joseph;seaton-william" type="multi"
								>Editors</persRef> of the Telegraph and of the National
							Intelligencer— I had visits in the course of the day from four Senators
							and 22 members of the House; besides <persRef ref="white-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> White</persRef>, the Delegate from
							Florida, who introduced <persRef ref="u">his brother</persRef> a student
							who comes from the University of Virginia, and is going to Cambridge—
							There were about ten other visitors, among whom <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> brought two copies of their Reports, and
							accompanying documents to be transmitted with the Message— With the
							members who called I had little conversation, but upon the trivial
							topics of the weather— <persRef ref="vanrensselaer-stephen">General Van
								Rensselaer</persRef> brought a file of Letters, recommending
								<persRef ref="duer-john">John Duer</persRef>, for the appointment of
							District Attorney, for the Southern District of New-York, in the event
							of the resignation of <persRef ref="tillotson-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Tillotson</persRef>, the present
							Attorney; or of his declining a re-appointment. Gen<hi
								rend="superscript">l</hi> Van Rensselaer spoke of the failure of
								<persRef ref="taylor-john">Taylor’s</persRef> election as Speaker,
							and said that he had made himself odious to all parties in New-York by
							his selfishness— The General himself is prejudiced against him— I have
							seen in the political conduct and character of Taylor no peculiar marks
							of selfishness; and he certainly has been one of the most popular men in
							the State of New-York— A State however the most fickle in the
							dispensation of its popular suffrages of any one in the Union— But
							Taylor’s manners are not attractive, and are sometimes repulsive— The
							members from the South will never forgive the part that he took in the
							Missouri question; and they have recently assailed his private life,
							with charges of dissolute conduct here which have deeply affected his
							reputation— It is a remarkable circumstance that these charges proceed
							from men of the most abandoned immorality themselves— Men who having
							neither reputation to lose, nor principle to restrain them, are
							invulnerable to the poisoned shaft, which they hurl against others— On a
							slender foundation of truth, they raised a fabrick of falsehood against
							Taylor, and widely circulate reports affecting his personal courage, as
							well as his chastity— The difficulty of his situation was, that the
							falsehood could not be refuted, without bringing the truth</p> <pb type="ms"

							from the seed. <persRef ref="stewart-andrew">Stewart</persRef> was quite

						<p>I have little sleep— Between two and three O’Clock this morning I awoke,
							and finding on looking at my watch by Moonlight, returned to bed and lay
							till four, when I arose—finished reading the proceedings of the Court
							Martial on the trial of <persRef ref="carter-william">Master Commandant
								William Carter</persRef>, for habitual drunkenness— The Court
							Sentence him to be Cashiered and disqualified from ever serving in the
							Navy which sentence I confirmed. I wrote till after Sunrise, and then
							walked round the Capitol Square. From breakfast till dinner I had a
							succession of visitors whose names as far as I can recollect them are in
							the margin. 32 members of the House of Representatives 14 Senators, and
							eight others— There are probably several omissions, and some mistakes of
							names; particularly among the Strangers whom I had not seen before— The
							alphabetical order of the names of members is imperfect, some of the

						<p>upon indifferent topics: <persRef ref="taylor-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor</persRef> called in the
							Evening, and gave me some particulars, of the election for Speaker— His
							failure was again owing to the defection among the members from his own
							State of New-York—of their thirty-two votes besides his own, he obtained
							not more than twelve— <persRef ref="oakley-thomas">Oakley</persRef> was
							absent. He lost eight or ten votes upon which he had counted, some of
							which were given by persons who had voluntarily told him within three
							days that they would vote for him— <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew"
								>Stevenson</persRef> solicited the votes of the friends of the
							Administration, and obtained several votes of Tariff men, by promising
							to appoint a Committee in favour of that measure, though himself deadly
							hostile to it. Taylor thinks there is no question that may arise, on
							which the Administration can expect a stronger vote than that for him as
							Speaker— He said he was willing to do any thing in his power for its
							support; but he thought it would be best to leave to the opposition, to
							move the usual distribution of the message into parcels for reference to
							Committees. These are appointed by the Speaker, and Stevenson would
							appoint them in such manner, as to indulge his own rancour and that of
							his party, and yet affect an appearance of impartiality— Stevenson is
							one of those men, whom troublous times always push into consequence and
							distinction—men of talents—of characters black with private
							infamy—detected—exposed—and yet maintaining their popularity and rising
							to power on the ruin of honour and virtue— <persRef ref="giles-william"
								>Giles</persRef> the present Governor of Virginia, and <persRef
								ref="ingham-samuel">Ingham</persRef> of Pennsylvania, are of the
							same class of Politicians— I told Taylor that I thought it quite
							immaterial, by whom the distribution of the message should be moved— The
							disposal of the business would depend upon the composition of the
							Committees, and Stevenson’s impartiality in the appointment of these
							would be like that of <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Vice President
								Calhoun</persRef>, at the first Session of the last Congress— Taylor
							supposed that the part of the message relating to the Colonial trade
							question might be referred to a Committee of Commerce who might make a
							Report of censure upon the administration relating to it: this is quite
							probable, but I said they could make no Report which the minority of the
							Committee could not easily refute by a Counter-report— Taylor spoke also
							of the state of Affairs in New-York— Of <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De
								Witt Clinton’s</persRef> coalition with <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef>, which he is satisfied was
							arranged more than a year ago— Of <persRef ref="sanford-nathan"
								>Sanford’s</persRef> pertinacious refusal, to take any part in
							sustaining the General Administration, and of the inactivity and
							timidity of our friends there. He says Sanford intends to be the
							candidate for Governor at their next Election, and has spent the Summer
							in travelling about the State to make friends. His neutrality was to
							avoid giving offence to either party— Taylor mentioned also a
							conversation he had with <persRef ref="tallmadge-james"
								>Tallmadge</persRef> upon the subject of appointments in the State
							of New-York— He says Tallmadge has for the present abandoned the pursuit
							of politics, and returned to his practice at the bar. <persRef
								ref="taliaferro-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Taliaferro</persRef> this morning spoke with surprize of a decision
							in the Senate yesterday confirming the appointment of <persRef
								ref="green-duff">Duff Green</persRef>, as Printer to that body— This
							man is Editor of the Telegraph Newspaper, a scurrilous and abusive
							print, set up by and for the opposition— The vote in Senate was 25 to
							19. and <persRef ref="barton-david">Barton</persRef> and Sanford were
							among the votes in Green’s favour— <persRef ref="wickliffe-charles"
								>Wickliffe</persRef> of Kentuckey, who introduced <persRef
								ref="daniel-henry">Daniel</persRef>, said I had carved out in the
							Message much work for Congress to do— I said I had stated to them the
							present condition of public affairs: it was for them to determine what
							work they would do. He spoke of the claims of the Revolutionary
							Officers, and said he thought Congress should do something for them, if
							they knew what it was— I thought it a very simple enquiry, and a very
							urgent duty— I signed Commissions for one Captain, one Lieutenant, and 8
							Ensigns of Infantry, 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Legion 1<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> brigade of the Militia of the District
							of Columbia— Wrote also a short Message N. 1. to the Senate, enclosing a
							Report from the <persRef ref="southard-samuel">Secretary of the
								Navy</persRef>, with documents required by a Resolution of the
							Senate of 19. February last, relating to the expenses incurred under the
							Act of 2 March 1819 for prohibiting the Slave-trade— I closed the
							Evening again soon after nine with the view to rise again to-morrow
							morning at four.</p>

						<p>I rose again at four—wrote till half past six and then walked round the
							Capitol Square—an hour and a quarter—then wrote again till nine. The
							visitors of this day were five Senators; twenty members of the House of
							Representatives, and two others— <persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kenney</persRef> came and gave me a
							long account of his negotiations with the Indians, particularly with the
							Creeks for the small remnant of their Land within the State of Georgia,
							not included in the last Treaty made with them in January 1826— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kenney is very voluble and magnified his
							office— He told me all the arguments that he used with the <persRef
								ref="littleprince">Little Prince</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="opothleyoholo">Opothle Yoholo</persRef>, and the <persRef
								ref="bigfellow">Big fellow</persRef>; and how he put down <persRef
								ref="ridge-john">Ridge</persRef> and <persRef ref="vann-david"
								>Vann</persRef>. The result of it all was a Treaty for the remnant
							of the Creek Lands in Georgia of which however the confirmation by the
							Indians in Council is yet to be received— I spoke to him of the
							remonstrance by the Brotherton and Stockbridge Indians, against the
							Treaty made by him and <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Governor Cass</persRef>
							last Summer, with the Winebago, and Menominie Indians. He made very
							light of it; but gave me no satisfactory answer to the claim of the
							Indians from New-York who alledge that the Lands ceded by this Treaty
							had already been ceded several years since with the approbation of this
							Government to them— I received afterwards a Letter from several persons
							at New-York, further and earnestly remonstrating against the Treaty.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kenney spoke to me in terms of high
							commendation of <persRef ref="bryant-thomas">T. S. Bryant</persRef> the assistant
							Surgeon, whose trial by a Court martial is before me. M’Kenney saw him
							at Green Bay, and bears testimony in his favour— <persRef
								ref="harrison-william">General Harrison</persRef> brought me a
							Letter to him from <persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Thomas D.
								Arnold</persRef> with Recommendations of him enclosed for The Office
							of U.S. District Attorney in East Tennessee, in the place of <persRef
								ref="lea-pryor">Pryor Lea</persRef> who has been elected a member of
							the House of Representatives in Congress— Harrison said he delivered
							those Letters to me, as he received them— Arnold was a competitor for
							Lea’s seat in Congress himself—and published a pamphlet against <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, which Harrison said,
							proved he was at least a bold man. I told him I had received Letters
							from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Arnold himself applying for the
							appointment— I mentioned to <persRef ref="cobb-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cobb</persRef>, the Senator, and four
							members of the House from Georgia, who came together, that I had
							received from the <persRef ref="forsyth-john">Governor Forsyth</persRef>
							a Letter, with a memorial of <persRef ref="mcbride-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Bride</persRef> who Cobb said was
							now Surveyor General of the State, and a manuscript map, shewing the
							principle upon which Georgia claims the South Branch of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Mary’s River for her boundary upon the
							Territory of Florida— I observed that the Governor wrote me that he had
							not had time to send a duplicate of these papers to the delegation of
							the State here, and that they might perhaps apply to me for
							communication of those he sent to me— I said I should very readily
							communicate them if the Delegation desired, and should be glad to do any
							thing further in my power towards the Settlement of the question. Cobb
							said they did not know exactly what to do next, and asked me a number of
							Questions, artful enough, to draw from me some opinion, upon the merits
							of this new claim of Georgia, but I avoided giving any opinion, and said
							I considered it not within the competency of the Executive Authority. He
							said the Delegation would consult together, and perhaps might request a
							communication of the documents I had received from Governor Forsyth— And
							then I might by Message bring the Subject before Congress. <pb type="ms"

							and was a warm patriot in the late war with Great-Britain— He has a
							large and helpless family, and when going to wreck and ruin, speculated
							in the Slave trade to save himself; was detected, and is under
							prosecution— The sympathies of many worthy persons in Baltimore have

								Southard</persRef> came and took the proceedings of the Court
							Martial in the case of <persRef ref="carter-william">Master Commandant
								William Carter</persRef>— I told him that I had subjoined to the
							Record a simple approval of the Sentence— That I had been extremely
							reluctant to approve that part of it which declares him disqualified him
							from ever serving in the Navy— But the testimony was positive that in
							one of his drunken fits, in a heavy gale of wind he gave orders, which
							brought the ship into the most imminent danger of foundering— That on
							another, by a press of Sail in the night he exposed her against warning
							to run upon the Ramirez Rocks— That he once treated rudely a British
							Officer, sent on board of his ship to explain a misunderstanding on the
							subject of a Salute—and once exposed himself by his Deportment at a
							Public House on Shore, in presence of many persons, among whom was
							another British Officer; and that he once ordered a Lieutenant in
							command, to leave the deck, and gave the Ship in charge of an acting
							Boatswain— Such enormous evils from intemperance demanded a signal
							example—and I said I had thought of annexing to the decision, a special
							reference to these incidents, as reasons for confirming the
							disqualifying part of the Sentence; but had finally concluded merely to
							confirm the Sentence without comment. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Southard said if I thought proper he would prepare a Letter to be
							communicated with the Sentence, and making the references I had
							proposed—to which I assented— He said he had a private Letter from the
							judge Advocate <persRef ref="coxe-richard">R. S. Coxe</persRef>
							mentioning that the Log-Book, upon which there had been much reliance in
							the defence, bore evident marks of erasures and interpolations— In this
							case, as in that of <persRef ref="chambers-talbot">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Chambers</persRef>, and indeed in
							every trial for drunkenness upon which I have been called to Act, the
							mass of <hi rend="italic">negative </hi>testimony, even from witnesses
							of the most respectable character—that is of witnesses who say that the
							accused was not drunk at times, when the positive witnesses swear that
							he was so, is surprizing— Others swear of a confirmed and notorious sot,
							that they have known him for years, and never saw him drunk in their
							lives— This is so invariable a resource of defence in every trial for
							drunkenness that it may be classed with the alibi of the Old Bailey—
							Negative testimony in such cases proves absolutely nothing— I received
							this day the visit of the <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
								>Vice-President</persRef>, five Senators, eighteen members of the
							House of Representatives, <pb type="ms" n="360"/>and two other persons—
								<persRef ref="bryan-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bryan</persRef> of North-Carolina came to remonstrate against the
							permanent appointment of <persRef ref="rogerson-asa">Asa
								Rogerson</persRef>, as Collector at Camden— He received the

							dissatisfaction to many friends of the Administration. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bryan says he is a man of a bad character;
							a speculating Slave-dealer, and a violent Slanderer of the
							Administration— That no member of the Delegation will recommend him but
								<persRef ref="sawyer-lemuel">L. Sawyer</persRef>, the disgrace of

								<persRef ref="dwight-henry">Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>
								Dwight</persRef> called in the Evening and we conversed upon the

								ref="ingham-samuel">Ingham</persRef>, <persRef ref="hamilton-james3"

							of Committees has heretofore usually if not invariably been made on the
							third day of the Session, and this postponement of it to the eighth is
							only indicative that it is now to be made a party measure, and that the
							Speaker is to be a mere instrument in the hands of a Caucus— Col<hi

						<p>I received visits from three Senators and eight Members of the House of

								Sloane</persRef>, whose residence was the nearest, they knew no more

						<p><date>9. IV.</date> Sun rose 7:22</p>
						<p>Heard this morning <persRef ref="motte-mellish">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Motte</persRef>, from Acts 28.22. “But we desire to hear
							of thee what thou thinkest—for as concerning this sect, we know that
							every where it is spoken against.” It was a vindication of the Unitarian
							doctrines, to which he is himself a convert, having commenced his
							profession as an episcopalian preacher. He spoke of the great
							earnestness with which he had searched the Scriptures from Genesis to
							the Apocalypse, without finding a single word which to his judgment
							would warrant the doctrine of the Trinity, and of the obligation which
							he had felt of doing homage to the truth however it might be spoken
							against— And he adduced many powerful considerations of encouragement to
							perseverance and stedfastness against the current of popular opinion; at
							whatever hazard of obloquy and persecution— He gave out for singing the
							Hymns 38 and 173 of the collection made for this Church by <persRef
								ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little</persRef>;
							both of which are beautiful and consoling. Hope in the goodness of
							God—reliance upon his mercy in affliction—trust in him to bring light
							out of darkness and good out of evil—are the comforts and promises which
							I derive from attendance on public worship— They help to sustain me, in
							the troubles that are thickening upon me, and although every day adds to
							the gloom, and threatening fury of the storm, and not a ray of light is
							discernible before me, yet I do gather strength and fortitude and a
							vague and indefinite confidence of escaping or of passing unhurt through
							the furnace that awaits me, from the constant exhortations to trust in
							the Lord which abound in the Psalms, as well as in the Selections of
							Hymns at the Churches where I attend— In the afternoon I heard <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read Prayers for the second Sunday in Advent, omitting the portion of
							the Psalms and the lesson from the Old Testament— His Discourse was from
							Hebrews 12.22 and 24. “But ye are come unto—Jesus, the mediator of the
							new Covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better
							things than that of Abel.”— There was a parallel between the sacrifice
							of <persRef ref="abel">Abel</persRef> and that of Christ—with an
							argument to prove that the blood of sprinkling, in the latter spoke
							better things than in the former. It was very dull, and the house very
							thin. But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley told us that the
							donation to <persRef ref="noah">Noah</persRef>, after the flood, of
							beasts for food, was the first grant to man of the right to slaughter
							brutes; and that before that time they could lawfully be slain only for
							sacrifice—and that the skins of beasts which formed the first garments
							of <persRef ref="adam">Adam</persRef> and <persRef ref="eve"
								>Eve</persRef> were of animals so slain— In the Evening I heard
							again M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Motte, from Luke 8.18. “Take heed
							therefore, how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given: and
							whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth
							to have.” The first clause of the verse was the only part of it upon
							which he commented, and the sermon was a querulous classification of
							persons who attend on public worship; as not being good hearers— He said
							that some if they did not sleep were giving their attention to the
							affairs of the world—perhaps even to bad passions— Others were playing
							the critic—cavilling in their minds at the composition, or passing
							Sentence upon the Delivery of the Discourse— Some would give a partial
							and occasional attention, which soon drooped, and scarcely any went
							seriously and soberly to hear and improve themselves by the delivery to
							them of the whole Counsel of God— I took to myself no small part of his
							censure; but thought there was in it some acrimony.</p>

								Todson</persRef> called on me this morning; returned from the
							African Colony where he says he had a narrow escape with his life;
							having taken the fever of the Country, and had a relapse, while on board
							ship upon his return— He brings a certificate signed by several of the
							Colonists, and a Letter from <persRef ref="ashmun-jehudi">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ashmun</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							in his favour— He says the Colony will prosper, if the Government
							continues to give it aid, and that its greatest danger is a Spirit of
							mercantile Speculation among the Colonists— <persRef ref="parris-albion"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parris</persRef> the Senator,
							and <persRef ref="mcintire-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Intire</persRef>, a member of the House from Maine came together—
							They spoke of the appointment of a Postmaster at Portland— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Parris had some time recommended a
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mitchell</persRef>;
							and now mentioned him again— <persRef ref="benton-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Benton</persRef>, Senator from
							Missouri, and <persRef ref="rowan-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rowan</persRef> from Kentucky came together— These with the five
							succeeding members of the House from Pennsylvania were only morning
							visitors— <persRef ref="white-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								White</persRef> the Delegate from Florida came in no small alarm, at
							the new pretensions of the State of Georgia to the Southernmost branch
							of the Saint Mary’s river for her boundary upon Florida— He says that
							when the Act of Congress passed to authorise the drawing of the of the
							line, there was an opinion that the Head of Saint Mary’s River was a
							more Northern Branch than that where <persRef ref="ellicott-andrew"
								>Ellicott</persRef> and the Spanish Commissioner drew the line—and
							that <persRef ref="cobb-thomas">Cobb</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>, and all the Georgians
							protested vehemently against any departure from the line of the Treaty—
							And now they talk of the mistakes of the Commissioners who drew the
							line, and the chartered Limits of Georgia— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> White of the Communications I had received
							from the Governor of Georgia, setting forth their pretensions, and the
							conversations I had had with the members of the Delegation— I had told
							them that this was a question beyond the competency of the Executive,
							and which must be referred to Congress. I sent for <persRef
								ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>,
							and had a conversation with him upon distressing domestic concerns. It
							was interrupted by <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor
								Barbour’s</persRef> coming in, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frye promised to call again. The Governor spoke of the numerous
							applications for army brevets, for ten years of Service in any one
							grade; which he said would in process of time turn every Officer of the
							army into a Major General—while on the other hand it would be a hardship
							on the Officers, to keep them half a century confined to the rank of a
							Lieutenant or Captain— I gave Governor Barbour the drafts of my
							decisions upon the Court-Martial proceedings in the cases of <persRef
								ref="bryant-thomas">Assistant Surgeon Bryant</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="u">Lieutenant Hunter</persRef>, with the request that he would
							look them over, and suggest any alteration that he might think proper—
								<persRef ref="mckinney-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Kinney</persRef> came to tell me that he had ascertained there
							would be no opposition, from any part of the Tennessee Delegation to his
							appointment as District Attorney for West-Tennessee; and to express his
							wish that the nomination might be soon sent in, as he was desirous of
							leaving the City in a few days— <persRef ref="judah-bernard">M<hi

								<persRef ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef>— He came to

								<persRef ref="buckingham-joseph">Buckingham</persRef>— <persRef

								ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>
							called again, and I had further Conversation with him on the subject of
							yesterday— The <persRef ref="menou-charles">Count de Menou</persRef>
							called and asked my permission to introduce to me a young Frenchman who
							is travelling in this Country— Captain    of the Navy introduced a
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parker</persRef>

								>Butler</persRef>, brought a petition from <persRef

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Philip S. Markley</persRef> was
							appointed Naval-Officer at the earnest recommendation of him M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, and not at-all, at that of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, whom he had thought rather
							unfavourable to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Markley’s appointment. I
							observed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush, that I doubted the
							effect of this Letter, as testimony, and its accuracy in point of fact—
							As testimony it would be unnecessary to any of our friends, and enemies
							would say, how can M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush testify to what
							passed between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and the President
							who nominated M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Markley— As to the fact of
							my impression was that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s wishes were
							entirely and warmly favourable to Markley certainly from no improper
							motive—nor did he press him upon me with importunity— He never does any
							one— But M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Markley had always been openly
							and earnestly the political friend of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay— He had separated himself from that gang of <persRef
								ref="ingham-samuel">Ingham</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="kremer-george">Kremer’s</persRef> tools and while they were
							persecuting and slandering him, moved in the House of Representatives a
							very complimentary vote of thanks to him, at the close of the Session of
							Congress, as Speaker. There was abundant reason to befriend M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Markley on the part of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and I did understand that he always
							did befriend him— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush said there had
							been a time, when he thought M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had
							rather favoured the appointment of <persRef ref="roberts-jonathan"
								>Jonathan Roberts</persRef>— This was true, but it was when we all
							apprehended that the objections to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Markley would be insuperable— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush burnt
							the draft of his Letter, and said he would mention to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay that <pb type="ms" n="367"/>he
							thought it might be questioned whether as members of the same
							Administration there would be a propriety in his volunteering such
							testimony. I gave M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush several papers of
							solicitation for the release of <persRef ref="thomson-edward">Edward

							Judgment of <persRef ref="hyde-de-neuville-jean">Baron Hyde de
								Neuville</persRef> against <persRef key="smith-william-steuben"
								>William S. Smith</persRef>— It was 385 dollars and 38 Cents. My
							intention has been and is to hold for the benefit of William S. Smith
							and <persRef key="smith-catherine-johnson">his wife</persRef> the sum of
							1488 dollars which were applied from the bequest of <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> to him, in payment of notes due
							from him to me— The remainder of that bequest was absorbed in the
							payment of debts of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith, for which
								<persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef>, and <persRef ref="forrest-richard">R.
								Forrest</persRef> had become responsible, and in part payment of
							this debt to Baron de Neuville— I paid of it this time last year only
							290:20. to avoid reducing the sum which I proposed to hold as a fund,
							for the benefit of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith and his wife;
							but never to be subject to his controul, or liable for any of his debts—
							A years interest was now due from me on this fund, and my intention was
							to have applied this interest annually to the discharge of the balance
							due from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith to De Neuville, until that
							debt should be wholly paid— This would be effected on the first of
							August 1831— But having heard that Baron de Neuville himself is now in
							circumstances which would make the full payment of this balance
							desirable to him, I concluded to pay the whole now, and charge it to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith as an advance of interest, upon
							the fund appropriated by me for his benefit, and discharging that
							interest, till the first of August 1831. Or the sum which I have now
							paid for him may be refunded to me, by a shorter advance of interest
							upon the fund, the residue to be paid by the sum to which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith may be entitled, at the second
							distribution of my fathers bequests to his devisees. The sum now

						<p>I heard this Morning <persRef ref="motte-mellish">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Motte</persRef> from a text in the Psalms, which he gave
							out in a tone of voice so low that I could not hear it, but the subject
							of his Discourse was Prayer— He considered it in points of view peculiar
							to himself; not touching upon those most obvious to discussion and
							enlarging upon those of more doubtful character— His remarks upon the
							Spirit of prayer were sensible—he represented fervour as its most
							essential property; and spoke with severity of those who neglect this
							duty by a cold and careless performance of it— The second <persRef
								ref="alcibiades">Alcibiades</persRef> of <persRef ref="plato"
								>Plato</persRef>, is an admirable Treatise upon the duty and objects
							of Prayer— And Jesus himself has comprized in the short Prayer which he
							prescribed to his disciples, all that man can need to ask of Heaven—
							When I went into the Church I found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Motte
							baptizing several children: a ceremony which <persRef
								ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little</persRef>
							declined always to perform— Considering it as a useless and
							superstitious rite, and the text by which Christians generally believe
							it to be enjoined (Matthew 28.19.20[)] as spurious— I think it one of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little’s great errors— In the
							afternoon at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read prayers for the third Sunday in Advent; observed that he had not
							been yet able to prepare the discourse, upon the typical representation
							of Christ in the History of <persRef ref="noah">Noah</persRef>, and the
							Ark, which he must therefore postpone to next Sunday; and he now
							preached from Isaiah 55.12. “For ye shall go out with joy, and be led
							forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before
							you, into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their
							hands. 13. Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead
							of the briar shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the Lord
							for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.” There
							was a beautiful Sermon in the text, if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hawley could have found it— <persRef ref="taylor-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> J. W. Taylor</persRef> dined and spent
							part of the Evening with me He told me of the manner in which 18 members
							of his own State of New-York voted against him on the Election of
							Speaker— Four of them had after arriving here promised to vote for him—
							Personal friends of long standing, men under strong obligations to him
								<persRef ref="degraff-john">De Graff</persRef>, <persRef

							him, in defiance of their Consciences and their promises, under the
							spell of party management— Some of these worthies are now deeply
							mortified, because they have not been stationed upon important
							Committees. Taylor spoke also much of the selection of a Candidate for
							the Vice-Presidency, and inclines in favour of <persRef
								ref="pleasants-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
								Pleasants</persRef>— The Pennsylvanians object to him, on account of

							was Governor of that State, and in which he denied the power of Congress
							to make internal improvements, and protect manufactures.</p>

								Graham</persRef> came to enquire if I had made a decision upon his
							claim for a per Centage, on the Settlement of Indian Office Accounts—
							But I had for some time mislaid the papers, and since finding them have
							not had the opportunity of consulting with <persRef key="rush-richard"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> upon it— I told
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham that the principal difficulty
							consisted in his having stated to <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford</persRef> when the
							allowance was made by his Order to the Agents, that he, Graham should
							not claim it— He said it was done, to facilitate the allowance to the
							Agents for their extra Services— But that since that time, and at the
							last Session of Congress, an Act had passed allowing to the third
							Auditor, 500 dollars a year for extra Services imposed upon him by a
							former act and the Executive had a discretionary power to allow
							compensation for extra-services ordered by itself— If he should be
							allowed 500 dollars a year for these services it would amount to about
							the same as the 2 1/2 per Cent, which he claimed— <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pearce</persRef>
							of Rhode Island came with <persRef ref="obrien-jeremiah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> O’Brien</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="butman-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Butman</persRef>,
							members of the House from Maine— They spoke of the North-eastern
							Boundary question, and of <persRef ref="lincoln-enoch">Governor Enoch
								Lincoln’s</persRef> Rhodomontades about the State’s maintaining her
							own rights by War; and refusing to be bound by the Stipulations of the
							Treaty: which I thought a very awkward imitation of <persRef
								ref="troup-george">Governor Troup</persRef> of Georgia— The
							difference was that Troup knew he could bluster, and talk big with
							safety— He well knew that the only adverse party to him was the Creek
							Indians, and that he would certainly obtain his end against them—and
							probably the sooner, the more insolent and insulting his language and
							conduct should be towards the Government of the United States. But the
							adverse party to Governor Lincoln’s pretensions was Great-Britain— The
							Treaty that he was for trampling under foot, was of unquestioned
							obligation upon the Union, and if Governor Lincoln should as he had
							threatened at his Militia Reviews, to go to War against it, he must like
							Don Quixot, sally forth alone, for neither the Union nor the people of
							his own State would sustain him. O’Brien said he had heard that <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> of Massachusetts
							disapproved of his brother’s impetuosity and wrong-headedness—which I
							well knew— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pearce’s <persRef
								ref="pearce-samuel">father</persRef>, died last week. <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>
							called, and took the draft of his Address to the Public— I advised him
							to change entirely the concluding paragraph; which presented the idea,
							of his retiring from public life, and being sacrificed as a victim to
							calumny— He asked if my objection was that it had an appearance of
							despondency. I said yes—but that was not all—I thought it highly
							probable that the base and profligate combination against him and me,
							would succeed in their main object of bringing in <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> at the next
							Presidential Election— And that one of their principal means of success
							will be this infamous Slander, which he had already more than once
							branded with falsehood and upon which he would again stamp the lie, by
							this address and its appendix. The conspiracy would nevertheless in all
							probability succeed— When suspicion has been kindled into popular
							delusion, truth, and reason, and justice spoke as to the ears of an
							Adder—the sacrifice must be consummated, before they can be heard—
							General Jackson will therefore be elected— But it is impossible that his
							Administration should give satisfaction to the people of this Union— He
							is <pb type="ms" n="370"/>incompetent both by his ignorance, and by the
							fury of his Passions— He will be surrounded and governed by incompetent
							men, whose ascendency over him will be secured by their servility, and
							who will bring to the Government of the Nation, nothing but their talent
							for intrigue. Discordant in the materials of their
							composition—rancorously hostile to each other, and all more skilled to
							pack the cards than to play the game, there will be no principle of
							cohesion among them, they will crumble to pieces, and the Administration
							will go to wreck and ruin. Then too will come the recoil of Public
							opinion in favour of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and it will be
							irresistible. If human nature has not changed its character; Kentuckey
							and the Union will then do Justice to him and to his Slanderers— In the
							Event of General Jackson’s election, he would of course, retire. (he
							said he should resign, and not give the General the opportunity to
							remove him—) He would return to his home in Kentuckey and there wait the
							course of Events— But I thought it would be better not to allude to it,
							in this publication, and particularly not to countenance the idea of his
							intending it, as a final retirement— He said this reaction of public
							opinion he thought very probable, but that it would be so long in coming
							that it might go beyond his term of active life— I said it might be very
							sudden and rapid— And reminded him of the instantaneous effect in favour
							of <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt Clinton</persRef>, of the
							removal of him by the Legislature as a Canal Commissioner— I concluded
							however by remarking that I had only made this suggestion relating to
							the closing paragraph of his address, and he said it had already
							occurred to him, that it might be liable to such an objection— <persRef
								ref="vail-aaron">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vail</persRef> came

							and he afterwards sent me the record of the proceedings of the same

							the Court, who were much gratified with it, and regretted that it had

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard papers that he had sent me
							yesterday from <persRef ref="biddle-james">Commodore Biddle</persRef>—
							Among which was a private Letter from Rio de Janeiro dated    October,
							referring to one of a previous date, in which he had expressed his
							expectation, that the decisions of the Brazilian Courts on cases of
							Blockade would be more favourable towards vessels and property of the
							United States than of Great-Britain. He now encloses documents to shew
							that they did proceed on that principle, till frightened out of it by
							the British Government— And he encloses an extract from an opinion given
							by the King’s Advocate, in a Letter to the late <persRef
								ref="canning-george">Secretary Canning</persRef>, to whom as the Law
							Officer of the Crown, the <pb type="ms" n="372"/>case had been referred,
							and who pronounces without argument, that this is an injury to
							Great-Britain, which ought to be resented— Cannon Law is the Law of
							Great-Britain towards other Nations. The principles which the Courts of
							Brazil intended to pursue were just— They were to apply to each Nation
							her own rules of Blockade— Those of the United States being favourable
							to neutral rights, were entitled to the benefit of them, from the
							Brazilian tribunals— Those of Great Britain, leaning only to the
							Belligerent pretensions, she could fairly claim only the same measure
							which she metes out to others— But these are not her maxims—
							Belligerent, she tramples upon neutral rights— Neutral she maintains
							them at the Cannon’s Mouth—and the Brazilian Courts have been awed into
							submission. Captain Biddle obtained confidentially from a British
							Officer, this extract from the opinion of the King’s advocate, and sends
							it enclosed in a private Letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Lowrie</persRef>, the Secretary of the Senate, brought a Resolution,

							two hours before the Committee, in arguing to them that the Treaty with
							Spain of 1795. had settled the line, and that the Journal of the Spanish
							and American Commissioners under that Treaty had fixed it so that there
							could be no departure from it. But that now, in a Message to the

							Proclamation of <persRef ref="george-iii">George the third</persRef> of
							1763. and to the Commission of <persRef ref="wright-james">Governor

								>Hackley</persRef>—of the two Generals <persRef

								<persRef ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef>— I have received

							Myers, and then to bring charges against him before the Senate, for the
							pleasure of inducing that body to reject my nomination. But as no charge
							has been made known to me, I have sent in the name of Myers; and the
							Senate will act upon it as they think proper— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Seymour mentioned to me that his Colleague <persRef

							the only reason of his not having called here— I had enquired how he was
							of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seymour at the Drawing room the
							evening before last— Seymour says that the late Governor of Vermont
								<persRef ref="vanness-cornelius">C. P. Van Ness</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="bradley-william2">W. A Bradley</persRef>, the late
							Member of Congress, are indefatigable in their exertions, to raise a

							Commissioner and Agent under the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.
							</hi>Article of the Treaty of Ghent <pb type="ms" n="374"/>which was
							rather harshly reduced by an Act of Congress, which I regretted and

								Motte</persRef> has taken his departure, and there was no public

							and my father is the husbandman. 2. Every branch in me that beareth not
							fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth
							it, that it may bring forth more fruit— 3. Now ye are clean through the
							word which I have spoken unto you. 4. Abide in me, and I in you. As the
							branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine: no more
							can ye, except ye abide in me. 5. I am the vine, ye are the branches: he
							that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit:
							for without me, ye can do nothing. 6. If a man abide not in me, he is
							cast forth as a branch and is withered; and men gather them and cast
							them into the fire, and they are burned.” The discourse was read as a
							Lecture upon this parable of the vine— In the afternoon of S<hi
								rend="superscript">t</hi> John’s Church, prayers were read for the
							fourth Sunday in Advent, and the Sermon was from Malachi 4.2 “The Sun of
							righteousness shall arise, with healing in his wings.” A Dissertation

								White</persRef> the Delegate from Florida, brought me a Letter from

							the judge himself; in vindication of his character against the charges
							of the <persRef ref="wright-benjamin2">District Attorney</persRef>, for
							the Western District of Florida— I had received a memorial from this
							Officer, signed also by three other members of the Bar at Pensacola
							complaining of the judge, as having been repeatedly absent from
							Pensacola, at times when his Courts should have been held, and
							particularly in this last month of November. The judge is at
							Philadelphia, and answers the charges with much irritation— He assigns
							as the reason for his absence last year that he went to Philadelphia to
							be married, and this year, <persRef ref="brackenridge-caroline">his
								wife’s</persRef> illness and his own, the yellow fever at Pensacola,
							and the death of the <persRef ref="seebree-william">Marshal</persRef>,
							without whom he argues that a Court could not be held— He complains of
							the malice of the District Attorney Wright, and requests for his
							removal. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> White’s Letter is entirely
							favourable to the Judge; and he spoke very unfavourably of the members
							of the Bar who signed the Memorial of complaint— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> White that my own opinion of judge
							Brackenridge had been favourable, and my disposition to him friendly—
							That I was glad he had given these explanations, which would relieve me
							from all hesitation with regard to renominating him—his Commission being

							did not propose to make any nomination to that office for the present.
							They spoke also of the objections to the nomination of <persRef
								ref="rogerson-asa">Asa Rogerson</persRef> as Collector at Camden, on
							account of his character— He is represented as a gambler, and
							Slave-dealer— I told them that when objections were made to men for

							sustained by responsable names, and that the party charged should have
							the opportunity of self defence— Bryan said he thought the charges <pb

						<p><date>25. IV:30.—</date> Christmas day— Round Capitol Square.</p>
						<p>The day was entirely without interruption of visitors— Part of the family
							attended the service at the Roman Catholic Church— I re-examined the
							memorial and Documents of <persRef ref="tharp-william">William
								Tharp</persRef> of Missouri who from 1806 to 1813 was a Suttler in
							the Army, and on the Settlement of his Accounts in 1814 claimed
							considerable sums for Articles furnished to Soldiers, since dead or
							deserted— These items were then disallowed, because the rules of the
							accounting offices then required that Letters of Administration upon the
							Estates of deceased Soldiers, should be produced, to warrant payments
							from the Treasury to their Creditors— And payments for deserters could
							be made only on proof produced of their debts— Since that time,
							according to the present army regulations, these charges of Suttlers
							against dead or deserted Soldiers, are allowed without requiring Letters
							of Administration to be produced, but in their stead a certificate from
							a board of Officers of the validity and equity of the charges— But as
							Tharp could neither produce this substituted evidence, nor have the
							benefit of regulations made since he was in the service, he obtained the
							allowance of part of his claims by taking out Letters of Administration,
							and on the 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of May 1826. an Act of
							Congress passed for his relief, authorising and requiring the accounting
							Officers to make him the same equitable allowances as are made by the
							existing army regulations— The accounting Officers themselves judging of
							the validity and equity of the claims in lieu of the certificates of the
							board of officers, and limiting the payments to be made, not to exceed
							on account of each soldier the amount of the sum due from the public for
							pay to him— Under this Act Tharp has obtained large further allowances,
							but has yet claims unadmitted by the Accounting Officers— At the last
							Session of Congress he petitioned for an explanatory Act— Neither House
							acted definitively upon his Petition— In the Senate it was referred
							successively to the Military and the Judiciary Committee, and Tharp has
							made an Affidavit that <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren</persRef> the Chairman of
							the Judiciary Committee told him the case was plain, that no Act of
							Congress was necessary, but that it was my duty to order the accounting
							Officers to admit his claims— His papers are so voluminous that it has
							taken me many hours of several days to read them, which I have not yet
							entirely accomplished— I first referred his memorial to the third
							Auditor <persRef ref="hagner-peter">Peter Hagner</persRef>, who reported
							upon it. But Tharps manner of writing is so confused, and his Memorials,
							Petitions and Letters mingle up with his claims such masses of mere
							vituperation upon the Accounting Officers, and so much balderdash of
							abuse upon the Government, constructive Powers, and State rights, that I
							have not even yet been able to discern the precise points at issue
							between him and the accounting Officers and upon which he appeals to my
							decision— I received a Letter from him on Saturday, pressing for this
							decision, and saying that <persRef ref="knapp-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> S. L. Knapp</persRef> would that day
							call upon me, to give explanations for him. But M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Knapp <pb type="ms" n="378"/>did not come. I read also a
							multitude of recommendations of <persRef ref="baird-george">George
								Baird</persRef>, for the appointment of Postmaster at Washington
							Pennsylvania.— Prepared in part a Message of Nominations to the Senate—
							Dined with all the family at <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi

							and brother to the late <persRef ref="perry-oliver">Commodore

							promised to do the same— <persRef ref="ingersoll-ralph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingersoll</persRef> came to recommend

							as District Attorney for the Southern District of New-York. I had
							yesterday received a Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards

							Ingersoll, that although I had heard much of <persRef
								ref="tillotson-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tillotson</persRef> the present Incumbent’s intention to decline a
							reappointment; yet no intention of it had been received from himself— I
							should therefore in a day or two nominate him to the Senate— But if he
							should decline, I had already received a recommendation signed by 23
							members of the New-York delegation, in favour of <persRef
								ref="duer-john">John Duer</persRef>, and although very favourably
							disposed towards M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards, I thought it

								<persRef ref="fitch-t">T. Fitch</persRef> at Batavia, New-York,
							complaining in behalf of the Seneca Indians, that one of their tribe
							named <persRef ref="jemison-jacob">Jemison</persRef>, has lately without authority,

							Bay— The Letter says that <persRef ref="redjacket">Red Jacket</persRef>,
							and others of the Chiefs protest against this contract, and are coming
							on here to remonstrate against its confirmation— Tracy spoke also of the
							New-York elections, and said it was understood that <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">Governor Clinton</persRef> would not be a
							Candidate for re-election— That he certainly could not be chosen, for
							there would be at least thirty thousand votes against him, for his
							masonry. The excitement on that subject pervades all the Western part of
							the State of New-York, and will influence all their elections for
							sometime— He says that <persRef ref="marcy-william">Marcy</persRef>, now
							Comptroller of the State will be the Jackson Candidate, at the next
							Election for Governor— That neither <persRef ref="rochester-william"
								>Rochester</persRef>, nor <persRef ref="sanford-nathan"

								ref="tracy-albert">Albert Tracy</persRef> would probably have been

							prevented me from having the message ready till after the Senate had
							adjourned. <persRef ref="wood-silas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wood</persRef> of New-York, brought me a Letter to him from <persRef
								ref="edwards-ogden">Ogden Edwards</persRef>, asking his influence to
							obtain for him the appointment of U.S. District Attorney in that City—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood said that he had signed a

									>r</hi> Duer</persRef> at the request of <persRef
								ref="vanrensselaer-stephen">General Van Rensselaer</persRef>; but

							respecting the appointment of a Navy Agent at Lima. He himself inclined
							in favour of <persRef ref="radcliff-william">William Radcliff</persRef>
							who has already the Office of Consul there— I left the determination to
							him, but acknowledged by own propensity in favour of <persRef
								ref="armstrong-andrew">Andrew Armstrong</persRef>, heretofore
							commercial Agent at Port au Prince—recalled thence because the tawny
							government of Hayti would no longer recognize him inasmuch as we
							declined to recognize them— He has also the merit of contributing to the
							support of a widowed <persRef ref="u">mother</persRef>, and that of
							being modest and respectful in his applications for employment. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard also requested me to nominate
								<persRef ref="brooks-james">James G. Brooks</persRef>, as a Purser
							in the Navy— The list of nominations from the Navy Department is not yet

							that from indications in the Committee of foreign Relations, of which he
							is a member, he concluded there would be opposition to the Conventions
							with Great-Britain, concerning the Northeastern, and Northwestern

							intended to send the name of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pringle to
							the Senate for re-appointment at their next meeting, and I had a
							conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush on the Subject—
							Pringle is devoted to the opposition, and so is Drayton, though with

								ref="condy-jeremiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jeremiah
								Condy</persRef>, from whom I receive the Charleston Newspapers, and
							scraps of Letters every day, and <persRef ref="geddes-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> John Geddes</persRef> once Governor of
							South-Carolina, have each written me a Letter, asking this Office for
							himself— And yesterday I received a Letter from <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">W. H. Crawford</persRef>, recommending
							Geddes in a manner peculiar to himself—that is in language of rudeness,
							self complacency, and monitorial advice— My system has been and
							continues to nominate for re-appointment all officers for a term of
							years, whose Commissions expire, unless official or moral misconduct is
							charged and substantiated against them. This does not suit the Falstaff
							friends who “follow for the reward”—and I am importuned to serve my
							friends, and reproached for neglecting them, because I will not dismiss
							or drop from executive offices, able and faithful political opponents,
							to provide for my own partizans— Crawford informs me that he considers
							his health as entirely restored; as <persRef ref="martin-luther">Luther
								Martin</persRef> shortly before he died, when in a state little
							above absolute fatuity, told me that he had some months before been so
							exceedingly out of health that some of his friends for a time had
							thought his understanding was impaired. There has been some talk here
							among the friends of the Administration, of running M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawford as their Candidate for the
							Vice-Presidency; and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush thought that
							this Letter, was intended as an advance towards reconciliation—
							Treachery of the deepest dye is at the bottom of Crawford’s character.
							It was before his palsy combined with strong mental powers little
							cultivated, and a desperate energy of Soul. The whole composition was
							more like one of <persRef ref="milton-john">Milton’s</persRef> fallen
							Angels, than that of any other man I ever knew—excepting that Milton has
							made his devils true to each other— Since his paralysis, Crawford has
							lost much of his memory, much of his judgment, and some of his Address—
							What he has lost of these he has gained in nervous irritability and
							morbid energy— He has been abandoned by all those of his friends who
							know his condition, but has been appointed a judge of the Supreme Court
							in Georgia, and those of his former partizans who are now friendly to
							the Administration, and who do not know his State have inclined to start
							him for the Vice-Presidency. I have given no countenance to the project
							and trust it will fail— <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis
								Williams</persRef> of North-Carolina has been the principal promoter
							of it, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush told me that Williams
							this day asked him whether Crawford had written Letters <pb type="ms"
								n="381"/>to him avowing himself against the Administration, and in
							favour of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>— Rush
							said he had; upon which, Williams said he would then give him up.
								<persRef ref="lee-richard3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richard

						<p><persRef ref="thomas-james2">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Thomas</persRef> came and held a long Talk with me upon New-York
							Politics. His principal object was to recommend <persRef ref="duer-john"
								>John Duer</persRef> for the appointment of District Attorney, for
							the Southern District of New-York. He referred to an Address delivered
							at a meeting in September 1814, by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Duer,
							to prove that he had been though a federalist, a supporter of the late
							War against Great Britain— He was very ardent in his commendations of
							Duer, and pronounced him beyond all question the most eloquent man in
							the State of New-York. Thomas is a great talker, and has no objection to
							bearing the whole expense of conversation— He spoke of <persRef
								ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt Clinton</persRef>, of <persRef
								key="clay-henry">H. Clay</persRef>, of <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
								>J. C. Calhoun</persRef>, and of some others, and told me many
							things they had said in conversations with him— He avows himself a
							friend to De Witt Clinton <unclear>quoad</unclear> the State of New-York; but he says he
							has been duped by the promise of the Vice-Presidency which he will not
							obtain, and that he is wretchedly poor, having ruined himself by his
							canvassing expenses in 1812— <persRef ref="brown-jacob">General
								Brown</persRef> called and mentioned a question of rank between
								<persRef ref="ketchum-daniel">Majors Ketchum</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="kearney-stephen">Kearney</persRef>, referred to him by the
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">Secretary of War</persRef>— It
							involves the long disputed and yet unsettled question between <persRef
								ref="scott-winfield">Generals Scott</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gaines-edmund">Gaines</persRef>— The board of Officers at the
							close of <persRef ref="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Monroe’s</persRef> administration had declined to decide this
							question, and General Brown had seemed to incline in favour of Gaines—
							My opinion had been with some diffidence otherwise, and General Brown
							now says, his decision, will be that in connection with a command, the
							oldest brevet must be preferred. He added that while he himself was in
							active service, neither Scott nor Gaines could have a command as Major
							General— They were both Brigadiers, and he had placed Gaines at his
							right hand and Scott at his left— This was the distinction he had taken,
							and conformably to it he should decide the question between Majors
							Ketchum and Kearney— The General said he had received my decisions on
							the Court Martial Sentences upon assistant <persRef ref="bryant-thomas"
								>Surgeon Bryant</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u">Lieutenant
								Hunter</persRef>, and was much pleased with the observations
							appended to them. The Prince of Musignano <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-charles">Carlo Luciano Bonaparte</persRef> came to
							pay a visit— He is going to embark with his family in the Delaware Ship
							of the Line, bound to the Mediterranean— The Prince was on his way to
							Norfolk; but I told him I thought the Ship had been ordered to
							Annapolis, and advised him to see the Secretary of the Navy. He thanked
							me for the opportunity given <pb type="ms" n="382"/>him of a passage in
							so safe a ship, and informed me that his uncle the <persRef
								ref="bonaparte-joseph">Count de Survilliers</persRef>, had come on
							with him as far as Baltimore, and would be here in a few days. <persRef
								ref="burges-tristam">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Burges</persRef>, a member of the House of Representatives from
							Rhode-Island apologised for not having paid his visit earlier. He has
							been unwell since his arrival in the City— And he has had the misfortune
							of losing within the last fifteen months <persRef
								ref="burges-cornelia;burges-mary;burges-abby" type="multi">his three

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Silsbee</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="crowninshield-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crowninshield</persRef> called together. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Silsbee had a Letter from the President of the U.S. Bank,
								<persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">N. Biddle</persRef>, urging the early
							appointment of Directors for the Government. I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Silsbee that I had the message of
							nomination sealed, and ready to go to the Senate, Monday Morning— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay came in while they were here. He had
							a copy of a Letter from the <persRef ref="nicholas-i">Emperor of
								Russia</persRef>, announcing the birth of a Grand-duke, on the 9 /
							21 September, and named <persRef ref="constantine2"
								>Constantine</persRef>— I agreed to give Audience to <persRef
								ref="krudener-paul">Baron Krudener</persRef> next Monday to receive
							this Letter— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said his Address and
							Documents would be published this day— He spoke of flattering accounts
							from North-Carolina through Richmond Virginia— He also read the answer
							he had prepared to a Letter from the Chairman of the Committee of
							Commerce of the Senate <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">Woodbury</persRef>,
							containing enquiries concerning the expediency of abolishing the
							discriminating duties— I suggested one or two slight modifications to
							the answer. A person unknown to me came and introduced to me a <persRef
								ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson</persRef> from
							Kentucky—likewise unknown— <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> had a Letter from the
							Collector at Key West, <persRef ref="pinckney-william2"
								>Pinkney</persRef> containing grave charges against <persRef
								ref="doane-isaiah">Captain Doane</persRef>, of the Revenue Cutter—
							Charges have also been received from Doane against Pinkney, we had some
							question how these charges should be investigated— Whether by another
							Collector, a District Attorney, or the Attorney General. But the first
							step to be taken is to furnish the parties with copies of the charges
							against them respectively, and to await their answers— I gave M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush the Certificate of the two Physicians
							at Philadelphia, concerning the state of <persRef ref="thomson-edward"
								>Edward Thompson’s</persRef> health, and the Letter from <persRef
								ref="randall-josiah">Josiah Randall</persRef> enclosing it— Thompson
							is to be released from close prison— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Southard called this Morning; and again in the Evening, when he read to
							me his discourse, to be delivered next Monday before the Columbian
							Institute— It is not quite finished— It is on the duty of the Government
							to protect and patronize Science—practical in purport, and cogent in
							reasoning— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary;adams-abigail2" type="multi">young
							Ladies</persRef>, dined at <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Fryes</persRef>— I received this day
							a remarkable Letter from <persRef ref="storer-bellamy">Bellamy
								Storer</persRef> in Ohio—indignant at the ratting of <persRef
								ref="hammond-charles">Charles Hammond</persRef>, a partizan of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s in that State— Storer suspects that
							Hammond acts in concert with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							himself, but I do not. Hammond only swims off from a sinking Ship, and
							is not scrupulous about the pretext— <persRef ref="tharp-william"
								>William Tharp</persRef> was also here this day. I told him that I
							could not interpose to controul the decisions of the accounting Officers
							of the Treasury on his claims— He asked me for a written declaration to
							that effect which I promised to give him if he would call on Monday.</p>

						<p>Heard at the Unitarian Church a young man named <persRef ref="u"
								>Kent</persRef> from 1. Corinthians 15.25. “For he must reign, till
							he hath put all enemies under his feet” The Sermon was upon the comfort,
							hope and consolation to be drawn from the certainty of the progressive
							prevalence and final universal spread of the Christian Religion— Its
							superiority to all others, and its adaptation to the wants and
							enjoyments of all Classes and conditions of human beings. It was
							remarkably well written—copious, argumentative, eloquent— The delivery
							was susceptible of improvement— In the afternoon at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t</hi> John’s I heard <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawley</persRef>
							read the Evening service for the first Sunday after Christmas, omitting
							the Psalms and the Lesson from the Old Testament— He preached from 1.
							Peter 3.21. “The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save
							us—by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.” The Sermon was an exposition of
							the typical character of <persRef ref="noah">Noah</persRef>, and the
							Ark, with reference to Christ and baptism <pb type="ms" n="383"/>a
							subject which I do not comprehend and which M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Hawley’s discourse did not make more clear— He abridged the
							service to attend a funeral— <persRef ref="roberdeau-mary">Miss Mary

								Southard</persRef>, and at two he commenced his anniversary
							Discourse to the Columbian Institute— He was about an hour in delivering
							it, and gave very general satisfaction— It was upon the obligation upon
							the Government of the United States to patronize Science— He maintained
							the cause with great zeal and ability—arguing it as a duty resulting
							from our situation among the Nations of the Earth, and recurring
							specially to the expressed opinions of <persRef ref="washington-george"
								>Washington</persRef>, <persRef ref="jefferson-thomas"
