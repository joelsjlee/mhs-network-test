						<p><persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef> called, having
							just returned from his visit to Virginia. We had some conversation upon
							several subjects in the business of the War Department, during his
							absence— The order from the Engineer Department of 17. August 1826.
							introducing several new, and highly important regulations, at the
							Military Academy at West Point, and which has given rise to several
							difficult questions, was adopted in my absence last Summer, and never
							even communicated to me. I have doubts of its legality on several
							points, besides that upon which the Officers appointed by the
							Superintendent for a Court of Enquiry refused to act— I learnt from
							Governor Barbour that the real object of the order was to limit the
							punishments to which the Cadets should be liable, exclusively to the
							penalties enumerated in the Order— And he said the order was issued at
							the solicitation of <persRef ref="thayer-sylvanus">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l</hi> Thayer</persRef> himself— One
							consequence of this has been that several of the Sentences of this Court
							Martial, must be disapproved as not included in the list of enumerated
							penalties, and thus the offenders will escape punishment altogether, or
							the sentences must be approved to the disregard of the order itself—
							Governor Barbour thought that such punishments as suspension from the
							Academy or from pay and emoluments, were objectionable in principle, as
							they took from the Cadet the benefit of education, for which he is
							there, and he thought degradation from rank might be inflicted by the
							Superintendent at his Discretion, it being the mere withdrawal of a
							distinction granted at his discretion— But the Articles of War give in
							many cases an indefinite and discretionary power to Courts Martial to
							inflict any punishment they think proper, and an Act of Congress
							declares that the Cadets shall be subject to the Articles of War— My
							question then is whether a mere Executive Order can prescribe to Courts
							Martial, a very small list of penalties, as the only ones to which they
							shall sentence Cadets, and thereby restrict the indefinite power given
							them by the Articles of War— Governor Barbour said he would submit the
							question to the <persRef ref="wirt-william">Attorney General</persRef>,
							for his opinion: and would suggest to Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							Thayer the propriety of a revisal of the order of 17. August 1826.

							on behalf of the Baltimore and Ohio Rail-road Company, to ascertain how
							far and upon what terms the assistance of the general Government can be
							obtained in furnishing detachments from the Topographical Engineers to
							make the necessary surveys of the route of the proposed road— They first
							wrote me a Letter, announcing their appointment and its object, and
							called upon me at one. I assured them of my earnest good wishes for the
							success of their undertaking, and of my disposition to give them every
							aid in the power of the Executive Government to bestow—referring them
							for particulars to the Secretary of War, who I informed them was now in
							the City, and with whom I advised them to confer. <persRef

							the member of Congress from Loudon County afterwards called on me:
							deeply anxious for the fate of his projected Chesapeake and Ohio Canal,

							though the two undertakings must interfere with each other— I
							congratulated Mercer upon his re-election to Congress: and he declared

							at the failure of <persRef ref="powell-alfred">M<hi rend="superscript"

							less than the corresponding Quarter of the last year. The falling off is
							less than he had recently anticipated, but promises a Million less for
							the Revenue of the whole year than we had estimated at the close of the
							last year— I spoke to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush of measures
							for obtaining information, political and commercial from the British
							Colonies, at the North of this Continent, and in the West-Indies— I had
							some days since spoken to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi

							but there is some difficulty in making the arrangement— <persRef

							weather which for the first fortnight of April had been nearly at Summer

								Little</persRef>, from 1. John. 2.15. “Love not the world, nor the
							things that are in the world.” The comment upon this text is more
							appropriate to other Sects of Christianity than to that which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Little sustains—enjoyment of the world, in
							the practice of virtue is congenial to the unitarian doctrine— Use the
							world as not abusing it, is the precept of that faith— After a visit
							from <persRef ref="wool-john">General Wool</persRef> just returned from
							attending a Court of Enquiry at Harper’s Ferry, I heard <persRef
								ref="campbell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Campbell</persRef> at <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker’s</persRef>— His text was from
							Revelation 2:16. “Repent or else I will come unto thee quickly.” M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Campbell, dwelt largely and earnestly upon
							the universal depravity of mankind— It is matter of curious speculation
							to me, how men of good understanding and reasoning faculties can be
							drilled into the sincere belief of these absurdities— The Scripture says
							that the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked—this
							is certainly true; and is a profound observation upon the human
							character. But the language is figurative—by the <hi rend="italic"
								>heart</hi>, is meant in this passage the selfish passions of man—
							But there is also in man a Spirit, and the inspiration of the almighty
							giveth him understanding— It is the duty of man to discover, and
							controul the vicious propensities, and deceits of his heart to controul
							them— This with the grace of God, a large portion of the human race in
							Christian Lands to a considerable extent do accomplish. It seems
							therefore to be worse than useless for preachers to declare that mankind
							are universally depraved. It takes from honest integrity all its
							honours—it degrades men in their own estimation— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Campbell read a hymn, which declared that <hi rend="italic"
								>we</hi> were more base and brutish than the beasts—a spiritual Song
							of <persRef ref="watts-isaac">Isaac Watts’</persRef>—what is the meaning
							of this?— If Watts had said this on a week day to any one of his
							parishioners, would he not have knocked him down? And how can that be
							taught as a solemn truth of religion, applicable to all mankind, which
							if said at any other time to any one individual would be punishable as

						<p>I had sent on Saturday to <persRef ref="elgar-joseph">M<hi

						<p>The early morning was mild, and I bathed in the Potowmac, as I had
							yesterday and Monday, with a view to bring out the inflammation with
							which I have been for weeks suffering internally—and I have apparently
							succeeded; but with a prospect of increased complaint for the
							approaching Summer— I had scarcely returned from the excursion of the

							and Rodgers who had before reported sickness in the Squadron, now

							the cultivation of them into this Country: and suggested the expediency

								<persRef ref="hitchcock-ethan">Captain Hitchcock</persRef> came to

								>d.</hi> Article of War vesting in the President alone the power of
							ordering Courts of Enquiry, unless demanded by the accused— The Attorney
							General and the Secretary of War thought that constructively the order
							from the War Department was an order from the President, and that an
							order by a <pb type="ms" n="192"/>general regulation was equivalent to a
							special order in each separate case— He said that notwithstanding this
							opinion of the Secretary of War and Attorney General, the Court
							persisted in the opinion that they were not legally convened, and still
							declined proceeding: in consequence of which they had first been put
							under arrest and then ordered to join their regiments— He said he was
							desirous the question might be fully considered, that others might avoid
							the same inconvenience, and that of all the Officers at the Point there
							was only one who doubted the illegality of the order— I told him that I
							had the subject under deliberate consideration— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Mills</persRef> is a Sister of a
							wretched man named <persRef ref="devaughn-jonathan">De Vaughn</persRef>
							under Sentence of Death at Alexandria, for an atrocious murder— She came
							in a state of extreme agitation and distress, to solicit a commutation
							of his punishment— Her tears and sobs and supplications deeply affected
							me— Her Story told in untutored language was itself moving— I scarcely
							dare think of it— I was immeasurably tempted to say something to her
							which would have given her a hope that he might be pardoned—yet I felt
							that I ought not— There is nothing to palliate the crime; and almost
							every thing to excite sympathy for his suffering— She says he is 78
							years of age—one of a family of ten brothers and Sisters; all in
							respectable Stations of life—almost all with families of children— He
							himself has an estimable wife and many children— More than a hundred
							persons, relatives as brothers Sisters and their descendants will suffer
							torture by his Execution— One Sister has taken to her bed and she is
							sure will die— She herself since his sentence has not had day or night a
							moment’s peace of mind— His head is white as Snow— Heavy with age— It is
							but a short time that could be given him—and must he die—must he be
							hung?— All this and more I heard, and while it wrung my heart, I
							resisted every impulse to comfort her with hope— I listened kindly to
							all she had to say, and told her, that my duty was of the most painful
							kind— That I felt deeply for her distress and that of her relatives; but
							that I could not talk with her on the matter of which she spoke. That it
							would have been extremely grateful to me, if I could have afforded her
							relief, but it was not in my power— <persRef ref="lee-william">M<hi

							Alexandria from John 3.16. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his

							but have everlasting life”— This person’s manner is pleasing to me,
							because there is great sincerity in its vehemence— He entangled himself
							in some doctrine of the peculiar mode of filiation of Jesus Christ— It
							seemed as if he was anxious to extricate the creed of the Trinity, from
							one of its most flagrant absurdities, as it shews itself to human
							reason— His argument was that Christ was God— That he was also the Son
							of God— But not as God— His filiation or Sonship was confined to his
							incarnate state— But the idea to be annexed to the terms father and Son,
							as applied to God, he attempted not, nor will any Trinitarian ever
							attempt to define— I thought the discourse was chiefly preached for my
							special benefit, but it was wheat sown by the way side. The divinity of
							Christ was mentioned as indispensable to sustain the atonement, and
							without the atonement there was no way of Salvation— I had already often
							heard this before; and lately in private conference with M<hi

							severity— If wishing could end it, my complaints would soon be relieved,
							but I must await my allotted time— My own Career is closed— My hopes
							such as are left me, are centered upon my children. George’s state is
							precarious; and his prospects are doubtful— My capacity to write, fails

						<p>Instead of my usual four miles walk before breakfast, I made this morning
							a tour of the garden, and had some conversation with the gardener, an
							Irishman by the name of <persRef ref="ousley-john">Ouseley</persRef>— I
							found in the garden a great number of plants, herbs, flowers, and weeds
							to the names of which I was a stranger. Some of them were unknown to
							him— There are of Fruit trees in the garden, one red mulberry, Several
							Peaches; more plumbs; a few cherries and three or four Hazel nut shrubs—
							Of flowering trees one Tulip, now in bloom, a large Weeping willow; one
							Ash, and one Florida Cornus dogwood— An Althea, and a White-thorn hedge—
							Many flowering Plants—and culinary vegetables—Potatoes, Carrots, Beets,
							Radishes, Cabbages, Cauliflower, Lettuces, Peas, Beans, Jerusalem
							Artichokes, Onions, Garlick, Shives, and Asparagus— There are other
							Roots and fruits which escaped my notice; and two sorts of Strawberries,
							the creeping Scarlet and the towering hautboy— I noticed two or three
							shoots of peach trees, this years growth, from buds which he told me he
							had inoculated last July upon Plumb-stock Suckers— The Plumb trees he
							said had never born, though they now present a fair shew of fruit— The
							old Peach trees looked sickly, and on examining near the ground one of
							them we found under the bark two of the destructive white worms—the
							Algeria exitiosa— After returning to the House, I took out the first
							Volume of <persRef ref="duhamel-henri">Du Hamel du Monceau’s</persRef>
							Physique des Arbres, and read a few pages of its Preface, and thought if
							I had made these Observations, and applied to this reading forty years

								ref="henderson-archibald">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Henderson</persRef> and <persRef ref="hall-joseph3">Lieutenant
								Hall</persRef>— He thought there was no sufficient ground for
							further proceedings against Henderson, and that he would order him to
							duty— With regard to Hall, he said it would be necessary that he should
							make a report in writing— <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> spoke of an agreement
							which he had drawn up for employing <persRef ref="sparks-jared">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Jared Sparks</persRef> to prepare for
							publication the Correspondence of the Old Congress during the
							Revolutionary War, according to a Resolution of Congress of 27. March
							1818—which has not yet been carried into execution— I approved of the
							terms proposed, and to which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sparks is
							prepared to assent. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay mentioned a
							Letter that he had received from <persRef ref="hardin-benjamin">B.
								Hardin</persRef>, formerly a member of Congress from Kentuckey, and
							now a Candidate for the Senate of the State— <persRef
								ref="jones-roger">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.
								</hi>Jones</persRef> the adjutant General came and explained to me
							the necessity of issuing a new rule in place of the army regulation N.
							1124— The rule is that a brevet Officer shall receive the pay of his
							brevet rank, only when he has a command equal to that rank— The rule
							proceeds to define a Captains Command to be a Company—A Major’s and
							Lieutenant Colonel’s, a Battalion—a Colonel’s a Regiment a Brigadier
							General’s a Brigade, and a Major General’s a division. Now the
							accounting Officers consider a Battalion, to mean half a Regiment, or
							five Companies— But Captains, who are Majors by Brevet, having command
							of two Companies, think themselves entitled to the pay and emoluments of
							Majors, as much as if their command was of five Companies; and Jones
							says there is no definition of the term Battalion, requiring that it
							should be of five Companies, or even of half a regiment; some regiments
							consisting of three Battalions and some of nine Companies— I took the
							matter for further Consideration— <persRef ref="thornton-w">Major
								Thornton</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">Major Hunter</persRef>, and
							another Militia Officer from Alexandria, came as a Committee from the
							Officers of that Brigade of the District Militia, to protest against the
							appointment of <persRef ref="smith-walter">General Walter
								Smith</persRef> as Major General— Smith was Brigadier General of
							Washington County Brigade; and <persRef ref="jones-walter">Walter
								Jones</persRef> of that of Alexandria— They left with me a written
							remonstrance against Smith, whom they charge with having abdicated his
							brigadier’s command for at least ten years after the peace and they
							claim the appointment of Jones as Major General, for more faithful
							service, and even prior Commission— They stated that Jones had resigned
							his Commission as a Brigadier, since Smith’s appointment as
							Major-General— We had company to dine. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>I Swam in the river this morning about ten minutes, and then spent an

							brought me a Letter from <persRef ref="kilbourn-james">James
								Kilbourn</persRef> of the State of Ohio, complaining of the
							determination to remove the land Office from Delaware to Tiffin—he now
							proposes that it should be fixed at Bucyrus— I advised M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham to write to <persRef
								ref="bartley-mordecai">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bartley</persRef> the member from Ohio, at whose instance, the
							location was made at Tiffin—to inform him of the substance of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Kilbourn’s observations, and to wait for
							his answer before coming to a final decision: He had also a Letter from
								<persRef ref="kilbourn-john">John Kilbourn</persRef>, concerning <pb
								type="ms" n="198"/>a grant of Land, made by an Act of Congress at
							their last Session. (3. March 1827. Ch. 93) to the State of Ohio, for
							the purpose of making a road from Columbus to Sandusky— Kilbourn is one
							of the Trustees appointed by the Legislature of the State to make the
							road, and makes a question whether the grant was to the State or to the
							Trustees— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham the grant was to
							the State, the Trustees not being ever mentioned in the Law— There was
							another question upon the construction of the Act, the present decision
							upon which became unnecessary— <persRef ref="furst-moritz">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Fürst</persRef> the Medalist came to
							renew the solicitation of Patronage, and employment— He complained that

							of my inauguration— Of this there are two causes— The medals are not
							remarkably well executed, and there is little taste for collecting and
							preserving medals in this Country— I told him there was no vacant
							employment that I could give him, and he said, he must then break up his
							establishment— <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef>
							came and took <persRef ref="randolph-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> T— M— Randolph’s</persRef> Letter, announcing the

							State and Florida. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Randolph is to be
							recalled, and directed to ascertain the cause of the suspension of the
							work, by the Governor of Georgia. Governor Barbour mentioned also an
							Application by <persRef ref="force-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Force</persRef>, publisher of the National Journal, for a copy of
							the order given by <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson</persRef> in January 1815. for the execution of six
							Militia-men as mutineers. This is one of the charges urged against him
							in the electioneering campaign— Some time since a Meeting of General
							Jackson’s friends at Nashville, appointed a standing Committee to defend
							his character and reputation against Slander— They have published a
							vindication of his conduct on this occasion, signed <persRef
								ref="overton-john">John Overton</persRef>, chairman of the Jackson
							Committee— They have given a copy of the order for the trial of the
							Militiamen, some extracts from the proceedings of the Court-Martial,
							certified by <persRef ref="donelson-andrew">Andrew J Donelson</persRef>,
							and an Affidavit Certificate of <persRef ref="pipkin-philip">Philip
								Pipkin</persRef>, Colonel of the Regiment to which the mutineers
							belonged— They were shot for mutiny by sentence of a Court Martial; and
							the Committee and Colonel Pipkin, urge that General Jackson had nothing
							to do in the affair but to order the Court Martial— The order from
							General Jackson, confirming the sentence of the Court, is at the War
							Department, and Force applies for a copy of it for publication in the
							Journal— I observed to Governor Barbour, that to furnish this document
							at the application of a Printer, would be perhaps a departure from the
							general rule of the Departments and would be considered as a measure of
							hostility to General Jackson— I thought it should therefore be declined—
								<persRef ref="lee-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lee</persRef> read me an extract of a Letter from <persRef
								ref="blake-g2">G. Blake</persRef> at Philadelphia, mentioning that
								<persRef ref="mills-elijah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mills</persRef> was decidedly convalescent— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard came with <persRef ref="chauncey-isaac">Commodore
								Chauncey</persRef>, and a plan of the Navy-Yard at Brooklyn,
							opposite to New-York, shewing the portion of the land, the title of
							which is now contested, by the Town of Brooklyn, and by several
							individuals, it is covered with water, and when purchased by the United
							States was a Mill pond— The claimants own land bordering on the pond,
							and affirm that the right of overflowing it was conditional, to the
							grinding of corn for the People of Brooklyn, at the Mill— The United
							States have had possession of upwards of twenty years which it is said
							gives in New-York a prescriptive title— And there is also an absolute
							Deed, from Commissioners of New-York— <persRef ref="southard-samuel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> mentioned
							also another question of title, to another part of the land— The Deed
							being to the Commissioners of Navy Hospitals, and not to the United

						<p><date>20. V:5</date> Cloudy.</p>
						<p>Heard this morning <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Little</persRef> from 1. Corinthians 6:11 “And such were
							some of you: but ye are washed but ye are sanctified, but ye are
							justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.”
							He assumed this text as one of those upon which the Calvinistic doctrine
							of regeneration, and election are supported— He gave what he considered
							to be the true meaning of the text— It was reformation of life in the
							Corinthians and other Christians to whom the Epistle was addressed, from
							gross moral vices, by their conversion to Christianity, which was all
							that he understood by the name of the Lord Jesus, and the Spirit of our
							God— I believe however there is an allusion to the rite of baptism which
							they had received, and <pb type="ms" n="199"/>which he did not notice.
							He then canvassed the Calvinistic dogma of regeneration, with much
							severity, and sarcastic humour, glancing also at the Armenian creed,
							which he considered as not less absurd— He reprobated altogether the
							idea of the total depravity of the human heart, as equally unjust and
							dishonourable to human nature, tending to reduce the good and evil to
							one common level, and to rob virtue of her due reward the acknowledgment
							of her existence— It is indeed an easy task for a controversialist of
							one Christian Sect to expose the absurdities of another— In the
							afternoon I heard at <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Baker’s</persRef>, the Methodist Minister, now stationed
							at the Foundery Church, <persRef ref="u">Davis</persRef>: and his text
							was the last clause of 2. Corinthians 6.2. “Behold now is the day of
							Salvation”— He began by asserting that very total depravity of man,
							which the morning Sermon had so earnestly denied—and quoted a good
							saying of some Saint that this world was God’s rebellious Province;
							which I do not suppose it is more than any other of the Planets— He
							alluded to the Sermon preached in the same pulpit last Sunday afternoon,
							and intimated a connection of purpose with it— Both were intentionally
							pathetic appeals to unconverted sinners to turn from the error of their
							ways, now—on the very day of Salvation— In the evening at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church I heard <persRef
									ref="johns-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry Van Dyke
								Johns</persRef>, from Psalm 39.5. [“]Behold thou hast made my days
							as an hairbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every

								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef> for the next

							having interfered with the Legislature of Vermont against his election
							as Senator— This was utterly without foundation; and his evidence is so
							remote from proof that he mixes about four parts of his own suspicions,
							with one part of fact to sustain his charge— Being himself a deep
							intriguer, and knowing the power of trifles light as air to the jealous,
							he made an argument of several columns to prove my interference against
							him, because just before the election, <persRef ref="buck-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r </hi> Buck</persRef>, a member of the House
							of Representatives of Vermont, received a Letter from <persRef

							and in a Postscript to the same Letter, mentioned that I was to leave
							Boston that day for Washington— This Letter was shewn by Buck to several
							members of the Legislature, and Van Ness says changed the votes of a
							number sufficient to defeat his election, which it very probably did—
							And so he to revenge himself charges it upon me, as a personal
							interference against him— Bailey published an answer, denying that he
							had ever had any conversation with me concerning that Senatorial
							election in Vermont, when he wrote his Letter to Buck; and otherwise
							chastising Van Ness, to which he has replied by a publication of eight
							Newspaper Columns which I have not seen— Another of Van Ness’s
							imputations is because M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Slade was last
							Summer employed to carry to Vermont, and other Eastern States the Laws
							of the preceding Session of Congress— Slade was in the State shortly
							before the Election, and perhaps freely expressed his opinions about Van
							Ness and in favour of Seymour— Slade is a Clerk in the Department of
							State; and was sent by <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef>— Therefore I, who was at Quincy and knew
							nothing of this arrangement, interfered in this Election— So reasons C.
							P. Van Ness. Slade also answered Van Ness, utterly denying his
							imputations and almost all his statements of fact— To him also Van Ness
							has replied; and Slade intends to rejoin— Van Ness makes me his object
							of attack, to give himself importance, and finding all his chances
							desperate under my standard, recommends himself to the adversary by a

							not yet received the expected written communication from <persRef
								ref="rebello-silvestre">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rebello</persRef>. There are three questions relative to the
							re-establishment of our mission to Rio de Janeyro. First whether any
							person shall be sent— Second—whether a Chargé d’Affaires, or a Minister
							Plenipotentiary— and third, at what time— There was much desultory
							discussion, and a final conclusion to defer the further consideration of
							the subject till M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rebello’s note shall
							have been received. If with a view to the negotiation of a Treaty of
							Commerce a Minister Plenipotentiary should be sent that measure must be
							postponed until the Meeting of Congress—and it is to be weighed whether
							a renewal of the mission should be made, without a previous assurance
							from the Brazilian Government that reparation shall be made for the
							seizure of the Spark—and whether that case shall be discriminated from
							other causes of complaint, or a pledge required for satisfaction upon
							them all— There was some allusion to the proceedings of this Government
							and the British in the affair of the Chesapeake and of the Leopard; and
							also to the transactions with the Russian Government in the case of the
							Pearl— The adjustment of differences of this description between Nations
							is a matter of great delicacy, and in the progress of which a single
							false step leads to disastrous and humiliating consequences— The Second
							subject of deliberation to the Cabinet, was a Letter of Instructions, to
								<persRef ref="brown-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Brown</persRef>, our Minister at Paris, concerning the claims of
							indemnity of many Citizens of the United States upon the French
							Government; for wrongs and spoliations committed during the
							revolutionary Wars. The complaints are of long standing, and for
							injuries to a very large amount— The french Government have refused to
							discuss them, unless in connection with a claim which they have raised
							of special favours to French Navigation in Louisiana, under the Treaty
							of Cession— This claim rests upon a Construction of the eighth Article
							of the Treaty which we have rejected as inadmissible— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s Letter of Instruction now directed
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown to renew the demand of
							indemnity for the claims of our Citizens; and to offer to refer the
							question upon the Construction of the Louisiana Treaty to the
							arbitration of a friendly Sovereign, or of a Commission of foreigners to
							be agreed upon between the two Governments—and if the French Government
							should agree to refer the Louisiana question upon condition that the
							claims should also be referred to the same arbitration, M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown was instructed to agree to it. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush objected to this reference of the
							claims as did <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor Barbour</persRef>, I
							thought with good reason. I suggested that the claimants themselves
							might make it a ground of future claim against this Government— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay thought the prospects of the
							Claimants would be improved by submission to an arbitration, but agreed
							to modify his Letter of instruction to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brown, so that the proposal of arbitration should be confined to the
							question upon the Louisiana Convention. I have little confidence in
							anything that we can now do for the attainment of indemnity for these
							claims, and believe that the only benefit to be expected from this
							instruction will be to shew that they are not abandoned by the
							Government, and to serve as the foundation of a Report concerning them
							to Congress at the next Session— I read a few pages of <persRef
								ref="duhamel-henri">Du Hamel’s</persRef> Physique des Arbres and

								Little</persRef> from Luke 11.3. “Give us day by day, our daily
							bread”— This discourse was not sectarian, but practical— He stated that
							the necessity of prayer could not be denied by a Christian. And there
							can be no doubt that Prayer is a Christian duty. In the second <persRef
								ref="alcibiades">Alcibiades</persRef> of <persRef ref="plato"
								>Plato</persRef>, <persRef ref="socrates">Socrates</persRef> teaches
							his young friend to be very cautious in selecting the objects of prayer,
							lest in praying for a good, he should obtain an evil— He approves
							therefore of prayer in general terms, referring to the Power to whom the
							prayer is addressed the particular objects to be granted— In the Lords
							prayer, the petitions are four—daily bread—by which must be understood
							provision for all the wants of the body—Forgiveness of Sins—not to be
							led into temptation—and deliverance from evil— It is to be observed that
							the latter of these two Petitions are in substance the same as the
							prayer approved by Socrates— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little
							assigned four distinct motives for the petition for daily bread, and
							shewed with cogency the reasons why this prayer is as obligatory upon
							the rich as upon the poor, and why the poor in addressing it to the
							Supreme Creator, should associate with it, the use of their own
							exertions to make it effective— In the afternoon I heard <persRef
								ref="campbell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Campbell</persRef> at <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker’s</persRef>, from Matthew 5.3.
							“Blessed are the poor in Spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.” A
							well delivered discourse upon humility— He related the anecdote of
								<persRef ref="demosthenes">Demosthenes</persRef>; giving action as
							the first, second and third qualification of an Orator, and he approved
							the application by one of the fathers, of this Story, to humility, as
							the first second and third of Christian virtues— Humility is no doubt,
							an excellent and a truly Christian virtue,—but it is a negative and a
							passive virtue— The virtue including all other Christian graces
							according to <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Paul</persRef> is Charity—or active benevolence— In the Evening I
							heard again M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little from John 14.30.
							[“]Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world
							cometh, and hath nothing in me. 31. But that the world may know that I
							love the Father; and as the father gave me commandment so I do. Arise,
							let us go hence.” The solemn and careful occasion upon which these words
							were spoken, is duly noticed. The profound impression which they must
							have made upon the disciples, and the heavy tidings which they carried
							to them were remarked— There was a long critical discussion who was
							meant by the Prince of this world, and an anxious argument to shew that
							it was not the devil— This he satisfactorily proved, and gave strong
							reasons for concluding that it meant the Roman and Jewish Authorities,
							Civil, military and Ecclesiastical— But he cannot touch this topic
							without falling into sectarianism, and he enlarged his digression, by
							the affirmance that there was no warrant in scripture, for believing in
							the existence of any such being as the devil— The day was warm— I took a
							ride in the Carriage after dinner with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef>, <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef>; but I could
							not write after returning home this Evening from Church— No Letter this
							whole week from <persRef ref="adams-george">George</persRef>— I wrote
							one of three lines to him. I read some pages in <persRef
								ref="duhamel-henri">Du Hamel du Monceau</persRef>—but have no time
							to pursue the perusal of his works, regularly, and now left his work
							upon the Physics of Trees, to consult the volume upon seeding and
							planting, and plunged into the midst of that— It appears that Du Hamel,
							is the most systematic writer upon forests and woods of modern times— I
							meet however with a difficulty at the threshold, in understanding a
							great multitude of the words used: a difficulty complicated at once by
							the language and the subject— I collected likewise some observations by
							looking into <persRef ref="prince-william2">Prince’s</persRef> Catalogue
							of his trees, plants and flowers at his nursery at Flushing on
							Long-Island— This is the oldest Institution of the kind in the United
							States, having been commenced by the <persRef ref="prince-william3"
								>father</persRef> of the present proprietor, before the American
							Revolution— One of the stumbling blocks to my project is the danger of
							enlarging it till it shall become impracticable— Another is of wasting
							time upon mere fancies without executing any thing— I find in Du Hamel
							many useful remarks upon the time of sowing the seeds of Stones and
							Trees in fall or Spring, and also upon the means of keeping them over
							Winter— My health is yet unpromising. Potted 9. Orange seeds.</p>

						<p>As none of the Nuts or Acorns which I planted last November and December

							five or six were found—rotten—with worm holes in the shells, and the nut
							apparently devoured by worms. One of the Princetown Chesnuts was found,

							long, and so near the surface, that it would probably have appeared in
							the course of the next Month. I then determined to leave the remaining

							enquiry and practical observation— <persRef ref="bailey-joseph">M<hi

							still thought the conduct of Bache, was not of a nature to be officially

							outrage committed by an Officer of the U.S. upon a Citizen for the
							exercise of the freedom of the press under the responsibility of his

							Alderman, under the authority of the State— But as the civil tribunals

							loan-stock—in 1818. which he thought just and reasonable. <persRef

						<p><date>Day—</date> differs little from that of the last Month; excepting

							and sometimes two in the Garden— Although my last Autumn’s plantings
							have not yet appeared, I have determined this year to repeat and
							multiply the experiments— The inconvenience that I now suffer is that it
							absorbs too large a portion of my time— The garden stroll added to the
							walk wastes the hours till breakfast, and then the books waste an hour
							or two more. Yet my reading is desultory and confused— Then my visitors
							an incessant stream, with Letters, despatches and Newspapers, keep me in
							constant employment, from the breakfast morning hour of nine till the
							Evening dinner hour of five— From seven or eight, until ten I have yet
							continued to write, for the Summer heat has not definitively set in— But
							my writing on the Colonial trade question flags, and other business gets
							in arrear— <persRef ref="loudon-john">Loudon’s</persRef> Encyclopaedia’s
