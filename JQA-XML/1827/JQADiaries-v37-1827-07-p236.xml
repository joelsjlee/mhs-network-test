						<p>Heard <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Little</persRef> from John. 15.12. [“]This is my commandment that ye
							love one another, as I have loved you— 13. Greater love hath no man than
							this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. 14 Ye are my
							friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.” It was a communion Sermon,
							and the duties of Christian benevolence were duly and emphatically
							recommended— The communion was afterwards administered, in which I
							participated— In the afternoon I heard <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>; from Exodus 20.8.
							“Remember the Sabbath day to keep it Holy”— In commenting upon this
							text, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker indulged his zeal beyond the
							bounds of discretion— He had preached on the same text this morning, and
							this was only a remnant of his discourse— He considered as violations of
							the command to keep the Sabbath holy, all attention to worldly concerns,
							and declaimed against Sunday travelling Steamboats and Stages, buying
							and selling—writing Letters and settling accounts—reading of newspapers,
							novels or books upon any other than religious subjects. He particularly
							declaimed against persons of distinguished consideration in Society for
							setting bad examples in this respect, and said that the Nation’s guest
							himself who was here two years since shewed in this respect that he had
							more regard for his own convenience, than for his God— I listened to all
							this very patiently and with my own opinions, as they were before— The
							extreme heat of the weather prevented me from attending in the Evening
							at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little’s— He had given notice that a
							Sermon would be preached, and a collection taken up for the benefit of
							the Colonization Society.</p>

								Thayer</persRef> the Superintendent of the Academy at West-Point,
							came to make as he said a confidential communication, relating to the
							condition of that Institution— The annual Report of the visitors, this
							year is highly favourable; as it has been heretofore— He said this was
							correct, so far as the examination of the visitors extended; which was
							only to the studies of the Cadets, and their acquirements in Science.
							But he regretted to say the moral condition of the Institution was not
							so favourable. That a habit of drinking had become very prevalent among
							them; and unless something effectual could be done to repress it, the
							Academy instead of proving a Seminary of accomplished education would
							usher into the world a large proportion of its pupils, even then vicious
							and prone to ruin and destruction— I asked him if these practices had
							been of long standing— He said not in much extent— That the Classes
							being arranged according to their merit, the head of each Class
							possessed an influence almost boundless over his associates— That
							heretofore the heads of the Classes have usually been distinguished for
							their good conduct as much as for their talents. That the reverse has
							happened with the class now recently graduated— That a young man from
							this District named <persRef ref="maynadier-william"
							>Maynadier</persRef>, was at the head of the Class— But with fine
							talents was of very loose morals, much addicted to drinking; avowing it,
							as a right to be asserted and maintained by every youth of Spirit, and
							encouraging and stimulating others to the same practice— This has now
							become so common that no small number of the Cadets are in danger of
							dating their utter ruin from their connection with the Academy. They
							have introduced a System of Stratagems for procuring liquor, and
							drinking, with faces averted from each other, that they may not testify
							one against an other— The Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> spoke also
							of the practice of trying the Cadets by Court-Martial, as very
							objectionable— The Superintendent being required to prefer the charges
							against the culprit, and thereby placed in the attitude of a party
							against his own pupils— And the Court Martial consisting of the Officers
							and Instructors at the Academy, always parties when the <pb type="ms"
								n="237"/>charges, are for violations of the discipline of the
							Academy, as they almost always are. I requested Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l</hi> Thayer to put the substance of these
							representations in the form of a written Statement, and to leave it with
							me— As to the regulation, excluding from admission persons infected with
							contagious disease, I recommended that hereafter it should be executed
							without requiring an exposure of absolute nakedness— <persRef
								ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Anderson</persRef> the Comptroller came in as Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thayer went out: still very much
							exasperated at the exclusion of <persRef ref="anderson-george2">his
								Son</persRef>, and incensed at the order for a naked examination— He
							now complained that there had been extraordinary rigour used with his
							Son; said he was informed <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clays</persRef><persRef
								ref="clay-henry2">Son</persRef>, and a youth named <persRef ref="u"
								>Willis</persRef> had been subsequently admitted without submitting
							to the naked examination— That a report had been circulated, that the
							reason why his Son had refused to be examined was that he had an
							infectious disease—which he said was a foul calumny— On the list of the
							Candidates for admission, with the remark upon the issue of their
							examination, those who refused the naked inspection were marked with the
							word declined—which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Anderson said was
							unfair— That the word would be understood as if they had declined the
							examination of their literary qualifications, which they had not. His
							Son having passed that examination, without committing a single error—
							He also said he had been informed that <persRef ref="u">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wheaton</persRef> had left the Point,
							because he would not execute this order for a naked examination— The
							judge was indeed under so much irritation, that I had a task to keep
							myself entirely cool— He also asked me, whether I had come to a
							determination upon the case of the Ex-Cadet <persRef
								ref="hughes-george2">Hughes</persRef>. I said I had not, and should
							wish to consult with the <persRef ref="barbour-james">Secretary of
								War</persRef>, before forming it— He spoke too of my Letter to him
							and the <persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">fifth Auditor</persRef>
							concerning my old Accounts, which he said they would answer in the
							course of the week— <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Brent</persRef> spoke of despatches recently received,
							and which he had sent me, from <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="brown-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown</persRef>,

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Weightman</persRef> the Mayor, and
								<persRef ref="goldsborough-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							join in the procession and attend the Oration to be delivered at
								<persRef ref="laurie-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lowrie’s</persRef> Church. The House of Representatives having
							passed some order that their Hall at the Capitol should no longer be
							used for that purpose. I promised to attend. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Weightman spoke about the Salary for a City Surveyor— I told
							him I could find no Law for it— <persRef ref="wheaton-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wheaton</persRef> brought a
							Certificate from Doctors    and <persRef ref="huntt-henry"
								>Huntt</persRef>, that he has the scars of several wounds received
							in the Revolutionary War, and recommending him for a pension— He
							repeated his distressing necessities, and says his difficulty at the War
							Department is that he cannot furnish cotemporary testimony of his
							wounds, all those who could have testified to them being dead— <persRef
								ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef>
							came, and mentioned his account as Guardian to <persRef

							thought it would be advisable to take the opinion of the <persRef

						<p>The Ex-Cadet <persRef ref="hughes-george2">Hughes</persRef> called this
							morning, and stated that it was highly important to him to obtain an
							immediate decision upon his application for a Commission. He stated that
							he had gone through a course of Education for the Military Profession—
							That he was unfitted for any other— That to lose the Commission for
							which he had been preparing, would be ruin to him— That he acquiesced in
							the decision of the Court-Martial against him, but hoped that his
							dismission from the Academy would be considered a punishment
							sufficiently severe for his offence— He asked therefore for a
							Commission, according to his rank in the Class, and if that could not be
							obtained, he then requested a Commission immediately after those of his
							Class— I told him that I would consider of his case, and let him know my
							determination shortly— <persRef ref="jones-roger">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jones</persRef> the Adjutant General
							was here, with a Letter of Resignation of <persRef ref="wallace-joseph"
								>Assistant Surgeon J. Wallace</persRef>, to take effect from the
								31<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of August next, which Jones said
							was conformable to usage, and to which I agreed— <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef>
							called and read me a Letter from himself to <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J. Ingersoll</persRef> upon the subject
							of naturalizing foreigners— He is averse to all Laws restrictive of
							naturalization, and would confer the rights of a native citizen to every
							foreigner from the day of his setting his <pb type="ms" n="238"/>foot
							upon our soil— With this opinion I do not exactly concur— He also took
							with him the Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><persRef
								ref="dorsey-clement">C. Dorsey</persRef>, concerning my opinions
							upon the projected amendments to the Constitution of the United States
							for taking the Election away from the House of Representatives— I told
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush distinctly what my opinions
							were— That I had expressed speculative opinions favourable to an
							amendment of the provisions in the Constitution, for the primary
							Election of President and Vice-President— In the Constitutional
							organization of the Electoral Colleges— I had thought it would be more
							conformable to the analogy of the other parts of the Constitution, if
							the whole Union should be divided, into Election Districts— Each
							District to chuse one member of the House of Representatives for each
							Congress, and one Elector at each Presidential Election, and that the
							Legislature of each State should <unclear>elect</unclear> the two additional Electors— I
							had expressed the belief that this would be an improvement— I still
							inclined to the same belief. But I never have believed or said any thing
							to indicate the belief that in the only contingency which assigns the
							Election to the House of Representatives, it ought to be taken from them
							and given to another body— For setting aside all reference to the last,
							or to the next Election. I thought in the peculiar contingency of a
							divided vote in the electoral Colleges, without majority for any one
							Candidate, the House of Representatives, was of all others the body
							peculiarly fitted for making the Selection. Being the popular branch of
							the Legislature— They would generally make the choice most pleasing to
							the People; and having a participation with the President in the
							enactment of Laws, they would be most likely to harmonize with a
							President chosen by themselves than by others— But I further said that
							the Constitution had left the trust of making Amendments to the two
							Houses of Congress without admitting the co-operation of the President—
							It was therefore doubtful to me whether the President could with
							propriety recommend to them any Amendment— But I had no doubt whatever
							that there would have been great impropriety in my recommending such an
							Amendment, after the circumstances under which I had myself been elected
							by the House— For I could not have done it without giving countenance to
							those base aspersions upon which the amendment mongers had rested all
							their cause— I thought therefore there could be no public benefit, and
							there might be some inconvenience in promulgating my opinions on these
							subjects— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush said he would write to
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dorsey accordingly.— The <persRef
								ref="menou-charles">Count de Menou</persRef> called here just before
							dinner, and mentioned that he had passed the Sunday at Philadelphia, at
							the same house where <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> lodged— That he left
							her well yesterday morning intending to proceed immediately to New-York—

							<persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> in my chamber at 90—and scarcely air to breathe— The fourth

						<p><date>4. III:30.—</date> Independence day— Boat Bath with <persRef

						<p>I had received notice last Evening, that the Literary, Scientific and
							Military Gymnasium of Georgetown, a School, kept by <persRef
								ref="cobb-james">James D. Cobb</persRef>—would tender me a salute in
							front of the house at seven O’Clock this morning. They came about eight

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Robert Potter</persRef> of
							North-Carolina came and took his Letters of Recommendation from <persRef
								ref="burton-hutchins">Governor H. G. Burton</persRef> which he had

							dollars to get home— He said he was afraid there had been an impropriety
							in the application he had made— I said there was no impropriety in that;
							but I did not perceive the propriety of my furnishing him with money. He
							then asked for the Letters of Recommendation which he had sent me, and I
							returned them to him— The notification had been that the procession
							would be formed this morning at ten O’Clock— But the Baltimore, Marion
							Company of Light Infantry were expected, and did not arrive till near
							Noon. I joined in the procession, and <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi

								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							read by <persRef ref="sim-thomas">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sim</persRef>, and the Oration by <persRef ref="coxe-c">C. S.
								Coxe</persRef>— The House was scarcely filled. After this there was

								ref="andrews-unknown3">Major Andrews</persRef> and his troop <pb
								type="ms" n="239"/>of horse, and received visitors, that is, the
							whole population, from one till three— The Marion Rifle Company, from

								ref="roberdeau-mary">Miss Roberdeau</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and <persRef ref="hellen-johnson"
								>Johnson Hellen</persRef>— There were two light Showers about 5 in
							the afternoon, with a subsequent breeze which refreshed the atmosphere—
							The day had for the first time a three fold interest, of glory, of joy
							and of melancholy which mingled in all my recollections— As the day of
							Independence— As my Son John’s birth-day, and as the day of <persRef

							upon the subject with the Secretary of the Navy. He thought there were
							no supernumerary Surgeons— None who could be spared from their
							appropriate duties— He then said that the Office of U.S. Consul at Paris
							and that of Agent of Claims, would shortly be vacant, and asked if in
							that event he could be considered as a Candidate for the place. I said
							certainly— But that it was doubtful whether Congress would continue to

						<p><persRef ref="elkins-jeremiah2">Major Elkins</persRef> of the Militia,
							came this Morning to inform me that the Rifle Company from Baltimore,
							who were going this day to visit Georgetown, wished to pay me a marching
							salute, on their way; and he afterwards came to mention the time,
							between half past eleven and Noon— They accordingly came, and I received
							their marching Salute. They were escorted by several of the Militia
							Officers of the District— They dined at Georgetown and in the afternoon
							commenced their march homeward—on passing by the house they again gave
							it a Salute of three Cheers— <persRef ref="thomas-unknown4">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thomas</persRef> came and kept me
							about two hours in electioneering political conversation, to which I was
							little more than a listener. He has been to Richmond, Virginia, upon
							business of his own, and is returning to New-York. He said little of
							Virginia, but much of men and things in New-York— Told me of numerous
							conversations with <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">Governor
								Clinton</persRef>, and many of his friends, and of other persons,
							all having reference to electioneering— The whole tendency of his
							Conversation was to satisfy me that he was disposed to make himself
							agreeable—and it manifested that knowledge of the world, in which many
							of the New-York politicians are proficients— <persRef

								Southard</persRef> had sent me last Evening Letters from <persRef
								ref="chauncey-isaac">Commodore Chauncey</persRef> from which it
							appeared that the question about the title to the Navy-Yard, at
							Brooklyn, had festered into a mob pulling down the fence which he had
							erected, and a personal affray between him, and two of <persRef
								ref="sands-joshua">Joshua Sands’s</persRef><persRef
								ref="sands-joshua2;sands-samuel" type="multi">sons</persRef>, in
							which he complains of having been outrageously assaulted, but for which
							he has been sued, and bound over to keep the Peace. He asks for
							instructions— Upon which I desired they might be, that no further
							resistance of force should be made to any thing Sands or any other of
							the claimants might do on the ground; but that an action of trespass
							should be instituted against them—for pulling down the fence, by which
							the title can be tried; and that Lieutenant Sands should be tried by a
							Court Martial for his assault upon Chauncey— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Southard suggested the expediency of immediately suspending
							Lieutenant Sands from duty, to which I assented. I endorsed also an
							order upon his Letter relating to the charges against <persRef
								ref="smith-richard2">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Smith</persRef> and <persRef ref="hall-joseph3">Lieutenant
								Hall</persRef>; of the Marine Corps, directing that a Court-Martial
							should be convened by the War Department, consisting of Officers of the

							Petition from <persRef ref="gooding-john">John Gooding</persRef> of that
							place, that a Noli Prosequi may be entered to a prosecution against him
							for the violation of the Statutes against the Slave-trade— He had also a
							recommendation to that effect from several very respectable Citizens of
							Baltimore; and Adams appealed to my compassionate feelings for this man,
							who he said had once been in flourishing circumstances, and was
							meritorious in privateering during the late War; but was now ruined, and
							had a wife and eleven children, dependent upon him for bread. I took the
							papers, and said I would do for his relief whatever might be in my
							power. <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							have sown seeds of Strawberries, raspberries and Currants, none of which

							“Happy is that people, that is in such a case; yea happy is that people,

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>, from Proverbs 1.20.
							[“]Wisdom crieth with out; she uttereth her voice in the Streets: 21 She
							crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in
							the city she uttereth her words, saying 22. How long, ye simple ones,
							will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and
							fools hate knowledge? 23. Turn you at my reproof: behold I will pour out
							my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. 24. Because I
							have called; and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man
							regarded: 25. But ye have set at naught all my counsel, and would none
							of my reproof. 26. I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when
							your fear cometh; 27. When your fear cometh as desolation, and your
							destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon
							you 28— Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall
							seek me early but they shall not find me.” M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Baker construes Wisdom to mean Christ; and all the

							Eastern Branch with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef> and <persRef

							The Report of Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thayer is unfavourable
							to him— On the roll of merit for conduct his name stands 186. in a

							that profession to which he has been bred—his Youth; and that with

							him, he ought to have the opportunity of defending himself. I discussed

							Bouligny left me, and must take the opinion of the <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">Attorney-General</persRef> concerning them—
								<persRef ref="cranch-william">Judge Cranch</persRef> called here
							this Evening, and gave me three Letters from me to him, written at
							Newbury-Port dated 14. October. and 8. December 1787. and 16— February

							of forbearance— I was so sincere, so earnest, so vehement in my
							opinions, and time has so crumbled them to dust, that I can now see them
							only as monumental errors— Yet the Spirit was such as even now I have no
							reason to disclaim— A Spirit of Patriotism of Order and of Benevolence—
							In the last of the Letters, is an allusion to my own state of mind at

							and walked in the Slashes towards the deserted College— I picked a few
							ripe bush blackberries; they are just beginning to ripen, and remained
							in doubt why this fruit is not cultivated in gardens— The Palma Christi
							and the Prince’s feather Amaranth are blooming, and I made acquaintance

							came up six weeks later— My observations on the process of vegetation

							Cadets by Court Martial; and expressed again his opinion that it was of
							most pernicious tendency— It has first the inconvenience of placing the

							criminated parties, upon trial; in which if the prosecutor fails, he is
							humiliated before his pupil— Secondly, he must generally rely for his
							testimony upon other Cadets; that is upon the accomplices of the party
							accused—and thirdly the testimony is of doubtful character, the regard,
							for truth being on the part of many of the witnesses postponed to the
							supposed duty of sustaining their fellow Students— I told the Colonel

							short of four Millions. That of 1827 about 150,000 dollars reduced— But
							New-York will give half a million more— On the whole the prospects are
							that there will be no additional falling off this year— I directed the

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Little</persRef>, from Isaiah 45–22. [“]Look unto me, and be ye
							saved, all the ends of the Earth: for I am God, and there is none else.
							23. I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in
							righteousness and shall not return, That unto me, every knee shall bow,
							every tongue shall swear. 24. Surely shall one say, in the Lord have I
							righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are
							incensed, against him shall be ashamed. 25. In the Lord shall all the
							seed of Israel be justified and shall glory.”— The Sermon was a
							dissertation upon the Book of Isaiah—which he observed was written
							before the Greeks had any Literature, and before Rome existed— He
							observed that the evidence of the authenticity and antiquity of this and
							the other Books of the Old Testament was unquestionable, and referred to
							the collection of them by <persRef ref="ezra">Ezra</persRef>, and the
							Septuagint translation under <persRef ref="ptolemy">Ptolemy</persRef>—
							It is very remarkable, that the influence of these Scriptures upon the
							moral character and History of mankind dates from this period— The
							Boo<unclear>ks</unclear> of <persRef ref="moses">Moses</persRef>, containing the Law,
							were locked up in the Ark of the Covenant—was afterwards lost, and in
							the time of <persRef ref="josiah">Josiah</persRef> was again found in
							the Temple— Its contents were entirely unknown to Josiah when it was
							found; from which it is clear that no copies of it had been in
							circulation till then— The historical books were the records of public
							events, kept by the Priests with the Book of the Law— The Psalms of
								<persRef ref="david">David</persRef> were devotional exercises kept
							in like manner, and the writings of <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon</persRef>, were treated with the same respect— How the
							Books of the Prophets came there does not appear— They were all written
							shortly before, and during the Assyrian and Babylonian captivity: and
							most extraordinary books they are— The whole body of the Scriptures was
							collected by Ezra, upon the building of the second Temple, and the
							return from the captivity— This was about 480 years before Christ. The
							Septuagint translation was made about 200 years later— Until the time of
							the captivity, the influence of the Holy Books was exclusively confined
							to the tribes of Israel;—and often yielded to neglect, and oblivion, and
							were often sacrificed to idolatry among them— The last of the prophets
							and Ezra, were nearly cotemporary but before Herodotus— The astonishing,
							and it may be said miraculous power of the holy books over the human
							mind, was much increased by the Greek translation; and it is surprizing
							that neither <persRef ref="aristotle">Aristotle</persRef>, nor <persRef
								ref="plato">Plato</persRef>, nor <persRef ref="xenophon"
								>Xenophon</persRef> have any allusion to them— The Doctrinal part of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little’s Sermon was as usual
							unitarianism— He gave notice that during the continuance of the
							intensely hot weather; the evening Service would be intermitted—
								<persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bakers</persRef> Sermon this afternoon was from Genesis. 6.5. “And
							God saw that the wickedness of man, was great in the earth and that
							every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
							continually.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker considered this
							description of the dispositions of men in the antedeluvian world, as
							entirely applicable to the present times, and to ourselves. If I could
							be persuaded that to believe ourselves the vilest of Gods creatures
							would make us better; I should be more credulous of this creed— I rode
							round by the Capitol and the College this Evening with my Son <persRef

							he said he had enabled the State of Pennsylvania to finish their
							Susquehanna Canal, and he could help the Directors of this Canal through
							with all their difficulties— His expedient so far as I understood him
							was to sow locust seeds on the sides of the canal, to consolidate the
							ground. I referred him to the Secretary of the Treasury for a further
							explanation of his project, and advised him also to make it known to the

							and a second is now heaving up at the surface— This seed was barely

							its stems shooting from its sides— Other seeds were pressed deeper, and
							their vegetation is much slower— The taproots are visible all round the

								Little</persRef> from Matthew 13.23 [“]But he that received seed
							into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it;
							which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundred fold some
							sixty, some thirty.” The doctrine urged was the duty of Christians not
							only to hear, but to understand the word— And also of bearing fruit, in
							which he observed that the text admitted of degrees— This is true— The
							Spirit of the gospel does admit degrees of merit, but does not
							countenance degrees of virtue, and manifestly imports entire equality of
							reward, and of punishment— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little gave
							notice that the intermission of the evening service still continued—
								<persRef ref="hagner-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter
								Hagner</persRef> the third Auditor paid me a visit after the morning
							service— And mentioned that he proposed shortly to make an excursion
							from the City— Heard <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Baker</persRef> in the afternoon— He read the 48<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm, and instead of a Sermon, read the
							pastoral Letter from the Presbyterian Convention recently assembled at
							Philadelphia, to the Christian denomination of that sect throughout the
							United States— It speaks with high gratification of several revivals of
							religion, which it affirmed have occurred, and denounced in very
							forcible language the prevailing vice of intemperance— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker added a most earnest exhortation of
							his own to the sharp rebuke of the Convention— He said it was computed
							that in the United States there are a hundred thousand professed
							drunkards, and that thirty thousand of them die every year— I think he
							fell far short of the real number of drunkards, and exaggerated the
							number of deaths among them— Drunkards shorten their lives, yet many of
							them live to old age, and nothing like the proportion of three in ten of
							them die every year— If all who shorten their lives by the abuse of
							ardent Spirits were included under the name of drunkards, half a million
							would be much nearer the account than one hundred thousand— Of the half
							a Million probably more than thirty thousand die yearly and they die in
							larger proportion than the temperate— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Baker highly commended the Society for the promotion of Temperance
							recently formed in Boston, and warmly urged the adoption of the rule
							recommended by them, of abstaining entirely from the use of ardent
							Spirits except medicinally. He said that two entire religious
							congregations in Boston had adopted this practice and were adhering to
							it. He compared the wives of Drunkards to the Indian widows who burn
							themselves to death upon the funeral pile of their husbands, but said
							their condition was worse, because the dead body could at least not
							curse his wife— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker was intensely
							earnest in his exhortation— Would to God that anything could be devised
							to suppress that odious, disgusting and fatal vice of intemperance— This
							day was cool with an Eastern wind. This evening I rode in the Carriage
							with <persRef ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hellen-johnson">Johnson Hellen</persRef>, and with <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>. <persRef ref="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> was unwell— The second stem from one Orange seed in
							the glass Tumbler N. 1. this day came up at the side of the glass— The
							first stem has risen just above the edge of the Tumbler, spread out its
							two opening leaves, and put forth a third— The Orange seed does not come
							up out of the ground— My two apple trees yet live the transplanted one
							is shewing the eighth leaf, but there is no perceptible growth in them
							from one day to another</p>

							long— All of the same size— He said the Corporation of Alexandria had
							remonstrated against cells of nearly the same dimensions, as being too
							small— They had therefore at the gaol there been reduced in number, and
							enlarged in size— I asked him if a certain portion of the cells at the
							Penitentiary could not be so reduced and enlarged. He said he would
							consult with <persRef ref="bulfinch-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"

							I took up a second time the Apricot Stone planted in Seedling Pot N. 5.

							there been any of either cherry, plum or Apricot that I have planted
							this Summer. It seems as if they must all pass a Winter, before they

							Cherry plum and Apricot Stones that I have kept in sand with those that
							I have packed in fresh earth, that sand does not, and earth does keep
							them of specific gravity to sink in water</p>

							to see him concerning it— He brought the semiannual reports since 1825
							when Bird entered— They shewed a regular decline of his standing from

							I have kept a small tin box full of cherry stones in sand, since the

							Cherry-stones, I infer, will not keep in dry sand, but must be kept in

							thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor
							the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; 2.
							While the Sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars be not darkened,
							nor the clouds return after the rain; 3. In the day when the keepers of
							the house shall tremble; and the strong men shall bow themselves; and
							the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the
							windows be darkened, 4. And the doors shall be shut in the Streets, when
							the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of
							the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low; 5. Also
							when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in
							the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall
							be a burden, and desire shall fail—because man goeth to his long home,
							and the mourners go about the streets. 6. Or ever the silver cord be
							loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the
							fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern, 7. Then shall the dust
							return to earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave
							it. 8. Vanity of vanities saith the preacher: all is vanity.” There is
							some obscurity in the language of this passage, and the translation must
							be defective— The images are much diversified, and many of the allusions
							are to things and manners of which we know nothing— But what a sublime
							and overpowering exhortation to piety in Youth; what a harrowing picture
							of the miseries of Old age! what a pathetic imagery of death! what a
							marked and unequivocal discrimination between the destinies of the
							perishable body and of the immortal Soul! and what quintessence of

						<p>Visiting the Garden this Morning, I found in the Southern bed, six more
							of the Quincy Shagbark trees just out of the ground—of those that I
							planted last November— I leave thus 11 of these and 5 Pennsylvanians up
							in that bed—and 4. Pennsylvanians and one Quincy tree in the Eastern bed
							= 21. There are also several Althea trees from the seed, and wild
							cherries from the Stones, self-planted in the Southern bed— I commended
							them all to the care of <persRef ref="ousley-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ousley</persRef>, the Gardener; and
							also my seedling Pots, with the Apple and Orange trees— The Apricot
							kernel planted 28 June in seedling Pot N. 6. which I took up the 21<hi
								rend="superscript">st.</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> found
							germinating, and replaced was this morning up— The two tumblers were
							given to the care of <persRef ref="newell-mary">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Giusta</persRef>. I planted a row of 36. whole black
							muscle plums in the Southern bed: next to desperate row; and desired
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ousley to keep for me about 50 of the
							Stones when they will be fully ripe; and also some of the peaches— There
							are also two Pots in each of which is a Tamarind planted by <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Adams</persRef>. With the exception of the time absorbed by my
							visitors the whole day was occupied in assorting papers and making
							arrangements for my departure— I sent to the Department of State,
							Treasury, War, and Navy, a multitude of papers, belonging to them, and
							which had accumulated in my boxes— There remained still a number which I
							leave in the boxes till my return— I wrote several Orders, for discharge
							of prisoners, and for remission of Penalties and forfeitures. Among them
							one in favour of <persRef ref="bigley-joshua">Joshua C.
							Bigley</persRef>, Master of Brig Fame of Providence R.I. for not
							bringing home a Seaman— <persRef ref="u;u" type="multi">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Carter</persRef> were from the Northern Neck of Virginia, and came
							to see the President and the House— They had a Letter of introduction to
								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> from <persRef ref="taliaferro-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Taliaferro</persRef>. I returned to
								<persRef ref="cutts-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cutts</persRef> the papers relating to the claims of several
							Officers in the army to double rations— My conversations with the
							several officers of the Government, who called upon me, related to
							subjects of business in their several departments. <persRef
								ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Huntt</persRef>
							gave me counsel concerning my health which is drooping, and the
							restoration of which is the principal purpose of my journey, and visit
							to my home. He pronounces my complaint unequivocally to be the
							Eresypelas— I think it all checked and obstructed perspiration— <persRef

						<p>Baltimore— All the morning till noon was employed with the interruptions
							of visitors, in concluding business of the several Departments and
							disposing of papers public and private. Many were yet kept without
							arrangement, and in disorder— About an hour before I left the City
								<persRef ref="nourse-charles">Major Nourse</persRef> came with
							several despatches from <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Governor
								Cass</persRef> of the Michigan Territory, announcing hostilities by
							the Winebago Indians, and much alarm. I hesitated whether I should not
							postpone my Journey; but I had some weeks since directed a reoccupation
							of the Post at Prairie du Chien— Governor Cass, appeared by his Letters
							to have taken all the measures of precaution required by the emergency;
							and the Secretary of War, having notified his intention to be here
							to-morrow or the next day, I desired Major Nourse to call his special
							attention to the subject on his return, and left to his discretion such
							further measures as he may deem advisable— Nourse afterwards wrote me a
							note, stating that since he saw me he had received information that a
							detachment of Troops had been ordered from S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t</hi> Louis to Prairie du Chien— <persRef ref="southard-samuel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> called
							twice—the second time to mention that he had information of the arrival
							of <persRef ref="rodgers-john">Commodore Rodgers</persRef> with the line
							of Battle ship North-Carolina, at Norfolk— He had expected she would
							arrive at New-York, and would probably be there, at the time of my
							arrival at that City; in which event he had urged me, and I had promised
							to visit the ship, which he thinks the finest ship in the world—
								<persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							called merely to take leave. <pb type="ms" n="257"/>At Noon I left the
							City of Washington, with my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef>, in my own Carriage, and four horses. <persRef
								ref="giusta-antoine">Michael Anthony Giusta</persRef>, my Butler and
							Steward who has lived with me since June 1814. had preceded us in the
							Stage, at ten O’Clock, with our heavy baggage— My own purpose is to pass
							the two Months ensuing in retirement at Quincy, with <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas">my brother</persRef> and his family; and if it
							may be to recover my flagging health, and prepare myself for the trials
							of the next winter— My Son Charles after having since he was graduated
							at Harvard University passed two years in pursuit of his Law Studies
							with me, goes to Boston, to follow them up in the concluding year before
							his admission to the Bar in <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi

							goes to reside with <persRef ref="frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript"

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Graeff</persRef> before two, and
								<persRef ref="merrill-john">Merrill’s</persRef> at Waterloo, near
							five— We met here <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Proud</persRef>, and an Administration County Committee of 16 or 18
							persons all of whom he introduced to me. I dined at Merrill’s, and after
							a parting glass of wine with the members of the Committee, proceeded to

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> My time of rising, this month has varied from
							a quarter past three to half past four, and I have busied the hours till
							nine, alternately, with bathing and swimming in the Potowmack, and with
							walking towards the College Hill, gathering plants and Blackberries, and
							visiting the garden; noticing the growth of the plants there, and
							talking of them with the Gardener <persRef ref="ousley-john"
								>Ousley</persRef>— Breakfasting at Nine, from ten till five in the
							afternoon, the current business from the Departments, visitors,
							despatches and Letters received by the Mails, and reading the
							Newspapers, slide through the time. Dine from five to six— After dinner,
							I have occasionally rode out an hour and a half in the carriage, or with
							my Son <persRef ref="adams-john2">John</persRef> in his Gig. From nine
							to ten I retire to bed— My health has been languishing, without
							sickness— From four to five hours of Sleep, not of good repose— A
							continual habit of costiveness, indigestion, failure of appetite,
							uncontroulable dejection of Spirits, insensibility to the almost
							unparalleled blessings with which I have been favoured; a sluggish
							carelesness of life, and imaginary wish that it were terminated, with a
							clinging to it, as close as it ever was in the days of most animated
							hopes—such has been the condition of my body and the disposition of my
							mind during this and several preceding Months— My confidence in the
							salubrity of the river bath and swimming is greatly shaken, and yet not
							wholly gone. I have bathed less than any preceding Summer; usually
							diving from the Boat, and swimming to the shore. Not less than ten, nor
							more than twenty minutes in the water— And sometimes substituting the
							Shower bath, with or without the tub bath, in its stead— With a
							defective perspiration, and imperfect digestion, there has been a
							continual inward heat, part of which has come out from time to time on
							the surface of the skin as it did last Summer, though not quite in so
							high a degree— <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Huntt</persRef> pronounces this to be Eresypelas, and has repeatedly
							and earnestly advised me to go and pass the remainder of the Summer at
							the North— To doff the world aside, and bid it pass— To cast off as much
							as possible all cares public and private; and vegetate myself into a
							healthier condition— This is the object of my present journey; but in
							going upon an expedition of purposed idleness my own deepest anxiety is
							to regain if possible a habit of useful industry.</p>
