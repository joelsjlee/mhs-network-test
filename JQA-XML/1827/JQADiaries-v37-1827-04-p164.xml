						<p><date>1. V.</date> Central Market— Cloudy.</p>
						<p>Heard <persRef ref="presbury-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Presbury</persRef> at <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Little’s</persRef> from Job 14.14. “If
							a man die, shall he live again.” This is a young man, graduated at Brown
							University, Providence, and has been some time a theological student at
							Cambridge— His subject was a future State, or the immortality of the
							Soul; and his argument that it was not discoverable by the light of
							Nature; and that the only assurance of it upon which we can rely is in
							the gospel of Christ— There were pathetic and eloquent passages in the
							discourse, and the argument from natural reason against continuous
							existence after death was urged with force and candour— It was presented
							in its most painful aspect; the eternal separation from those whom we
							have cherished upon Earth— After exhausting the topic of natural reason,
							and quoting several passages from the Old Testament, shewing that the
							doctrine of eternal life was not there; he made a sudden transition to
							the doctrine of the Gospel, by repeating without preliminary remark the
							words of Jesus—“Lazarus, come forth”—which he followed up with remarks,
							upon the restoration to life of Lazarus, and the subsequent resurrection
							of Jesus himself, in proof of the belief in a future State— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Little after the service, administered the
							Communion, in which I joined— <persRef ref="thornton-william">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Thornton</persRef> whom I had met in
							the street, accompanied me to Church, but came away before the Communion
							service was over— Between the Morning and afternoon Service, <persRef
								ref="pleasonton-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pleasonton</persRef> called to visit me and said he was going
							tomorrow on a tour of a fortnight to Lancaster County, Pennsylvania— I
							spoke to him of the movements in the House of Representatives on the
							subject of my old Accounts; and read to him the draught of the Letter I
							had written jointly to him and to the <persRef ref="anderson-joseph"
								>Comptroller Anderson</persRef>— I asked him also for the volumes
							containing the Accounts of Ministers abroad; heretofore settled; which
							he promised to send me tomorrow Morning— In the afternoon I heard
								<persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker</persRef>, from Micah 6:6— [“]Wherewith shall I come before
							the Lord, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him
							with burnt offerings with calves of a year old? 7. Will the Lord be
							pleased with thousands of Rams, or with ten thousands of Rivers of Oil?
							shall I give my first born for my transgression, the fruit of my body,
							for the sin of my Soul? 8. He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and
							what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy,
							and to walk humbly with thy God?”— This most admirable text contains in
							itself a whole system of ethics—it includes all the duties of man
							towards his fellow creatures and towards God— No Sermon can do Justice
							to it— In the Evening I heard M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Presbury
							again—from Psalm 34:8. “O taste and see that the Lord is good”—the
							discourse though sensible was less impressive than that of the morning.
							I wrote to <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> of
							Massachusetts.</p>

								Southard</persRef> called twice in the course of the Morning first
							to mention letters received from <persRef ref="hull-isaac">Commodore
								Hull</persRef> in the Pacific, and from <persRef ref="rodgers-john"
								>Rodgers</persRef> at Malta, in December; and afterwards to read to
							me a reply from <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>,
							to the answer Southard had sent him to the Letter which Jackson had
							written to him about the after dinner Conversation last Summer at
							Fredericksburg— The reply is in two or three sheets of paper; written in
							a coarse and insulting Style, somewhat verbose, and with passion partly
							suppressed; alledging that he had received the statement of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard’s remarks from <persRef
								ref="wallace-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wallace</persRef>
							and a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson</persRef>,
							in writing—these were two of the guests at table— He complains that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southards answer is argumentative, instead
							of plain matter of fact; which he had expected; and then it enter into
							large historical details to shew that he received no proper supplies
							from the War Department for <pb type="ms" n="164a"/><pb type="ms" n="165"
							/>the defence of New-Orleans, but saved that City by obtaining pistol
							flints from Barataria— He finishes the Letter by announcing it as a
							close of the Correspondence— <persRef ref="u">Borosky</persRef> was a
							stranger who announced himself as a Polish Officer wanting money to go
							to Philadelphia, where he expected to obtain relief from <persRef
								ref="girard-stephen">S. Girard</persRef>— The impositions I have
							endured from pretenders of this description have made me callous to
							their applications— I denied him; not without reluctance— <persRef
								ref="colbert-winchester">Colbert</persRef> is a Chickasaw Indian
							Youth, about 17. who has been living two years for education with
								<persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								M’Kenney</persRef>, and being now on the point of departure to

							note from <persRef ref="elliot-william2">W. Elliot</persRef>, mentioning
							the hours of eclipses of Jupiter’s Satellites, for some weeks to come:
							among which was one at ten O’Clock this Evening— Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Roberdeau mentioned also a plan that he
							has formed for improving the Militia; upon which he is preparing a
							paper— <persRef ref="ironside-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ironside</persRef> came and introduced Col<hi rend="superscript"
								>l</hi>    of Delaware; a stranger; but who immediately commenced
							upon politicks— Says Delaware is broken all to pieces, and knows not who
							will be elected to the House of Representatives, in the place of
								<persRef ref="mclane-louis">L. M’Lane</persRef>—perhaps <persRef
								ref="wells-william2">W. H. Welles</persRef>. <persRef

							of Rhode-Island called—detained here by the illness of <persRef
								ref="burges-cornelia;burges-mary" type="multi">two of his
								daughters</persRef>— Spoke of a Marine Hospital, which the
							Delegation from Rhode-Island have requested might be erected at
							Providence— Expressed some doubts as to the right of Congress to levy a
							tax of 20 Cents a Month upon the wages of Seamen; but without recurring
							to that he thought it just that the money should be expended where it
							had been raised— I told him I had heard that point much discussed
							heretofore in Congress, and the argument used that the Seamen of
							New-England were much oftener sick at the Southern Ports than at home—
							He will see me again upon this subject before he leaves the City—
							Evening very heavy— Catarrh still troublesome.</p>

							upon the trial of the cases, which have arisen from the frauds of

							recommended that a Letter should be written immediately written to M<hi

								ref="betton-solomon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Betton</persRef>
							called for his papers which I gave him— Cabinet Meeting at one—all
							present—the drafts of Letters to <persRef ref="scott-winfield">Generals
								Scott</persRef> and <persRef ref="gaines-edmund">Gaines</persRef>
							were discussed and amended, softening the expressions in many passages.
							The general order to be issued to the army was also considered— That
							such an order should be issued was thought advisable by all— The terms
							of the draft were considerably modified— After this was disposed of
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> read his draft of a Letter of Instruction to <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gallatin</persRef>: containing a reply to <persRef
								ref="canning-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Canning’s</persRef> last Note on the Colonial Trade— He apologized
							for its length; and also for the more than moderation of its tone— It
							answers and refutes all that has a shew of reason in Canning’s note; and
							points out its departures from matters of fact. It proceeds to state our
							assent to the principle of regulating the trade by Legislation— Then
							states what we are inclined to offer by Law; and instructs M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin to enquire, first whether they
							will in consequence of our opening the trade to their vessels, without
							discriminating duties, and yielding to them the circuitous voyage, open
							the Ports to our vessels <pb type="ms" n="166"/>Secondly, if they will
							not open them upon those terms, whether they will upon others, and what
							terms— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush had already seen this draft,
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay wished that Governor Barbour,
							before he leaves the City, and <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi

							Southard said he thought there was rather too much of concession in it.
							I inclined to the same opinion myself. Evening solitary, and incapable

							second call was to read to me two or three Letters from <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J. Ingersoll</persRef>— One asking that
							the Captains of two Revenue Cutters, which boarded <persRef
								ref="thomson-edward">E. Thompson’s</persRef> Tea Ships should be
							ordered to attend as Witnesses, at the U.S. Circuit Court, to sit next

							present Collector at Philadelphia, <persRef ref="jones-william">W.
								Jones</persRef>, were doing bad business, by which their credit may
							be affected. <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hubbard</persRef>, announced himself as a Presbyterian Clergyman,

								ref="armstrong-andrew">Andrew Armstrong</persRef>, Commercial Agent

							authority to order the discontinuance of it— He then presented me a
							written complaint against Armstrong signed by himself and three or four
							more Masters of Vessels, on a charge of his having taken of them
							excessive fees— I told him, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Armstrong,
							upon his return home, which was shortly expected would be apprized of

								>Wilson</persRef> came to enquire if I had seen the District

								<persRef ref="smith-richard2">Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
									Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Smith</persRef> of the Marine

							him upon various points exhibited by the Report, but finally letting him
							off from a Court-Martial, on the ground that there was contradictory
							testimony, and that some excuse was found in the ill health with which
							he has been for some time afflicted— It finished by ordering him to
							duty. I observed to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard, that the
							conclusion seemed not to harmonize with the body of the Letter, and
							although the Report of the Court of enquiry authenticates the complaint
							of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Little</persRef>
							that there were unsettled Accounts between her and Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Smith, yet this Letter would leave her
							without remedy and release him from the obligation even of settling the
							Accounts— I thought it would be more advisable to write to Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> Smith that before any decision here upon
							the Report of the Court of Enquiry, it was expected that he should
							settle his Account with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Little, to her
							satisfaction or by judgment of Law—with the resolution if he makes this
							settlement, to leave without farther notice the remaining charges— There
							was also a Letter from <persRef ref="kuhn-joseph">Captain
							Kuhn</persRef>, paymaster of the Marine Corps, complaining that <persRef
								ref="henderson-archibald">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Henderson</persRef> had deprived him of the service of his Clerk, by
							an arbitrary order, which he makes the subject of an additional charge
							against the Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> I advised M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard to write forthwith an order to
								Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Henderson, to forbear all
							interruption of the paymaster in the paymaster’s duties—and to keep any

							commence a suit for 4000 Acres of the Land— Donaldson declines
							furnishing his quote of the contribution, and declines also purchasing
							the right of the heirs of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson— All I

							portion of the right, as representing the heirs of <persRef
								ref="wallace-charles">Wallace</persRef> and <persRef ref="muir-john"
								>Muir</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye took also the

							voted for this Bill, and against an amendment less favouring the popular
							right of suffrage, which prevailed at the time; although the principle

						<p>I still notice in my early morning walk, the different processes of

							for directions which I gave him to make me a Book-case— A Subject about

							and from generation to generation— I gave him the dimensions of one

								ref="triplett-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							He had a few days since obtained a recommendation signed by several
							respectable persons at Alexandria, that he might be appointed Collector
							of some port in Florida— He asked me if I had received it. I said I had—
							That it was painful to me to tell him my impressions concerning him, but
							that candour required it of me. The Sentence of the Court Martial had
							declared him addicted to habitual intemperance— I could not appoint a
							man to any civil office, dismissed from the military service for that
							cause— He said he came to ask me to suspend my opinion for two or three
							Months within which time he hoped to be able to furnish unequivocal

							this— <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							to leave it discretionary with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin

						<p>I have already been tempted by the prevailing warm weather to bathe in
							the Potowmack, but have been deterred by the Catarrh, still hanging upon
							me, and by the warnings of physicians, whose doctrines are not in
							harmony with my experience— I took however for this morning’s walk, the
							direction to the River, and visited the rock whence I most frequently go
							into the River— It is yet adapted to the purpose; but all trace of the
							old Sycamore tree which was near it, and blew down the winter before
							last, is gone. There is yet one standing a little below; but it is
							undermined with every high tide; and must be soon overthrown. The
							borders of the river are strewed with dead herring and shad: and the
							waters are not so high as usual at this Season— The French Minister the
								<persRef ref="durantdemareuil-joseph">Baron de Mareuil</persRef>

							Havre. He said he was going upon a leave of absence, not knowing whether
							he should return here or be otherwise disposed of. I assured him of my
							good wishes, and that it would give us pleasure to see him here again.
							And I desired him to assure his Government of the continued earnest
							desire entertained by us to be upon the terms of harmony with France. He
							spoke in equal terms of courtesy, and expressed himself grateful for the
							treatment he had received in this Country— These were words of course,
							and without much cordiality, or more sincerity than there is in the
							closing Salutation of a Letter— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							mentioned a despatch of 26. February received from <persRef

							want 200 feet for my two Book cases—and must give 25 dollars a hundred
							for the wood— He is to make the two Cases accordingly— I continued the

								Little</persRef>, from Luke 11.44. “Woe unto you, Scribes and

							with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the
							burdens with one of your fingers.”— This discourse appeared to be an
							apology for delivering in the pulpit sentiments, at which individuals
							take offence as though intended to be applied personally to them. It is
							difficult to animadvert upon any vice or immorality without bearing upon
							those who are addicted to them—and yet the pulpit is not the place for
							reproving individual transgression; at least in the present age—and the

							general observation, made without any intention of reference to him—
								<persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker’s</persRef> afternoon discourse was from Matthew 5.4.
							[“]Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.” There is

							from Colossians 1.5. “For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven,

							again repeated his application for an appointment; and said he was

							to a Seaman, named <persRef ref="morris-joseph">Joseph Morris</persRef>,
							who deserted last July from a British Packet at New-York, and afterwards

							Chauncey</persRef>, he admitted that his name was Morris and that he
							left the British Packet, last July, but denied having taken the money.
							We concluded to discharge the man, and to give such notice to the

								Graham</persRef> brought me a Synopsis of the public Lands within
							the present boundaries of the States and Territories to the first of
							January 1826. from which it appears that the Quantity of Land purchased
							by the United States exceeds 258 Millions of Acres, of which near 139
							millions have been surveyed, and upwards of 19 Millions sold, for about
							40 millions of dollars—more than 32 Millions of which have been paid—
							There have been upwards of 7 Millions of Acres, reserved for Schools,
							and the quantity remaining unsold exceeds 210 Millions— The sums paid
							for public Lands have been little short of thirty-three Millions of
							Dollars, exceeding by about half a Million the proceeds of the Sales;
							but this includes the whole purchase money for Louisiana and Florida;
							all the sums paid to the State of Georgia, for Lands, and all the
							expenses of surveying and of Sale— The Lands remaining within the limits
							of the United States, North and West of the boundaries of the States and
							Territories are estimated at 750 Millions of Acres— It appears also that
							the amount of duties received at the Custom-House at New-Orleans to the
								30<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September last is more than 15
							1/2 Millions— This Statement is well suited to shew the immense value of
							the Lands to the Union; but will not suffice to preserve them from the
							Rapine of some of the Western Spirits— I gave M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Graham a Letter I had received from <persRef
								ref="noble-james">James Noble</persRef> Senator from Indiana, and
								<persRef ref="test-john">John Test</persRef>, late a member of the

							County had been held that day— His Election has been bitterly contested
							by a man misnamed <persRef ref="loyall-george">Loyall</persRef>— But in
							that County Newton had nearly three votes to one— There are yet the
							borough and one small County to vote, and Newton is confident of final
							success. He is one of the fairest and most intelligent men in Congress,
							as well as the oldest Member of the House of Representatives— <persRef

							departs without being desired— He expressed however his Gratitude for

								Nourse</persRef>, Chief Clerk of the War Department came with some

						<p><date>22. V:</date> Sun rose 5:18.</p>
						<p>Heard <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Little</persRef>, this morning from Psalm 104.14. “He causeth the
							grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he
							may bring forth food, out of the earth; 15. And wine that maketh glad
							the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread, which
							strengtheneth man’s heart”—and in the Evening from Psalm 65. part of 9
							[“]Thou visitest the earth and waterest it— 10. Thou waterest the ridges
							thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrow thereof: thou makest it
							soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof”— This was one of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little’s best discourses— Somewhat
							desultory as his manner is— The general doctrine was to urge the
							goodness of God, from the annual renovation of Nature in the Spring—
							There were some pleasing descriptions of the operation of nature upon
							vegetation, and upon the birds— In the evening Sermon he quoted that
							most exquisitely affecting description of Spring in the second Chapter
							of Solomon’s Song—11.12.13—but omitted that which points all <pb
								type="ms" n="179"/>its beauties, the 9<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> verse, and the closing clause of the 13<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi>— He drew also from the phenomena of the
							physical world in Spring, an argument in favour of a future life; which
							he weakened however by stating an opinion of some good men that this
							immortality would be conferred only upon the virtuous; and saying that
							he gave no opinion upon that point. But this is not Christian doctrine—
							The language of <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>
								Paul</persRef> is that we must <hi rend="italic">all</hi> appear
							before the judgment Seat of Christ, and there is surely nothing in
							nature or in revelation to countenance the idea that there is any
							discrimination of immortality among men— This afternoon, I heard at
								<persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Baker’s</persRef> a Stranger, from Numbers 23.10. “Let me die the
							death of the righteous, and let my last end by like his!”— The Sermon
							was sensible and well written though it seemed to me not altogether
							original; but the voice of the preacher was so extraordinary, that it
							was unaccountable to me until M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker in
							the concluding prayer, explained it, by giving an intimation that the
							preacher was deaf— After the morning service, I called at <persRef
								ref="king-charles2">C. B. King’s</persRef> the Painter’s, and saw
							the Portrait he is painting of my Son <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef>, which was much improved since I saw it last
							Sunday— He has also made a very good copy of <persRef
								ref="stuart-gilbert">Stewart’s</persRef> last Portrait of <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> which he borrowed— I omitted
							writing, after returning from Church this Evening.</p>

							grounds; and I desired him to ask <persRef ref="bulfinch-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bulfinch</persRef> to call on me, to
							take his opinion, upon the same subject. Elgar thought the ground which
								<persRef ref="bomford-george">Bomford</persRef> asks for, as
							necessary for the arsenal could not without inconvenience be spared from
							the Penitentiary; but Bulfinch thought it might— I had no other visitors
							this day. I am inclining to resume my enquiries, relating to the
							production and growth of fruit and forest trees. Since I first entered
							upon them last Summer, a few Books treating of the Subject, have been
							procured for the Department of State, from London and Paris— I have
								<persRef ref="loudon-john">Loudon’s</persRef> Encyclopaedia of
							gardening, fourth Edition 1826. an Octavo Volume of 1240 pages— And his
							Encyclopaedia of Agriculture, 1825. a similar volume of 1224 pages— And
							I have this day borrowed from the Department, <unclear>. . .</unclear> Treatises of
								<persRef ref="duhamel-henri">Du Hamel Du Monceau</persRef>, upon the
							cultivation of Trees and the uses and treatment of Wood, which have been
							procured at my request— I find upon consulting them, that there are two
							others wanted to complete his entire work upon the forests— Looking into
							these Books I find a wide field opened before me, which I cannot expect
							that the remnant of life allotted to me, will afford me time to explore:
							and at present the time that I can bestow upon it is so very little, and
							cut up with such incessant interruptions, that I fear the result of my
							pursuit will plunge me into inextricable confusion of mind, without
							contributing to any useful end— I brought home yesterday from the
							Race-ground, a twig covered with white blossoms, which upon examination
							I found to be the Dogwood—Cornus Florida— I had seen it in blossom about
							a week at the Capitol garden without knowing it— I found the description
							and Print of it in <persRef ref="michaux-francois">Michaux’s</persRef>
							North-American Sylva. Vol 1. p. 255. and in <persRef ref="bigelow-jacob"
								>Bigelow’s</persRef> Medical Botany. Vol. 2. p. 73— And another
							Dogwood in Bigelow Vol. 1. p. 93— This morning also, with <persRef
								ref="giusta-antoine">Antoine</persRef> I planted four Rows of large
							Pennsylvania Walnuts— 9. Quincy Walnuts and 3 Hazelnuts in one Row and
							three Peters Chesnuts, with the rest of the Row in Apple seeds in a
							different part of the Garden, from that where I planted last November—
							That bed is now covering itself with weeds; but there was not a symptom
							of any of my nuts having vegetated— Upon digging however, Antoine found
							one of the Pennsylvania Walnuts had put forth a shoot which will
							probably show itself above ground in June—which gives me hopes that
							others will appear also— The time that I can snatch for this fantastical
							humour is now the only hour</p>

							“For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world, are

							argument of <persRef ref="paul">S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
								Paul</persRef> in this Chapter is that the existence and Nature of
							God, are inferrable from the visible Creation—that the heathens, by
							rejecting this evidence, and by their vain imaginations, substituted
							corruptible man, birds, beasts or reptiles, instead of the true God,
							were without excuse—and that this fantastic preference of idolatry to
							the worship of the true God, was the source of all loose, depraved and
							vicious morals— The connection between the belief of one omnipotent
							Spirit, creator of the visible universe, and pure morality, is here
							stated with great force—and that of depraved morals, with idolatry— S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul says that God gave them up to vile
							affections, and a reprobate mind, because they refused to acknowledge
							him— These positions seem to deserve full and particular illustration;
							but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little confined himself to a single
							view of the Subject, the unreasonableness and absurdity of Atheism— Now
								S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Paul is not here censuring Atheism,
							but Polytheism—not the disbelief of any God, but the perverted belief of
							human and brutal Gods— And he is shewing the necessary connection
							between such perverted belief and all the vices of unnatural lust, of
							cruelty and of fraud. A philosophical developement of the secondary
							causes by which these effects are operated would be acceptable, and
							instructive to me.</p>

								Graham</persRef> came with a Letter from <persRef
								ref="hendricks-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hendricks</persRef> one of the Senators from Indiana, complaining of
							the order to the <persRef ref="tiffin-edward">Surveyor
							General</persRef>, to supersede all Surveys in that State, because no
							specific appropriation was made for them at the last Session of
							Congress— There was indeed an appropriation generally for surveys, of
							twenty thousand dollars, but it was made upon estimates not including
							these Surveys and before the Indian Treaty by which the lands were
							acquired had been ratified. The omission to make a subsequent additional
							appropriation was an oversight, which the Indiana members now feel will
							be imputable specially to them; and hence their great anxiety upon the
							subject— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham however observed that a
							part of the appropriation actually made might be applied to the Indiana
							surveys, at the hazard at having the fund fall short, for those on the
							estimate of which it was given, and perhaps some might be made in the
							anticipated confidence of an appropriation at the next Session of
							Congress, and I agreed that he should instruct the Surveyor General
							accordingly. <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> came with a petition from Boston, for the remission
							of a forfeiture, of a British vessel from Bermuda; which has entered the
							Port, since the Proclamation of 17. March was issued. This vessel was
							chartered at Bermuda, to bring home the Cargo, of an American vessel
							which had entered there in distress— Sailed from Bermuda 7. of this
							month, before the existence of the Proclamation was known there; and the
							property belongs to a Citizen of the United States— I agreed with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush that this was a case for the
							remission of the forfeiture— <persRef ref="lovell-joseph">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lovell</persRef> came and introduced
							a <persRef ref="u">brother</persRef> of <persRef ref="brown-jacob"
								>General Brown’s</persRef>, and another person perhaps an officer in
							the army, but whose name I did not ascertain— And <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>
							introduced <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beale</persRef>, a visitor from Kentucky— <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef> had a Letter from <persRef ref="ridgeley-charles"
								>Captain Ridgely</persRef>, who had been with the frigate
							Constellation to La Guayra, and communicated with the Consul, <persRef
								ref="williamson-john">Williamson</persRef>, but did not go into the
							Harbour. He had also a Letter from <persRef ref="jones-jacob">Captain
								Jones</persRef> of the Sloop of War, Lexington, at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> Blas, on the Pacific Ocean— She had been
							to the Sandwich Islands, and Jones gives a bad account of <persRef
								ref="percival-john">Percival</persRef>, who had preceded him there
							in the Dolphin— Percival is in prison at New-York, upon suits at Law,
							brought against him by <persRef ref="edwards-alfred">Alfred P.
								Edwards</persRef> and others. I was employed much of this day in
							preparing decisions upon the trials of nineteen Cadets at
							West-Point—eleven of whom the Court Martial have sentenced to be
							dismissed— In the examination of these cases several questions of
							importance have occurred to me requiring much reflection, and upon which
							I have not been able to come to a satisfactory conclusion. These
							difficulties have delayed my decision upon the trials, for several
							weeks. <persRef ref="roberdeau-mary">Miss Mary Roberdeau</persRef> came
							again to pass some days with us.</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> The average of my rising hour through the
							month has been five, immediately after which, I take a walk of an hour
							and a quarter— I then read an hour, and write an hour, and often waste
							an hour upon some trifle of idleness— At nine we breakfast, which with
							the Morning Newspaper soaks up from one to two hours and thence till
							five in the afternoon, I am engaged with the Mails from South and North,
							the Heads of Departments, with business, and voluminous papers, and
							visitors, Strangers, Petitioners, and Officers, so that I can never
							apply with certainty a quarter of an hour together to any one pursuit.
							At five we dine, and I take two hours or more of leisure and relaxation—
							From seven till ten or eleven I apply to the arrears of my Diary Index,
							and to writing upon the Colonial trade question. Then retire for the
							Night. This life is regular and very little varied— My health has been
							the whole month bad— My anticipations for the two succeeding years,
							calls for more than Stoic fortitude. As life draws towards its close, it
							loses value philosophically every day, but physically becomes more
							precious— For all that is past Gratitude is the only sentiment that
							should fill my Soul, as the future should be allotted to humble hope, to
							firm reliance, and to resignation.</p>
