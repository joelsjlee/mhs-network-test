							to <persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> the Editor of the

							Longitude for 1822 which he said he had received from <persRef
								ref="cardell-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cardell</persRef>— He it seems had borrowed it of me three or four
							years since which had escaped my recollection— Tyler also shewed me a
							Letter from <persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> to him, dated
							4. July 1818 of which he proposed to publish an extract, but I dissuaded
							him— <persRef ref="randall-thomas">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Randall</persRef> came to take leave of me— He is going to Florida,

							announced to me, that he had prepared a plan of finance such as never
							was presented to any Nation—which would place at the command of the
							Government many annual millions, to be applied to internal improvement,
							and to strike all opposition dumb— Not wishing to trespass on my time
							and occupations; he asked only that I should send copies of it to two or
							three of my friends, and if they should approve it; that I should
							recommend it in my next Message to Congress— After hearing him expatiate
							a quarter of an hour or more upon the marvellous effects to be produced
							by his plan I desired him to let me have it, and promised to give it a
							deliberate consideration; but this did not answer his purpose— He urged
							me with great pertinacity to say that I would submit the consideration
							of it to some of my friends conversant with the Subject of finance, till
							I was obliged to tell him, that upon Subjects to be recommended in a
							Message, the members of the Administration were the only persons whom I
							was in the habit of consulting, as they were responsible for their
							Advice; and if I should determine to refer his paper to any of my
							friends it would be to them— He then hesitated whether he should send me
							his paper at all; but I rather cheered him to send it; and he left me
							expecting to receive it— <persRef ref="bulfinch-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bulfinch</persRef> brought me a plan

							Corps— But the Catarrhal oppression upon my lungs makes writing doubly

							called this morning with <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Butler</persRef> who was one of the Candidates for the appointment
							of Collector for the District of Camden in North-Carolina. But his
							application and recommendations came too late, <persRef
								ref="rogerson-asa">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Asa
								Rogerson</persRef> having been appointed last week. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Butler manifested some curiosity to be

							recommendations from Elizabeth City itself— <persRef ref="todson-george"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todsen</persRef> came again to
							ask favour of me immediately— He said that he was about forming a
							matrimonial connection with a young Lady; whose Parents had no other
							objection to the match than his destitute condition, and the shade upon
							his character arising from his dismission from the public Service. He
							spoke also of the great difficulty of obtaining support by his
							profession under his present circumstances— I told him that I had done
							for him all that was in my power. That as to replacing him in the public
							service, it was doubtful whether I should ever be able to do it,
							consistently with my own obligations— But if I should, it could only be
							by nominating him to the Senate for an appointment, and that could only
							be while the Senate are in Session— He said if he had known that he
							would not have troubled me again, and once more took leave— <persRef
								ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little</persRef>
							came to ask for a Settlement of his charge for extra-copying in the
							Patent-Office— A Bill for legalising this work passed the House of

							in the Senate— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little said he should not
							ask to be continued in this employment; but he was extremely earnest to

									rend="superscript">r </hi>Clay</persRef> he said, had referred

							Little’s request is very reasonable in itself; but last Summer he was
							equally importunate to obtain the doing of the work, upon condition that
							his compensation should expressly depend upon its being subsequently
							sanctioned by Congress— <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor
								Barbour</persRef> brought a number of papers concerning <persRef

								<persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">T. L. M’Kenny</persRef>— <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> had

							which had arrived within the Jurisdiction of the United States before
							the Proclamation was received, by the <persRef ref="myers-moses"
								>Collector at Norfolk</persRef>, but had not anchored in the
							harbour, till after— There was a long argumentative Letter from <persRef
								ref="tazewell-littleton">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tazewell</persRef> the Senator in support of the claim. I advised
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush to answer that the vessel was to
							be considered as having entered before the Proclamation was known— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush mentioned also that there had been
							this day a meeting of the Commissioners of the sinking fund, who had
							determined to pay off five Millions of the principal of the Public Debt,
							on the first of July. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay brought me two
							private Letters—one from <persRef ref="hammond-jabez">Jabez D.
								Hammond</persRef> at Albany, intimating his disposition to accept
							one of the Auditor’s Offices in the event of a vacancy, and suggesting
							the policy of making one. The other Letter was from <persRef

							personal objection to him, <pb type="ms" n="161"/>but because he was a
							lawyer, and because it was thought there were already more Justices of

							Weightman said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall’s being a lawyer
							was in his mind rather a recommendation than an objection; for if there
							were already too many Justices of Peace, the excess consisted not so
							much in their numbers, as in the want of due qualification in some of
							them to discharge the duties of the Office, owing to their ignorance of
							the Law. He said also that he had called on me to make these remarks
							verbally rather than give M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hall a written
							recommendation. For he had found it necessary to decline giving any such
							recommendations, to avoid, by a general rule the necessity of giving
							them to many persons who applied for them, but whom he considered
							incompetent for the Office— He spoke also of an application which he had
							made some Months since in the behalf of the City Corporation for a
							Surveyor; and to which I am to give attention. <persRef key="clay-henry"

							condition than before he commenced his operations upon them; and now,
							having been paid for more work than he has performed, he writes the most
							insolent and insulting Letters to the Secretary of War and to me— He is
							withal a political tool, of the coarsest kind— My Catarrh continues— I
							took the day before yesterday an ounce of Castor Oil, and this morning a
							second— This distemper has assailed me at various periods of my life,
							and continued many weeks unsubdued at each attack— It differs from

							bears severely on my nerves and Spirits— Patience!</p>

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Walsh</persRef> came and passed an
							hour with me, and gave me with great freedom and candour his opinions
							upon political subjects— I told him I had received his last Letter
							requesting an Article on the British Colonial trade, which I promised to
							furnish him at latest by the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May—
							He said that upon that question he was satisfied we had the right of the
							controversy; but that if we had not, he should never take the side of a
							foreign Government in collisions with our own— He also thought it would
							be politic in the Government to make some federal appointment in
							Pennsylvania— He said he had nothing to ask for himself; but he was very
							urgent in his recommendation of <persRef ref="hopkinson-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hopkinson</persRef>— I mentioned
							several federal appointments that have been made, but he thought the
							party would not recognize them— <persRef ref="forrest-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Forrest</persRef> brought for
							signature an Exequatur for a Brazilian Vice-Consul at Boston. Cabinet
							Meeting at One—<persRef key="clay-henry">Clay</persRef><persRef
								key="rush-richard">Rush</persRef>, <persRef ref="barbour-james"
								>Barbour</persRef>, <persRef ref="southard-samuel"
								>Southard</persRef>, <persRef ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef>, all
							present— The question was what should be done, upon this publication by
								<persRef ref="scott-winfield">General Scott</persRef> of a pamphlet
							Letter to the Secretary of War— A Regulation of the army forbids the
							officers on penalty of Court-martial punishment, from publishing in
							Newspapers or pamphlets their private quarrels— Scott complained to the
							Secretary of War, that <persRef ref="gaines-edmund">Gaines</persRef> had
							violated this order by printing a pamphlet, containing a part of the
							Correspondence; but suppressing the most important of all the documents,
							namely Scott’s answer to an argumentative, and vituperative Letter of
							Gaines; Scott therefore asked either that Gaines should be arrested and
							brought to trial for violation of the Rule, or that the Rule itself
							should be suspended so far that he might publish a counter pamphlet to
							that of Gaines— He was informed that the rule could not be suspended;
							but that the Government possessed no Evidence to sustain a charge
							against Gaines, for publishing the pamphlet— Scott then sends this
							Letter in Manuscript 156 pages to the Secretary at War, and immediately
							after prints and circulates it in this pamphlet— The first question was
							whether they should both be arrested, and tried— But we have not
							evidence to sustain charges against either of them— Scott however had
							sent his Letter in Manuscript to the Secretary of War— Had we not a
							right to conclude, from the fact of publication, that it was made by his
							authority, and to hold himself answerable for it? Then if Scott alone
							should be taken to task, leaving Gaines unnoticed; Something of
							partiality would be suspected among the people, for visiting with
							censure only him whose transgression consisted only in repelling the
							offence of the other— It was at length thought best that the Secretary
							of War should write to both stating that although there was not evidence
							at hand legally to convict them of the violation of the regulations, yet
							the presumption arising from the Circumstances warranted the inference
							that they had both gone beyond the line of their duty. That this conduct
							was disapproved by the President, and the more so because the only
							difference between them which could call for any publication from either
							of them, was of public interest, and might have been discussed by them
							in pamphlets, without violating any of the army regulations— But in
							determining to write this Letter I observed it would be proper to be
							prepared for the next step if their answers should be insulting—which I
							thought Scott’s would be— It was said— Strike from the Rolls of the
							army, or try by Court-Martial— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Walsh and
