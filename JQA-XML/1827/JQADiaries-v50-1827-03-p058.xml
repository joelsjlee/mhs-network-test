						<p>Cabinet Meeting— The question was whether the communications received

							Georgia, and <persRef ref="vinton-john">Lieutenant Vinton</persRef>,
							should be communicated to Congress; and if so, whether with any comment

								Rush</persRef> and <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> inclined to the opinion

							consider as declared in the Secretary of War’s Letter to him— <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> urged
							that the simple transmission of the papers without a word of commentary
							would be advisable— My own first thought was to shew by a very summary

							that the proper treatment of it was silence— I sent the Message with the
							Copies. <persRef ref="knight-nehemiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Knight</persRef> of the Senate and <persRef ref="forward-chauncey"

							<unclear>ga</unclear>ve me pleasure, as permanently beneficial—half a Million
							appropriated yearly for the gradual improvement of the Navy— It was
							saved from a local <unclear>qu</unclear>icksand, with extreme difficulty— I sent to the

							suspended their rule of presenting <unclear>no</unclear> Bills to the President, on

							is much engaged in researches upon this subject, concerning which he has
							to prepare a Report for Congress— At the Capitol where I continued until

							importance to sign— The Colonial Trade Bill was lost by a disagreement
							between the two Houses— The House of Representatives having last Evening
							adhered to an Amendment the Senate this morning adhered to their non
							concurrence with it— The Loan and Woollen Bills were left among the
							unfinished business— The current appropriation Bills for all the
							Departments have been liberal enough—but the only Bill which I consider
							as a permanent benefit to the Nation, and creditable to the Congress
							just expired is the Bill for the gradual improvement of the Navy—
							Stripped as it was of half its worth, by the exclusion from it of a
							Naval Academy, which the Bill from the Senate had provided for. A local

							within a hairs breadth of losing the Bill— <persRef ref="storrs-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Storrs</persRef> was induced

							eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of
							Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and
							inheritance among them which are sanctified, by faith that is in me”— He
							gave a very particular and minute account of the success of the
							Missionaries from this Country at the Sandwich Islands— The first
							Mission there was in 1820. and the Islanders till then were in the
							primitive barbarism of the Savage State— The details of their manners
							were horrible and disgusting— Treachery and Cruelty; Parricide and
							Infanticide were among their most ordinary practices—they are now more
							than half civilized— Many thousands have learnt to read and write,
							observe the Sabbath, and have the gospel preached to them—</p>
						<p>On returning from Church I found <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi

							and never made any of Appointments which must be determined by the Heads
							of Departments, acting by certain indispensable rules; but said I would
							solicit the Appointment by the Secretary of the Navy. C. J. Ingersoll

						<p>Afternoon, I heard <persRef ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript"

							more of these marginal Notes— And I can scarcely conceive a more
							harassing, wearying, teazing condition of existence— It literally
							renders life burdensome: What retirement will be, I cannot realize, but
							have formed no favourable anticipation— It cannot be worse than this
							perpetual motion, and crazing cares— The weight grows heavier from day
							to day— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay says that these times of
							trouble, are the times which try the Spirits of men— Even so— And may
							our strength be proportioned to the ordeal through which we must

						<p>A Cabinet Meeting had been appointed for this day at one O’Clock.
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef> called early to say that he was much engaged with
							public Causes at the Supreme Court and asked, if he could be excused
							from attending here— I told him I could not dispense with his

							introduced <persRef ref="harris-abel">Abel Harris</persRef> of
							Portsmouth New-Hampshire, who came to solicit the appointment of Naval
							Officer there, when vacant— The death of the incumbent, <persRef ref="u"
								>Hall</persRef>, is expected shortly. <persRef ref="u"
								>Bowen</persRef> came to borrow money to buy a horse, instead of one
							he has lost by falling into a Well— <persRef ref="ruggles-benjamin"

								>Hendricks</persRef>, <persRef ref="marks-william">Marks</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="orr-robert">Orr</persRef>, are members of Congress who
							came to take leave. Cabinet Meeting at one— The question was whether a
							proclamation shall be issued, conformably to the Act of Congress of
							March 1823. to regulate commerce with the British Colonial Ports— There
							was much discussion upon the point, whether the proclamation was
							imperatively required by the Law—whether the time for issuing the
							proclamation was at the Discretion of the President, and whether he can
							suspend its operation, till the first of October, or of January next.
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> thought that the issuing of the Proclamation was
							positively required by the Law; but that the time was to some <unclear>ex</unclear>tent
							discretionary, and that its operation might be prospectively made. He
							said <persRef ref="vaughan-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Vaughan</persRef>, the British Minister had called on him yesterday,
							and requested that if the Proclamation should issue, it might be with
							some previous notice— I thought there could be no prospective suspension
							of the Law by the executive; but that it might be effected by remission
							of the forfeitures, until reasonable time of notice shall be given—
							There was a question whether the <unclear>tra</unclear>de had been <hi rend="italic"
								>prohibited</hi> by the British Laws, so that the Proclamation would
							be <unclear>re</unclear>quired, and concluded that it had— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay said that <persRef ref="thompson-smith">Judge Thompson</persRef> of
							the <unclear>Su</unclear>preme Court was of that opinion— After three hours of

							had promised took look into the Act of Congress of 30. March 1802. “to
							regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, and to preserve
							Peace on the frontiers”— The act upon which the prosecution of the
							Georgia Surveyors within the Indian Territory has been directed— The
							judge now suggested that there might be a Constitutional difficulty, in
							the execution of the Law— For which he referred to the
							Constitution—Article 3. Sect: 2. last paragraph: and to the 6<hi
								rend="superscript">th. </hi>Article of Amendment to the
							Constitution—securing to Criminals, a trial, <unclear>in</unclear> the State and District
							where the Crime was committed—whence Judge Johnson anticipates two

							admitted to have been within the State of Georgia, it will be contended
							that Congress could pass no Act prohibiting Surveys by authority of the
							State, and secondly, that Alabama claims the very Land where these
							Surveys were made—and if her claim be correct, the trial by the sixth
							Amendment to the Constitution must be in Alabama— I said I supposed the
							Georgia Surveyors would be estopped from pleading that they were
							surveying in the State of Alabama— The judge appeared very desirous of
							being relieved from trying the Cause, and said there could be no
							possible reliance upon a Georgia Jury to try it— But he said he should
							take occasion as soon as possible to send it for trial to the Supreme

								Graham</persRef> brought me to sign three Proclamations for the sale

							Superintendent <unclear>of</unclear> the Repairs on the Cumberland Road— I referred him
							to the <persRef ref="barbour-james">Secretary of War</persRef>, but
							observed I believed the choice was already made— Cabinet Meeting from
							one to half past four— The question upon issuing a Proclamation, under
							the act of Congress of 1. March 1823. was again discussed, and <persRef

								Canning’s</persRef> Notes to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi

							January were read— It was obvious that the British Government would
							adhere to their determination not to negotiate, on the subject of this
							trade, and whatever discretion the Executive might possess, <unclear>to</unclear> choose
							the time for issuing the Proclamation, it was unanimously concluded,
							that it could not with propriety be delayed so long as until the next
							Session of <unclear>Co</unclear>ngress; and that if delayed now, no adequate motive for
							issuing it could be assigned, at any subsequent Period before the
							Session— I requested <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef> to prepare a draught of the Proclamation,
							to be presented at a further Meeting, <unclear>at</unclear> ten O’Clock, the day after
							to-morrow, when the Attorney General may be able <unclear>to</unclear> attend— On
							examination of the Act of 1. March 1823—it was the prevailing <unclear>ul</unclear>timate opinion, that the exclusion of British vessels coming from the
							Colonies would take effect only from the time of its publication; and
							that there might <unclear>be</unclear> a remission of the forfeiture to vessels arriving
							without previous notice of <unclear>the</unclear> exclusion— M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>Cabinet Meeting at 10— <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef> had sent me yesterday a draught of a
							Proclamation, declaring, that the trade and intercourse between the
							United States, and Certain British Colonies, which had been opened by an
							Act of Parliament of June 1822. was now prohibited by two Acts of
							Parliament of 5. July 1825 and an Order in Council of 27. July 1826— I
							had made some slight alterations in the draught, and abridged it by one
							half. Some further alterations were made, and it was determined that it
							should be issued, to-morrow or the next day— I also requested <persRef
								key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> to
							prepare circular Instructions to the Collectors of the Customs; for
							carrying into effect the Navigation Acts of 1818 and 1820. There was
							some question whether the interdict upon British shipping from the
							Colonies, will not upon the issuing of the proclamation, operate
							retrospectively to the first of December last, the time at which the
							British Prohibition commenced, but I think the Law fairly susceptible of
							the Construction—that our interdict shall commence only upon and after
							the issuing of the Proclamation— The meeting was abridged, as <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> was
							engaged at the Supreme Court, in the argument, of a Cause, and <persRef
								ref="barbour-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef>, were to take the Steam-boat at four this
							afternoon, upon a tour to Point-Comfort and Norfolk— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush remained with me, perhaps two hours
							after the Meeting was over, and we conversed together on this thorny
							subject of the Colonial Trade; upon which he urged me to write for
							publication— I intend so to do, if I can command the necessary time—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay came in before Rush left me, and
							spoke of a draught he had some time since submitted of an Instruction to
								<persRef ref="poinsett-joel">Poinsett</persRef>, to propose to the
							Mexican Government the purchase of the Province <unclear>of</unclear> Texas to the Rio
							del Norte, or the Colorado— I asked him to let me see the draught again—
								<persRef ref="catlett-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								<persRef ref="cranch-william">Judge Cranch</persRef> came and took

								>my father</persRef>, which I had read, and upon which I had made

							Columbian Institute— I finished this day the signing of 1725

						<p>Immediately after Breakfast, at half past nine I walked to the Capitol,
							and in the Apartment of the Columbian Institute heard the Discourse upon
								<persRef ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> character, delivered
							by <persRef ref="cranch-william">Judge Cranch</persRef>— It was nearly

							was a vote of the Institute of thanks to judge Cranch, and that the
							Discourse should be printed for their use— The company assembled was not
							numerous, and consisted about one half of Ladies— The Meeting adjourned

						<p><date>18. V:15—</date> Cloudy— Rain— Storm.</p>
						<p>There came on this morning a heavy storm of rain, which detained me from
							attendance at Church— I finished a long Letter to <persRef
								ref="gallatin-albert">A. Gallatin</persRef>— I write few private
							Letters, and those under irksome restraints— I can never be sure of
							writing a line, that will not some day be published by friend or foe—
							Nor can I write a sentence susceptible of an odious misconstruction, but
							it will be seized upon and bandied about like a watchword for hatred and
							derision— This condition of things gives Style the Cramp— I wrote also
							the weekly Letter to <persRef ref="adams-george">my Son</persRef>— These
							at least will escape the torture of the Press— <persRef
								ref="wheaton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry
								Wheaton</persRef> called upon me to converse again upon his
							contemplated Mission as Charge d’Affaires to Denmark— He has yet to
							obtain the consent of <persRef ref="wheaton-seth">his father</persRef>;
							but hopes it will not be withheld— He has read the previous
							correspondence upon the claims, and I advised him to see and confer with
								<persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Connell</persRef> at Philadelphia— He goes for New-York to-morrow—
							In the afternoon although the Storm continued I attended Church at
								<persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker’s</persRef>, and heard him from Mark. 13.37— [“]And what I say
							unto you, I say unto all, Watch”— The auditory was very small, and the
							text more impressive than the discourse— In the Evening I walked to the
							Unitarian Church, expecting to hear <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Little</persRef>; but there was no
							service, doubtless owing to the weather— After returning home, I read
								<persRef ref="huskisson-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Huskisson’s</persRef> Speech in the House of Commons, on the 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May 1826. on the state of the
							shipping interest, and the Navigation Laws— He admits that in
							substituting reciprocity, for the old exclusive principle of the
							Navigation Act, they had proceeded upon compulsion, under the
							retaliatory discriminating duties of the United States— His whole
							argument for the adoption of this rule of reciprocity is
							necessity—imposed by the countervailing regulations of other Countries—
							Necessity, first to compound with the United States; and next to extend
							to other Countries the advantages already yielded to them. The further
							step of taking back from them, that which is now conceded to others, was
							taken more than two Months after the delivery of this Speech; but the
							fear and Jealousy of the United States which prompted to that measure
							are unequivocally disclosed in many passages of the Speech— <persRef
								ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> is better, though still
							confined to his chamber— The oppression upon my lungs <unclear>is</unclear> less than
							yesterday—but not removed.</p>

							the appointment of Engineer for constructing the Dry Docks at

							Never was the vital spark <unclear>ne</unclear>arer extinction and yet kept alive— He was

							Lord Jesus Christ, let him <unclear>be</unclear> Anathema Maran-atha. The grace of our
							Lord Jesus Christ be with you. My love be with you all in Christ Jesus
							Amen.” Why all this was given for a text did not appear. The Sermon was
							all upon the Anathema Maran-atha. Heard Little again in the Evening from
							Matthew 6–7.8— [“]But when ye pr<unclear>ay</unclear> use not vain repetition, as the

							The Vegetation of Spring is advancing— The weeping willows are in leaf;
