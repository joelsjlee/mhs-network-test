						<p>I planted in my Eastern bed 10 black 11. red Cherry Stones. 18 almond in
							shell and 6. unshelled— In the South bed where I planted nuts and acorns
							last November and December none of which have come up; while weeding it
							with my own hands I left growing several plants which came up
							spontaneously, and the growth of which I inclined to observe— There are
							many wild cherry trees, sprung from Stones dropped last Summer from an
							old tree standing near the bed— They came up about the first of May—
							Then a plant of Lettuce— Then four poppies— Mustard— Anthemis, and two
							or three more. This morning the first flower of the Anthemis opened— It
							is like whiteweed. I read in <persRef ref="duhamel-henri">Du
								Hamel</persRef> on sowing and planting, and on the physics of trees—
							In <persRef ref="loudon-john">Loudon’s</persRef> encyclopaedia of

							Looked into <persRef ref="nicholson-william">Nicholson’s</persRef>
							Encyclopaedia, Article Botany; and <persRef ref="eaton-amos"
								>Eaton’s</persRef> Manual. <persRef ref="randolph-david">M<hi

							returned last evening from a visit to Baltimore to see <persRef
								ref="maelzel-johann">Maelzel’s</persRef> autometon Chess-player.
								<persRef ref="willard-simon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Ingle</persRef> came as a Committee from the Residents on Capitol
							Hill—requesting that the building for the fire-engine and Hose at the
							Capitol may be located on the Hill, and not as some other persons
							desire, at the foot of the hill— They assigned very sufficient reasons
							for preferring the summit, although they mentioned that <persRef
								ref="bulfinch-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bulfinch</persRef> thought otherwise— I promised to see <persRef

								Todsen</persRef> came again to solicit the vacant Clerkship in the
							War Department. Said he had applied to Governor Barbour, who said he
							should attempt to go on with the business of the Department without
							supplying that vacancy— Todsen urged my interposition in his favour— I
							declined unless Governor Barbour should himself consult me— He did speak
							to me of Todsen’s application, and of his own intention not to fill the
							vacated office for the present— <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> mentioned that <persRef

							inspect the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal works had returned, and made

							He also offered for adjustment the account of <persRef

							for his attendance at the Circuit Court at Philadelphia in the <persRef
								ref="thomson-edward">Thompson</persRef> tea cases, all of which have

							Chargé d’Affaires to Denmark which I read and sent back to the

								ref="tudor-william2">W. Tudor</persRef> to take <persRef

								>r</hi> Wheaton— <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi

						<p>Shortened my walk to the Tyber Square; and spent two hours in the garden,
							chiefly in conversation with <persRef ref="ousley-john"
								>Ouseley</persRef>, who is an excellent and scientific gardener— The
							garden is small, and I would avail myself of the opportunity of becoming
							acquainted with the principal plants which it produces— Part of it has
							been abandoned to the weeds; and is overrun with them— There is a large
							weeping willow at the South-eastern corner, just within the fence, and
							on one side of the arched gate opening upon Pennsylvania avenue another
							willow of the same size is on the South side of the gate, and outside of
							the garden fence— Within the fence, on the South side of the garden, but
							North of the strip overrun with weeds is a row of well grown trees—a
							Tulip, a Red mulbery—two Ashes, and one Cornus Florida Dogwood— Near the
							turn of the Southwest Corner is a large wild cherry-tree— I found among
							the weeds, dock, plantain, Asters, Wild poppies, and plants which he
							called Shepherd’s purse, and Sour thistle—thence visiting the cultivated
							part, in a patch North of the middle alley, were Rue, Wormwood, Balm,
							Sage, Targon, Vervain, Mint, and Tansy— The Artichoke was in another
							quarter, and of flowers I retained the names of Hybiscus, African
							Marygold, Broadleaved Sage, and the Shrub Sbiria, improperly called
							Snow-Ball— These are perhaps not one in a hundred of the plants
							vegetating in the garden—a plant of which numbers are within the last
							week coming up in my seed bed, he told me was the Althea— I planted 23.
							Black-heart cherries in my eastern bed. Then returning to my Study read
							a few pages of the Preface to <persRef ref="duhamel-henri">Du
								Hamel</persRef> on planting— There is much good information in the
							Book— <persRef ref="vanwyck-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Wyck</persRef> came, and informed me that as <persRef
								ref="vanwyck-william">his brother</persRef> had declined to accept
							the appointment which was offered him of keeper of a Light House, he
							himself would gladly accept a similar appointment for one now building
							and which he understood be finished, and ready for a keeper next
							September— I told him I would bear it in mind— He said that his brother
							had involved him in his misfortunes, and was now keeping a school in
							some part of Pennsylvania— <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> came to say that he
							had sometime since engaged a Vessel at Norfolk, to carry to the African
							Colony a number of negroes adjudicated to the United States, as having
							been illegally imported— Twelve had been taken in at Norfolk and the
							vessel had proceeded to Savannah in Georgia, there to take in upwards of
							a hundred more— <persRef ref="peaco-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Peaco</persRef>, a Surgeon in the Navy had been employed as the
							agent to have charge of them for their conveyance to Africa, but a few
							days after his arrival at Savannah he was taken sick and died— The
							vessel which by the engagement was to be only twenty days at Savannah,
							had already been there that time, and now remains at a charge of
							demurrage to the Public, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard
							said he did not know whom to employ in the place of D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Peaco— I mentioned to him <persRef
								ref="todson-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Todsen</persRef>,
							as a professional Surgeon, accustomed to Southern Climates, and perhaps
							as well suited to this service, as any person, who could now be
							selected— I told him of the circumstances under which he had been
							dismissed from the service and his continual applications to be restored
							to it— I referred him to <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>, for a further account
							of Todsen’s character; observing that as I believed all his misfortunes
							had originated in the badness of his temper, that would constitute the
							principal objection to his appointment— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Southard said he would make enquiries of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wirt; and then confer with me again. <persRef ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Watkins</persRef> and <persRef

								>W. Elliot</persRef> on Capitol Hill. It agreed within a minute,
							with my own observation of the rising Sun this Morning. <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Skinner</persRef> came to say he
							had received a Letter from <persRef ref="willey-calvin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> C Willey</persRef> of Connecticut,
							mentioning his wish to be appointed Collector at Middletown, when the
							vacancy occurs in that Office which must be very shortly. I had received
							similar Letters from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Willey himself, and
							told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Skinner that the only possible
							objection to his appointment was his being a member of Congress— That
							would be a difficulty— <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Clay</persRef> and <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi

						<p><date>3. IV.</date> Sun rose 4:39.</p>
						<p>I finished this morning reading the Preface to <persRef
								ref="duhamel-henri">Du Hamel’s</persRef> Treatise upon sowing and
							planting. It contains a summary of the whole work, which is in six
							books, forming a Quarto Volume of about 400 pages besides the preface
							which is of 68— The first book treats of the Soils adapted to different
							trees. The second of the various modes of raising trees. The third of
							Nurseries and Batardicres— The fourth of Plantations from the Nursery.
							The fifth of raising Forests. And the sixth of the preservation and
							restoration of decayed Woods— The Summary itself gives me a favourable
							idea of the contents of the work, and many things are new to me, which I
							ought to have known at least half a century— One considerable difficulty
							is the nomenclature— Numerous words not to be found in the Dictionary of
							the Academy, and some which when found are not intelligibly defined— The
							writer is however clear, and there are many plates in the work, more
							explanatory than any description could be. I have suspended the Physique
							des Arbres, to take up this book. Heard <persRef ref="little-robert"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little</persRef> from
							Ecclesiastes 6.11. [“]Seeing there be many things that increase vanity,
							what is man the better? 12 For who knoweth what is good for man in this
							life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for
							who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?” M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Little explained the meaning of the term
							Vanity, as used in the Scriptures, and particularly in the Book of
							Ecclesiastes, observing that it was different from the sense in which
							the same word is now in common discourse applied to the character of
							persons. And he then gave a picture of the miseries and afflictions
							incident to human life in illustration of this Sentiment in the text,
							which is indeed the prevailing doctrine of that book— It is easy to fill
							up this outline— There is a natural disposition in man to brood over his
							afflictions, and to make himself more unhappy than he is— The Scriptures
							have added the sanction of religion to this Sentiment, and present the
							condition of man, as wretched because it is fallen— In the heathen
							mythology the moral and physical condition of man was represented as
							having undergone gradual depravation, but the variety of human life is
							not inculcated among the moralists of Greece and Rome— The Satyrist
								<persRef ref="persius">Persius</persRef> says</p>
						<lg><l>“O Curas Hominum! o quantum est in rebus inane!”</l></lg>
						<p>but in that Poet and still more in <persRef ref="juvenal"
								>Juvenal</persRef>, there are many traces of the influence of
							Christian ideas upon the opinions of the age—an influence, of which
							while it acted upon them they were themselves unconscious. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Little closed his discourse however by
							admitting that the condition of human life was now much happier than it
							was in the days of <persRef ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>— I have no
							doubt—but whether taking an average of individuals there is more
							enjoyment, or more suffering now than then— Of sensual pleasure no man
							now living can have enjoyed more than fell to the lot of Solomon— None
							can have been favoured with higher, nobler, more varied, or longer
							continued intellectual gratifications— And he contributed as much
							perhaps as man that ever lived to that very improvement in the Condition
							of his Species— But he was satiated with happiness, and after a youth of
							supernatural wisdom; and a manhood of unrivalled glory he wasted his old
							age in blasted, and impotent excitement; in idolatrous dotage, and in
							helpless repining at the nothingness of the delights which he could no
							longer relish— His wives and concubines found him as <persRef
								ref="daubigne-francoise">Madame de Maintenon</persRef> found
								<persRef ref="louis-xiv">Louis 14</persRef>. a not amusable man—
							With health of body and of mind, human life is in truth a condition of
							happiness in the main, interrupted by frequent sorrows. And while we
							assent with humble reverence to the estimates of life formed by unerring
							wisdom, we are not the less bound to receive and acknowledge with
							gratitude the blessings with which divine Providence has gladdened our
							existence— A Storm of rain, confined me at home, from the time of the
							morning service for the rest of the day— <persRef ref="giusta-antoine"
								>Antoine</persRef> brought me as a present from <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jullien</persRef> six Silk
							worms: three black, and three nearly white, one of which was beginning,
							and one preparing to spin the web around him—</p>

						<p>The rains of yesterday and last Night, turned me to my usual Winter’s
							walk round the Capitol Square, which as the Season advances has become a
							dull one— Upon my return a heavy Shower, excluded me from the garden—
							The Silk worm which commenced its web yesterday, had completely
							surrounded himself this morning, but was yet visible through the cocoon
							all this day— The two other black ones went into the same state last
							Night and this day. The web of the first is a bright golden yellow;
							those of the second and third are nearly white— I read the first Chapter
							of <persRef ref="duhamel-henri">Du Hamel</persRef> on Plantation— Upon
							the Soil suitable for Trees; which shews that judgment must be used in
							adapting the trees to be planted to the Soils in which they are to grow—
							He considers the soil not only of and near the surface, but even as deep
							as the roots of the trees will delve, as subject of grave consideration.
							The trees of wet and dry soils, of clay sand and gravel, of chalk and of
							Stone— The trees for large forests, and for low thickets for groves and
							arbours for hedges and walls, for warren’s, and partridge
							coves—shrubbery or single Standard, are all discriminated, and a
							description and engraving are given of an Auger (Tariere) to bore the
							earth six, eight, or ten feet deep, and thence bring up a sample of the
							stratum of earth there hidden— He gives it as a general rule, that
							whatever the soil near the surface may be, if rock or chalk be found
							within the depth to which the roots strike, the tree will be stunted— I
							examine my three flower Pots almost every hour of the day to witness the
							process of vegetation. <persRef ref="bourne-george">George M.
								Bourne</persRef> came suddenly this morning again to solicit a
							place— He is one of the two Sons of <persRef ref="bourne-sylvanus"
								>Sylvanus Bourne</persRef>, many years Consul at Amsterdam, and has
							been seven or eight years— In the interval he has been twice or three
							times to France and Holland, to New-Orleans, to New-Harmony and I know
							not where— Always a burden upon Charity, and always coming back to
							represent himself at death’s door, to be saved from perishing only by an
							office— His condition is pitiable— I advised him to go and fix himself
							somewhere— To exert himself to obtain a subsistence as others do, and
							quietly to wait, till there may be an opportunity to do something for
							him— While he was here came <persRef ref="coulon-helene">Madame
								Coulon</persRef>, Mother to <persRef ref="armstrong-andrew">Andrew
								Armstrong</persRef> who has been Consular Agent at Port au Prince in
							the Island of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Domingo. The Government
							there having repeatedly demanded to be recognized, and we having
							declined to comply with that request, finally refused to consider him as
							the authorised Agent of the United States, upon which he was some Months
							since ordered to come home— He has not yet arrived but his mother now
							came to solicit another place for him, suggesting and urging that her
							subsistence depended greatly upon him— I told her that I would do for
							her Son what might be in my power— <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> came and took the
							papers in the case of the British Barque Lord Wellington, the forfeiture
							of which for bringing a number of Passengers beyond that authorised by
							the Law, I have ordered to be remitted. <persRef ref="southard-samuel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard</persRef> read me a
							Letter from <persRef ref="sands-joshua">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sands</persRef> of New-York, complaining that <persRef
								ref="chauncey-isaac">Commodore Chauncey</persRef> had taken military
							possession of the Land at the Navy-Yard, the title to which is claimed
							by him, and also that his Letter proposing to refer the question to
							arbitrators had not been answered— I advised that an answer should
							immediately be sent him, declining an arbitration— Stating that the
							title of the United States to the Land is believed to be good; and that
							if his claim and those of other individuals to parts of the Land can be
							sustained, it must be settled by the Courts of Law— Southard spoke also
							of <persRef ref="todson-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Todsen</persRef>, concerning whom he had made enquiries, and had
							received various information, which he thought upon the whole rendered
							the appointment of him to the African Agency of doubtful expediency.
							Todsen himself was afterwards here, and had heard from some person that
							his name had been mentioned by me to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Southard, for this appointment— He was extremely anxious to obtain it— I
							referred him to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard, but without
							giving him any encouragement— He came again after seeing M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard; and said he believed he should
							obtain the place— This evening, at the request of the <persRef
								ref="cass-lewis">Governor</persRef> and Legislative Council of the
							Michigan Territory, I remitted a fine imposed by the Superior Court of
							the Territory upon <persRef ref="teneyck-jeremiah">Jeremiah Van

						<p>Although the morning was cold, I bathed and swam about ten minutes from
							the rock, alone— Then spent two hours in the garden, where at every
							visit enquiries multiply upon me— In this small garden of less than two
							Acres, there are forest and fruit trees, shrubs, hedges, esculent
							vegetables, kitchen and Medicinal herbs, hot house plants, flowers and
							weeds, to the amount I conjecture of at least one thousand. One half of
							them perhaps are common weeds, most of which have none but the botanical
							name— I ask the name of every plant I see— <persRef ref="ousley-john"
								>Ousley</persRef> the Gardener knows almost all of them by their
							botanical names, but the numbers to be discriminated, and recognized,
							are baffling to the memory, and confounding to the judgment— From the
							small patch where the medicinal herbs stand together I plucked this
							morning leaves of Balm, and Hyssop, Marjoram, Mint, Rue, Sage, Tansy,
							Targon, and Wormwood, one half of which were known to me only by the
							name— The Tarragon, not even by that— I read the second chapter of
								<persRef ref="duhamel-henri">Du Hamel</persRef>, upon the climate
							and exposition, adapted to different trees— He divides them generally
							into mountain and valley trees, and marks the quarters of the compass to
							be considered in fixing their various sites— <persRef

							the Government of Brazil—and induced them to offer that promise of
							satisfaction for all just complaints which they have made through their
							Charge d’Affaires here, <persRef ref="rebello-silvestre"
								>Rebello</persRef>; and he said that he hoped the Confidence which I
							had so often shewn him would not be withdrawn— I told him that my

							that I had thought it would have been better, if he had before taking
							that step Consulted his Government. <persRef ref="calvert-george2">M<hi

						<p>My bath was again alone, and cold— My garden stroll becoming anxious— I
							examined the weeds which have grown up in one small Strawberry bed, set
							out by the gardener last Autumn— They amount to ten or twelve
							conspicuous and prevalent—Amaranth, Ambrosia, Buckwheat, Broad and
							narrow leaved Dock— Goosefoot or Hogweed, Knot-grass, broad and narrow
							leaved Plantain, Shepherd’s purse, and Thorn-apple, or Datura
							Stramonium; and Veronica; or Speedwell— A few only of these are in
							blossom, and many repetitions both of the sight of the plant and of the
							name it bears, are necessary to fix almost every one of them distinctly
							in my mind— I was thus occupied till breakfast time and had none for
							reading <persRef ref="duhamel-henri">Du Hamel</persRef>— I had sent for
								<persRef ref="elgar-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Elgar</persRef>, and I spoke with him concerning the City Surveyor;
							he did not think himself authorised to make any payments to him from
							public funds— He considers him now as a Corporation Officer, to be
							compensated by fees, or at the charge of the City, though he had given
							him a commission, under an opinion of the Circuit Court of the District
							that this was necessary to the legality of his appointment. I mentioned
							the application of <persRef ref="matthews-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Matthews</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="weightman-roger">R. C. Weightman</persRef>, as a Committee from
							the Washington Library Society, for Land on which to erect the building
							for keeping their books— He said there might be a sale to them at an
							easy price, unless they should wish some of the reserved Lands, not
							intended for sale— I desired him to see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Matthews and ascertain from him, where they wished to place their
							building— I referred also to the application from <persRef
								ref="may-frederick">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> May</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="ingle-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ingle</persRef>, in behalf of the House holders on the Capitol Hill,

								ref="carroll-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Carroll</persRef> was the only person who objected to its being on
							the top of the Hill; because it will intercept the view of the Capitol,
							from a corner house there belonging to him— He said all the other
							inhabitants on the hill being anxious to have the building at the
							summit, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Carroll had withdrawn his
							objection; and nevertheless still urged that when he had built his
							house, it was with the expectation that the space between it and the
							Capitol would always remain open— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Elgar that the convenience to the Capitol and the neighbourhood was
							obviously so much greater in having the building at the top of the hill,
							and there being only one objector to many Petitioners, the objection too
							being ostensibly withdrawn, I thought the building should be erected on
							the top of the Hill— Elgar told me he had at <persRef ref="foy-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Foy’s</persRef> request, fenced
							round, a plot of the yard west of the House for my use as a Nursery for
							trees and plants— <persRef ref="todson-george">D<hi rend="superscript"

								Southard’s</persRef> objections to appointing him to the agency
							vacated by the Death of <persRef ref="peaco-john">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Peaco</persRef>, and he made an
							argument to prove his fitness for the place— I told him that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard had probably made other
							arrangements, and that I believed he must wait until there should be
							some other opportunity for employing him— <persRef ref="raguet-condy"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Raguet</persRef> came, and
							observing that he should leave the City to-morrow Morning to return to
							Philadelphia, read me several Letters, relating to his departure from
							Rio de Janeiro and some to sustain his opinion that the Government
							there, will be shortly overthrown— One of the Letters was from <persRef
								ref="gordon-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gordon</persRef>
							the British Minister, who had been long confined by illness to his
							chamber; but who expressing great regret at his intended departure, and
							a candid opinion that the step he had taken was stronger than the
							circumstances would justify tendered his friendly good offices to
							produce a reconciliation so as to avert his departure— His answer which
							he also read declined accepting this interposition, unless he should be
							assured it was desired by the Brazilian Government, which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gordon of course could not state— He said
							he had afterwards a personal interview with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gordon, from whom he parted upon the most friendly terms. He
							said he had been well aware that the step he had taken was one of very
							great responsibility; but he was yet confident that nothing short of it
							would have prevailed upon the Brazilian Government, to give us any
							satisfaction for their numerous wrongs— <persRef ref="u">M<hi

						<p>The mornings are yet cool, and the river water cold, but as the morning
							tide s<unclear>erves</unclear> I dive from the boat, alone, and swim to the shore— The
							tide being this morning high I ascended the bluff, and plucked a weed,
							which my living dictionary <persRef ref="ousley-john">Ousley</persRef>
							told me was yarrow— I took also from the fields a plant of common woolly
							Mullein, which I knew and compared it with the moth Mullein in the
							garden, a totally different plant. There are two plants one of which
							Ousley called Comefry, and the other Grounsel which were altogether

							seen and known but forgotten— The leaves of Plants are extremely
							imperfect, and somewhat deceptive tests of discrimination— That is
							reserved to the flower, of which a small proportion are in bloom at one
							time— I planted this morning a few ripe strawberries to ascertain if
							their seeds would vegetate— I had time to read only a very few pages of
								<persRef ref="duhamel-henri">Du Hamel</persRef> in the third chapter

								<persRef ref="salmon-hilario">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Salmon</persRef> the Spanish Charge d’Affaires’s complaint of
							violations of neutrality by <persRef ref="porter-david">Commodore
								Porter</persRef>. It was deemed important to prevent him from making
							use of his station at Key-West for annoyance against Spain— But of the
							precise authority of the Executive to restrain him by force, and of the
							mod in which it should be exercised were much discussed— It was finally
							concluded that the Secretary of the Treasury should write to the
								<persRef ref="pinckney-william2">Collector at Key west</persRef>,
							directing him generally not to permit any violation of neutrality by the
							Commodore, and particularly that he should not be allowed to fit out his
							prizes there as privateers; and then ordering them to return there with
							their prizes, and that he should not be allowed to arm and in any manner
							increase his force there— Instructions are to be given by the Secretary
							of the Navy to the <persRef ref="ridgeley-charles">Commander of our West
								India Squadron</persRef> to touch occasionally at Key West and give
							to the Collector any aid of force that he may need to enforce his
							discharge of his duties; the Instructions to the Collector and those to
							the Commander of the Squadron, are to be adapted to each other, and the
							answer by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Salmon is to be conformable to them— Attention is however to
							be given to two important points—one to authorize no act of force of
							doubtful legality— The other not to endanger the life and health of the
							men in our public ships, by requiring them to remain any length of time
							at this and the approaching Season of the year at key West. I requested
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay to answer a Letter that I have

						<p>I had a bad night—little repose, and by a feverish restlessness rose from

							hanging upon my hands— As soon as there was daylight enough to allow me
							to read, I finished <persRef ref="duhamel-henri">Du Hamel’s</persRef>
							third Chapter and first Book on planting— His remarks on Mountain
							Trees—on Whitewoods and aquatic trees— Of trees for alleys in Gardens
							and Parks—for Palissades and Arbours for warrens and coveys—for Massive
							Forests, Avenues, High ways Hedges and Quincunxes, all have their
							interest, though not all suited to the taste of the Age, and some of
							them not to the usages of this Country— The principles are applicable to
							all times, and to every Country— For the perfection of the tree, it
							should be suited to the soil and climate where it is to grow—for
							purposes of economy, plantations should be made for the profit to be
							derived from them— The uses of plants and trees are numberless, for all
							the comforts, and enjoyments of civilized life, and they are adaptable
							to every stage of civilization— At five I went to the boat, and swam
							about 15 minutes to the Shore— Then visited the garden, and noticed the
							patch where the seedling esculent vegetables were in blossom— The deep
							blood coloured beet, the white flowered carrot, and yellow flowered
							Parsnip— The enormous leaved Horse radish, and the tall and Slender
							stemmed Jerusalem Artichoke—with those numerous weeds are growing in
							rank luxuriance; though I found none new— I appealed again to my
							nomenclator, the gardener for the names of various weeds which he had
							told me before, but which I had forgotten, and fixed some of them more
							determinately in my mind— I put 28 red cherry stones into the ground. I

							of unrelaxing attention will be necessary to accomplish any thing useful
							for posterity, and after all it may terminate in disappointment— This
							night I change my bedchamber, in the hope of obtaining less unquiet

						<p>The first decided Summers day— Began reading <persRef ref="duhamel-henri"
								>Du Hamel’s</persRef> second Book on Plantation— On the various
							modes of propagating trees— 1. By seed. 2. By slips. 3 by layers 4. by
							Suckers. 5. by grafting— The first he recommends as the best, although
							you are never sure of raising the same variety that is planted— The
							second chapter treats of trees which are raised by slips—the third by
							layers: the fourth by suckers, and the fifth by grafting; and budding—
							On going out about five, I measured by pacing the four sides of the
							ground just fenced in for my use as a Nursery— I count 2 1/2 feet to
							each of my paces, and by this rule I find the enclosure contains 1 1/5
							Acre not quite. I swam from the boat about a quarter of an hour and then
							visited my garden beds. I found one of my casual poppies in flower a
							dark violet with a Corolla, of four Petals— The mustard is also in
							flower and has attained a height of five feet— The wild cherries which
							came up about the first of May, are none of them more than four inches
							high— The Altheas are coming up every day—the first appeared about the
								20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May, and the Seed leaves were
							open about ten days before the leaf proper pushed forth. As <persRef

								Little</persRef>, this morning from Ecclesiastes 3:11. [“]He hath
							made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in
							their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from
							the beginning to the end”— There was a connection between this discourse
							and that of last Sunday Morning. In this text there is an obscurity of
							expression, which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little did not attempt
							to explain— There is an apparent disconnection between the premises and
							the conclusion—the words he hath set the world in their heart convey an
							indistinct idea— The Latin vulgate and the German Translations say more
							intelligibly—“He makes every thing good in its time; and lets their
							heart perplex itself, how it shall go in the world—for man cannot indeed
							find out the work that God does—neither beginning nor end[”]— <persRef
								ref="thomson-charles">Thomson’s</persRef> translation of the
							Septuagint changes entirely the thought and says “All the things which
							he made, considered as a <hi rend="italic">whole</hi>, are good in his
							time. But with regard to all things considered as <hi rend="italic">one
								whole</hi>, to them he hath assigned the whole age so that no man
							can find out the work which God hath done from beginning to end.” This
							is a paraphrase; more obscure than the common English translation, and
							refined almost into nonsense— The text is in the middle of the Chapter
							which commences with the assertion that to every thing there is a
							season, and a time to every purpose under heaven— The thought in the
								11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> verse seems to be—every thing is
							good in its time— Men make them selves anxiously busy with prying into
							the management of the world, but it is beyond the reach of human
							enquiry. This <pb type="ms" n="219"/>is intelligible enough, and
							corresponds with the purport of the whole chapter, and of the Book. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Little dwelt principally upon the last
							clause of the verse—the absurdity of attempting to account for things
							from the beginning to the end— In the afternoon I heard <persRef
								ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker</persRef>
							from Joshua 22.20. [“]Did not <persRef ref="achan">Achan</persRef> the
							son of <persRef ref="zerah">Zerah</persRef> commit a trespass in the
							accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and
							that man perished not alone in his iniquity.” M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Baker told the whole story of Achan’s trespass and of his
							punishment; but this text is only an allusion to it by Joshua, when
							first informed of the proposal of the two and a half tribes, to settle
							on the East side of the Jordan, and he supposed they intended to
							separate themselves from the rest of the tribes and renounce their
							religion— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker’s train of thought was in
							that direction— The trespass in the accursed thing to him was
							infidelity—and infidelity was a disbelief of the atonement— His zeal is
							very ardent and very sincere— In the Evening I heard M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Little again— It was within one day of the
							fifth anniversary since the opening of this Church; and he took the
							occasion for a renewed exposition of the Unitarian doctrines— His text
							was from Ephesians 4:15 “Speaking the truth, in love”— There was of
							course little more than a Summary of the opinions which he has been
							during that time inculcating— He said however it had been alleged that
							he had changed his ground; that the character of the principles which he
							now maintained was not the same with that of the system upon which he
							had commenced— This he very explicitly denied, and in proof of the
							denial, he read a large extract from the Sermon which he preached at the
							dedication of the Church— The allegation itself of any change in the
							complexion of his discourses seems to me quite unfounded— I walked this
							morning in the garden, and after dinner round the grounds in front of
							the House— Found the second of my poppies in blossom— A single flower,
							the petals of a delicate carnation colour— My attention is turning to
							the Suckers from some of the trees, and I first noticed one from the
							paper mulberry which may be set out the next Autumn— I read part of
								<persRef ref="duhamel-henri">Du Hamel’s</persRef> Chapter 6. of Book
							2. on the propogation of trees by seeds— With a description of the
							different kinds of Seeds, and of the signs by which they are known to be
							ripe— Read also a few pages of <persRef ref="locke-john"
								>Locke’s</persRef> outlines of Botany, and turned over the pages of
								<persRef ref="loudon-john">Loudon’s</persRef> Encyclopaedia of
							gardening— The warmth of the day was oppressive.</p>

							be transplanted, say two inches above its junction with the main stem
							put a small peg into the slit to keep it from closing again—passed a

						<p>The attractions of the Garden, and the objects of curiosity constantly
							multiplying upon my attention there have rendered my walks abroad for
							mere exercise tedious, and irksome— So that I have omitted them the last
							three days— But this morning after planting in my eastern seed bed 18
							whole red cherries, and visiting the Southern bed where the casual
							poppies are now all (six) in flower—the mustard and Anthemis in full
							blossom—the Althaeas still coming up, and the wild cherries apparently
							stationary. I remarked that the strawberries are ceasing, and the
							currants red and black becoming ripe— The Catalpa trees are in full and
							beautiful blossom, and the Holyoke’s Bladder Senna, and other flowers
							are blossoming— The rue, sage, and Hyssop are also in bloom— I remarked
							that the Honey Bees, had keen relish for the Poppy-flowers, and the
							wasps for the wormwood though not in blossom— The border of Thyme is
							still in full-bloom— I walked after leaving the garden, half way to
							College Hill— My Apple pippin in the flower pot, shed its shell,
							forty-eight hours after its first appearance on the surface of the
							ground— This seed must have been barely covered with the earth— I sowed
							several of them thus, and others as much as two inches deep— It was
							raised about half an inch above the surface, when the shell was ready to
							drop off; and the seed opened itself into two greenish seed leaves, with
							a plume already formed between them. I procured four small boxes for the
							purpose of preserving cherry stones and other seeds to be sown and

							one of the finest trees I ever saw— Umbrella formed— I should judge
							fifty feet high, and ten feet in circumference— These are all valuable
							Oaks, none of which grows in the vicinity of Boston— On my return I
							picked up in the road 8 small red cherries, the stones of which I
							propose to plant— In the garden I planted 10 whole Strawberries just
							covering them over with Earth— I found this morning a second apple
							pippin coming up in the flower pot— It had cast its shell before coming
							to the surface having been planted deeper than the other. It came up by
							a stem issuing from the germ and bent downwards—in the course of the
							day, the stem raised the split seed so that the two seed leaves or
							cotyledons presented their surface obliquely towards the light of the
							window— The plume made its first appearance— That of the first risen
							seed expanded itself into two leaves proper, showing still a feather
							shooting from them— The radicle and the plume spring from the same germ—
							The books say that the movement of the radicle is always downward, and
							that of the plume always upward— But it seems to be the radicle that
							throws up the seed leaves out of the ground— These however rise only
							high enough to unfold themselves to the Sun, and the plume shoots out
							from them like the inner tube of a spyglass from the outer one— I
							finished reading the second Book of <persRef ref="duhamel-henri">Du
								Hamel</persRef> on planting— The observations upon the various kinds
							of seeds, upon nurseries, upon propagating trees, by Suckers, layers,
							grafting and budding <pb type="ms" n="222"/>are interesting, and to me

							convicted of Man-Slaughter— The jurymen by whom he was convicted,
							recommended him to the lenity of the Court, who sentenced him only to
							one Month’s imprisonment, and a fine of ten dollars— I doubted the
							expediency of still further mitigating this Sentence, at least for the
							term of Imprisonment— The other was an application for pardon for a man
							convicted of Murder in Alabama—forwarded by his Council: whose own
							Statement of the case makes it a very atrocious murder— I took both
							these cases for Consideration— <persRef ref="jones-roger">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Jones</persRef> the Adjutant General

							chiefly, who by the existing regulations are allowed the pay of their
							Brevet rank as Major’s only when they are in command of a Battalion or
							five Companies— The new regulation will allow it when they are in
							command of two Companies— I assented to the alteration, and Col<hi

							vegetation, and one with a radicle near two inches long, but no stem nor
							severance of the seed in two— I recovered it with the earth— The chesnut
							seemed a little swollen at the germ I replaced it— The Strawberries
							remained, all the juices of the pulp being withdrawn, an adhesive
							semblance of skin, with the seeds unaltered in their places without
							appearance of vegetation— I left the Pot containing the apple pippins
							exposed for two or three hours this morning to the action of the Sun,
							made more intense by passing through the window glass— The apple tree
							which first came up, and which untill then had grown with vigorous and
							rapid vegetation, began then as rapidly to decline, and this Evening has
							all the appearance of withering— <persRef ref="duhamel-henri">Du
								Hamel</persRef> says that this happens to great multitudes of
							Plants, without assigning any cause— But I attribute this to the fierce
							heat of the Sun— The second pippin, which came up yesterday morning,
							drooped also very much this day, after its exposure, but revived much in
							the Evening. <persRef ref="taliaferro-john">M<hi rend="superscript"

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="little-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Little</persRef> this Morning, from 1. Corinthians 1.23. “But we
							preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the
							Greeks foolishness; 24. But unto them which are called, both Jews and
							Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.” After some
							historical notices of the occasion upon which this Epistle was written
							and the purposes of the Apostle in writing it, he gave his own view of
							the meaning of the text, and argued against the doctrines deduced from
							it by the Calvinists, and Trinitarians— In the afternoon I went to
								<persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Baker’s</persRef>, where after the congregation had been some time
							assembled <persRef ref="handy-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Handy</persRef> gave noticed that there would be no afternoon
							service; and I attended at S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> John’s Church,
							where <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Drain</persRef>
							read the Evening prayers for the first Sunday after Trinity and preached
							from Psalm 102.26. “They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all
							of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change
							them, and they shall be changed. 27. But thou art the same, and thy
							years shall have no end.” It was a sensible and well written discourse
							upon the immutability of God. More in the Style of episcopal clergymen,
							formerly in fashion, than in that which many of them have more recently
							adopted— It was a regularly divided Sermon, and successively considered
							the immutability of the divine being in reference to his mercy, his
							promises and his justice. The preacher was quite a young man, and the
							modesty of his tone and manner was prepossessing in his favour. In the
							Evening I heard again M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little, from Luke
							21.16. [“]And ye shall be betrayed both by Parents, and brethren, and
							kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to
							death. 17. And ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake 18. But
							there shall not an hair of your head perish. 19. In your Patience
							possess ye your Souls.”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little admits
							that Jesus Christ exercised the Power of prophecy and considers this
							prediction of the destruction of the Temple, as one of the most
							remarkable instances of it. He alluded to the fact that this Gospel of
							Luke was published several years before the fulfilment of this prophecy.
							There is great difficulty in conceding the gift of prophecy, and the
							power of working miracles with the denial that Christ was more than a
							human being— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Little dwelt not long upon
							this aspect of his text, but proceeded to the illustration of it, by
							urging it as an exhortation to firmness and self possession under
							calumny and persecution. This part of his discourse was impressive and
							not ineloquent—partaking too much however of that habitual train of
							thought which pervade almost all of his Sermons— The Morning had been at
							high Summer heat, as was yesterday and last Night— A short gust; with a
							light sprinkling of rain, and without thunder, was followed by a
							North-western breeze, a clear sky, and an evening uncommonly cool for
							the season— I took a short walk in the Garden this Morning— And read the
							chapter of <persRef ref="duhamel-henri">Du Hamel’s</persRef> third Book
							on Plantations which treats of Nurseries, of the Seasons for planting in
							them, and of transplanting from them.</p>

							regard to his honour, and integrity, and as the Court of enquiry to
							which they were submitted, exonerated Henderson he now wishes to remove
							Kuhn from the Office of paymaster, and wrote to the Secretary of the
							Navy, to that effect— A correspondence between them ensued the result of
							which is an opinion of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard, that the
							Commandant has not the right of appointing the paymaster, but that he
							should be appointed by the President during the recess, and by
							nomination to the Senate, at their Session— The question depends upon
							the construction of three or four Acts of Congress: which M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Southard thinks have been incorrectly
							construed; but upon two of which at least, my opinion inclines to the
							old Construction— And upon the other I am not entirely without doubt.
							After discussing the subject with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Southard, I requested that there might be a consultation with the

							practice entirely new, and opposite to that which has been long

							the age of Midshipmen, and been five years in service, should be
							entitled to an examination; after which they shall receive a new Warrant
							as passed Midshipmen—with additional pay and rank over all Midshipmen
							not passed— I agreed to this and requested that an addition to it should
							be made that no person should receive a Midshipmans warrant under 14
							years of age— The papers relating to the trial of <persRef

							heavy loss— <persRef ref="slacumb-george">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Slacum</persRef> our Consul at Buenos Ayres, called to
							pay a morning visit and said he should go upon an excursion to the
							North, in about a fortnight— The weather was again so cool, that I took
							my morning bath in the river alone, and not without hesitation— I then
							came to the Garden: and planted 12 whole cherries— Held my now customary
							conference with <persRef ref="ousley-john">Ousley</persRef> the
							Gardener, who told me the names of several flowers and weeds, some of
							them perhaps for the fourth or fifth time— It would take me six Months
							of this listening, from day to day, to know at sight the names of the
							herbage and Plants, in this single Garden— The Chrysanthemum resembles
							the Anthemis, and is the common white-weed patricianised into a Garden
							flower— He had several plants procured from the Dutch Minister, and the
							names of which he did not know— And there was Balsam, Larkspur,
							Sympathum, Sweet and everlasting pea. Red single, and white double
							Holly-hocks in flower, and the double carnation pink, which cannot yield
							seed— In my old seedling bed, Ousley discovered a plant newly risen
							which he took for a Lilac, and I discovered one of my Pennsylvania
							Walnuts which came up yesterday— The only one of at least one hundred
							nuts and acorns that I planted here last November and December— In my
							Flower pot, a fifth Apple pippin shewed itself— The second put forth two
							Apple leaves which should be at right angles with the Cotyledons— These
							have spread to the size of a common peach kernel, and stand on a stem
							raised about an inch and a half from the ground— Antoine procured me two
							quart glass tumblers, and filled them with earth— I put into one of them
							ten orange seeds one whole Cherry, one Almond, and two cherry stones,
							which I covered with earth, and placed close to the side of the glass,
							where I see them, and wish if possible to see the first process of
							vegetation— I took the idea from <persRef ref="duhamel-henri">Du

							ground laid out in beds, at first all sown to grass— The Beds to be
							taken in succession, for the plants to be introduced from time to time—
							I visited with him the front-yard, and examined the places East and West
							of the House where last November I had with him planted Chesnuts, Acorns
							and Walnuts, but not one of them appears— They are much overgrown with

							motives of curiosity— Cartagena speaks no other language than Spanish;
							wherefore I could hold no discourse with him— They were both men of
							respectful deportment—and made their visit short. In the garden this
							morning I mistook the Lupine for the African Marigold, and enquired
							again the names of several plants which had been repeatedly told me— The
							French Marigold was shewn me differing altogether from the African— My
							Pennsylvania Walnut was as yesterday— I planted 11. whole cherries which
							completed the row— Foy recognized the Oxalis or wood-sorrel, the Echium
							vulgare or wild bugloss and the Verbascum Blattaria, or Moth Mullein— I
							planted 12 red cherry-stones entirely fresh—round the sides of a
							tumbler, filled with earth. The second of my apple pippins, puts forth a
							third leaf proper; the plume still appearing distinct from them all— Its
							appearance is extremely frail and delicate, always threatening to wither
							and perish. The last three came up like the first with the shell yet
							over the seed— I took one of them off when it remained barely as a cap
							over the cotyledons, and they parted like the two sides of a pair of
							pincers relieved from the pressure of an elastic Spring— These last
							comers are more puny than the first— Three of the Silk-worms came out
							this Morning as white Moths.</p>

								Little</persRef> from Philippians 3.12. [“]Not as though I had
							already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after if
							that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ
							Jesus. 13. Brethren I could not myself to have apprehended: but this one
							thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth
							unto those things which are before, 14. I press toward the mark for the
							prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.” The discourse was
							elaborate, to shew that Christianity is essentially a system of
							improvement— That progressive virtue is its peculiar characteristic— My
							impression at first was that this position was too obvious to need
							illustration; but as the argument was ingenious as well as earnest, I
							came at last to view it as an important aspect of the system.
							Progressive improvement is indeed the great doctrine of Christianity; as
							a code of morals, and it is perhaps in no other religion of ethics— In
							the afternoon I heard a Stranger at <persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bakers</persRef>, from Hebrews 2.3
							“How shall we escape if we neglect so great Salvation?” A minatory
							Sermon; but the preacher had little eloquence, and not much Logic— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Baker was in the pulpit with him— After
							dinner I rode with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Adams</persRef> round by the Capitol
							and College Hills, and heard again in the Evening M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Little from Acts 17.26. [“]And hath made
							of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the
							Earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of
							their habitation; 27 That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might
							feel after him, and find him though he be not far from every one of
							us.”— Although the text was changed, the Sermon seemed a continuation of
							that of the Morning— The Silk worms are now all turned to whitish Moths,
							are in pairs, and several of them laying eggs nearly white, which from
							day to day, fade into a dunnish yellow, and darken into brown— My apples
							tree N. 2 this day shews a fourth leaf proper nearly formed, and now
							exhibits a perceptible stem above the seed leaves— This is the only one
							of the five which came up the growth of which has been apparently
							natural—the seed leaves of the two others yet surviving came up cramped
							by the shell still covering them, and they never have unfolded
							themselves perfectly— I infer that by the process of nature, the shell
							should be cast off, before the seed comes out of the ground.</p>

						<p>In my walk to the fields, I plucked three or four plants, growing wild by

							one or two more which <persRef ref="ousley-john">Ousley</persRef> did
							not know— I enquired further of garden plants but only repeated names,
							told me before— There was a shoot coming up; perhaps a cherry Stone

							from the seed— The single Pennsylvania walnut in the Southern bed, which

							attempt to turn the attach upon <persRef ref="thornton-william2"
								>Lieutenant Thornton</persRef>, the Officer who accused him, by

							intended to order her immediately to proceed upon her cruize to the
							coast of Labrador, for the protection of the fisheries— But she needs
							repairs, which cannot be completed in less than six weeks— The fishery
							cruize is therefore likely to fail for the present Season— I observed
							that if the repairs could be completed so that she could sail by the
							first of August, she should still be despatched, as she would then still
							have a practicable cruize of two Months; but that she would have then no
							time to spare— <persRef ref="roberdeau-mary">Miss Mary
								Roberdeau</persRef> came to pass some days here. I walked this
							morning to what are called the Slashes, and plucked unknown Plants and
							weeds as I went. Among them was the Teucrium Canadense, or wild

							Betony by <persRef ref="ousley-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ousley</persRef>, but which I do not find in <persRef
								ref="bigelow-jacob">Bigelow</persRef>, a Solanum, and leaves of the

							walk, are not numerous, and when I have ascertained the name of one, I
							find myself surprized to observe how often it recurs— In the garden I
							planted 12 Armistead Apricot Stones, and 9. Alberge Plum stones— I
							observed that three more Pennsylvania Walnuts, had come up in my
							Southern bed— Those in the other bed had scarcely advanced at all since
							yesterday— In my seedling pot N. 1. came up an Apple pippin N. 6. having
							cast its shell— The orange shoot grows to a considerable degree; the
							leaves imperceptibly swelling out. Of the Garden vegetables I this day
							discovered the Martinia, Vervain and red pepper. I took up this Evening
							the subject of the Colonial Trade with Great-Britain, which has now for
							several weeks been overlooked— At two O’Clock this afternoon, <persRef
								ref="devaughn-jonathan">Jonathan De Vaughn</persRef> was hanged at
							Alexandria, for the murder of <persRef ref="martin-tobias">Tobias

								Anderson</persRef> the Comptroller came to me in a state of warm
							excitement at an incident, which has recently occurred at West Point—
							His ninth Son <persRef ref="anderson-george2">George W.
								Anderson</persRef>, was one of the youths offered for admission to
							the Academy— One of the regulations directs that no candidate for
							admission shall be received who is deformed or diseased infectiously, or
							disqualified by it for military service (1338). In execution of this
							rule, the Candidates for admission this year, were for the first time
							required to undergo the inspection of a Surgeon, naked— Three of them, a
								<persRef ref="clay-henry2">Son</persRef> of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay, a <persRef ref="reed-isaac">Son</persRef> of <persRef
								ref="reed-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Reed</persRef> the
							late Senator from Mississippi, and Anderson refused to submit to this
							examination, and were not admitted— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Anderson shewed me the Letter from his Son, who was at a College in
							Pennsylvania, soliciting that he would obtain for him a Warrant as a
							Cadet, and that in which he gives the account of his rejection for
							refusing to submit to this inspection, and the judge was extremely
							indignant, at this act of oppression as he considers it— He seemed
							unwilling to admit the possibility that I should not be as angry at this
							measure as he was, and could hardly endure the comparative coolness with
							which I considered it— I told him that I felt some repugnancy to this
							mode of ascertaining the fact of their bodily soundness, and some
							surprize at its being thus suddenly introduced. But that before making
							up my judgment upon it, I must recur to the old principle “Audi alteram
							partem.” There was a Cabinet Meeting at one O’Clock, upon the question
							with regard to the appointment of the Staff Officers of the Marine
							Corps. Whether the appointment is to be made by nomination to the
							Senate, or whether it is vested by Law in the Commandant. In 1798. the
							authority was given contingently to the Commandant—but in 1809. in 1814
							and more unequivocally in 1817. it appears to have been placed upon the
							footing of other appointments—to be nominated to the Senate— Yet even in
							carrying this last Act into Execution the <persRef ref="southard-samuel"
								>Secretary of the Navy</persRef> directed the Commandant to make the
							Appointments and report them to the Department; and sundry subsequent
							appointments have also been made by the Commandant down to the close of
							the year 1822— To reverse all this and declare it illegal, in the
							interval between one Session of Congress and another, upon a pragmatical
							construction of the Laws opposite to that which was acted upon,
							apparently upon full deliberation, was concluded not to be advisable—
								<persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wirt</persRef> thought there was danger if the appointments were
							illegally made, that the sureties to the official bonds, might not be
							held. But that danger would be the same if the appointment were
							illegally made by the President and Senate, as if made by the
							Commandant. It was finally determined that the Secretary of the Navy
							should inform <persRef ref="henderson-archibald">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Henderson</persRef> verbally, that it
							is thought best no change of the appointment should be made before the
							Session of Congress; and that then some measure should be adopted to
							remove all ambiguity from the Law— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams
							left the City this day at two O’Clock with <persRef ref="winnull-jane"
								>Jane Winnull</persRef>, and <persRef ref="kirk-john">John
								Kirke</persRef>, to go on with all possible speed to Boston. I
							missed this morning my shower bath—but walked to the Slashes, and then
							in the Garden— Planted 6. Henderson Apricot Stones, which completed the
							row of that fruit, in my eastern seedling bed—and plucked several plants
							among which was the Persimon tree— In the garden, the Balsam, the
							Lupine, three Larkspur’s and two Marigolds, are in beautiful Blossom—
							The five Walnuts in the Southern and four in the Eastern bed, are
							growing with unequal rapidity. What I took for a cherry was however only
							a fragment of a broken purslane— My apple pippins in the seedling Pots
							are thriving— N. 2 is putting forth a fifth leaf proper—the seedling
							leaves remaining still unaltered— The transplanted tree still lives but
							has not grown, in its new residence— N. 6 comes up so much later but
							also more vigorously than the rest— A third Orange shoot has come up.
							Very close to the first— This has opened and expanded into two leaves
							which assume a Spoon shape, and are constantly enlarging— Evening very
							sultry.</p>

								<persRef ref="pleasonton-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pleasonton</persRef> called and requested me to send to <persRef
								ref="anderson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Anderson</persRef> the Comptroller, a copy of my Letter to them both
							relating to the settlement of my accounts as a Minister in Europe— He
							brought with him the Telegraph Newspaper of last Evening, in which were
							two fresh columns of misrepresentation and falsehood, on the same
							subject— They refer to a document communicated to Congress in 1822. and
							from an inaccurate statement in it affirm that I received Salary as
							Minister to S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Petersburg, and as Minister
							to Ghent, at the same time— I pointed out to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Pleasonton the inaccuracy of the document, but even that did
							not support the assertion in the Telegraph— <persRef ref="graham-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham</persRef> came with a
							Letter from <persRef ref="bartley-mordecai">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bartley</persRef> of Ohio, respecting the removal of the
							Land Office to Tiffin— He has been there himself and attests the
							suitableness of the place— <persRef ref="nourse-charles">Major
								Nourse</persRef> came respecting the Report of the Visitors to
							West-Point, and the application of the late <persRef
								ref="hughes-george2">Cadet Hughes</persRef> for a Commission in the
							army. <persRef ref="macomb-alexander">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Macomb</persRef>, and <persRef ref="thayer-sylvanus">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thayer</persRef> the Superintendant
							of the Academy came in while Nourse was here— I spoke of the new mode of
							examining the persons of the Candidates for admission to the Academy, as
							of doubtful expediency— Thayer said it was not for him to judge of the
							expediency of the regulation— But as it existed he had thought it
							necessary to require a certificate from a Surgeon, of the soundness of
							person of the candidate; and the Surgeon would give the certificate only
							upon his inspection of the person— I thought it would be advisable to
							modify the execution of the regulation hereafter in such manner as to
							dispense with any indelicate exposure of the person, and if there should
							be a necessity for providing against imposition, and the introduction of
							any diseased person, there might be some additional regulation provided—
								<persRef ref="niles-nathaniel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Niles</persRef> brought Letters of Recommendation—and came with an

							him I believed such an agency would be very useful, but that it would
							require the sanction of an Act of Congress to authorise— <persRef

							Watervliet in New-York— But having been an Officer in the Revolutionary
							War, he thinks it is too much duty for one Man to be responsible for the
							safe keeping of a great mass of Military Stores— He kept me nearly three
							hours, in laying down the extreme importance of the subject—the imminent
							and awful danger of the blowing up of the Magazine— The dreadful
							accidents of that kind which have happened, and the fact which has been
							stated to him that at this very Arsenal at Watervliet, a Lieutenant in
							the army did once enter the building with a lighted Segar in his mouth.
							I advised him to make a written Statement to the Secretary of War, who
							he thinks as well as <persRef ref="bomford-george">Col<hi
