						<p>Rain all day—which confined <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary;adams-abigail4">us</persRef>
							all to the house, and <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							could not go to Boston— I visited the garden, and set out one plant of
							the Downton Strawberry vine but was obliged to return into the house by
							the rain— I continued the draft of my Will, and wrote part of a page of
							biography— Compared with Charles a few pages of <persRef
								ref="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Journals with the Copy. It
							seems impossible to bring them into exact Chronological order, and the
							writing is so microscopic that it is equally difficult to decypher it. I
							received this Evening a Note from <persRef ref="lord-melvin">M
								Lord</persRef>, asking for the Manuscript of <persRef
								ref="macmurrough-dermot">Dermot</persRef>— I copied an extract from
								<persRef ref="hooker-john">Hooker’s</persRef> Translation of
								<persRef ref="cambrensis-giraldus">Giraldus Cambrensis</persRef> for
							a note explanatory of the name, of Dermot MacMorrogh, and an extract
							from Giraldus himself as an Epigraphe to the Poem— I have many
							reflections in letting this work go out of my hands under a multitude of
							discouragements— Its first and great purpose is Moral—but whether it
							will be understood is doubtful— Whether read—still more so— Mediocris
							esse Poeta</p>

						<p>I finished the draught of the Schedules to be annexed to my Will, and it

							the debts and incumbrances upon it, may constantly admonish me while
							there is yet time, to a steady course of exertion to redeem the pledges

						<p>I made the draught of Account N. 7. for the Executors of <persRef

							swamp and gave me his note, payable 1. May next for the balance 285. Of

							spoke of the Wood land offered me by <persRef ref="bracket-lemuel"

								<persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to Boston, and

								<persRef ref="spear-daniel">Deacon Spear</persRef> was here, and
							said he should immediately advertise, for a Sale of standing wood upon
							my <persRef ref="borland-leonard">Borland</persRef> lot— About one half

							purchase <persRef ref="bracket-lemuel">Lemuel Brackett’s</persRef>

							which they might each make 50 dollars. I told him he might offer 550
