							Maryland, who thinks he has discovered a new method of squaring the
							Circle. His method is actually new to me—and he makes 8862. the length

						<p>Two miscellaneous Stanza’s— Received this Morning by the Mail, the first

							went with them entirely round the lot which is partly covered with wood
							and partly bare— The shrubbery and Briars are so thick in part of it as

							walked home two Miles and a half. <persRef ref="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> and <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his

							Apple-trees transplanted from the Box in the front yard— My time will
							fail me again for doing a tenth part of what I intended— I must hope to
							transplant again in the Spring— And leave how much undone— <persRef

								>Jackson</persRef> had a majority of seven or eight hundred more
							than at the late election for Governor. The result is nevertheless

							deeply furrowed with years and cares—mine much the same— He besieged me

							The overruling power of Love—and the transcendent Virtue of Fortitude in
							Adversity— The Magnanimity of enduring pain, and the relentless purpose
							of Revenge, embrace almost the whole of Byron’s Morality— The Riches of
							his Mind are inexhaustible— His observation of physical Nature more like
							intuition than perception— His remarks on men and manners, keen and
							penetrating, but always tinctured and discoloured by his own Vices— He
							saw of human nature nothing but its defects and infirmities, because he
							was always seeking palliatives for his own— My thoughts are wandering
							into vacuity, and I cannot collect them upon one point— I am wasting

								>Manfred</persRef>. The Story of the Venetian Doge is extraordinary,

							transcending the bounds of probability and with language elegant and

							head—a Man of fourscore years of age—for a cause so slight, is a
							phenomenon in History— A slanderous sarcasm upon <persRef
								ref="gradenigo-aluycia">his wife</persRef>—insufficiently punished
							in his estimation as the sole ground for his attempt to overthrow the
							Government, and make himself the Supreme Lord of Venice— It is scarcely
							less extraordinary that <persRef ref="byron-george">Byron</persRef>
							should expose with so much indignation the corruption, consisting in a
							licentious intercourse of the Sexes— Manfred is a production of a
							different character. I see it sometimes represented as the greatest

						<p>The walk round the Capitol before Breakfast, seems a necessary of Life to
							me, when at Washington; and then the want of occupation during the walk
							is another. Thus it was that the Poem of <persRef
								ref="macmurrough-dermot">Dermot</persRef> was composed, and it is
							now matter of surprize to myself, how it was fashioned into the shape
							which it finally assumed— I want a similar subject now; but invention is
							barren, and I have a repugnance to the further use of the Ottava Rima
							Stanza— <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Huntt</persRef> was here and told some appalling Stories of the
							ravages of the Cholera while it was prevailing here. It is now raging
							with tremendous fury at New-Orleans, and the yellow fever with it— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt hinted to me that my complaint might
							become a fistula— But how to guard against it— I read <persRef
								ref="byron-george">Byron’s</persRef> Tragedy of <persRef
								ref="manfred">Manfred</persRef>; in three Acts— There is a vapour of
							mystery cast around, the Story, which seems to be considered as
							constituting the Sublime— There is no action in the poem— Manfred talks
							much—evokes a succession of Supernatural Spirits— Commands them all
							despotically—Disdains obedience to any of them—but he does nothing but
							die—and there is no reason given why he dies then, rather than seven
							years before, or seven years after— <persRef ref="galt-john"
								>Galt</persRef> says that Byron affected to raise dark suspicions
							that there was some horrible reality in his own life like that
							pourtrayed with the Story of Manfred— He was a “Fanfaron de Crimes.”</p>

						<p>Walk round the Capitol before Breakfast, and finished a poetical trifle
							which has teazed me for several days— I am sufficiently disoccupied for
							the mind to feed itself with anticipation of evil— As I have not the
							power to avert them, my resource is to escape from them when possible.
							This is what I am now endeavouring to do, with little success; for the
							want of a continuous subject of meditation— My time is almost totally
							uninterrupted, and day after day passes without a Solitary visitor— This
							is my happiest state of existence—but it needs an occupied mind— I
							answered a Letter from <persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">N.
								Biddle</persRef>; and with more difficulty one from <persRef
								ref="mills-drake">Drake Mills</persRef> a man at New-York, who
							thinks he has discovered a perpetual motion but is not sure whether he
							has or not. He confides his secret to me; and asks my opinion of it— I
							advise him to have the same confidence in some honest Mechanic employ
							him to make a model of his invention, and try the experiment— I read the
							first and part of the second Canto of <persRef ref="byron-george"
								>Byron’s</persRef> Corsair—written and published in 1814 a year
							before his Marriage— Desperate Courage, inflexible Fortitude, and
							contempt of pain and death, were the darling Virtues of Byron’s
							Imagination— His Love was gross sensuality mingled with ferocious
							tenderness romantic sentimentality, and a total disregard of all moral
							restraint— The Love of a Cat Tyger.</p>

							The discourse of Christ with his disciples; concerning whom he was said

							continues very unwell— In my morning walk I called at <persRef
								ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef> Hotel, and saw <persRef
								ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell</persRef>,
							who gave me the information which I desired respecting the claim of
								<persRef ref="soper-frederic">Frederick Soper</persRef>— The Danish
							Commission take no cognizance of Seamen’s wages— <persRef
								ref="nagy-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles
								Nagy</persRef> a Hungarian Patriot brought me a Letter of
							Introduction from <persRef ref="lafayette">General La Fayette</persRef>—
							I had a morning visit from <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef>, Chief Clerk of the
							Department of State— <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Huntt</persRef> was here to visit his two Patients; and
								<persRef ref="frye-nathaniel;frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Frye</persRef>
							called in the afternoon—and <persRef ref="lawrence-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence</persRef> in the Evening— He
							is here upon some claim before the Danish Commission— I wrote several
							Letters; but the pressure upon my Spirits from the illness of my wife
							and grand child at once, with all the other prospects before and around
							me, is more than I can endure and reduces me to the weakness of a child.
							And it is a childhood from which there is no recovery— No release but by
							death— It seems to me that Indian torture, roasting to Death by a slow
							fire would differ little from the condition that awaits me.</p>
