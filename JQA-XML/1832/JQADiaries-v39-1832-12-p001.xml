							complete surrender to the nullifiers of South-Carolina— On Motion of

							great dissatisfaction to all those with whom I converse, and will be

							neutrality which he had heretofore maintained upon the conflicting

							Letter I think to <persRef ref="porter-peter">Peter B. Porter</persRef>—
							This Message already puts my temper and my discretion upon a trial

							but mischief. I walk between burning Ploughshares and have no support
							upon Earth, with a fearful foreboding that every effort I could make for

						<p>I was belated this Morning and found the House of Representatives in
							Session, when I reached the Capitol— The States were called over for the
							presentation of Petitions, and afterwards of Resolutions: A Resolution
							was offered by <persRef ref="boon-ratliff">Boon</persRef> of Indiana,
							directing the Committee on Public Lands, to enquire into the expediency
							of reducing and graduating the price of Public Lands, and finally to
							give them away to the States in which they are situated. This Resolution
							passed without opposition or remark. Immediately after, <persRef
								ref="clay-clement">Clay</persRef> of Alabama moved another
							Resolution, still more liberal in distribution of the spoils— <persRef
								ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> then moved to postpone
							the consideration of this Resolution till next Monday. after some debate
							this was agreed to— <persRef ref="hiester-william">Heister</persRef> of
							Pennsylvania then moved a reconsideration of the vote, adopting Boon’s
							Resolution, which also prevailed 90 to 83. and it was postponed also
							till Monday.— A Letter was received from the <persRef ref="mclane-louis"
								>Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, with the Report of <persRef
								ref="toland-henry">Henry Toland</persRef> the Agent appointed by him
							to examine into the Affairs of the Bank— It is extremely favourable to
							the Bank— <persRef ref="wickliffe-charles">Wickliffe</persRef> moved for
							the printing of 10000 Copies— <persRef ref="wayne-james">Wayne</persRef>
							objected to the questions being taken till the Resolution has lain one
							day on the table— Wickliffe moved to suspend the rule; but failed—the
							vote being 9 to 6 not two thirds.— These votes give some slight hopes
							that the Country may not be totally ruined as soon as is threatened by
							the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President’s</persRef> Message— The
							House agreed to choose a Chaplain to-morrow, and adjourned between 2.
							and 3. O’Clock. I wrote to <persRef ref="adams-charles2">my Son
								Charles</persRef>.</p>

						<p>I reached the House this Morning before the Session opened— Petitions and
							Resolutions were called after which in Committee of the whole House on
							the State of the Union the Resolutions, for distributing the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Presidents</persRef> Messages were adopted with
							modifications, reported to the House, and there adopted. The parts of
							the Message relating to the Bank, were finally referred to the Committee

							or to investigate the Affairs of the Bank— But the recommendation in the
							Message to sell all the Stocks of the United States in incorporated
							Companies which in Committee of the Whole had been referred to the
							Committee of Roads and Canals was in the House taken from them and
							transferred to the Committee of Ways and Means, by yeas and nays 91 to
							77. Most of the Western members heretofore devoted to internal
							improvement voting for the change— The bribe of the Public lands has
							bought them off— There was a very warm personal discussion, between
								<persRef ref="wickliffe-charles">Wickliffe</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef>, upon a very

						<p>At the House the prayer was made by the Roman Catholic Priest <persRef

							Chaplain to the Senate. It was short, and very appropriate— He had it

							adopted by the house— The motion for taking the yeas and Nays upon the

								>Polk’s</persRef> to amend the Resolution for a Select Committee
							upon the part of the Message recommending an Amendment to the

							writing, if desired, taken and recorded by yeas and nays— This being
							laid on the table, my course must be to keep minutes of the proceedings,
							and of the votes myself— The Resolutions that the reduction of the
							Revenue, had been Committed by the House to the Committee of Ways and
							Means, and not to the Committee of Manufactures, were also laid on the
							Table.— They do not choose to meet the question directly—but to assume
							the power, whether entrusted or not— My Resolution to enquire of the
								<persRef ref="mclane-louis">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>,
							what will be the probable effect on the Revenue, of a suspension of the
							collection in the Ports of South-Carolina, and of forcible resistance to
							the Execution of the Laws in that State, was not decided, though much
							discussed— The Committee adjourned to meet next Monday at ten O’Clock—
							In the House the Committee of Ways and Means obtained leave to sit
							during the Session of the House— The debate upon <persRef
								ref="clay-clement">C. C. Clay’s</persRef> Resolution to give away
							the Public Lands was resumed— <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis
								Williams</persRef> continued but did not finish his Speech against
							it. The House went into Committee of the Whole upon four Bills—debate on
							a Bill for establishing Offices for essaying gold, in the States of
							Virginia, North and South-Carolina, and Georgia, in which the strict
							constructionists or limitarians are at issue with one another— Debate on
							a Bill for giving Land to Blind Asylum Hospitals— On both these the
							Committee reported progress, and had leave to sit again— I had
							Conversations with <persRef ref="condict-lewis">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Condict</persRef> and <persRef ref="taylor-john">J. W.
								Taylor</persRef>, as to the expediency of offering a Resolution that
							the subject of reducing the Revenue, had not been referred to the
							Committee of Manufactures— Taylor said he thought the House would either
							refuse to consider, or would lay on the Table such a Resolution— It will
							therefore not be prudent to move it.</p>

							would of course lie one day upon the Table— It will now come up of
							course though probably the House will refuse to consider it— The Bill
							for establishing Offices for assaying gold, was postponed in Committee

						<p>On taking my Seat in the House this Morning, <persRef
								ref="dearborn-henry2">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Dearborn</persRef> came to me, and said that a number of our friends
							wished me not to call up my Resolution, calling for copies of the
							Proclamation and Ordinance of South-Carolina— I told him that although
							it would be excessively against my own opinion, I would comply with
							their wish— Soon after, <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">Pearce</persRef> of
							Rhode-Island came and gave me the same intimation— I gave him a reason
							for the call which he thought a sufficient one; but I told him I would
							not press the Call— <persRef ref="mitchel-thomas2">T. R.
								Mitchill</persRef>, a South-Carolina Unionist came, and intreated me
							not to press my Resolution, and I told him I would not— I asked <persRef
								ref="archer-william">Archer</persRef> of Virginia, who is Chairman
							of the Committee of Foreign Relations and affects to be the confidential
							intimate of the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Executive</persRef>,
							whether he had any objection to the call for the Correspondence with
							Buenos-Ayres; he said no—but he had to my Call for the Proclamation— I
							told him, I would not press the Call, and would consent to its laying on
							the table— He then promised it should be very soon forthcoming— After
							the calls for Petitions and for Reports of Standing and select
							Committees were gone through—the <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew"
								>Speaker</persRef> said the following Resolution is offered by the
							Gentleman from “Massachusetts” up started at once <persRef
								ref="letcher-robert">Letcher</persRef>—<persRef

							Speaker— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Speaker—they all thought it was
							the Resolution, calling for the Proclamation— Letcher, a good humoured;
							shrewd, jocose <persRef ref="lanatus-agrippa">Menenius Agrippa</persRef>
							to <persRef ref="clay-clement">Clay</persRef> was going to move either
							the question of Consideration or to lay the Resolution on the Table—
							Wickliffe insisted that there was a Resolution of his that should have
							been called up before mine— Davis held out an amendment that he had
							prepared to propose, which he had mentioned to me before, and to which I
							had assured him I should make no objection— It was to include additional
							papers in the call— There was some bustle and confusion till it was
							ascertained that the Resolution taken up and announced by the Speaker,
								<pb n="11" type="ms"/>was the call, not for the Proclamation, but
							for the Correspondence with Buenos-Ayres. I assigned in a few Reasons
							for the call, my motives for it, amending the Resolution by adding the
							Instructions to the Chargé d’affaires. The Resolution was adopted
							without opposition— Wickliffe’s Resolution was then taken up—having
							precedence of mine for the Proclamation. His was for a call on the
							President for a list of Members of Congress appointed to Office, since
							1826— This Resolution was opposed by <persRef ref="foster-thomas2"
								>Foster</persRef> of Georgia, in a Speech to which Wickliffe
							replied. <persRef ref="clayton-augustin">Clayton</persRef> of Georgia
							was about opening, when the hour of Resolutions expired; and soon after

							opposite to <persRef ref="brown-jesse">Brown’s</persRef> Hotel. The

						<p>I am threatened with an inflammation of the eyes—particularly of the left
							eye, with which I have been heretofore severely afflicted— I therefore
							rose this morning two hours later than my regular time, to avoid reading
							or writing so much by Lamp-light— It disqualifies me at a very critical
							time; but I trust is for the best; perhaps even for myself— At the House
							I had a Conversation with <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Dearborn</persRef>, concerning the
							application which he made to me yesterday in the name of some of our
							friends, to withdraw my resolution calling for the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President’s</persRef> Proclamation, I asked him
							who they were— He named <persRef ref="ellsworth-william"
								>Ellsworth</persRef>, <persRef ref="choate-rufus">Choate</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="letcher-robert">Letcher</persRef>— I asked him whether
							they supposed I had offered the Resolution without having reasons for
							it; and whether they proposed to assume the right of controuling my
							course— He said no—that in speaking to me he had acted entirely on his
							own responsibility; but that if I did not withdraw my Resolution, it
							would be voted down by a very large majority of the House— I told him I
							should take my chance for that; but I should not withdraw my
							Resolution,— I shewed to Dearborn, and afterwards to <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">E. Everett</persRef> an Article in the
							Telegraph, taken from the Richmond Whig, calling upon <persRef
								ref="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef> to abandon the Tariff party
							and save the Union—and I asked them what it meant— They did not know— In
							the House, <persRef ref="wickliffe-charles">Wickliffe’s</persRef>
							Resolution, calling for a list of members of Congress appointed to
							Offices, since February 1826. was discussed— <persRef
								ref="clayton-augustin">Clayton</persRef> made a short Speech for it,
							and <persRef ref="speight-jesse">Speight</persRef> one against it.
								<persRef ref="kennon-william">Kennon</persRef> of Ohio moved an
							Amendment that the President should be called upon to give the names of
							all the members of Congress who have applied for Offices for themselves
							or their friends since February 1824. which I opposed, it being very
							obvious that the President could give no such information—especially
							during the time of his Predecessors, I said I should vote for
							Wickliffe’s Resolution asking for a List of the Members of Congress
							appointed to Office; because it was information which being desired by a
							member, I thought the House should in Courtesy grant it— But that at the
							proper time I should vote against his proposed alterations of the
							Constitution, which I thought would not be an Amendment— The Hour
							elapsed, and the House proceeded to private business— They agreed to
							adjourn over till Wednesday— <persRef ref="clay-clement">C. C.
								Clay</persRef> just before the adjournment moved a reconsideration
							of that vote, because the Committee of Ways and Means would be ready to
							report on Monday an Anti-Tariff Bill; but the House adjourned— So that
							my call for the Proclamation cannot come up before Wednesday, nor
							probably before Thursday— The Potowmac river froze over last Night.
								<persRef ref="connell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								Hammett</persRef>, the Chaplain of the House of Representatives—a
							Wesleyan Methodist— I had been much pleased and edified by his Prayers
							before the Sittings of the House; and his discourse this day was not
							ineloquent— From John 18.36. “Jesus answered, my kingdom is not of this
							world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight”—
							The House was crowded, and the preachers doctrine, against the Alliance
							of Church and State exceedingly popular— So popular, that it is
							dangerous in this Country to avow a different opinion— This was more of
							a stump electioneering Speech than of a Sermon— A compound of good
							principles, and of crudities Full of Christian benevolence and meekness,
							yet bitterly censuring the Roman Catholic Church, tho’ his fellow
							Chaplain at this very Session is a <persRef ref="pise-charles">Roman
								Catholic Priest</persRef>; and reviling the Church of England though
							assenting without qualification to the purity of her Creed— Upon the
							Alliance of Church and State, there is much to be said on both sides— It
							has produced enormous Evils— But whether any Religion can be maintained
							without it, is yet to be seen— The question is between Atheism and
							Superstition between spiritual Anarchy and spiritual Servitude— Truth
							makes little progress when only one side of a question can obtain a

						<p>The Committee of Manufactures having adjourned to ten O’Clock this

								ref="findlay-james">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Findlay</persRef> came soon after into the Committee Room, and with
							him and Hoffman, I had a general Conversation of upwards of two Hours—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Hoffman is a New-Yorker, of Dutch
							descent— A Lawyer, of the Democratic-Republican party—of the Albany
							Regency, and now a <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef>
							man— They are <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, tenacious of State-rights, and
							politically leagued with the Anti-Tariff policy of the South— But as
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> men, they must be
							anti-nullifiers, and to these two incoherent elements, subserviency to
							the Slave-holding policy; and the personal animosities of President
							Jackson against <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Vice-President
								Calhoun</persRef>, may be traced—the glaring inconsistencies of
							principle, between the Message of this year and the Proclamation— I told
							Hoffman that the real question now convulsing this Union, was whether a
							population spread over an immense territory, consisting of one great
							division, all Freemen, and another of Masters and Slaves, could exist
							permanently together as members of one Community or not— That to go a
							step further back, the question at issue was Slavery.— He said he was of
							that opinion; and that if it should come directly to a point
							nine-tenths, if not ninety-nine hundredths of his Constituents would
							take side against Slavery— He said too that if this question with
							South-Carolina should come to a struggle of force, and the <pb n="13"
								type="ms"/>nullifiers should be overpowered the whole population of
							the State would emigrate to Mexico; but Findlay asked what they would do
							with their Slaves— Slavery being abolished in Mexico, and all the
							South-American States except Brazil— It was past one, when we parted,
							and I returned the visits of several members of Congress; none of whom
							were at home— I met a man in the Street, who accosted me and said there
							had been a Battle. That <persRef ref="blair-james">General James
								Blair</persRef>, a member of the House of Representatives had
							knocked down and very severely beaten Duff Green, Editor of the
							Telegraph and Printer to Congress.— What changes in the affairs of
							Passions of men— <persRef ref="green-duff">Duff Green</persRef> and his
							Telegraph, were set up here, against my Administration and for its
							overthrow, by Calhoun, <persRef ref="hayne-robert">Hayne</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="hamilton-james3">Hamilton</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="eaton-john">Eaton</persRef> of Tennessee, <persRef
								ref="drayton-william">Drayton</persRef>, and the united gang of
							Calhoun and Jackson conspirators against me— They sent a man by the name
							of <persRef ref="u">Berryman</persRef> to Charleston, to obtain
							subscriptions for the Telegraph; and I have among my papers Drayton’s
							recommendation of him to some of the men of this party.— They made Green
							Printer to the Senate, and he became the Prince of Slanderers against
							me— When Jackson came in they rewarded Green by making him the Printer
							to both Houses of Congress, which he still is— But he attached himself
							to the Fortunes of Calhoun— Men baser than himself have supplanted him
							in the favour of Jackson— He has plunged into the Maelstrom of
							Nullification, and it is dashing him and his instigators to destruction—
							His Telegraph has lately had some violent publications against the Union
							men in South-Carolina, of whom Blair is one— To make them odious it
							designates them as <hi rend="italic">Tories</hi>, a name of special
							abhorrence there, from remembrances of the Revolution— This was the
							immediate provocation to Blair, who is of the race of the Giants—a man
							of fifteen Score, and who has nearly killed Green— When I came home, I
							found <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> very ill
							again; confined with an excruciating head-ache, and oppression upon the
							lungs to her bed— <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript"

							with my Resolution, to call for the Proclamation and Ordinance. I told

								Clay</persRef> would not commit himself to the principles of the

							that I had made <pb n="14" type="ms"/>it and particularly at this time—
							He said Dearborn had no unfriendly disposition to me; of which I assured

							Proclamation ought to have been communicated to Congress immediately
							after it was issued. Silsbee said he would speak of the matter to Gen<hi

							it would be well for them to understand one another, in time to act with

						<p>At the House; after the Petitions had been called up, my Resolution to

							was precluded from the privilege of assigning to the House the Reasons,
							which had induced me to offer the Resolution—he said I was—that it
							admitted of no debate— I said no more, and the House by a vote of 106 to

								>Collier</persRef> of the Anti-Masons, All the Jackson party, and

							of the National Republicans, and the nullifiers voted for it— <persRef
								ref="archer-william">Archer</persRef> had promised me upon his word
							of Honour, that a Message should come, by Monday next at the latest— I
							told him I had no design, when the papers should come to make any motion
							for the disposal of them—though I saw it was suspected I had— I supposed
							he or some other member of the Administration party would move the
							reference of them to a Select Committee for a Report— I had not the
							least desire to be upon that Committee— He said he had a perfect
							Confidence in my integrity and Patriotism, and would be very much
							gratified that I should be the Chairman of that Committee, if my
							opinions upon the Proclamation should concur with theirs— To this broad
							overture, I gave no encouragement— I said it was probable my opinions
							upon the proclamation would probably not concur with his; but that I had
							no wish to be on the Committee. <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">E.
								Whittlesey</persRef> of Ohio, spoke to me, and said he was afraid

							came to me from <persRef ref="green-duff">Duff Green</persRef> to offer
							an abstract from the Documents relating to the Manufactures, which have

								ref="hoffman-michael">Hoffman</persRef>, and not I, was the mover in
							this case, and I presumed he would comprehend his motive— The Committee

							read. <persRef ref="verplanck-gulian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Verplanck</persRef> the Chairman gave notice that he should call it

							Committee of the Whole— <persRef ref="clay-clement">C. C.

							to God. There was no use of arguments to sustain this thesis— No

							would dissent from this Report— They would not permit that it should be
							made to the House at all, and would doubtless prepare a Report of a
							different and opposite character— Probably the House itself, would
							refuse to receive such a Report as I should prepare; but I could not
							endure the idea of suffering the ruinous principles and recommendations
							of the Message to pass, as if they were uncontroverted— The Doctor
							agreed with me, and I promised to prepare a Report, and communicate it
