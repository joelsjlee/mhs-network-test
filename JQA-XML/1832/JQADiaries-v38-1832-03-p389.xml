						<p><persRef ref="tudor-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Tudor</persRef> sent and requested me to call upon her this morning
							and I went— She has been led to expect that she is entitled to certain
							bounty Lands perhaps of the value of 1000 dollars, as the widow of an
								<persRef ref="tudor-william">Officer of the Revolutionary
								War</persRef>— But she had a Letter from <persRef
								ref="otis-william3">William Otis</persRef>, a Clerk in the general
							Land Office, stating that he had conferred with the Commissioner
								<persRef ref="hayward-elijah">Hayward</persRef>, who advised her to
							apply to me, and observed there was no record to prove that her husband
							was an Officer of the Revolutionary War— I took Otis’s Letter, and at
							the House, found in the first Volume of the Journals of the Old
							Congress, the Record of the Election of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Tudor as Judge Advocate of the Army— In the House, the Resolution of
								<persRef ref="clayton-augustin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clayton</persRef> proposing the appointment of a select Committee to
							investigate his fifteen charges against the Bank of the United States—
								<persRef ref="mitchel-thomas2">Thomas R. Mitchell</persRef> made a
							speech of two hours against the Bank— <persRef ref="denny-harmar">H.
								Denny</persRef>, <persRef ref="watmough-john">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Watmough</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="ellsworth-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ellsworth</persRef> supported it— <persRef ref="foster-thomas2"
								>Foster</persRef> of Georgia and <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
								>Cambreleng</persRef> replied— Watmough moved an Amendment to
							Clayton’s Resolution, to be referred to the Committee of Ways and Means,
							and then <persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie</persRef>, gave up the
							whole ground; and advised Watmough to withdraw his amendment; and let
							Clayton have his Committee in his own way— The House adjourned at four
							O’clock without taking the question— But I conclude that M’Duffie has
							betrayed and sacrificed the Bank— His surrender was unexpected to me;
							but it is not uncongenial to the obliquity of his politics, and the
							unsteadiness of his mind— I had fortunately taken no part in this
							debate, and it is a new warning to me, to forbear all volunteering upon
							such treacherous ground as that covered by the floor of the House— I am
							constantly tempted to speak and yet have continual demonstration, that I
							should only expose myself to mortification, and be surely deserted even
							by those whom I would wish to serve and sustain. <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="nicklin-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nicklin</persRef> were here this Evening; they had just been at the
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President’s</persRef> Drawing Room—
							Ingersoll spoke with astonishment at M’Duffie’s defection in the House.—
							I spent the leisure of the Evening in writing and brought up my arrears.
							The apportionment Bill was taken up in the Senate where <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> made an eloquent Speech— I fear to no purpose— If
							reason or argument could effect anything at this Time, I should hope
							that a great and inveterate defect in the apportionment Laws, might be
							remedied— But the conviction is pressed upon me more and more from day
							to day of my utter inability to render any valuable service to the
							Country— I would not prematurely despair of the Republic—but my
							forebodings are dark; and the worst of them is in contemplating the
							precipice before us—yawning at our feet, from the very pinnacle of
							prosperity to which we have been raised, and on which we stand.</p>

						<p>Finished the version of the 83<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> and began
							that of the 84<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm. Both exceedingly
							difficult; and my task grows more oppressive as I proceed— I called at
							the Navy Department and enquired of <persRef ref="woodbury-levi">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodbury</persRef>, if according to
							the recent joint-Resolution of Congress he was prepared to pay the
							amount due to the Stone-Cutters <persRef ref="newcomb-jonathan"
								>Newcomb</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">Richards</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="u">Gridley</persRef>. He said he had ten days since, given
							order for the payment of 48000 dollars, and that the remainder would be
							paid on production of the vouchers that the contract had been performed.
							I then called at the War Department; but the <persRef ref="cass-lewis"
								>Secretary Cass</persRef> was at the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President’s</persRef>. I left the Letter from <persRef
								ref="hodges-james">James L. Hodges</persRef>, asking my assistance
							to obtain admission as a Cadet <pb n="390" type="ms"/>at West-Point, for
							a young man recommended by him— At the House, a joint Resolution passed
							authorising the <persRef ref="livingston-edward">Secretary of
								State</persRef> to employ Clerks to record the Patents in the
							Patent-Office— This Resolution has passed sub-silentio; without
							opposition, and without notice— A contrast sufficiently striking with
							the retrenchment proceedings in 1828. <persRef ref="clayton-augustin"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clayton</persRef> of Georgia’s
							Resolution, for a Committee to investigate the direction of the Bank was
							taken up and he made a tiresome Speech of an hour in which he barely
							reached the threshold of his subject— The orders of the day were called
							for, and the Speaker <unclear>. . .</unclear> the recent alteration of
							the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> rule did not extend to the days of
							private business—Fridays and Saturdays— That on those days therefore the
							orders of the day could not be set aside by a bare majority of the
							House— A motion was made to suspend the rule to allow M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clayton to finish his Speech— It very
							nearly prevailed—the vote being 96 to 54. but the majority not amounting
							to two thirds, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clayton was silenced for
							the day. The Bill for the relief of <persRef ref="decatur-susan">Susan
								Decatur</persRef> and others was resumed— <persRef ref="davis-john4"
								>John Davis</persRef> offered an Amendment, for a distribution
							conformable to the Prize act, which he supported by a Speech of two
							hours, of great power and impression— <persRef ref="carson-samuel"
								>Carson</persRef> followed and attempted to answer him— About four
							O’Clock <persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Duffie</persRef> moved that the Committee should rise, intimating
							that he had a great speech to make for which there would not be time
							this day— The Committee rose and the house adjourned. Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi>
							<persRef ref="johnson-richard">Richard M. Johnson</persRef> asked me to
							walk with him, and said he wished to speak with me of the state of the
							personal Relations between the President Jackson and me— That he,
							Johnson wished the relations of friendly personal intercourse between us
							to be restored— And that he thought the first advances to it should be
							made by him— He had also spoken of it, to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Cass the Secretary of War, who agreed with him on this point.— I said
							that the personal intercourse between General Jackson and me had been
							suspended by himself, without informing me of the reason why— I had
							never known his reason— I had seen at the time in the Telegraph, an
							anonymous statement, that it was because <hi rend="italic">he</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">knew</hi>, that I had caused or countenanced abusive
							charges against <persRef ref="jackson-rachel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Jackson</persRef> in the Newspapers— The fact was not
							so— I never had caused or countenanced directly or indirectly any such
							publication. But General Jackson had never asked of me the question, and
							I did not deem it necessary to notice anonymous charges in the
							Telegraph. Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson said he had always
							been sure it was so— That General Jackson had come here with
							dispositions entirely friendly to me, and intending to call upon me—
							That his mind had been poisoned here by scoundrel Office-seekers— That
							he was a warm tempered passionate man, and had been led to believe that
							I was the cause of those publications against his wife— But that he
							Johnson knew, that the President’s feelings were now as friendly to me
							as they had ever been. He had told him that at the time of the debate in
							the House of Representatives on the Seminole War questions, he had
							received more assistance from me in drawing up the minority Report of
							the Military Committee than from all the world beside— He did not now
							speak by authority of General Jackson, but he knew that his disposition
							towards me was friendly, and had no doubt if a friendly advance from him
							would be accepted by me that he would make it— I said I had no desire
							that the interruption of social intercourse between us should continue,
							and was disposed to receive any friendly advance from General Jackson
							with kindness. He asked if I would accept an invitation to dine with
							him?— I said no— That was an act of mere ordinary courtesy, usually paid
							to every Member of Congress, which I could not consider as an advance
							towards reconciliation— He asked if I would accept an invitation <pb
								n="391" type="ms"/>to a small and select party of friends— I said
							that would be liable to the same objection— It would pass for mere
							civility to a member of Congress, and set to the account of my present
							situation— He then asked what I should myself think proper— I said it
							was not for me to prescribe— I could only say that I was willing to
							receive in a spirit of conciliation any advance which in that Spirit,
							General Jackson might make— With this, the Colonel was satisfied and we
							parted— But it has placed me again in a situation of the delicacy of
							which it is my duty to be profoundly sensible— <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">My Son John</persRef> dined with <persRef
								ref="kerr-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kerr</persRef>, of
							Maryland to whom I sent an excuse— I wrote to Mess<hi rend="superscript"

							against <persRef ref="mckight-priscilla;mcknight-anna;mcknight-mary">her

								ref="newton-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newton</persRef>
							of Virginia sent for me to go into the Library, where he introduced me
							to <persRef ref="taylor-robert">General Taylor</persRef> of Norfolk, and

								Cook</persRef> of Ohio, who proposed an Amendment to the Amendment
							of <persRef ref="davis-john4">John Davis</persRef>, and made a speech
							which brought the Clock to half past four.— The Committee then rose and
							the house adjourned— I received from <persRef ref="johnson-richard"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Richard M. Johnson</persRef>
							a Note without date or signature which I copy for curiosity— “<persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Jackson</persRef> expressed great Satisfaction that I had the
							conversation with you which I detailed to him and expressed a wish that
							I should assure you of his personal regard &amp; friendship &amp; was
							anxious to have a social and friendly intercourse restored between you—
							There I left it and have satisfied my own mind. I shall communicate to
								<persRef ref="cass-lewis">Gov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cass</persRef> the same and there it rests with me, having done what
							my heart suggested— The President expresses himself as perfectly
							satisfyed now that you never did countenance the publications to which I
							alluded &amp; entertains for you the highest opinion as a man of honor
							&amp;c.— Please destroy this when you read it.” So far so good— The
							President is now perfectly satisfied that I never countenanced the
							Newspaper publications against <persRef ref="jackson-rachel">his
								wife</persRef>—and wishes the relations of social intercourse to be
							restored between us— Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson is to
							tell this to Governor Cass and there leaves it— And what is now my duty
							to myself and to the Country? To seek Governor Cass?—no.— But to return
							to Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Johnson his paper instead of
							destroying it—letting him know that I have a copy of it— To thank him
							for the conciliatory part he has taken in this affair, and to assure him
							of my gratification that the President is satisfied I countenanced no
							newspaper publications against this wife. <pb n="392" type="ms"/>A
							restoration of friendly social, and personal intercourse between
							President Jackson and me, at this time would attract much public notice,
							and could not fail to expose me to obloquy.— The old federal party now
							devoted to <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> have already more than once tried their hands at
							slandering me— They have drawn the sword and brandished it over my head—
							If I set my foot in the President’s house, they will throw away the
							scabbard. I must therefore walk with extreme circumspection; even that
							will not protect me from their malignity— Something is due to myself—and
							the path is narrow to avoid on the one hand the charge of an implacable
							temper, and on the other of eagerness to propitiate the dispenser of
							power— We had company to dine— Besides the persons named in the margin,
								<persRef ref="sergeant-john">J. Sergeant</persRef> had promised to
							come—but the Judgment of the Supreme Court was delivered this morning,
							upon the case of the Missionaries to the Cherokees imprisoned in
							Georgia. It pronounces the Statute of Georgia under which they are
							imprisoned unconstitutional. Sergeant, who with <persRef
								ref="wirt-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef>
							argued the cause for the Missionaries has been waiting only for the

								ref="keith-reuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Keith</persRef> of
							Alexandria— He read prayers for Quinquagesima, or the Sunday before Lent
							and preached from Revelations 3.20. “Behold I stand at the door, and
							knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door I will come in to
							him, and will sup with him, and he with me.”— The Sermon was partly
							written and partly extemporaneous—generally read from the manuscript;
							but with occasional exhortations unpremeditated—among which was one
							drawn from a conversation this morning with <persRef
								ref="hawley-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hawley</persRef>, the Minister of the Church, who has been nearly three

								ref="tudor-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor</persRef>
							called upon me after the morning service to make inquiry concerning her

								ref="tudor-william">her husband’s</persRef> appointment as Judge
							Advocate of the Army but not the time of his resignation— She said it
							was not more than three Months before the close of the War, and that
								<persRef ref="laurance-john">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Lawrence</persRef> of New-York was his Successor— In the afternoon I
							heard M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith, at the Presbyterian Church;

							gave out two hymns to be sung with a commentary upon each line of each

							sung—but gave no Sermon— I received by the Mail several Letters, and
							with one of them a Memorial signed by several thousand persons upon the
							existing relations between the United States and the Cherokee Tribe of
							Indians, and the imprisonment of the Missionaries. The Memorial was the
							result of a very numerous Meeting at New-York, and a Letter from a

							escaped from my memory, and remained unanswered— I now concluded, though
							after much hesitation to present it to-morrow Morning, well assured that
							it will be of no avail, but willing to perform to the utmost of my
							power, my duty.</p>

						<p>Rainy Morning— I rode to the Capitol—stopping at the Post-Office, to
							deliver a bundle of Speeches and documents, which I forward to the
							members of the Massachusetts Legislature from the County of Plymouth and
							others, among whom some of my friends. At the House it was the day for
							calling Petitions, and at the call of Massachusetts I presented the
							Memorial from New-York, concerning the Cherokees and the missionaries
							imprisoned in Georgia— It was read at my request, and I moved that it
							should be printed and referred to a Select Committee— This immediately
							gave rise to a debate which consumed the day— <persRef
								ref="speight-jesse">Speight</persRef> moved its reference to the
							Committee on Indian Affairs— <persRef ref="bell-john">Bell</persRef>,
							Chairman of that Committee, made one of those Speeches, common in the

							reception of the memorial but closing with a repetition of Speight’s
							Motion— The Georgia members were variously affected— <persRef
								ref="clayton-augustin">Clayton</persRef> raved, and said that before
							the decree of the Supreme Court should be carried into Execution,
							Georgia should be made a wilderness— <persRef ref="thompson-wiley"
								>Thompson</persRef> of Georgia finally moved that the Memorial be
							laid on the table— The question was taken by yeas and nays 91. for. 92
							against laying on the table— The vote was first thought to be carried
							for <persRef ref="stewart-andrew">Stewart</persRef> of Pennsylvania had
							voted in the affirmative by mistake— He corrected it before the decision
							was announced— <persRef ref="wayne-james">Wayne</persRef> then attempted
							to move a postponement of consideration for a fortnight— <persRef
								ref="drayton-william">Drayton</persRef> actually moved a
							postponement. <persRef ref="davis-john4">John Davis</persRef> moved a
							reference to the Committee of the whole on the state of the Union—
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">Everett</persRef> had proposed this to
							me, and said it was an understanding between the parties that the
							subject should be discussed in Committee of the whole on the Union. This
							was personally satisfactory to me, but did not discharge my duty to the
							Memorialists— Stewart moved the previous Question, but withdrew it at my
							request to give me the opportunity to give my reasons for not assenting
							to Davis’s proposition— <persRef ref="beardsley-samuel"
								>Beardsley</persRef> of New-York followed with an argument that the
							Memorial should be laid on the table— He said he thought I should have
							moved that myself. <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
								>Cambreleng</persRef> noticed that the Memorial, though from
							New-York, was not presented by any of the Representatives from that
							City— I said I had reason to believe, that it was from no disrespect to
							the members from New-York, that the memorial had been sent to me; but
							from a belief that it would be an unpleasing task to them— It was no
							pleasing one to me— I had wished to decline it— But after examining the
							contents of the Memorial, had deemed it my duty to present it.— The
							House were now in possession of it, and would dispose of it as they
							thought best.— Stewart renewed his call for the previous question which
							was seconded and taken— <persRef ref="wickliffe-charles"
								>Wickliffe</persRef> moved that the vote should be taken upon the
							simple question of commitment— I asked for the yeas and nays and they
							were taken— The Commitment was carried 96 to 93— And then it was
							referred to the Committee of the Whole on the State of the Union without
							a division— This decision is precisely what I wished; though having
							moved for a select Committee, I did not feel at Liberty to assent to it—
							In Committee of the whole on the state of the Union, I may leave it to
							the management of other hands—and may take any part or no part in the
							debate as I may think proper— The three members from the City of the New
							York, voted to lay the Memorial on the Table— Cambreleng and <persRef

								<persRef ref="verplanck-gulian">Verplanck</persRef> for it. I

								Hastings</persRef> called upon me this morning and took back a paper
							which he had left with me respecting the manufactures of glass— He said
							he would attend the Committee to-morrow Morning.— At the House of
							Representatives, there was a call for Petitions by States—resumed from
							Massachusetts where it had stopp’d yesterday, by the debate which arose
							upon the New-York Memorial— I overtook <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Cambreleng</persRef>, walking to the Capitol, and apologised to him
							for having presented the memorial—it being considered as a courtesy that
							every member should present Petitions from his own particular
							constituents— After the States had been called over— Reports from
							standing Committees; and Reports from Select Committees were called for
							by <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">the Speaker</persRef>— The first
							order of the day then was the Resolution of <persRef
								ref="clayton-augustin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clayton</persRef> of Georgia, upon which he made a Speech of three
							hours and more, repeating and reinforcing all the charges of his
							Indictment against the Bank of the United States— He was very tiresome,
							but the house listened to him with much attention—excepting that a large
							portion of the Seats were deserted. When he finished he announced that
							all he had till then said was mere inducement and he had a great deal
							more to say, but would detain the house no longer— As he sat down, ten
							or twelve members sprang up to speak among whom were <persRef
								ref="wayne-james">Wayne</persRef> of Georgia and Root of New-York.
							The Speaker said <persRef ref="root-erastus">Root</persRef> had the
							floor— Wayne asked him to yield it for a moment, to allow him to offer
							an Amendment to his Colleague’s Resolution, which would give him
							something to talk about. There was a laugh in the House at the implied
							Sarcasm of Wayne, upon Clayton; as if his three hours Speech was not
							worth answering—but Root said he had enough to talk about, and refused
							to yield the floor— He moved that the house should adjourn, which was
							carried— I saw in the House <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="seymour-horatio">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Seymour</persRef> of the Senate— They had the apportionment Bill
							before them, with an Amendment proposed by M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Webster of the success of which he is doubtful— I wrote
							short Letters to <persRef ref="connell-john">J. Connell</persRef>, and

								<persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Almy</persRef> of

							after their Meeting <persRef ref="clayton-augustin">M<hi

							of the New-York Banks and their safety fund— <persRef ref="bell-john"

								ref="jackson-andrew">President’s</persRef> Opinions and to his
							proceedings respecting the Bank— The question was taken upon Root’s

							course about 16. accidentally or otherwise absent—for the most part
							Skulkers— <persRef ref="wayne-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							raised a question of Order, whether Burges’s proposal for a Committee of

								<persRef ref="root-erastus">Root’s</persRef> motion yesterday—
								<persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">The Speaker</persRef> inclined to

								ref="everett-edward">Everett</persRef> pointed out differences
							between the motions but the Speaker decided the Committee of 7 to be
							chosen by ballot was out of order. Then Burges at the suggestion of
								<persRef ref="wickliffe-charles">Wickliffe</persRef> moved a
							Committee of 8. which the Speaker thought was in order— <persRef
								ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie</persRef> rose and with some
							impatience said the great evil above all others in this case was delay.
							That it was of infinite importance that the house should do what it
							meant to do at once— Wayne started up and asked if the <hi rend="italic"
								>evil</hi>, of which the Gentleman spoke was evil to the Country or
							to the Bank— M’Duffie turned pale, and replied that he must say the
							course of the Gentleman from Georgia in the house, was intolerably
							supercilious and impertinent— Wayne rose again—his eyes flashed with
							fire and he in substance told him that if he wished to give proof of
							manhood it must be elsewhere— They were called to order and the Speaker
							said the observations made on both sides had been very improper.
								<persRef ref="barstow-gamaliel">Barstow</persRef> of New-York moved
							a reconsideration of the vote yesterday which rejected Root’s motion for
							the choice of the Committee by Ballot. He said he had not changed his
							opinion, and should vote the same way again—but some of his friends
							absent yesterday had requested him to give them an opportunity to vote
							and he was willing to gratify them— The vote was accordingly taken—after
							a Call of the House—and the reconsideration prevailed 98 to 93. still a
							small vote. The hour had now expired, and the house went into Committee
							of the whole, Speight in the Chair upon <persRef ref="decatur-susan"
								>Susan Decatur’s</persRef> bill— <persRef ref="slade-william"
								>Slade</persRef> of Vermont and <persRef ref="burd-george"
								>Burd</persRef> of Pennsylvania made Speeches against <persRef
								ref="davis-john4">J. Davis’s</persRef> amendment. It was rejected,
							and the Bill was reported to the house without Amendment— Davis renewed
							his Motion for amendment—rejected by yeas and nays 78 to 102— <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">Pearce’s</persRef> Amendment in favour of the
								<persRef ref="mcknight-mary;mckight-priscilla;mcknight-anna"
								>M’Knight’s</persRef> met the same fate 80 to 93 and the Bill itself
							was then rejected 78 to 95. Before the House adjourned, <persRef
								ref="mercer-charles">C F. Mercer</persRef>, referring to the wrangle
							that had taken place <pb n="397" type="ms"/>between Wayne and M’Duffie,
							said he hoped they would be reconciled— He called upon them according to
							Parliamentary usage sanctioned by practice in England. He stated what
							had been first said in the warmth of debate by Wayne, without intention
							he had no doubt—but which he thought was justly offensive to M’Duffie—
							He called upon Wayne to disavow the offensive intention— Wayne said he
							was convinced by the opinion of his friends around him that what he had
							said in the heat of debate was susceptible of an offensive imputation
							upon M’Duffie— He disclaimed all such intention and declared his full
							conviction of the patriot Spirit of the Chairman of the Committee of
							Ways and Means— M’Duffie declared himself entirely satisfied, and said
							that he retracted the words he had used with infinitely more pleasure
							than it given him pain to speak them. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Wayne then complimented him upon his Spirit, and the house adjourned.

						<p>I called this morning on the <persRef ref="cass-lewis">Secretary of War,
									M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cass</persRef>, to enquire in

								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor sent for him yesterday, and he had

							He thought however the claim of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor
							would not come within those provided for by the Continental Congress— I
							mentioned to him the Letter I had left, of <persRef ref="hodges-james"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hodges</persRef> recommending a

							immediate Power is in the hand of the State— The Executive of the Union,
							is leagued with the State Authority; and the two Houses of Congress are
							about as equally as possible divided in the case— It is clear that the
							Constitution and Law of the Union, and its judicial authority will be
							prostrated, before the despotic power of the State; and I would it were
							possible for me to anticipate the course to be taken, and the measure
							proper to be proposed, when the information shall come back— Convinced
							that I can effect nothing, my own course will be to withhold myself from
							all action concerning it.</p>

						<p>I went up to the Capitol soon after nine this Morning, and finished the
							draught of a bill for the Meeting of the Committee on Manufactures—for
							the purpose of repressing frauds on the Revenue— I found <persRef
								ref="barbour-john">John S. Barbour</persRef> already at the Capitol,
							walking about in the passage ways— He came to the Committee-room, for
							about five minutes, before the hour of the Meeting of the Committee; but
							did not attend the Meeting— There were present at that <persRef
								ref="condict-lewis">Condict</persRef>, <persRef ref="dayan-charles"
								>Dayan</persRef>, <persRef ref="horn-henry">Horn</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="worthington-john">Worthington</persRef>—to whom I read
							my draught of a bill, made according to the recommendation of the
								<persRef ref="mclane-louis">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>, and
							taken chiefly from a Bill reported by the Committee of Manufactures at
							the Session before last— Diversities of opinion soon arose— Horn very
							good humouredly opposed every thing— Worthington manifested a similar
							disposition with more reserve. Dayan objected to the provisions of the
							draughted bill, but proposed measures less energetic. D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Condict was earnest upon the object— We
							sat till noon, and adjourned till to-morrow Morning as I propose now to
							have daily Meetings till we have determined whether to report a Bill or
							not— In the House, <persRef ref="clayton-augustin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clayton’s</persRef> Bank investigation
							Resolution was taken up— <persRef ref="collier-john">Collier</persRef>
							of New-York made a speech of an hour and a half; in which he fully
							exposed the system of combined Banks and safety fund of that State— The
							political caballing—the reservation of 3 per Cent from the Capitals of
							all the Banks— The party combinations intertwining with them—the
							patronage of, by, and through three Bank Commissioners with Salaries
							each of 1500 dollars a year—the holy league and Covenant of banks
							loaning money at seven per Cent, against a Bank which discounts at six
							per Cent, with the bearing of all this upon the Resolutions of the
							Legislature of New-York, instructing their Senators and requesting their
							Representatives to oppose the rechartering the Bank of the United
							States—the jugglery of party discipline—the political frauds and
							hypocrisy of the party, styling itself <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
							<pb n="400" type="ms"/>Republican party—their subserviency to the
							Regency of the Albany Argus, and their motive of recommending themselves
							to favour by their joint and violent attack upon <persRef
								ref="root-erastus">Root</persRef>, were all displayed in a manner at
							once cautious, playful, and bitter— After he closed, <persRef
								ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie</persRef> rose merely to urge that
							the question might be taken to day— I gave notice that I should before
							the final question upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clayton’s
							Resolution should be taken offer an Amendment to it, which I sent to the
							chair— There was then a Call of the House—and after one Call of absent
							members a suspension of it—202 members answered as present. The vote
							upon Root’s Motion to choose the Committee by Ballot was 100 to 100. and
							the <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker</persRef> decided against
							the ballot—that is to appoint the Committee, himself— <persRef
								ref="plummer-franklin">Plummer</persRef> voted for the Ballot but
							before the decision was announced changed his vote— <persRef
								ref="jenifer-daniel">Jenifer</persRef> was unaccountably lounging
							about the house, and did not get within the bar till after his name was
							called— He asked, but was not allowed to vote— <persRef
								ref="burges-tristam">Burges</persRef> was absent—sick—<persRef

								>Randolph</persRef> of New-Jersey, <persRef ref="mitchell-george"
								>Mitchell</persRef> of Maryland—<persRef ref="ingersoll-ralph"
								>Ingersoll</persRef> absent— In this case as in the choice of the
							Speaker and the apportionment Bill, by carelessness and accident always
							operating against right the decision was against the declared sense of a
							majority of the House— <persRef ref="wayne-james">Wayne’s</persRef>
							Amendment was then taken up and he spoke for two hours till he was so
							hoarse that he could not articulate; and the house adjourned leaving his
							speech unfinished— Walking home with <persRef ref="drayton-william"
								>Drayton</persRef> and <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"
								>Cambreleng</persRef>, I noticed this and Drayton said Wayne had
							never learned when or how to finish a speech— The apportionment Bill

								>Findlay</persRef> and <persRef ref="barbour-john">John S.
								Barbour</persRef> absent— My draft of a Bill was discussed without
							drawing near to any conclusion— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Horn read
							a letter to him from a manufacturer expressing a strong aversion to
							repealing the minimum system of imposts— The majority of the Committee
							are equally averse to it and I told them I would report just such a Bill
							as they should direct. But I assured them that I became from day to day
							more firmly convinced that this system of minimums must ultimately be
							abandoned, or that there would be an insurrection in the South— The main
							argument for sustaining the minimums in the Letter to Horn was that
							Congress would not directly levy so high duties as are levied by this
							winding process— We are to meet again to-morrow, and I told the members
							of the Committee I should wish to meet every morning until we shall have
							come to some determination upon my draught of a Bill— In the House
								<persRef ref="wayne-james">Wayne’s</persRef> proposed amendment to
								<persRef ref="clayton-augustin">Clayton’s</persRef> Resolution was
							taken up— He spoke for about two hours; and the instant he sat down
								<persRef ref="hubbard-henry">Hubbard</persRef> of New-Hampshire
							rose, moved the previous Question, and a call of the House— The direct
							object of this was to cut off all discussion upon my proposed Amendment—
							The call of the house was first made, and when the first call of names
							was gone through Hubbard moved to suspend the call and renewed the
							motion for the previous Question— To this I objected that the House
							could not entertain <hi rend="italic">two</hi> motions from a member at
							once— <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">The Speaker</persRef> who
							evidently favoured Hubbard told me the previous Question did not admit
							of debate, unless I spoke to a point of order, which I said I did—and it
							was to enquire whether the Gentleman from <pb n="401" type="ms"
							/>New-Hampshire could have two Questions under the consideration of the
							House at once— The Speaker said the Question was whether the call of the
							House should be suspended— <persRef ref="everett-edward"
								>Everett</persRef> suggested to me while I was speaking that I might
							speak against that. I said I did object to the suspension of the Call,
							because I wished every member in the City whose attendance could be
							procured should be present— I deemed my Amendment extremely important
							and was very anxious to have a full vote upon it— I believed the
							original Resolution proposed a Committee with powers which the House
							itself did not possess and was not competent to give— The Speaker said
							again I could not debate the previous Question—but I did not permit
							myself to be disconcerted by these interruptions— I said I had yesterday
							given notice that I should move this Amendment expressly declaring that
							it was to anticipate that the previous Question would otherwise be moved
							before I could offer it— I had abstained from assigning my reason for
							offering it, but my object had been to shew as I thought I could that
							the original Resolution would transcend the legitimate Powers of the
							House— I had no desire that any humiliating process should be pursued
							towards the absent members, but merely that they might be sent for and
							their attendance requested— The doors were for some time closed and then
							the call was by consent suspended— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Hubbard’s motion for the previous question was not sustained by a
							majority of the House—the question was taken by yeas and nays on M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Wayne’s Amendment, and lost 26 to 164 my
							Amendment was taken up— <persRef ref="beardsley-samuel"
								>Beardsley</persRef>, <persRef ref="hogan-william">Hogan</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> successively offered
							Amendments for delay, and supported them by speeches— <persRef
								ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie</persRef>, <persRef ref="polk-james"
								>Polk</persRef> and <persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef>
							took part in the debate— I had proposed to limit the time for receiving
							the Report to the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of April— M’Duffie
							asked me to extend it one week further to the 21<hi rend="superscript"
								>st</hi> to which I assented— The other Amendments were all
							rejected, by successive yeas and nays— Twice the yeas and nays were
							taken upon motions to adjourn, which were rejected, and at last the yeas
							and nays were taken upon my Amendment which was carried 106 to 93— On
							the Resolution as amended the question was taken and carried without a
							division— Everett renewed the motion for the appointment of the
							Committee by Ballot nine instead of seven— But afterwards withdrew the
							motion— I moved five because the Speaker had told me that seven having
							been once rejected would be out of order— But five were thought too few—
							I moved seven again—and the Speaker said that would be the number if not
							objected to— At half past eight the house adjourned, and it was past
							nine when I got home— <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">The

							He has seen <persRef ref="livingston-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Livingston</persRef>, the Secretary of State upon the
							Subject; he thinks very favourably of the project; but that it must
							first be undertaken by a private Company, before the aid of the

							read to me a Letter he had recently received giving a deplorable account
							of the situation of things in that part of South-America; but he still
							clings to his project, which seems likely to share the fate of <persRef
								ref="charlemagne">Charlemagnes</persRef> project for uniting the
							waters of the Rhine and of the Danube— I attended the Committee on <pb

								ref="dayan-charles">Dayan</persRef> and <persRef ref="horn-henry"
								>Horn</persRef> were the only members present— We discussed my

							coming to any result— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Horn is an
							importing merchant, and inclines to no further restriction, to provide
							against the frauds upon the Revenue— Dayan seems to be a more candid and
							tractable person— Horn’s personal appearance is not prepossessing. We
							read through the Tariff-Bill of 1828. but could come to no conclusion—
							In the House on the reading over of the Journal of yesterday, the Bank
							investigation Committee were announced— <persRef ref="clayton-augustin"
								>Clayton</persRef>, Adams, <persRef ref="mcduffie-george"
								>M’Duffie</persRef>, <persRef ref="johnson-richard">R. M

								>Cambreleng</persRef>, <persRef ref="thomas-francis"
									>Thomas</persRef> of Maryland, and <persRef ref="watmough-john">Watmough</persRef>— The Chairman and a
							Majority of the Committee, are taken from the minority of the House upon
							the Resolution as it passed— But Watmough seemed to be satisfied with
							the Committee— He told me it was not so bad as he had expected— The
							Committee were notified by the Chairman to meet at ten to-morrow
							Morning, in the Room of the Committee of Claims— There came up in the
							House a Resolution offered some time since by <persRef
								ref="root-erastus">General Root</persRef> for an Amendment of the
							Constitution by changing the mode of electing the President of the
							United States— This was a favourite electioneering topic five years
							ago—but no one cares a straw about it now— Root made a short Speech; but
							no one answered him, and he got rid of his Resolution by moving its
							reference to the Committee of the whole on the State of the Union— The
							appropriation Bill, came next, and a very warm debate arose upon a
							motion of <persRef ref="davis-warren">Warren R. Davis</persRef> of
							South-Carolina, to strike out the item for Salary of a Minister to the
							Republic of Colombia— The Committee had obtained Evidence that the
							Republic of New-Grenada had six Seaports on the Atlantic, and three on
							the pacific Ocean by a Letter from <persRef ref="santander-francisco"
								>General Santander</persRef> now at New-York. <persRef

								<persRef ref="archer-william">Chairman of the Committee of foreign
								Relations</persRef>, upon the discoveries in physical Geography that
							he had made since this subject was last before the house. This sarcasm
							quite overset Archer’s philosophy and put him in a passion— This item
							was passed by for further consideration— The additional item of 35000
							dollars for contingencies to the Turkish Legation was also passed over
							and the Bill was reported by the Committee to the House— Before the
							adjournment, I asked to be excused from further service upon the
							Committee on Manufactures—but it was late; and at the request of
								<persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Richard M. Johnson</persRef>, and of other members, I waved the

							the Committee-Room of the Committee of Commerce. Some arrangements were
							made for going to Philadelphia together— There was some question with
							regard to expenses, and allowances by the House to the Committee— It was
							agreed to consult the precedents of the Committee which in the year
							1819. was sent to Philadelphia on a similar Commission—particularly the
							accounts of their expences— I observed from recollection that the
							Committee on that occasion agreed among themselves to accept no
							invitations to dinner, or to evening parties— I proposed the same
							agreement now, and it was so unanimously determined. We agreed to meet
							again at ten tomorrow Morning— At the Meeting of the Committee on

									>r</hi> Condict</persRef>, <pb n="403" type="ms"/><persRef

							frauds on the Revenue was further discussed without coming to any
							conclusion. Agreed to meet again, Monday Morning— In the House I renewed
							my request to be excused from further service on the Committee on
							Manufactures, for reasons which I briefly stated— Much to my surprize it
							excited considerable debate—to abridge which, and particularly at the
							request of <persRef ref="wayne-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wayne</persRef> of Georgia, I withdrew the motion for the present,
							reserving to myself the right of renewing it, before the departure of
							the Bank Committee for Philadelphia— The General Appropriation Bill, was
							taken up; and many of the items discussed in Committee of the whole were
							again debated. I took part only in that upon the item of 35000 dollars
							for contingencies of the Legation to the Porte— <persRef
								ref="archer-william">Archer</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of
							Foreign Relations now explained the purpose of the appropriation, which
							was for presents upon the Negotiation and exchange of Ratification of
							the Treaty— Archer gave a succinct account of the Negotiations, and did
							full Justice to the preceding Administrations with regard to these
							Transactions— The appropriation was partially opposed, from various
							quarters, and especially by <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">E.
								Whittlesey</persRef> of Ohio—who objected to it, as a payment of
							tribute— I supported the whole appropriation, and it was carried almost
							unanimously, though Archer at one time had consented at the instance of
							M’Duffie to reduce it to 26000 dollars— The calls from all parts of the
							House for the whole appropriation, that M’Duffie finally gave up his
							objection to any part of it.— This was the second instance of effect
							produced by my share in a debate, favourable to the opinion which I
							sustained— The first was in the passage of my Amendment to the Bank
							investigation Resolution— It increases beyond expression my anxieties;
							as the reasons assigned by several members for objecting to excuse me
							from the Committee on Manufactures— It was near 6 in the Evening when
							the House adjourned— <persRef ref="stansbury-arthur">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Stanbury</persRef> the Reporter
							brought me just at the adjournment, the notes taken by the Englishman

									rend="superscript">r</hi> Cambreleng</persRef> said he would not
							be ready to go, before next Wednesday— It was then determined to go that
							day— <persRef ref="clayton-augustin">Judge Clayton</persRef> takes
								<persRef ref="clayton-julia">his wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="u"
								>child</persRef> with him, and goes separately— <persRef
								ref="thomas-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas</persRef>
							goes to Frederick to-morow, and will meet us at Baltimore Wednesday
							Evening— <persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="johnson-richard">Johnson</persRef>, Cambreleng, <persRef
								ref="watmough-john">Watmough</persRef> and myself are to go together
							in an Extra Stage, which I engaged to procure, and which is to come and
							take us up, at the door of the House at 1. O’Clock next Wednesday— The
							account of expences of the Committee of 1819. was not in the Clerk’s
							Office, but in that of the Register of the Treasury— A Copy of it was
							sent for by the <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Clerk of the
								House</persRef>
							<pb n="404" type="ms"/>and by him brought to me, after the House met— I
							gave it to M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> M’Duffie. In the House,
								<persRef ref="wickliffe-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wickliffe</persRef> moved a Resolution for Enquiry into the conduct
							of <persRef ref="hayward-elijah">Elijah Hayward</persRef>, Commissioner
							of the General Land-Office, and Wickliffe being himself Chairman of the
							Committee of Public Lands he moved its reference to the Committee on
							Private Lands— Heyward was very feebly defended by one or two Members
							from Ohio—chiefly by Irwin—who moved its reference to a
							Select-Committee. Another moved its reference to the Committee on the
							Judiciary— I supported by a very few words the Select Committee—
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">E. Everett</persRef> whispered to me
							that <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">the Speaker</persRef> would in that
							case make me Chairman of the Committee, but I said I should excuse
							myself, as by the Rule of the House every member already on two
							Committees may— The question to refer to the Private-Lands—but that for
							reference to the judiciary, succeeded by a small majority— Everett voted
							for it, saying to me that it was because that Committee would pursue the
							enquiry—while Stevenson the Speaker would have appointed a Committee who
							would smother it— While the House was in Session, <persRef
								ref="adams-john2">my Son John</persRef> sent me a Letter from
								<persRef ref="=adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> received by the
							mail informing me of the death of my dear and amiable brother <persRef
								ref="adams-thomas2">Thomas Boylston Adams</persRef>, last Monday the
								12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March 1832. in his sixtieth
							year, which he would have completed on the 15<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of September next— I had engaged to dine this day with
								<persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef>, but sent him an apology; and made one verbally to
								<persRef ref="pendleton-edmund2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pendleton</persRef> who had invited me to dine with him next
							Tuesday— The house adjourned soon after two O’Clock. I called and saw
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> at his lodgings, and enquired of him the state of
							the apportionment Bill— He said his Amendment had failed by a vote of 24
							to 23. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay being absent, and probably to
							avoid voting against the Amendment, as if present he would have done. He
							said <persRef ref="frelinghuysen-theodore">Frelinghuysen</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="tomlinson-gideon">Tomlinson</persRef> had also voted
							against us; and now <persRef ref="chambers-ezekiel">Chambers</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="naudain-arnold">Naudain</persRef> were called away by
							sickness in their families. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster’s
							dinner was brought in, and I left him; telling him I would see him again
							on Monday to have some Conversation with him on the Tariff— Evening Snow
							Storm I wrote to <persRef ref="adams-ann">my brother’s widow</persRef>,
							and to my Son Charles.</p>

								<persRef ref="worthington-john">Worthington</persRef> present—
								<persRef ref="barbour-john">Barbour</persRef> there a few minutes
							but went away to attend a meeting of the Virginia delegation. I read my
							draught of a Bill for the prevention of frauds on the Revenue. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Horn is the most intractable member of the
							Committee— It is impossible to bring him to agree to any thing.— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dayan has been very inflexible too—but he
							was this day a little more yielding— We are to meet again to-morrow— In
							the House, it was the weekly day for Petitions and Resolutions— Several
							Bills passed to the third reading— The General Appropriation Bill, and
							one other passed.— A Bill relating to insolvent debtors was debated.
								<persRef ref="baldwin-henry">Judge Baldwin</persRef> called me out
							and promised to call upon me this Evening— I went to the Senate chamber
							at the door of which I met <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef>, with whom I went in
							to the Committee Room, and we talked over the Apportionment Bill and the
							Tariff— The former he said, would have no chance of amendment if called
							up before the return of <persRef ref="chambers-ezekiel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Chambers</persRef> of Maryland, and
								<persRef ref="naudain-arnold">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Naudain</persRef> of Delaware. I desired him if he could to keep it
							until my return; which he said he would. Of the Tariff he spoke with
							much uncertainty— I pressed him upon the abandonment of the minimums,
							and the return to a system of ad valorem duties— He could not come to
							it, for he is too closely tied to <persRef ref="clay-henry"
								>Clay</persRef>— He asked me if I would repeal the duty on wool— I
							said yes, upon coarse wool, as part of the disposition to ad valorem
							duties— He said no, he could not do that. It had prodigiously increased
							the breed of sheep, and the repeal of it would be very unpopular in
							New-England— I said a bounty upon raising Sheep, might benefit upon
							agriculture, but to tax the indispensable raw material one hundred per
							Cent— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster seemed apprehensive that
							the final compromise of interests would be made at the Expence of
							New-England— In the Evening <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frye</persRef> called upon
							me—afterwards Judge Baldwin and finally <persRef ref="mitchel-thomas2"
								>Thomas R. Mitchell</persRef> of South-Carolina— Baldwin said
								<persRef ref="wilkins-william">Judge Wilkins</persRef> was about to
							propose in the Senate as an Amendment to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay’s Resolution, his Baldwin’s plan for the modification of the
							Tariff—Ad valorem duties—cash payments and a duty on Sales at Auction.
							The judge was very anxious that I should see and converse with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilkins upon <pb n="406" type="ms"/>his
							plan— He said he should see Wilkins again in the morning, and would ask
							him to call upon me in the house. Mitchell came to urge me not to
							persist in my request to be excused from serving further in the
							Committee on Manufactures— He thought I could render much service by
							conciliating the parties— I told him I could accomplish nothing—having
							not the slightest weight with either of the parties— He said that he and
							his friends were exceedingly unwilling to vote upon the question; but
							that if I did insist, he should call for the yeas and nays— It is clear
							that if I renew the request, it will have the appearance of seeking more
							compliments—and with this notice that the yeas and nays would be called,
							I should be suspected of forcing them as a trophy to my own importance—
							They do not wish to vote at all upon it, and if I compel them to vote
							they will attribute it to my own Self-sufficiency— My situation is
							distressing, deeply; without prospect of coming out of it creditably,
							but I cannot withdraw from it; and must abide by the issue—such as a
							higher power may dispense.</p>

							present Tariff-system is to be maintained—which I believe not only

							was urged strongly by the manufacturers, and because I wish to see how

							for this emergency, I doubt whether I should have brought them to report
