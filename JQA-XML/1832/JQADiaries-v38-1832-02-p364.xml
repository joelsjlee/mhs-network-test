						<p>Walk to the Capitol. Call at <persRef ref="gadsby-john"
								>Gadsby’s</persRef> to see <persRef ref="silsbee-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Silsbee</persRef>, but he was gone to
							the Senate— Met <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">C J Ingersoll</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef>. Went into
							the Senate Chamber and spoke with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Silsbee, about the Letter of <persRef ref="hedge-isaac;hedge-t">I. L.
								and T. Hedge</persRef>. Plymouth— <persRef ref="benton-thomas"
								>Benton</persRef> introduced to me his Colleague <persRef
								ref="buckner-alexander">Buckner</persRef>—and <persRef
								ref="grundy-felix">Felix Grundy</persRef> of Tennessee— I met
								<persRef ref="barrell-samuel">S. B. Barrell</persRef> there— In the
							House <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett’s</persRef>
							Resolution to call for a copy of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							Article of the Treaty September 1830 with the Chickasaws was taken up.
								<persRef ref="huntington-jabez">Huntington</persRef> made a speech
							to support it, and <persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> a speech
							against it— A party movement from which I doubt if much good will come—
							The hour expired, and the apportionment Bill was called up— <persRef
								ref="hubbard-henry">Hubbard</persRef> replied at some length to the
							arguments against his motion— <persRef ref="sutherland-joel"
								>Sutherland</persRef> and <persRef ref="mccarty-johnathan"
								>M’Carty</persRef> of Indiana spoke against him— I revised a Note in
							pencil from the <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker</persRef>,
							urging me to sum up in reply— It was four O’Clock and great impatience
							in the House for the Question— I made a very short and incoherent Speech
							saying not half what I intended, and omitting several more forcible
							positions which occurred to me after it was all over— I recurred to the
							Constitution and to a calculation shewing that the Committee which fixed
							the ratio at 48000 had taken special care of their own States— It
							brought up <persRef ref="barstow-gamaliel">Barstow</persRef> of
							New-York—to vindicate himself and Polk to refute my positions— The
							question was taken by yeas and nays, and carried 98 to 96. to strike out
							48000 and insert 44000. Polk then told me that he would give up the
							question— <persRef ref="holland-cornelius">Holland</persRef> of Maine
							who was on the Committee came to me with a calculation to shew that
							Maine was better off with 44000 than with 48000. <persRef
								ref="bates-james2">Bates</persRef> of Maine had already announced
							that he should vote for 44000. <persRef ref="evans-george2"
								>Evans</persRef> had been all along with us, and spoke this day for
							44000— <persRef ref="wickliffe-charles">Wickliffe</persRef> thanked me
							for my calculations and said he had intended to present the same
							himself. <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Cambreleng</persRef>
							congratulated me upon our success. I had despaired of the vote and was
							overjoyed at the Event— The whole Bill was to be modified in conformity
							to the change in the ratio, and the house adjourned at half past four.—
							I rode home rejoicing though much dissatisfied with my own performance—
							I wrote in the Evening to <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor
								Lincoln</persRef>— <persRef ref="connell-john">J. Connell</persRef>
							spent a couple of hours here— The Danish Claim Commission have adjourned
							till May.</p>

							reply to <persRef ref="hayne-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hayne</persRef> and others upon his Resolution, for an immediate
							repeal of duties— There was a call of the House, and upwards of twenty

							called over, the doors were closed, and several excuses made in behalf
							of <pb n="365" type="ms"/>the sick— <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">The

							absent who voted with us yesterday— Two or three voted against us now,
							who were absent yesterday, and there were two or three deserters— The
							Reconsideration placed the Bill just where it was before the vote was
							taken yesterday.— That is it restored the number 48000—with the motion
							of <persRef ref="hubbard-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hubbard</persRef> to strike it out and insert 44000— <persRef
								ref="allan-chilton">Allan</persRef> of Kentucky moved to recommit

								>Sultans</persRef> Sign Manual I went up to the Capitol to attend a
							Meeting of the Committee on Manufactures but had mistaken the day to
							which they had adjourned— It was to Monday, and <persRef
								ref="condict-lewis">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Condict</persRef>
							asked me to meet them at ten O’Clock—to which I agreed— In the House
								<persRef ref="johnson-cave">Cave Johnson</persRef> of Tennessee,
								<persRef ref="drayton-william">Drayton</persRef> of South-Carolina,
							and <persRef ref="clayton-augustin">Clayton</persRef> the new Member
							from Georgia occupied the hour and more upon <persRef

							Chickasaw Treaty— Johnson opposed the call; but spoke in the severest
							terms of the Sabine Reservation bargains of <persRef
								ref="lewis-william3">Lewis</persRef> the second Auditor and declared
							that they were utterly disapproved by the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President</persRef> himself— Clayton made a strange and by no means
							a wise Speech, dashing at the right hand and the left—opposing the
							call—abusing the mover and supporters of it, and finishing by offering
							an Amendment, with which he said he would vote for the original
							Resolution— It was a Second Resolution declaring that the House called
							for the 5<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Article of the Chickasaw Treaty
							because <pb n="367" type="ms"/>they considered Indian Treaties to be no
							Treaties at all. After the expiration of the hour, the private Bills
							were taken up. There is a Rule of the House that not more than three
							Bills shall be committed to a Committee of the whole at once; but it is
							never observed— Ten private Bills were this day committed together—
								<persRef ref="letcher-robert">Letcher</persRef> of Kentucky in the
							Chair— There was one, a claim of a man named <persRef ref="u"
								>King</persRef> for a vessel alleged to have been impressed into the
							public Service in the late War and lost—upon which a debate of nearly
							two hours arose, and it was postponed till next Friday— There were two
							or three other Bills for giving revolutionary Pensions into which by
							amendments an allowance of interest for fifty years was introduced. I
							finally made an objection, in one case, but without success, but there
							was barely a quorum to vote— The Bills were reported with the amendments
							to the house— The seven bills reported without Amendment were then
							passed to be engrossed— Everett then moved to adjourn; but was persuaded
							by those who wished to pass the amendments, to withdraw his Motion— I
							immediately renewed it, and said I hoped the house would not without
							further consideration adopt that principle of the allowance of interest;
							and the house did adjourn. I rode home— We had company to dine as in the
							margin— I had invited several others who made excuses— <persRef
								ref="burges-tristam">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burges</persRef>
							of Rhode-Island finally declined this morning on account of infirm

							which he has been writing to <persRef ref="colden-cadwallader">C C.

							was charged with the thanks of <persRef ref="carroll-charles">M<hi

							Report from the Committee of Manufactures— My original plan has been
							disconcerted by the occurrence of intermediate events— I have been
							diverted from it by other subjects of deliberation upon which my
							attention has been wasted to no purpose— I have now concluded to take up
							the subjects by fragments, devoting two or three days to each of them,
							and then endeavouring to link them together into one system— I glanced
							this Evening at a new point of Constitutional power—Art 1. Section 8.

						<p><persRef ref="brown-jonas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brown</persRef> called upon me this Morning, and said that <persRef
								ref="lawrence-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Lawrence</persRef> an importing merchant from Boston, was here, and
							as well as himself was ready to give any information either individually
							to me, or to the Committee on Manufactures which we might be desirous of
							obtaining, and which they could afford— I understood him that their
							particular motive was to shew the evils, which would be hazarded by
							abandoning the system of progressive minimum duties, or by changing the
							valuation from the invoice prices, to the value of the Article here, at
							the place of Sale.— I told him I should be happy to see and confer with
							him and with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lawrence upon these
							Subjects, particularly as I thought some of the members of the Committee
							inclined to the opinion that the change of the place of valuation, and
							the graduated minimums, would be beneficial. He appeared to be strongly
							apprehensive of ill effects from these measures but had not time to
							explain to me how they could operate injuriously.— I told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown there had been gross
							misrepresentations in the public newspapers of opinions expressed by me
							respecting the revision of the Tariff.— That he might be assured I
							should neither abandon nor sacrifice, the interests of the manufacturers
							nor of the Constituents whom I represented—though I had said, and still
							thought that this was an occasion upon which there ought to be a Spirit
							of mutual concession exercised on both sides.— He said he had believed
							and understood this to be my opinion, and had so written in a Letter to
							one of his friends which had been published— I went at half past ten to
								<persRef ref="chapman-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chapman’s</persRef> Room, and sat for my portrait. He has a small
							exhibition of pictures chiefly copies from Italian Masters. At the House
								<persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Duffie</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means,
							presented his Tariff Bill, which was in substance a project for reducing
							all imposts to a duty of 12 1/2 per cent ad valorem upon all
							importations— There was a long report with the Bill— <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-ralph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ingersoll</persRef>, a member of the Committee said that he
							dissented entirely from the Bill, and from the Report of the majority,
							and with one other member from Pennsylvania, should present a Counter
							report— <persRef ref="verplanck-gulian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Verplanck</persRef> said that he differed both from the majority and
							minority of the Committee and should present his views either in a
							Report of his own, or upon the floor. There was some discussion upon the
							proposal to print 5000 copies of the Report, but that lays over a day
							for consideration. <persRef ref="mercer-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Mercer</persRef> from the Committee on Internal
							improvement moved the printing of a late Report to the British House of
							Commons upon the use of Steam-carriages on common roads— This lead to a
							discussion till <persRef ref="polk-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Polk</persRef> called for the Orders of the day— Several bills were
							read the third time and passed— A Bill or two from the Senate were read
							the first and second Time and committed— The apportionment Bill was then
							taken up— The question upon <persRef ref="kerr-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Kerr’s</persRef> motion to strike out
							48000 and insert 44400 as the ratio was about to be taken by yeas and
							nays—and as it appeared to be the last opportunity for pressing the
							smaller number I again addressed the house in a very confused and
							ill-digested Speech presenting however some considerations which had not
							before, and recurring particularly to the Journal of the Convention of
							1787 to shew the principles upon which the Representation had been
							established in the Constitution. As usual I omitted half what I had
							intended to say, and blundered in what I did say— I was answered at some
							length by <persRef ref="coulter-richard">Coulter</persRef> of
								Pennsylvania—<persRef ref="clay-clement">Clay</persRef> of Alabama
							and Polk of Tennessee; and sustained by <persRef ref="wayne-james"
								>Wayne</persRef> of Georgia, and <persRef ref="letcher-robert"
								>Letcher</persRef> of Kentucky who tried with success the good
							effect of joking. The question was taken by yeas and nays, and <pb
								n="370" type="ms"/>resulted in a tie—97 and 97—the Speaker decided
							in favour of the change and for the second time we carried our vote— But
							we could not get the Bill engrossed. <persRef ref="taylor-john"
								>Taylor</persRef> moved to recommit the Bill, with Instructions to
							strike out 44400. and insert 53000, and took the yeas and nays his
							motion was rejected 63 to 126. <persRef ref="mcduffie-george"
								>M’Duffie</persRef> moved that the Bill should be engrossed, but
								<persRef ref="mitchel-thomas2">Mitchell</persRef> of South-Carolina
							moved to adjourn and it was carried— So, we shall lose it again
							to-morrow— Rode home in the rain— I received notice that the joint
							Committee on the Centennial Celebration, would meet at ten to-morrow
							Morning— Evening industriously occupied— I began this morning the

						<p>Finished the version of the 76<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and began
							that of the 77<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm— Attended the joint
							Committee of the two houses on the proposed centennial celebration of
								<persRef ref="washington-george">Washington’s</persRef> birth-day.
							They met in the Committee room of the Military Committee of the Senate—
							There were 22 members of the Committee of the House present— <persRef
								ref="burges-tristam">Burges</persRef> of Rhode Island, and <persRef
								ref="duncan-joseph">Duncan</persRef> of Illinois were absent— The
							Committee of the Senate consisted of Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							<persRef ref="clay-henry">Clay</persRef>, <persRef ref="webster-daniel"
								>Webster</persRef>, <persRef ref="chambers-ezekiel"
								>Chambers</persRef>, <persRef ref="poindexter-george"
								>Poindexter</persRef> and <persRef ref="bibb-george">Bibb</persRef>—
							It was agreed that the Committees should act and vote separately— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay was Chairman of the Committee of the
							Senate—and <persRef ref="thomas-philemon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thomas</persRef> of Louisiana who offered the Resolution Chairman of
							the Committee of the House. There was much diversity of opinion and much
							trifling debate— <persRef ref="mccoy-william">M’Coy</persRef> of
							Virginia and <persRef ref="thompson-wiley">Thompson</persRef> of Georgia
							were for reporting that it would not be expedient to hold any
							celebration of the day— Thompson made that motion, and as it was
							opposed, rather stiffly urged it, till I observed that it was a
							difference of opinion upon an important principle, on which I hoped the
							question would be fairly taken, upon which Thompson withdrew his motion.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said there were two modes of
							celebrating the day, which might be proposed—one by the delivery of a
							Sermon—the other far less probable by that of an Oration— A motion was
							then made that <persRef ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice
								Marshall</persRef> should be requested to deliver an Oration upon
							that occasion, and after some discussion it was adopted— The Chairmen of
							the two Committees were appointed a Sub-Committee to make the
							application and to report his answer to an adjourned Meeting of the
							joint committee to-morrow Morning— There was some idle debate on the
							question whether in the event of the Chief-Justices declining the
							Sub-committee should be authorized to make application to any other
							person— <persRef ref="bell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bell</persRef> of Tennessee said there was but one other person to
							whom with any sort of propriety application could be made if the Chief
							Justice should decline, and he was a member of the House itself— Without
							direct notice of this allusion which was to me I said it would perhaps
							be best not to anticipate, that the Chief Justice would decline— I hoped
							he would not. If he should, I inclined to the belief that it would be
							best to make of it a religious ceremony and to have a Sermon— The
							Meeting then adjourned till to-morrow. In the House, there was a second
							long debate upon the motion of <persRef ref="mercer-charles">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mercer</persRef> at the instance of
							the Committee on Internal Improvement to print a report to the British
							House of Commons made in October last, upon the use of Steam-carriages
							on common Roads— The yeas and nays were taken 120 to 61. <persRef
								ref="root-erastus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Root</persRef>
							offered a Resolution to print 5000 copies of it; but the motion got
							entangled in a question of order and failed— The Apportionment-Bill was
							taken up— And motion upon motion <pb n="371" type="ms"/>was made to
							strike out the number of 44400 agreed upon yesterday, and the yeas and
							nays were taken six or seven times— <persRef ref="evans-george2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Evans</persRef> of Maine moved to
							strike out 44400 and insert 44300 which would give Maine an additional
							member— <persRef ref="ashley-william">Ashley</persRef> of Missouri moved
							42300— <persRef ref="clay-clement">Clay</persRef> of Alabama 47300— A
							call of the house was demanded, and they prevailed upon <persRef
								ref="clayton-augustin">Clayton</persRef> of Georgia to move a
							reconsideration of the vote of yesterday—and then the house adjourned— I
							wrote all the Evening</p>

						<p>I called at <persRef ref="chapman-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							and his answer were read by <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>— The question what was
							next to be done ensued— <persRef ref="drayton-william">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Drayton</persRef> offered a

									>r</hi> Howard</persRef> of Maryland, and <persRef
								ref="condict-lewis">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Condict</persRef>
							of New-Jersey intimated the wish that another application should be
							made— They did not name me, but were understood as referring to me— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Condict had asked me privately whether I
							would undertake it, and I had noticed to him the objections in the way—
							Those objections or others were felt by a large majority of the
							Committee; and Colonel Drayton’s motion was adopted with my vote and
							approbation— I was glad to be relieved from the necessity of undertaking
							this task, for the performance of which the time was too short— It was
							then determined that the report should recommend that the two Houses of
							Congress should adjourn over from the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi>
							to the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of February; and that the
								<persRef ref="post-reuben;durbin-john">Chaplains</persRef> should be
							requested to perform divine Service on that day— Also that the Members
							of Congress would unite with their fellow-Citizens in other
							festivities—(a Ball.) Then a Resolution was proposed to take this
							opportunity to carry into effect a Resolution of Congress for
							transporting the remains of <persRef ref="washington-george"
								>Washington</persRef> to be deposited under the Capitol, on that
							day. This was much debated—and opposed by <persRef ref="mccoy-william"
								>M’Coy</persRef> of Virginia—<persRef ref="thompson-wiley"
								>Thompson</persRef> of Georgia, and <persRef ref="hall-thomas"
								>Hall</persRef> of North-Carolina— But it passed by a large
							majority— It was proposed by <persRef ref="wickliffe-charles"
								>Wickliffe</persRef> of Kentucky. The two Chairmen were charged to
							make the Report to the respective Houses, and the Committees adjourned.—
							In the House, <persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie</persRef>,
							Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, reported a Bill to
							recharter the Bank of the United States with modifications. 5000 copies
							of the Bill and Report were ordered to be printed—and also of a
							Counter-report made by <persRef ref="alexander-mark">Alexander</persRef>
							of Virginia, for the minority of the Committee— Everett’s Resolution was
							taken up and Hogan of New-York made a very animated and severe Speech,
							in elegant Language;—but extremely pointed upon <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Everett’s</persRef> motives in bringing forward
							this Resolution— <persRef ref="hogan-william">Hogan’s</persRef> voice is
							bad—almost feminine in its intonations— His person is not prepossessing,
							but his action is temperate: and not ungraceful— His diction more
							polished and ornate than that of any other member of the House, Everett
							himself not excepted. He was listened to with great attention by the
							House, and Everett winced under the castigation— But he had not time to
							reply for the hour expired and the House passed to the orders of the
							day. A private <pb n="372" type="ms"/>Bill for the relief of a man named
								<persRef ref="u">Knight</persRef> which had been debated all day
							last Friday was again discussed—supported by <persRef
								ref="wardwell-daniel">Wardwell</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="jewett-freeborn">Jewett</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="taylor-john">Taylor</persRef> of New-York; and opposed by

								ref="jarvis-leonard">Jarvis</persRef> of Maine and <persRef
								ref="drayton-william">Drayton</persRef>— It passed nevertheless to
							be engrossed, by a large Majority— Adjourned over to Monday— My Evening
							was absorbed by visitors— First <persRef ref="white-joseph">Joseph M.
								White</persRef> of Florida who made some enquiries upon what he
							thought the variance between the English and Spanish diction of the
							Florida Treaty— He is much distressed at the new Nominations for Offices
							in the Territory— Particularly for the substitution of a worthless

							Lawrence and another person left with the Committee— There was a

							remission of duties upon the Iron to be imported by them for their work.
							It was agreed that a separate report should be made on this and upon the

							Tariff and Bank questions— I asked him when he expected to report, upon
							the Resolutions of the house calling on him for his plan. He thought not
							for several weeks— I observed with regard to the last Conversation
							between us, that I found there was a determined opposition among the
							manufacturers to the change of the place of valuation, and to the
							abandonment of the graduated scale of the minimums— He said that in his
							Report in answer to the enquiries of the Committee on that subject he
							should give estimates, but no opinions— We had company to dine—the names
							in the margin above, and much conversation— I took too great a share in
							it— The art of entertaining is to <hi rend="italic">stimulate</hi>

						<p>My dear <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">wife’s</persRef> birth-day.
							57. I began the version of the 78<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm—
							A long, and very beautiful Poem—of which I versified this morning the
							first eight verses; in a most unsatisfactory manner— Last evening I came
							under the censure of self-reproof, for indiscreet garrulity with my
							company— This morning I am discontented with the employment of my time
							in Solitude; and so life passes away—never satisfied with myself— For
							this there is no remedy— The cause is deficiency of intellect— The
							means—resistance against the allotment of Providence— The result
							perpetual disappointment, and the failure of attempts beyond my powers—
							This has been the character of my existence—Boundless
							Aspirations—unremitting exertions—Perpetual failures— Nothing can be
							more desperate than this attempt at a new versification of the Psalms;
							and yet I pray that I may not give it up in despair— I heard <persRef
								ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef>
							this morning from 1. Timothy 2.8 [“]I will therefore that men pray every
							where, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting:”—and in the
							afternoon from Romans 1.22. “Professing themselves to be wise, they
							became fools.” I paid not sufficient attention to these discourses to
							derive any benefit from them— My thoughts were wandering as too often
							they do— If I could faithfully devote every hour of the Sabbath to God,
							I might more profitably occupy every hour of the week to the benefit of
							mankind— I find a passage in reading the Bible, which I had never
							particularly noticed before— Part of the last words of <persRef
								ref="david">David</persRef>. “But the Sons of <persRef ref="satan"
								>Belial</persRef> shall be all of them as thorns thrust away,
							because they cannot be taken with hands. But the man that shall touch
							them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a Spear; and they shall
							be utterly burnt with fire in the same place”— 2. Samuel 23.6–7— How are
							the preceding verses of this Chapter to be understood? Who are the sons
							of Belial? compare the other passages of Scripture where they are named,
							See <persRef ref="milton-john">Miltons</persRef> Paradise lost— Is there
							an inversion of tenses in this passage— The past, the present and the
							future are often indiscriminately blended in the language of Scripture—
							What is the import of this figure of Speech—comparing the sons of Belial
							to thorns, and indicating how they are to be treated— Why are these last
							Words of David made to precede the Catalogue of his Mighty Men— His
							numbering of the People— The disorders of his last days— His transfer of
							the crown and his dying charge to <persRef ref="solomon"
								>Solomon</persRef>? Here is a good subject for a historical and
							moral discourse.</p>

						<p>I passed an entirely Sleepless Night. The iniquity of this Apportionment
							Bill, and the disreputable means by which so partial and unjust a
							distribution of the Representation have been effected agitated me so
							that I could not close my eyes— I was all night meditating in search of
							some device if it were possible to avert the heavy blow from the State
							of Massachusetts and from New-England— I drew up this Morning a short
							paper, to shew to the members of the Pennsylvania delegation appealing
							to their Justice and generosity as umpires upon this question— Walking
							up to the Capitol I met <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> and spoke to him
							upon the Subject— He said he would make a dead set against the Bill in
							the Senate. I gave my paper to <persRef ref="mckennan-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Kennon</persRef> of Pennsylvania,
							the member who voted for us, when we carried the ratio of 44000 and the
							next Morning moved for a reconsideration— I asked him to shew the paper
							to the other members of the Pennsylvania delegation; and he did to some
							of them— I spoke to <persRef ref="crawford-thomas">Crawford</persRef>
							who said he was willing to take our number; and to <persRef
								ref="sutherland-joel">Sutherland</persRef> who said he would if the
							Senate would send back the Bill with 46000 for the ratio. In the House
							the Bill was taken up, and <persRef ref="polk-james">Polk</persRef> from
							the Committee reported not only the number of 47700 as instructed, but
							all the remnant of the Bill with the number of Representative, for each
							State, which was not within the charge of the Committee— When the report
							was received an amendment was moved to substitute 45500 for 47700.
								<persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie</persRef> moved the previous
							question, upon the plea of saving time, and useless debate, but he could
							not carry it— Then Polk made it a point of order; that the House having
							instructed the Committee to report a number, no motion of amendment by
							another number could be received— The <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew"
								>Speaker</persRef> decided that it could. M’Duffie pronouncing the
							decision perfectly absurd. Polk insisted, persisted, and appealed from
							the decision of the Speaker, who read from the Manual a Rule which I
							thought fully sustained him— M’Duffie pronounced it inapplicable, but
							Polk withdrew his appeal. many numbers down to 42000 and up to 59000
							were moved and rejected; and lastly the number reported by the Committee
							47700 was adopted and the Bill ordered to be engrossed for a third
							reading— I hung my harp upon the willow— The Senate passed in amended
							form the second Resolution sent them yesterday by the House. They struck
							out all invitations, and made of the Resolution a request to the
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President of the United
								States</persRef> to superintend the removal, and deposit under the
							Capitol of Washington’s remains— The House concurred in the
							Amendment.</p>

							Vernon; though M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Custis does consent that
							those of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Martha Washington should be

							<persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">Whittlesey</persRef> moved to strike
							out the first and second Sections, which provided for the payment of

							Bill, from the Senate for the Settlement of claims for Interest of all

							was not carried— I said a few words in favour of it, in answer to
								<persRef ref="burges-tristam">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							subject— I therefore suppressed my feelings and my Speech— Whittlesey
							called for the yeas and nays, and the Bill passed to a third reading

								Everett</persRef> retired soon after the Meeting was opened— I had
							called the Meeting, and stated that my object was that we should consult

							that I had drawn up and submitted through <persRef ref="mckennan-thomas"

								Webster</persRef> said he would move its reference to a Select

							reduce the ratio of apportionment to 44000.— It was agreed that the
							members of the delegation in the House, should converse with those from
							Pennsylvania, and expostulate with them, upon this outrageous injustice
							to Massachusetts and to all New-England. I also invited the attention of
							the Meeting to the attitude assumed by Pennsylvania in the Union for the
							last four or five years. She has taken the lead of the general Policy of
							the Country from Virginia, and she is exercising its certainty, for her
								<pb n="377" type="ms"/>own advantage— It might deserve enquiry,
							whether for that of the whole Union. She had settled the election both
							of <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Vice-President</persRef> to her own Satisfaction—
							She was now doing the same again— The Tariff was her Tariff— The Bank
							was her Bank— They are now before us for further enquiry, and it might
							be well to consider the subjects with reference to the interests of the
							whole as well as to the special interests of Pennsylvania— She had
							heretofore valued herself upon being an unambitious State; and the
							complaint to her had perhaps too strongly been against Virginia, of
							leading or misleading the Union— Virginia has now become a State of
							subservient policy; and is internally so much convulsed, as to be
							deserving rather of compassion than of envy— Pennsylvania has now become
							the domineering State; and her exercise of her supremacy is not
							encouraging. I read also an extract of a Letter I received two days
							since from <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>
							stating the interest taken there in the apportionment Bill, and the
							mortification experienced at the reversal of the decision for a ratio of
							44000.— In the House this was one of the days devoted to private Bills;
							but none of them was taken up— <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">D. J.
								Pearce</persRef> moved a recommitment of one of <persRef
								ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie’s</persRef> appropriation Bills, to
							strike out an appropriation of 70000 dollars for the Navy-yard at
							New-York, to insert it for Newport Rhode-Island— M<hi rend="superscript"

							of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but
							condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.” M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gurley, is a preacher of very different
							character from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith— Plain, practical
							and persuasive; he has neither metaphysical refinement, nor oratorical
							flourish in his discourses— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith abounds
							in both— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gurley has a very handsome
							person and florid countenance,—and a very good voice, not very well
							modulated— This is an art of which few of our public Speakers have even
							a conception. Preachers less than any others— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Gurley’s doctrine like his texts was pious, humane and
							benevolent, totally free from all sectarianism, and such as any preacher
							of any Christian denomination might have delivered— In the interval
							between the Services I received a visit from <persRef

								Poinsett</persRef>, who came to take leave, being on the point of
							departure to return to Charleston South-Carolina— He went last Summer to

						<p><date>20. V. </date>Monday.</p>
						<p>Finished the version of the 78<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm— One
							of the longest and most difficult in the whole collection— But what is
							difficulty? Whether I ought to pray for life and health to complete this
							task, or for grace and self-knowledge to abandon it, and commit to the
							flames what I have done, I do not know— There is a level of poetical
							power which a man may attain, and which he cannot transcend— It differs
							in different men; and mine is very low— I have known it these fifty
							years, for so long have I written verses, and yet I persevere— I have
							published very little, and the success of that little has been in no
							wise flattering— My prose writings published have fared not much better—
							Why should I longer weary the world with verse or prose?— This was a
							heavily rainy, gloomy day— I rode to the Capitol— Being Monday, the
							States were successively called for presentation of Petitions, a most
							tedious operation in practice though to a reflecting mind a very
							striking exemplification of the magnificent grandeur of this Nation, and
							of the sublime principles upon which our Government is founded— The
							forms and proceedings of the House—this calling over of States for
							Petitions—the Colossal emblem of the Union over the <persRef
								ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker’s</persRef> chair—the Historic Muse
							at the Clock the echoing pillars of the Hall, the tripping Mercuries who
							bear the Resolutions and Amendments between the Members and the
							Chair—the calls of ayes and noes with the different intonations of the
							answers from the different voices—the gobbling manner of the Clerk in
							reading over the names— The tone of the Speaker in announcing the vote,
							and the varied shades of pleasure and pain in the countenances of the
							members on hearing it would form a fine subject for a descriptive poem—
							There was little done in the House after receiving the Petitions. There
							was a bill for the relief of insolvent debtors partly discussed and
							postponed— A Question upon printing papers relating to Railways and
							Canals in which <persRef ref="mercer-charles">Mercer</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="ellsworth-william">Ellsworth</persRef> took part. But
							the house was thin—the day was dark—and <persRef ref="carson-samuel"
								>Carson</persRef> before three moved to adjourn; because it was so
							melancholy— They accordingly adjourned, to the great indignation of
								<persRef ref="hubbard-henry">Hubbard</persRef> of New-Hampshire, who
							has the Claimants for Revolutionary Pensions in charge and burns with
							zeal to assist them— He asked for the yeas and nays on the adjournment,
							and to fool him into fury they were refused— He went out of the House
							almost sputtering with rage— I went out to walk home; but found it
							pouring with rain and return’d by the western door, and poked into the
							Senate in chamber— They were in Session, but very soon adjourned. I met
							there <persRef ref="barbour-james">Governor James Barbour</persRef>, who
							is returning from Baltimore. <persRef ref="barbour-lucy">His
								family</persRef> have been there from the time of the <persRef
								ref="clay-henry">Clay</persRef> Convention of which he was
							President. He left them there and has now been to fetch them back— He
							said he should proceed homeward the first fair day— He told me that
								<persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Madison’s</persRef> health was very bad; and that for some time it
							was feared he would not survive the winter. But that he was now better.
							I spoke with <persRef ref="ruggles-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Ruggles</persRef> Chairman of the Senate’s Committee on
							Claims, about the Bill for the relief of <persRef ref="lincoln-jotham"
								>Jotham Lincoln</persRef>— He said <persRef ref="silsbee-nathaniel"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Silsbee</persRef> had the
							papers, but that the Committee had decided another case founded on the
							same principle, against the claimant. I had received an invitation from
								<persRef ref="chambers-ezekiel">E. F. Chambers</persRef> and others
							Committee of a party for a public dinner at <persRef
								ref="barnard-frederick">Barnard’s</persRef> on the centennial day,
							to attend the dinner as a guest— <persRef ref="johnston-josiah">J. S.
								Johnston</persRef> told me that they wanted me not only to attend;
							but to make Toasts for them and a Speech— I said, my health would not
							permit me to attend, and that I was a bad Toast maker as he knew— I
							might have added I was a worse Speech-maker. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi>
							<pb n="380" type="ms"/>Clay spoke to me; and asked when the Committee on
							Manufactures would report— I said not for several weeks— He asked if we
							should not notice <persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie’s</persRef>
							Anti Tariff Report and <persRef ref="gallatin-albert"
								>Gallatin’s</persRef> Memorial— I said we should probably meet some
							of their arguments— He said he had been so much occupied that he had not
							found time to read them— I told him that M’Duffie’s Report was one of
							his dinner-Speeches without its fury— I had read only a small part of
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin’s Memorial— I said my
							attention had quite unexpectedly to myself, but necessarily been
							diverted from the Tariff to this iniquitous apportionment Bill: he said
							it was a very unjust one, and they would endeavour to change the ratio
							in the Senate, but they had got a very bad Committee— I said something
							to him of my plan for representation of the whole people and he referred
							me to a mode of giving a Representation to fractions in the Constitution
							of Kentucky— <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">Gen<hi rend="superscript"
									>l.</hi> Samuel Smith</persRef> accosted me and immediately
							began upon his new controversy with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay—
							He appeared to be deeply wounded. Clay treated him with such extreme
							severity that Smith who has four score years upon his head is as
								<persRef ref="adams-john">my father</persRef> used to say upon the
							compassionate list— All parties think Clay pressed him too hard— Smith
							told me almost with tears in his eyes, that he had come with a
							deliberate resolution by all possible means to avoid all controversy
							whatever with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and he intimated a
							wish that I would give him a written confirmation of his Statement of
							what passed between him and me, relating to the British Statute
							concerning the Colonial Trade— I told him I would give him such a
							Statement if he desired it—but I saw no necessity of it for him; was
							inasmuch, as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay had not denied the
							correctness of that part of his Statement— There was no issue between
							them upon that point— Smith said my father had once appealed to him for
							a Statement, which he had very cheerfully given him— The Truth is that
							in dissuading him from his demand of a certificate from me I mean it in
							kindness—for if I do give it, the truth will bearer harder upon him than
							anything that has been said of him by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay. I went in to the Library, and took out the Volume of Constitutions
							of the United States— On going again to the Eastern door of the Capitol
							I found my Carriage had been there; and <persRef ref="kirk-john"
								>Kirk</persRef> being told I was gone, had gone away— I walked home
							in the midst of a cold heavy rain; following great part of the way a
							Company of Militia from Philadelphia, marching through the flood with a
							fine band of music— They had come from Philadelphia to join in the
							projected centennial procession. I wrote this evening till I was falling
							asleep over my paper.</p>

						<list>
							<item>Smith William S.</item>
						</list>
						<p>The Solemnities intended for this day at this place lost all their
							interest for me by the refusal of <persRef ref="washington-john">John A.
								Washington</persRef> to permit the remains of <persRef
								ref="washington-george">George Washington</persRef> to be
							transferred to be entombed under the Capitol. A refusal to which I
							believe he was not competent, and into the real operative motives to
							which I wish not to enquire— I did wish that this Resolution might have
							been carried into execution— But this wish was connected with an
							imagination, that this federative Union was to last for ages. I now
							disbelieve its duration for twenty years, and doubt its continuance for
							five— It is falling into the fear and yellow leaf— For this among other
							reasons I determined that my celebration of this day, should only be by
							sharing in its devotions— I attended the performance of divine Service
							at the capitol where a very ordinary prayer was made by <persRef
								ref="post-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Post</persRef> the
							Chaplain to the House of Representatives and a singular though not
							ineloquent Sermon was delivered by <persRef ref="durbin-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Durbin</persRef>, Chaplain to the
							Senate— His text was from Revelations 4.11. “Thou art worthy O Lord, to
							receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things,
							and for thy pleasure they are, and were created.”— The discourse was not
							written; nor was it composed to be preserved— It was extemporaneous and
							yet well suited to the occasion— It exalted the character of Washington
							perhaps too much— There were close approaches to the expression of a
							belief, that there was something supernatural in his existence. There
							seemed little wanting to bring out a theory that he was a second Saviour
							of mankind— That he had a charmed Life, and was protected by a special
							Providence was explicitly avowed as a belief— The religious character of
							Washington was dwelt on with great emphasis. The House was well filled,
							but not crowded— The 148<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 100<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalms were sung, without instrumental
							Music, and a hymn at the close— The <persRef ref="calhoun-john"

								ref="smith-william-steuben">William S. Smith</persRef> was here—
							There was a dinner party at <persRef ref="barnard-frederick"

						<p>Began the version of the 80<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm, to my
							own grievous dissatisfaction. I had received yesterday a Petition to the
								<persRef ref="barry-william">Postmaster General</persRef>, from the
							principal inhabitants of Quincy, asking for a daily Mail between that
							place and Boston, with a Mail from Boston through Quincy to New-Bedford—
							I called with it this morning at the General Post Office; and left it
							for the Postmaster-General who was not there— At the House, <persRef
								ref="drayton-william">Drayton</persRef> had offered a Resolution for
							altering the Rule of the House which devotes Friday’s and Saturday’s to
							the consideration of private business, so that Saturday <pb n="383"
								type="ms"/>alone should be thus specially appropriated— Various
							amendments were proposed, and after a discussion of two hours or more
							they were all rejected, as well as the motion itself. There ought to be
							no private business before Congress— There is a great defect in our
							Institutions by the want of a Court of Exchequer or chamber of Accounts.
							It is judicial business, and Legislative Assemblies ought to have
							nothing to do with it— One-half of the Time of Congress is consumed by
							it; and there is no common rule of Justice for any two of the cases
							decided. A deliberative assembly is the worst of all tribunals for the
							Administration of Justice— <persRef ref="clayton-augustin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Clayton</persRef> of Georgia smuggled
							in by consent of the House a Motion for the appointment of a select
							Committee to examine into the Affairs of the Bank of the United States
							with power to send for persons and papers— It must lay over a day for
							consideration— The Orders of the day were postponed and the General
							Appropriation was taken up in Committee of the whole <persRef
								ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef> in the Chair— I fully
							intended not to have opened my lips on this bill, and my purpose is as
							seldom as possible to enter into any debate. But the impulse to take
							part is continually recurring and I cannot always resist it. I rose this
							day twice—once to support a contested item of appropriation for
							surveying of the public Lands—and once to object to an amendment
							proposed by <persRef ref="archer-william">Archer</persRef>, Chairman of
							the Committee of Foreign Relations. The appropriation which I supported
							was adopted. The amendment proposed by Archer was to add 35000 dollars
							for contingencies to an item of 2500 dollars for a dragoman at
							Constantinople— I asked what it was for? Archer declined giving the

							entertaining different political opinions were unanimous in recommending
							the Amendment— I still objected, though declaring my confidence in the
							Committee— My opposition would probably have been of no avail, but
								<persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie</persRef> joined in it, and
							in his peremptory tone said the information must and should be given—if
							the Committee chose it might be given to the House, but given it must
							be— The amendment was then rejected without counting. Some other
							amendments were adopted and the Bill was reported to the House.—
							Adjourned near five— I wrote till Midnight, unable still to bring up my
							arrears of Journal.</p>

						<p>Another change in the Night to severe Cold— I lose in the Morning what I
							borrow upon the Night— The Sun was up this morning when I rose— I called
							again at the General Post-Office, and saw this Morning the <persRef
								ref="barry-william">Postmaster General</persRef>. He told me that he
							had already given the order asked for by the Petition from Quincy, for a
							Mail from Boston through Quincy to New-Bedford, and thus a daily Mail
							between Boston and Quincy— I called at <persRef ref="chapman-john"
								>Chapmans</persRef> room; but he had been to Alexandria and was not
							returned; on going back towards <persRef ref="gadsby-john"
								>Gadsbys</persRef>, I met him; but his room was not in order, and I
							promised to call some other Morning— I then called at Gadsby’s and saw
								<persRef ref="silsbee-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Silsbee</persRef>— Asked him for the papers in the case of <persRef
								ref="lincoln-jotham">Jotham Lincoln Adm<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi></persRef>— The Bill at three successive Sessions has passed
							the House of Representatives, but always stopped in the Senate. Silsbee
							afterwards sent me the papers— Silsbee told me of the Battle between
								<persRef ref="jones-walter">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Walter
								Jones</persRef> and <persRef ref="thornton-james">Thornton</persRef>
							the second Comptroller at the Supper table of the Ball at <persRef
								ref="carusi-samuel">Carusi’s</persRef> Saloon on Wednesday. Jones
							broke two decanters upon Thornton’s head— The dinner at <persRef
								ref="barnard-frederick">Barnard’s</persRef> was very delightful, and
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef> made one of his most eloquent Speeches. The
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>
							<pb n="384" type="ms"/>and <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
								>Vice-President</persRef> were both invited and both declined
							attending the dinner. My Letter and Toast were read, and well received—
							The President took no part in any of the celebrations of the day— In the
							House the Resolutions on the Table were taken up, and disposed of in
							order— I moved a Resolution to call for the Papers relating to the
							Negotiation with Turkey; partly on account of the item of appropriation
							proposed yesterday by the Committee on Foreign Relations, and the
								<persRef ref="archer-william">Chairman’s</persRef> affectation of
							Secresy— But my motion could not be received without the unanimous
							consent of the House; and <persRef ref="root-erastus">General
								Root</persRef> objected that he had been a month waiting for an
							opportunity to offer a Resolution, and had not been able to offer it
							yet. <persRef ref="everett-edward">Everett</persRef> advised me to move for a suspension of the rule—but I
							preferred acquiescing in Roots objection— <persRef ref="branch-john">Branch</persRef> had offered a
							Resolution for papers relating to the Live-Oak Plantation— A controversy
							between him and <persRef ref="white-joseph">White</persRef> of Florida
								<persRef ref="johnson-richard">R. M. Johnson</persRef> moved that
							the House would hold next Monday an Evening Session at 7. O’Clock to
							take up the Post-Office and Post-road Bill— And after much discussion
							and various motions to change the day, and to meet at eleven A.M. which
							all failed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson’s Motion was carried—
							The Resolution offered some weeks ago by <persRef ref="lecompte-joseph"
								>Le Compte</persRef> for a Committee to require into and report upon
							the expediency of an Amendment to the Constitution to make the Judges of
							the Courts of the United States hold their Offices for a Term of years,
							was called up and the House refused to consider it by yeas and nays 124
							to 46. The Bill for the relief of <persRef ref="decatur-stephen">Stephen
								Decatur</persRef> came up, in Committee of the whole <persRef
								ref="speight-jesse">Jesse Speight</persRef> Chairman. <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef> produced Letters from
								<persRef ref="decatur-susan">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Decatur</persRef> and <persRef ref="mcknight-mary">Mary
								M’Knight</persRef> and a Statement by <persRef
								ref="mckight-priscilla">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Twiggs</persRef>, somewhat discreditable to M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Decatur, charging her among other things of having given to
								<persRef ref="canning-stratford">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Stratford Canning</persRef> a gold snuff-box which had belonged to
							<persRef ref="decatur-stephen">her husband.</persRef> <persRef ref="carson-samuel">Carson</persRef> insisted that
							the Statement was a forgery, and charged it as infamous and disgraceful—
							But Twiggs is a Georgian— <persRef ref="wayne-james">Wayne</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="wilde-richard">Wilde</persRef> testified to his
							character and Carson retracted and apologised for his censure— The
							debate became exceedingly ardent and somewhat bitter. About four the
							Committee rose, and the House adjourned— In the Evening <persRef
								ref="hastings-j">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J. S.
								Hastings</persRef> of Boston spent about two hours with me— He is
							interested in the Glass Manufactory, and said that Statements from the
							New-York Convention, concerning that interest would soon be presented
							here— But he appeared much more prepared for a modification of the
							Tariff conciliatory to the South, than any other manufacturer that we
							have seen— He told me that a great majority of the People of the Eastern
							Section of the Union were convinced that it would be indispensably
							necessary.</p>

							of <persRef ref="brown-jonas2">J. B. Brown</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="schenk-peter">P. H. Schenk</persRef> which I could not find— We
							read two Memorials, and adjourned to meet again next Wednesday Morning
							at half past ten— In the House <persRef ref="branch-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Branch’s</persRef>
							Resolution was taken up— <persRef ref="white-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> White</persRef> of Florida moved an
							amendment which brought on an extremely violent debate between them,
							full of the most offensive personalities— Charges of direct falsehood
							cast to and fro— Branch accusing White of speculating to pocket some
							hundreds of dollars upon the Government and upon his Constituents and
							White retorting that Branch had wasted 45000 dollars of public money,
							upon useless agencies in this business, and of having appointed last
							Winter one of his near relatives on this Service, and increased his
							Salary 600 dollars after his own dismission from Office— This was
							continued by speech and counterspeech for nearly two hours— <persRef
								ref="carson-samuel">Carson</persRef> was beginning to speak on the
							side of Branch when the <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew"
								>Speaker</persRef> stopped him, and said he had indulged M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Branch, on account of the peculiar
							situation he was in with reference to the executive Office he had
							recently held, and in which his conduct had been made a topic of
							animadversion—but that this indulgence could be extended no further—
							Branch finally acceded to White’s Amendment with a modification
							suggested by <persRef ref="wickliffe-charles">Wickliffe</persRef>, and
							the Resolution was adopted— I renewed my request for the consent of the
							House to offer a Resolution, this Morning, and <persRef
								ref="root-erastus">Root</persRef> now suffered it to be received,
							though he objected to the next one that was offered— Mine lies over till
							Monday— The Bill for the relief of <persRef ref="decatur-susan">Susan
								Decatur</persRef> was taken up again in Committee of the whole—
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> produced a
							Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Decatur explaining the
							donations which in <persRef ref="mckight-priscilla">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Twiggs’s</persRef> Letters she was
							charged with having made—and Everett produced the gold snuff-box itself
							which she was said to have given to <persRef ref="canning-stratford"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning</persRef>—and the box
							was paraded about the house and deposited on the Clerk’s Table. It was
							like the bloody robe of <persRef ref="caesar-julius">Caesar</persRef>
							produced by <persRef ref="antony-mark">Mark Antony</persRef> in the
							Forum, and with much the same motive— Here it was practically to give
							the lie to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Twiggs— But <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">Pearce</persRef> still sustained her, by
							corroborative statements and particularly by intimating that the
							Snuff-box had been offered to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Canning,
							though not accepted by him— Upon which Everett said Pearce was too tough
							for him—and I said I had no doubt the statement was true— For I did not
							believe M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Twiggs capable of a wilful
							falsehood. <persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie</persRef> too sung
							out a premature Io Triumphe upon the production of the box— Pearce’s
							Amendment was however rejected by a vote of 70 to 80. at least so
							announced by <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">the Speaker</persRef>.—
								<persRef ref="watmough-john">Watmough</persRef> made an eloquent
							Speech in M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Decatur’s favour, as White of
							Louisiana had done yesterday— <persRef ref="blair-james">Blair</persRef>
							of South Carolina moved to strike out the first Section of the Bill.—
							This introduced the debate upon its Merits— M’Duffie wanted to press it
							into the House, and prevailed upon Blair to withdraw his motion; but it
							was immediately renewed by <persRef ref="dickson-john">Dickson</persRef>
							of New-York— The Committee rose after four, and the House immediately
							adjourned. Walking homeward <persRef ref="wilkin-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilkin</persRef>, member from Orange
							County New-York lent me his Umbrella— We had company to dine as named in
							Margin— <persRef ref="holmes-john">John Holmes</persRef> Senator from
							Maine had promised he would come but failed— The Company in general were
							less known to us than usual, and the party was accordingly less
							pleasant— <persRef ref="plummer-franklin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Plummer</persRef>, Member of the House from Mississippi, is a native

						<p>Snow melting off— On going to the Presbyterian Church, I found scarcely

							and heard a Stranger from Alexandria— He read prayers for Sexagesima
							Sunday—and preached from John 5.40—“And ye will not come to me that ye
							might have life.” There is a rule of Grammar which seems to be infringed
							by this Sentence. Conjunctions couple like cases; like Moods and Tenses—
							I think it should be that ye may have life—or it should be ye <hi

							couples <hi rend="italic">would</hi> and <hi rend="italic">might</hi>.
								<hi rend="italic">will</hi> and <hi rend="italic">might</hi> make a

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith from his text was Religion is Life—
							And in this respect there was a remarkable coincidence between the
							morning and afternoon texts though the Sermons were by different
							preachers and of different denominations— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Smith made no use of the narrative in the Story of the Prodigal Son,
							only mentioning it as a beautiful Parable— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Smith always connects the conclusion of his discourse
							immediately with his text; and then fills up the canvass with argument,
							illustration and declamation— I spent the Evening at home, retrieving my
							arrears.</p>

							and unfolded to me his plan for the settlement of the Tariff question—
							It is simple enough—20 per Cent upon all importations of Articles
							whether with or without foreign competition— Then gradually shortened

							upon Sales at Auction. This is his Panacea— He has revealed it to

								<pb n="388" type="ms"/>M’Duffie</persRef>, who did not tell him that

							should not, the President will.— <persRef ref="baldwin-henry">Judge

						<p>Began the version of the 83<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Psalm— One of
							extreme difficulty being full of proper names, which will not

							Officer named <persRef ref="u">Bird</persRef>, now residing in the State
							of New-York, but a native of Massachusetts called to ask my aid to a
							claim for a pension which he has before Congress— A Bill in his favour
							has passed the House of Representatives at two preceding Sessions, and
							at the last was reported without amendment by a Committee of the Senate,
							but not acted on, for want of time— <persRef ref="cooke-bates">Bates
								Cook</persRef> is his Representative with whom he requested me to
							consult, and to whom I did speak of the claim— At the Committee on

							Adrianople, Constantinople, and Buenos-Ayres, and the manufactures from
							them of Satinets and Kerseys— In the House, the Post-Office-Bill was
							taken up, in the Committee; reported to the House, and passed to be

								Vance</persRef> offered a Section to make Post Masters whose

								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>, by and with
							advice and consent of the Senate. Rejected in Committee of the whole 76
							to 54— He said he would offer it, upon another Bill— The other orders of
