						<p>I rose this morning, with a full determination to employ industriously
							the day, but accomplished nothing more than to write two short answers
							to Letters, and to begin the attempt to redeem the arrears of my diary
							from the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of March when I was compelled
							to stop it— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> went to
							Boston and returned to dine— I am still reading <persRef

							Anti-Masonry— And read this afternoon most of <persRef
								ref="mitchell-thomas">Mitchell’s</persRef> Translation of the Wasps
							of <persRef ref="aristophanes">Aristophanes</persRef>— These plays have
							opened to me a field of the drama, nearly new— I had before an imperfect
							idea of the old Greek Comedy— I find the Anapaestic measure of
							Mitchell’s Translation grows tedious in its long continuance— The day
							was showery and I lost again the opportunity of exercise by walking—
								<persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> came and
							settled for Rent of the Mount Wollaston farm to the 1<hi

						<p>Morning Thunder Showers— I finished reading <persRef ref="stone-william2"
								>W. L. Stones</persRef> Letters on Masonry and Anti-masonry, which
							are addressed to me— I have many reflections to make upon them, for
							future consideration— This day was undisturbed by visitors, yet all that
							I did was to finish a Letter I had begun yesterday to <persRef
								ref="rush-richard">R. Rush</persRef>— I have had these three days a
							dull rhumatic head-ache which I slept off this afternoon by a three
							hours Siesta.— Finished reading <persRef ref="mitchell-thomas"
								>Mitchell’s</persRef> Translation of the Wasps of <persRef

								ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas
								Greenleaf’s</persRef>— Visited also my Nursery of young trees—
							Almost all those which came up from the seed nut or stone, were killed
							by the winter down to the surface of the ground. New shoots have sprung
							up this Summer, which will be liable to be killed next Winter in the
							same manner— A very essential protection for trees in a Nursery is
							shade— And another essential is the art of trimming. I have served an

							and have just learnt that I know nothing about it.</p>

							Circumstances at the present time admonish me to be in a state of
							preparation for the approaching close of my life, and particularly to
							dispose of my worldly affairs by Will— I began this day to make a
							Schedule or Inventory of my property and of my debts— The last Will that
							I made was in 1819. since which the State of my property and the
							condition of my family have totally changed— I wrote one short Letter
							and part of another— About 6 in the afternoon I bathed with Charles at

						<p>I am afflicted again with the Lumbago, of which I suffered much in the
							Months of May and June— <persRef ref="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							passed the day at Boston, and returned at eve— I spent the Morning in
							writing upon Free Masonry; but am as yet only wasting Ammunition— The
							abolition of that Order I believe to be necessary; and I feel a moral
							obligation to contribute as much as may be in my power to the event— It
							is a moral ulcer in the Community; but to heal it requires a tender as
							well as a skilful hand. I would wish to write and speak on the subject
							with effect— To that end it must be presented under new views—and with a
							concentration of aim— I am distrustful of my powers, and totally
							dissatisfied with what I have written— I am resolved to <hi
								rend="italic">publish</hi> nothing, till the ensuing Presidential
							election shall be past— I rode with the <persRef
								ref="adams-louisa-catherine;hellen-mary">Ladies</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="adams-mary4;adams-georgeanna">Children</persRef> this
							afternoon, and called to see <persRef ref="thayer-solomon">Solomon
								Thayer’s</persRef> new Wheat— He has raised about forty bushels upon
							half an Acre. Gave me a slice of the bread— <persRef
