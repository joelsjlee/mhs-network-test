							Heard <persRef ref="lowell-charles">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Charles Lowell</persRef>, from Genesis 16.13—[“]Thou, God, seest
							me”—a deeply impressive discourse, and in the afternoon from 1. John 3.2
							“Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we
							shall be[”]— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowell dined with us, and
							his Son <persRef ref="lowell-james">James Russell</persRef>, a boy,
							eleven or twelve years old. I read the first Sermon of the Second Volume
							of <persRef ref="saurin-jacques">Saurin</persRef> Upon the assurance of
							Salvation, from Romans 8.37.38— Not so pleasing as some of those in the
							first Volume— His Discourses are all argumentative and hortatory—
							Somewhat objurgatory, without attempt at the pathetic I received from
							Cambridge, the <persRef ref="cambrensis-giraldus">Giraldus
								Cambrensis</persRef>, in the original Latin, and also translated in
							the compilation of <persRef ref="hooker-john">Hooker’s</persRef>
							Chronicles— I have been tempted to add several Stanza’s, but will
							suppress the inclination, believing that what I have written is quite
							enough for an experiment upon public opinion. <persRef

						<p>I have been about six weeks occupied in making a draft of a Will, with a

							September is closing, and in about six weeks more, I shall be required
							to go on to Washington— I have yet done nothing since my return, and
							must begin to act efficiently or do nothing— I therefore determine to
							make the preparation of my Will, my Morning’s work. Began upon it
							accordingly this Morning;—with the Resolution to complete and have it
							witnessed, on or before the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							October. After breakfast I visited my Garden, and laboured about two
							hours Finished a row of Apple-Seeds in the Garden from tree to tree,
							opposite to the Nursery Gate— The rest of the time I was hoeing weeds—
							Despairing of success in planting, I now work with no rational motive
							but for exercise— I then wrote a page of biography— After dinner, I rode
							with <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine;adams-abigail4;hellen-mary"
