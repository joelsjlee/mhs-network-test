						</lg>
						<p>Began the day by reading the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and two
							succeeding Chapters of Deuteronomy; and then made the version of the
								61<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Psalm, of which the above Stanza
							contains the first four verses or one-half— Deeming it eminently suited
							to the time and Circumstances I place it at the head of my Diary for the
							commencing year, and believe that the Trust in God which it imports is
							my sole reliance for this world and the next—in all humility imploring
							that support;—with this Sentiment I attended public worship at the
							second Presbyterian Church, and heard <persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> from 27.1 “Boast not
							thy self of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.”
							From this most excellent text he delivered a well written and eloquent
							discourse—the first written Sermon that I have heard him preach—juvenile
							and florid, but full of Sentiment, and of sound morality.— I had morning
							visits from <persRef ref="davis-john4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Davis</persRef> and <persRef ref="bancroft-george">G
								Bancroft</persRef>, from <persRef ref="white-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> White</persRef> of Florida, and his
							brother in Law<space/>from <persRef ref="lee-william">W. Lee</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="stackelberg-berndt">Baron Stackelberg</persRef>; who
							could not suppress his eagerness for the recovery of Finland from Russia
							to Sweden— I heard M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith again in the
							afternoon; from Ezekiel 2.7. “And thou shalt speak my words unto them,
							whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most
							rebellious” This Sermon was unwritten, and was commendable principally
							for its brevity— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith has not much
							extemporaneous matter in his mind, and is not fruitful in his unwritten
							premeditations— He should write at least one of his Sermons weekly— I
							began yesterday the rough draft of a Report to be laid before the
							Committee of Manufactures.</p>

						<p>Finished the version of the 63<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> and began

								ref="worthington-john">J. T. H. Worthington</persRef> absent— They

							them the answer of the <persRef ref="mclane-louis">Secretary of the
								Treasury</persRef> to the Letter I had written him asking for
							information—and I proposed to them the question whether the remission of
							duties should be postponed till after the extinguishment of the National
							debt—and whether the whole debt should be paid off before the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d</hi> of March 1833— I found opinions not at all
							matured or concurring on this subject— The opinion of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Condict and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Findlay was rather in favour of a considerable remission of duties
							immediately, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Barbour’s more decisively so
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dayan wishing to proceed to a
							reduction of the Tariff without reference to that question— I read a

								J. B. Brown</persRef>, which had been put into my hands yesterday by
								<persRef ref="davis-john4">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Davis</persRef>. The Committee agreed to meet again next Monday
							Morning at eleven. Then adjourned and I entered the house just as the
							Speaker took the Chair. Sundry Resolutions were offered and Bills
							reported and read— The rule itself limiting the debates upon Resolutions
							to one hour was modified— The Bill for adjusting the claim of the State
							of South-Carolina was taken up, on the motion of <persRef
								ref="mccoy-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Coy</persRef>
							to refer the Bill, and the Report of the Committee of Military Affairs,
							to the Committee of Claims. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Coy was not
							in the house, and I made a short speech in favour of the reference to
							the Committee of Claims, which brought up, <persRef

							and the motion for reference was rejected by a large majority— The
							question then came upon the Bill, but it was near four O’Clock, and the
							house adjourned— What shall I do upon the lesson of this day? The
							Committee on Manufactures do not agree with my principles with regard to
							the payment of the debt—a speech of ten minutes brings down upon me a
							swarm from all quarters of the house, among whom three members from my

							I was unquestionably right upon the principle, and that twenty members

						<p>Finished the version of the 64<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm. A
							great change of weather has taken place, and a thaw commenced which
							carried off almost all the Snow— I rode to the Capitol Hill, and called
							upon <persRef ref="adair-john">General Adair</persRef>, with whom 25
							years since I sat in the Senate— He gave me now some of his opinions,
							which were in no wise congruous with my own. He thought this new
							manufacturing interest was more deeply injurious to the interests of New
							England—than to those of any other part of the Union. His argument was
							that the natural interest of New-England consisted of Commerce—shipping
							and navigation— That by diverting a large capital from these objects to
							manufactures, great numbers of young men were thrown out of employment
							and means of subsistence, and obliged to emigrate to the western States
							and Territories, where they were remarkable only for idleness
							profligacy, and dishonesty— This he had found in an extensive tour he
							had made last year, in the Western Country—where the young men who had
							emigrated from Kentucky, active and industrious young men, would come
							and give him this account of the Yankees— He also disapproved of
							Steam-boat Navigation upon the Western rivers; and said their produce
							sold at higher prices in Kentucky before the Steam-boat trade than now.
							That the only advantage they had derived from Steam-boats was that of
							ascending the river, in a shorter time and having foreign goods cheaper—
							But the accidents and disasters to property were much greater in the
							Steam-boats, than they had been in the flats— He had also a very poor
							opinion of the coasting trade, which was of no profit to the Nation,
							nothing being gained by it, and it never made Sailors good for anything—
							I said that might be true of the Coasters employed in river Navigation—
							He said it was the same thing with them all, and every officer of the
							Navy would tell you that Sailors from the Coasting trade were not worth
							having— He spoke also with contempt of the Mania for internal
							improvement, which he said was a raging disease throughout the Country—
							To all this I made no reply—except to the last observation. I said I was
							much affected with the disease myself.— But I thought I perceived
							anti-<persRef ref="clay-henry">Clayism</persRef> and anti yankeeism
							at the bottom of it all, and saw how those two Spirits were operating in
							Kentucky— In the House a Multitude of Resolutions was offered— Twelve
							bills upon private claims were passed in Committee of the whole,
								<persRef ref="speight-jesse">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Speight</persRef> in the Chair, and reported to the House without
							Amendment. <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Whittlesey</persRef> proposed an Amendment to a
							Revolutionary Pensioners Bill, which raised a debate but the Amendment
							was rejected— <persRef ref="root-erastus">E. Root</persRef> started
							objections to all the Bills for giving pensions to individuals—but they
							were blasted down by a short speech from <persRef ref="thomas-philemon"
								>Philemon</persRef> Thomas of Louisiana— Upon one Bill from the
							Committee of Commerce, a small grant to a Surveyor of the Customs at
							New-York, objection was made by <persRef ref="jarvis-leonard">Leonard
								Jarvis</persRef> a member of the Committee, and before the question
							was taken the house about 3. O’Clock adjourned— <persRef

							for a copy of the Bill proposed at the Meeting the other Evening for the

						<p>I was up twice in the Night. First about one in the morning when I was
							awaked by <persRef ref="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> who
							was extremely ill; and had a very violent fainting fit— I went up to
								<persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirk</persRef>, roused him from bed
							and ordered him to go for <persRef ref="huntt-henry">Doctor
								Huntt</persRef>— But on returning below found M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams so much recovered that she declined
							having the Doctor sent for— About three there was a noise outside of the
							house, which seemed like an attempt to break open an outer door. I rose
							again, went below and examined all the doors and windows; and found all
							quiet— These incidents so disturbed my repose that it encroached upon
							the morning and I finally rose by daylight— I heard at the Presbyterian
							Church, <persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> from 1. John 3.20. [“]For if our heart condemn us,
							God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.”— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith’s discourse was a metaphysical
							analysis and deduction, comparing together self-condemnation as the
							less, and the condemnation of God as the greater— An unfortunate cause
							of numberless religious disputes is a want of precise definitions to
							words of the highest power— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith
							inveighed most learnedly against <hi rend="italic">Sin</hi>— But what is
							Sin?—one of the Apostles says it is something exceedingly Sinful— But
							this is one definition— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith I think
							defines Sin, anything contrary to the Will of God—but this would require
							another definition— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith approached this
							day nearer than has been usual with him to the doctrines of original
							sin, total depravity and regeneration— The weather and walking were so
							bad, that there were very few persons at Church. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Smith gave notice that on the same account there would be no
							afternoon service— Nor was <pb n="347" type="ms"/>there any at S<hi
								rend="superscript">t.</hi> John’s Church— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Adams was quite unwell the whole day; and in the afternoon

							He came to have some conversation with me upon the subject of Slavery in
							the District of Columbia— I asked him if he had seen the remarks that I
							made on presenting the Petitions from Pennsylvania— He said he had— But
							wished to know my Sentiments upon Slavery— I told him I thought they did
							not materially differ from his own— I abhorred Slavery; did not suffer
							it in my family, and felt proud of belonging to the only State in the
							Union, which at the first census of population in 1790 had returned in
							the column of Slaves—none—that in presenting the petitions I had
							expressed the wish that the subject might not be discussed in the house—
							Because I believed discussion would lead to ill-will—to heart-burnings,
							to mutual hatred, where the first of wants was harmony, and without
							accomplishing anything else— I asked him what he should think of the
							Inhabitants of the District of Columbia, if they should petition the
							Legislature of Pennsylvania to enact a Law, to compel all the Citizens
							of that State to bear arms in defence of their Country? He said he
							should think they were meddling with what did not concern them— I said
							the People of the District of Columbia, might say the same of Citizens
							of Pennsylvania, petitioning for the abolition of Slavery, not in <pb
								n="348" type="ms"/>that State itself but in the District of
							Columbia— He said there were many persons of that opinion, and he had
							been very desirous of distinctly knowing what my Sentiments upon the
							subject were— At the House—I received and presented to the House a
							Petition, for a Pension which was referred to the Committee on
							Revolutionary Pensions— Resolutions and Petitions were called for

								Connell</persRef> called this Morning and conversed with me upon his
							project for investing at interest the sums paid by the Danish Government
							for claims, until it can be paid to the claimants. I had received a
							Letter from him concerning it yesterday; with a printed copy of the
							Convention with Denmark— I advised him first to see the <persRef
								ref="mclane-louis">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> and ascertain
							whether it could not be done without requiring the action of the
							Legislature; and next to ascertain what the Bank of the United States
							would allow for interest on the deposit— I said that of course if the
							authority of Congress should be required to sanction the arrangement it
							would be on the condition that the deposit should be held at the risk of
							the Claimants— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Connell said he would
							immediately see the Secretary of the Treasury. <persRef ref="ohl-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ohl</persRef> brought a Letter
							of Introduction from <persRef ref="burns-john">John Burns</persRef>— He
							is a German Merchant of Philadelphia— He has a claim before Congress for
							a drawback upon sugars, and will see me again with documents and
							vouchers— I called upon the Secretary of the Treasury and had a long
							conversation with him upon the Modification of the Tariff; the payment
							of the debt the Manufactures, and the question as to rechartering the
							Bank of the United States. <pb n="351" type="ms"/>He said he had
							received no answers to the Letters of enquiry which he had addressed in
							various quarters upon receiving mine— I told him that my impression had
							been very strong, in favour of the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President’s</persRef> project and his plan for paying off the
							National debt by the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March 1833. but
							I had not found a single other person in Congress, favourable to that
							measure— And especially none willing to effect it by selling the seven
							Millions of public Bank Stock for eight— It is impossible for me to
							enter into the details of our Conversation— He had calculations to shew
							that the Bank Stock might be sold to pay off the three per Cents, not
							only without loss, but with profit to the Public—which supposing the
							Stock to be sold at eight Millions, were calculations to prove that five
							and two make three— I could not abide them— He said the Directors of
							this Bank were willing to take eight Millions for the Stock, without a
							pledge, but with the chance of a new Charter— I thought it would either
							be a fraudulent or a foolish bargain on our part— He said the Bank would
							give twelve Millions for the seven of Stock; with a pledge of a new
							Charter— And he agreed that the Treasury Department could not go on for
							a single year without the Bank— I told him I had prepared a Resolution,
							for bringing to <unclear>issue</unclear> in the House of Representatives
							the question of rechartering the Bank, when the Memorial from the
								<persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">President</persRef> and Directors
							relieved me from the necessity of offering it. He made several remarks
							upon <persRef ref="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay’s</persRef> speech the other day in the Senate, which he
							charged with being in many respects erroneous; and he read me an act
							relating to the sinking fund passed in 1830 which he thought would make
							it positively obligatory on the Government to pay off several Millions
							of the three per Cent Stocks the present year— He said he would write me
							another Letter stating that he had not yet collected the information
							which the Committee had requested— He wished also another call to be
							made on him in the shape of a Resolution of the house, of which he
							promised to send me a private Note— I returned the visits of <persRef
								ref="foster-thomas2">Thomas F. Foster</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="lamar-henry">Henry G. Lamar</persRef> members of the House of
							Representatives from Georgia— <persRef ref="lamar-mary">M<hi

							for that fraction. And he insisted that the veto of <persRef

							Department, and conversed with him respecting the Resolution of the
							house calling upon him for information respecting the operation of the

							recommend as an Agent to collect information; I said I had no person to
							recommend— He proposed that I should consult with <persRef
								ref="appleton-nathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Appleton</persRef>, and <persRef ref="davis-john4">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis</persRef> on the subject. I told
							him I believed the reduction of the Tariff must be a matter of
							compromise— Something must be given up on both sides— There was so
							little of that Spirit on either side, that I had scarcely a hope of
							effecting anything; but that I believed that the plan of reduction ought
							to come from the Treasury Department, and I for one should be disposed
							to give to such plan every <pb n="358" type="ms"/>aid in my power; so
							far as should be consistent with my duties— I should certainly not
							consent to sacrifice the manufacturing interest— But something of
							concession would be due from that interest to appease the discontents of
							the South— He concurred altogether with these opinions, and I told him I
							would soon see him again— On my way to the Capitol I called upon
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>—and gave him my recollections with regard to the
							question in his note which I had received last Evening— I gave him a

								ref="washington-george">President Washington</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="morris-gouverneur">Gouverneur Morris</persRef> in October 1789—
							He said that was sufficient, and that he believed there would be a

							and the apportionment Bill was taken up.— <persRef ref="wayne-james"

							taken by Tellers against striking out 48000 for 44000 by 105 to 81.
								<persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> then moved as an

							The question was debated till the hour had expired and the orders of the

							reading and an additional Section—introduced in it. <persRef

							Republic of Colombia— <persRef ref="archer-william">Archer</persRef>,

							brought upon me besides Archer, <persRef ref="everett-edward">E.
								Everett</persRef> and <persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill"

							followed— <persRef ref="claiborne-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Claiborne</persRef> of Virginia made a sort of mock

								ref="root-erastus">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Root</persRef>
							spoke again shortly against it— <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha"
								>Whittlesey</persRef> produced in a folio Volume of Manuscript
							Reports from the Committee of Claims, a Report made in 1810 by Root as
							Chairman of the Committee of Claims in its favour, but Root explained
							that the Report was drawn up by <persRef ref="gholson-thomas"
								>Gholson</persRef> of Virginia— That he Root reported it as Chairman
							of the Committee, but was against it himself— The Committee being
							divided 4 and 3. It appeared that Root had voted <unclear>for</unclear>
							it in the house. <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">Dearborn</persRef> made
							a short Speech in its favour. Said he had heard in the Gallery 25 years
							ago a very eloquent Speech in its favour and had then been fully
							impressed that it was just— The question was now taken by yeas and nays
							and the Bill passed 124 to 46— The claim was good for nothing; but any
							opposition from me would have been as fruitless as it was from Root— I
							barely recorded my vote against it. By suspending the Rule, the House
							got to and carried a vote to adjourn over till Monday. Then they
							resolved to call for Resolutions by States— Thirty or forty Resolutions
							were offered and passed— <persRef ref="nuckolls-william"
								>Nuckolls</persRef> offered one to make his enquiries of the
							Committee of Manufactures to which <persRef ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef> of Tennessee objected that he
							did not like to see a Resolution so smuggled in, but it passed 63 to 57.
								<persRef ref="lecompte-joseph">Le Compte</persRef> offered a
							Resolution that the Committee on the Judiciary be instructed to enquire
							and Report upon the expediency of an Amendment to the Constitution to
							make the Judges of the Supreme and other Courts of the United States
							hold their offices for a term of years— This was superseded by a motion
							to adjourn, about <pb n="360" type="ms"/>four O’Clock—there was then
							hardly a Quorum in the house to vote— I saw then the unfair advantage
							which the assiduous and the diligent sometimes take of the careless and
							the negligent— <persRef ref="verplanck-gulian">Gulian C.
								Verplanck</persRef> told me he had received the free-trade Memorial,

						<p>I was up till near Midnight. And it was seven this morning when I rose—
							In extreme cold weather I am apt to oversleep my time— I finished the
							version of the 71<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> and began that of the
								72<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Psalm— The Senate have taken off
							the injunction of secresy from their proceedings and debates on the
							nomination of <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren</persRef>,
							as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Great Britain—
							Several of the Speeches against him were published in the National
							Intelligencer this Morning, and in reading them I was belated at the
							Committee room which I reached not till a quarter past eleven instead of
							half past ten— The members present were <persRef ref="condict-lewis"
								>Condict</persRef>, <persRef ref="horn-henry">Horn</persRef>
							<persRef ref="dayan-charles">Dayan</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="barbour-john">J. S. Barbour</persRef> who did not however stay
							the Meeting out. <persRef ref="findlay-james">Findlay</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="worthington-john">Worthington</persRef> were absent—
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Condict produced the Statement of
								<persRef ref="schenk-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Schenk</persRef> sworn to before a magistrate here. Also hints for a
							remedial Bill— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Horn read a Letter from a
							friend of his of the manufacturing interest— To remedy the frauds on the
							Revenue in the importation of Woolens, I proposed the discussion of the
							question whether the place of valuation of the imported Article should
							be changed from the place whence exported to the port of importation.
								D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Condict inclined to the change—
							Schenk and <persRef ref="brown-jonas2">Brown</persRef> were against it,
							on account of the fluctuations in the Market, much greater here than in
							England. Horn and Dayan were also against it, objecting that the
							operation of the principle of valuation here would require great
							additional labour at the Custom houses, and would produce a want of
							uniformity in the amount of duties payable on the same Articles
							according to the varying estimates of the Appraisers at different Ports—
							I was requested to see and converse with the <persRef ref="mclane-louis"
								>Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> on these points—also on the
							expediency of rectifying the value of the Pound Sterling as fixed by Law
							for our Custom-houses; and also of shortening the terms of credit upon
							importations— I shewed D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Condict an Article
							circulating in the Southern Newspapers about what I said in the
							Committee of Manufactures of the necessity of mutual concession between
							the manufacturing and the Southern planting Interests in modifying the
							system of the Tariff— It was grossly misrepresented— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Condict said he had made the remark to the
							other members of the Committee this Morning. I called at <pb n="361"
								type="ms"/>the Treasury Department and waited some time in the
							Anti-chamber— Met there <persRef ref="wing-austin">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wing</persRef>, Delegate from
							Michigan, and <persRef ref="hassler-ferdinand">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Hassler</persRef> afterwards came in with his Reports in
							Manuscript upon weights and measures at the Custom-houses— I had half an
							hour’s conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lane— He
							strongly inclined to change the place of valuation of imported Articles
							as the best if not the only remedy against frauds in the importation of
							woolens—with regard to the shortening of the credits and the
							rectification of the value of the Pound Sterling, he gave no decided
							opinion; but said he would answer the enquiries of the Committee
							relating to the frauds at an early day— We think of reporting a separate
							Bill upon that Subject— I gave the name of <persRef
								ref="phillips-willard">Willard Phillips</persRef> of Boston, as the
							proposed agent to collect the information desired respecting the
							manufactures— He said he would appoint him— We had a company of
							Gentlemen to dine: among whom the two Agents of the French Government de
								<persRef ref="beaumont-gustave">Beaumont</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="tocqueville-alexis">Tocqueville</persRef>, who have been round
							to New-Orleans and through the Western Country since I met them at
								<persRef ref="biddle-nicholas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Biddle’s</persRef> in Philadelphia— I had a long conversation with
							Beaumont after dinner— He had many inquiries respecting the political
							and Literary Institutions of this Country. He complained of not having
							been able to obtain all the information he had desired on these
							Subjects; but spoke with great Satisfaction of what he had seen and
							heard at Boston.</p>

						<p>This morning I was again belated in my rising— The 72<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> Psalm is entitled of or for <persRef
								ref="solomon">Solomon</persRef>, and it is one of the most beautiful
							of the whole collection— For there are varieties of poetical beauty
							between them— It is indeed remarkable that of 150 lyric poems all upon
							the greatness and goodness of God, there should be such continual
							variety, with such constant sameness— There are a few primary ideas
							always repeated; but always under different modifications— This 72<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> Psalm is understood to be prophetical and
							descriptive of Christ’s kingdom upon Earth.— But in its ostensible
							appearance it is a coronation hymn for Solomon, as the 45<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> is an epithalium for the same Monarch—
							There seems to me to be a similarity of Style between these two Psalms
							classing them apart from the rest— This is a fervent supplication to
							God, that he would bestow upon Solomon the Spirit of wisdom and of
							goodness to discharge his duties as a king; and paints the blessed
							consequences to himself and to his People which would flow from this—
							The Sentences are all short; and the verses easily throw themselves into
							the forms of rhyme— But my Stanzas sound flat and unprofitable to myself
							even by the side of the prosaic English Bible— I heard this morning
								<persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef>, from Acts 7.59. “And they stoned <persRef
								ref="ststephen">Stephen</persRef>, calling upon God and saying, Lord
							Jesus, receive my Spirit.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith appears
							to have one formula of announcing immediately after reading his text the
							doctrine that he proposes to draw from it— Thus after reading his text,
							he said the maxim to be drawn from it was that Jesus Christ was the only
							dependence of the Soul— And then he expatiated upon the history of
							Stephen the first Martyr—presented various views of life and death, of
							Time and Eternity and concluded by disclosing that his Sermon was
							occasioned upon the decease of two members of his Society— <persRef
								ref="lee-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James</persRef> of
							Boston were in the Pew— There came a fall of Snow which continued all
							the latter part of the day, and detained me at home from the afternoon
								<pb n="362" type="ms"/>service— <persRef ref="marshall-john">Chief
								Justice Marshall</persRef>, and <persRef ref="story-joseph">Judge
								Story</persRef> visited me—before dinner. The Chief Justice told me
							that the debate in the Legislature of Virginia, upon the proposal for a
							gradual emancipation of the Slaves in the State was closed by a majority
							of about twenty for postponement of the Question, though in the form of
							rejecting the Resolution— Several of the members who voted against it
							declaring that they were individually in favour of it; but wished time
							and opportunity to ascertain the Sentiments of the People concerning it—
							Day and Evening spent upon this Diary— I received Letters from <persRef
								ref="sullivan-w">W. Sullivan</persRef> and from <persRef
								ref="wallace-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James W.
								Wallace</persRef>—and from <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">D. J.

								Nuckolls</persRef> last Friday was read and I was instructed to
							refer it to the <persRef ref="mclane-louis">Secretary of the

							Claims I spoke to <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Whittlesey</persRef> the Chairman and

							of <persRef ref="grice-samuel">Grice</persRef>, and said the Committee
							thought the opinion of the <persRef ref="taney-roger-brooke">Attorney
								General</persRef> wrong— It was part of the jugglery of <persRef
								ref="kendall-amos">Amos Kendall</persRef> against the Commissioners
							of the Navy— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Condict presented a Memorial
							from New-Jersey, concerning the Colonization of free people of Colour,
							which after a peppery debate without Salt and yeas and nays once taken,
							and two or three times threatened was finally referred to a Committee of
							7— <persRef ref="jenifer-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jenifer’s</persRef> Resolution was not taken up now but will be
							referred to the same Committee— The apportionment Bill was taken up.
								<persRef ref="wickliffe-charles">Wickliffe’s</persRef> proposition
							to recommit the Bill to a Committee of 24. one from each State, with

									>r</hi> Hubbard</persRef> then moved to strike out 48 and insert
							44— This was a last and desperate chance— Wickliffe advised him not to
							specify the inserting number because he said he would certain lose it.
							But Hubbard insisted— As the question was about to be taken <persRef
								ref="burges-tristam">Burges</persRef> moved an adjournment which was

								Adams</persRef> and the family were waiting for me at the door of

						<p>Began the version of the 73<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Psalm. <persRef
								ref="johnston-josiah">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Johnston</persRef> of Louisiana called upon me this morning with his
							Colleague in the Senate newly elected <persRef ref="waggaman-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Waggaman</persRef>, who
							apologized for not having called upon me before— They found me reading
							the Speeches still publishing, upon the nomination to the Senate of
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van-Buren</persRef> as
							Minister to Great-Britain. <persRef ref="hayne-robert">Hayne</persRef>

								<persRef ref="poindexter-george">Poindexter</persRef> of
							Mississippi, and <persRef ref="moore-gabriel">Moore</persRef> of
							Alabama, by uniting with them accomplished their object, with the
							casting vote of the <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
							>Vice-President</persRef>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnston asked
							me if I knew anything of a Treaty negotiated by <persRef
								ref="erving-george">G. W. Erving</persRef> in Spain, by which the
							Rio del Norte was to be the boundary between the United States and
							Mexico— I said there certainly never had been such a Treaty— He said the
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> had assured them
							that there was, and that the proof of it was in the Department of State—
							I said I had no doubt this was one of G. W. Erving’s lies, as there was
							not a greater liar upon Earth— That I was perswaded that the only colour
							for it that could be produced would be a Letter from him, written after
							the conclusion of the Treaty with <persRef ref="onis-luis"
								>Onis</persRef>, in which detailing some interview that he had with
							the <persRef ref="pizarro-joseph">Spanish Minister Pizarro</persRef>, he
							had said something from which Erving pretended to infer that they would
							give up the boundary to the Rio Bravo— Johnston said there was a Treaty
							with Mexico now before the Senate, which confirmed the boundary of the
							Treaty with Spain. That the people of Louisiana did not wish for the
							Province of Texas; but that the President believed in this Treaty of
							Erving’s— I said I knew the President had been labouring very hard to
							get this Province of Texas— That he would not get it by Treaty with
							Mexico; but I believed the increasing Settlements in Texas were all from
							this Country and that the inhabitants would prefer to belong to the
							United States rather than to Mexico; and it might perhaps be taken, as
							Florida was taken in 1812— But there would be one difficulty in it; as
							Slavery had been abolished in that Country. Johnston said that was only
							by a Military decree which the people there had resisted— It was only
							such a decree as <persRef ref="bolivar-simon">Bolivar</persRef> had
							issued in Colombia— I walked to the Capitol— In the House, <persRef
								ref="jenifer-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jenifer’s</persRef> Resolution was taken up, and with an amendment
							of <persRef ref="archer-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Archer</persRef> was referred to the same Committee appointed upon
							the Memorial presented yesterday by <persRef ref="condict-lewis">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Condict</persRef>— There was the same
							agitation which never fails to arise upon the approach to any topic
							connected with Slavery— <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Everett’s</persRef> Resolution
							calling for a Copy of a Treaty with the Chickasaw Tribe of Indians, was
							taken up, and modified by him so as to limit the call to a copy of one
							Article of the Treaty. He supported it by a Speech deeply implicating
							the second Auditor of the Treasury, <persRef ref="lewis-william3">Major
								Lewis</persRef>. <persRef ref="bell-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Bell</persRef> of Tennessee answered, somewhat

							against it— He was followed by <persRef ref="mitchel-thomas2">T. R.
								Mitchell</persRef>, and <persRef ref="wickliffe-charles"
								>Wickliffe</persRef> who opposed the Call— The discussion was
							arrested by the expiration of the hour— The apportionment Bill was taken

								>Slade</persRef> made a long and sensible Speech. <persRef
								ref="arnold-thomas">Arnold</persRef>, <persRef ref="kerr-john"

								<persRef ref="hubbard-henry">Hubbard</persRef> then moved to strike
							out 48000 and insert 44500. upon which Wilde moved and carried an
							adjournment— Rode home— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
