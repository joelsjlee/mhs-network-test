							establishment for making all the machinery used in the Cotton and
							woollen manufactures—such as wheels and spindles, and other machines of

							school also connected with the establishment where we saw about 40

							handsome young woman, with her husband— She was very sick on the way— We
							breakfasted at Burlington, and reached <persRef ref="morgan-h"
								>Morgan’s</persRef> United States Hotel in Hartford at 1/2 past 11—
							Here my companions again dispersed, and I took passage in another hire

							passengers including six children, five of them with one woman; also a
							blind old man, and a National Bostonian named <persRef ref="u"
								>Newell</persRef>— The heat was intense—the dust choaking and
							powdering— It was four O’Clock when we reached Vernon where we dined—
							That is M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newell and myself.— The woman
							with 5 children, and another with one had left us— Just as we alighted
							at Vernon came on a thunder gust, and the rain in torrents fell &amp;c
							for nearly three hours— Our Stage was afterwards stalled, and drawn out
							of the mire by two pair of oxen— At Ashford, I was recognized by
								<persRef ref="u;u">the old couple where I breakfasted on the 9<hi
