						<p>In the House the Debate relating to the transportation of the Southern
							Mail, was after some discussion made the special order of the day for
							tomorrow. <persRef ref="jones-george4">George. W. Jones</persRef> of Tennessee offered a Resolution that the
							Committee on Revolutionary Pensions, be instructed to enquire into the
							expediency and propriety of authorizing the <persRef ref="marcy-william">Secretary of War</persRef>, to employ
							additional Clerks, in the Pension Office temporary that the Committee
							report as soon as practicable. <persRef ref="cocke-william2">Cock</persRef> of Tennessee moved as an Amendment
							that the <persRef ref="edwards-james">Commissioner of Pensions</persRef> be authorized to employ the temporary
							Clerks, instead of the Secretary of War—the original Resolution
							prevailed. <persRef ref="thompson-richard">Thompson</persRef> of Indiana from the Committee on Elections reported
							a Resolution for taking testimony in the Election contested by <persRef ref="monroe-james2">James
							Munroe</persRef>— By a Rule of the House on every <pb n="244" type="ms"/>alternate
							Monday during the Session the States are called for Resolutions and this
							was the day assigned for that purpose. Numerous Resolutions were
							accordingly offered, some of them adopted and most of them laid over for
							future consideration— <persRef ref="hudson-charles">Charles Hudson</persRef> of Massachusetts offered a
							Resolution to instruct the Committee on Military Affairs to enquire into
							the expediency of requesting the <persRef ref="polk-james">President</persRef> to withdraw our Armies now in
							Mexico to the East Bank of the Rio Grand and to propose a Treaty of
							Peace to the Mexican Government, with the Boundary of the<space/>between the
							Nueces and the Rio Grand. Hudson called for the Previous Question— <persRef ref="thompson-jacob">Jacob
							Thompson</persRef> of Mississippi moved to lay the Resolution on the Table.
							Thompson withdrew his motion, which was renewed by <persRef ref="stephens-alexander">Stevens</persRef> of Georgia.
							<persRef ref="cobb-howell">Cobb</persRef> of Georgia objected that it was not in order to move to lay a Bill
							or Resolution on the Table. After the House had directed the Main
							Question to be put— The <persRef ref="winthrop-robert">Speaker</persRef> decided it was in order and his decision
							was sustained by the House— <persRef ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles. J. Ingersoll</persRef> moved a Resolution
							that the President be requested to inform the House whether any official
							notice has been taken by this Government or its <persRef ref="bancroft-george">Minister in England</persRef> by
							correspondence or otherwise of the threatening and offensive terms in
							which the <persRef ref="temple-henry">British Secretary for Foreign Affairs</persRef> is credibly reported to
							have spoken in his place in the Commons House of Parliament lately, of
							what he treated as the want of Public faith in the United States
							punishable by Great Britain. <persRef ref="houston-john2">John. W. Houston</persRef> of Delaware in pursuance
							of previous notice moved a Resolution of thanks to <persRef ref="taylor-zachary">General Zachary
							Taylor</persRef> and his Army for the Battle of Buena Vista and that the President
							be requested to cause to be struck a gold medal to be presented to Major
							<pb n="245" type="ms"/>General Taylor. <persRef ref="evans-alexander">Evans</persRef> of Maryland offered an
							Amendment, but Houston moved the Previous Question in the original
							Resolution; it was not seconded. A motion was made to refer the
							Resolution to the Committee on Military Affairs. <persRef ref="henley-thomas">Henley</persRef> of Indiana moved
							to amend, by adding an instruction to the Committee, to add the words
							engaged as they were in defending the rights, and honor of the nation.
							Henley called for the yeas and nays. <persRef ref="ashmun-george">George Ashmun</persRef> of Mass. moved to
							amend the Amendment by adding the words, in a War unnecessarily and
							unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States. The yeas
							and nays were taken on this Amendment and it was carried by a vote of 85
							to 81— Cobb of Georgia said that the Amendments presented such a
							remarkable issue that he must propose to discuss it— The resolution was
							therefore laid over to be debated tomorrow— <persRef ref="rockwell-john">John. A. Rockwell</persRef> of
							Connecticut introduced a Bill to revise the Consular System of the
							United States which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs—
							About three oclock P.M. the House adjourned—</p>
