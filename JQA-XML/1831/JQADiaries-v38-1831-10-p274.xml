						<p>Began the version of the 27<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm— I went
							to Boston with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="roberdeau-mary">Mary Roberdeau</persRef> and <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>— Called at <persRef
								ref="gray-frederick">Gray</persRef> and <persRef ref="bowen-charles"
								>Bowens</persRef>, where I left twenty pages of manuscript of the
							chapter for the American Annual Register— I told M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gray that I would furnish him with a continuation of the
							manuscript as fast as he would print it, to the end of the chapter, and
							I requested him to send out to me to Quincy the proof sheets, as fast as
							they should be printed for correction—which he promised to do.— I called
							twice at <persRef ref="richardson-eleazar">Richardson</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="lord-melvin">Lord’s</persRef> to see M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lord; but he was not there— Then at
								<persRef ref="halliard-william">Hilliard</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="gray-harrison2">Gray’s</persRef>, to enquire if they had any
							copies remaining of my Lectures on Rhetoric and Oratory.— Hilliard (or
							the man who kept the shop[)] told me they had only five copies
							remaining— That they had sometime since sold a number of copies at
							Auction which they had received thirty cents for a Volume— He said it
							was what they called a dull book; like <persRef ref="campbell-george3"
								>Campbells</persRef> philosophy of Rhetoric— They would not sell— He
							shewed me the accounts of their stock for several years in succession,
							where the numbers of copies of each book on hand, were set down, and for
							four or five years in sequence the number of sets of my Lectures was the
							same— He said that at the auction sale they had sold at thirty cents a
							volume— I asked him if he would take that for all the copies he had
							remaining. He said he would, and I took them all— Four copies in boards:
							but he chose to retain one copy which was bound. I told him I had
							thoughts of printing another Edition of them. He said that books of that
							kind, all elementary books upon Science, had no sale, unless adopted as
							Class-books at some public school or College. I went to <persRef
								ref="eastburn-john">Eastburn’s</persRef> shop he was not there; but
							afterwards met me at Charles’s house— There had been some complaints
							from Editors of Newspapers, at the Copy-right taken out of the Eulogy;
							and an attempt in the Boston Courier, to impress the belief that the
							Copy-right had been taken, for my own benefit— Eastburn said <persRef
								ref="buckingham-joseph">Buckingham</persRef> the Editor of the
							Courier knew this to be false, for he had told him how the fact was.— I
							desired him to give notice in that paper that the Editor of any
							Newspaper, in the United States might publish in his journal the whole,
							or any part of the Eulogy at his pleasure; and told him I did not
							believe there was one who would avail himself of the privilege when he
							should have it— I dined at <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H.
								Everett’s</persRef> with a party of fifteen or sixteen gentlemen;
							among whom were the two French Commissioners of the Government <persRef
								ref="tocqueville-alexis">Tocqueville</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="beaumont-gustave">de Beaumont</persRef>, who have been sent to
							this Country to visit and examine the Prisons; and prison discipline—
							After dinner I called at <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Frothingham’s</persRef>, where the
							Ladies and Charles had dined; and whence we returned in the Evening to
							Quincy.</p>

							to have a likeness of him in his last days, by the first Painter in this
							Country. It has been a source of much gratification to me, that this was
							effected— The picture is an excellent likeness, and one of the best that
							Stewart ever painted— After my father’s death, I had a copy of it
							painted by Stewart himself which is at Washington— <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> has the Original in his house
							at Boston. The same Summer when my father died, (1826) Gimbrede copied

							Copies of the Print, and Gimbrede offered me the drawing for 25 dollars—

						<p>Early this morning, <persRef ref="brinley-francis">M<hi

								<persRef ref="walker-amasa">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Amasa
								Walker</persRef>, came as a Committee from the Anti-Masonic State
							Convention, consisting of Committees from the several County Conventions
							in the Commonwealth, and sitting at Boston, and announced that they had
							yesterday, unanimously agreed to nominate me for election to the Office
							of Governor of this Commonwealth for the ensuing year.— The election is
							to take place on the second Monday of the next Month— It is the first
							election under the adopted Amendment of the Constitution of the State,
							by which the political year is to commence in January, and the
							Legislature are to hold only one annual Session— They said they hoped I
							would accept the nomination; and that the <pb n="276" type="ms"
							/>Convention yet in Session were anxious to receive my answer as soon as
							possible— I desired them to assure the Convention of the grateful sense
							that I entertained of the confidence manifested in their offer of
							nomination; and of my regret that I felt myself bound in duty to decline
							it. <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef> was
							personally my friend, and I approved the general course of his
							administration. I therefore could not permit my name to be set up in
							opposition to him, and I had earnestly hoped that the Antimasonic
							Convention would have nominated him— I ought in candour to tell them
							that I approved his answer to the Letter which had been addressed to him
							by their Committee— I thought his opinions against the Masonic
							Institution clearly and strongly expressed— There were indeed some
							passages relating to the course of the Anti-masons, which seemed to
							import censure upon them, but I believed it was not intended, and might
							easily be explained— I had hoped the Anti-masons would be satisfied with
							his Anti-masonic Declaration and had no doubt that in the course of the
							year events would have occurred which would have fixed him entirely with
							them.— Walker said it was to be regretted that they had taken other
							views; but as they had done so, he presumed they would in the event of
							my declining make another nomination— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Brinley made no remark upon my observations but expressed a wish that I
							would give my answer in writing— I requested them to call again in half
							an hour, which they did, and I immediately wrote my answer— But they
							returned before I had time to have a copy of it made— I told them that
							to avoid detaining them, I would give them the Letter without waiting to
							take a copy— That if they should publish it, I would take my copy from
							the publication, but if not, I should request them to furnish me with a
							copy, which they promised should be done— I was at an Evening party at

							home, although it was after sunset and darkening I planted in the garden

						<p><persRef ref="spear-daniel">Deacon Daniel Spear</persRef> sold this day
							the wood standing upon my lot called Lawyers Common, and I walked over
							there to see the progress of the Sale— There was a larger number of
							purchasers than usual and the sales were brisk. The price of wood for
							fuel is in this neighbourhood at present nearly double its usual
							average—occasioned by the scarcity of Snow last Winter in the State of
							Maine whence the principal supply of fire-wood for the Boston market
							generally comes— Here, and along the Sea-Coast Southward to North-<pb
								n="277" type="ms"/>Carolina, there fell last winter at least double
							the average quantity of Snow— While Northward, and in the State of Maine
							there was no Snow at all— The want of Snow prevented the transportation
							of firewood from the forests in which it is cut down, to the landing
							places on Kennebeck River where it is usually embarked and very little
							of it has been brought to Boston this Season.— This has raised the price
							of standing wood here.— I observed again the growth of young Oaks and
							Walnut Trees, coming up in the place of the Pines and Cedars cut down on
							part of this Lot two years ago— This natural phenomenon has been
							observed by the writers upon woods and forests; but has never been
							accounted for; and is to me so surprising as to make me incredulous
							almost of my own observations. On my return homewards I gathered a
							pocketful of black and grey Oak Acorns in my Middle and Druid
							Pastures;—which I planted together with some red Oak Acorns in my

								Lowell</persRef> of Boston; in the morning from 2. Timothy 1.5.
							“When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowell dined with us.— His discourse of
							the Morning upon the influence of mothers upon the characters of their

							one to <persRef ref="tefft-israel">I K. Tefft</persRef> of Savannah,
							from whom I received nearly a year since a Letter, and another last

								>General Joseph G. Swift</persRef>— After dinner I planted 3 rows of

								ref="dana-richard">Dana</persRef>—<persRef ref="bryant-william"
								>Bryant</persRef>—<persRef ref="u">Peabody</persRef>—<persRef
								ref="willis-nathaniel">Willis</persRef> and a review of their
							compositions gravely settling the pretensions to precedence among them,
							and placing Dana at their head— Halleck has poetical powers, smothered
							by a burden of burlesque— Percival has half the property of a poet wild
							and fanciful conceptions— Peabody has tenderness and pathos for copies
							of verses, and Bryant has some talent at description— With the exception
							of Halleck, it would take nine such Poets to make a Tale— There was an
							Ode of Percivals called Genius waking which has acquired some
							reputation— Tis <persRef ref="pindar">Pindars</persRef> Eagle; stolen
							from <persRef ref="gray-thomas">Gray</persRef>, and scourged round the
							welkin, through every medium of passage, and among the rest through
							rocks. I read Gray’s Bard, and his Progress of Poesy which I have always
							admired not only as beautiful poems, but as the best English
							exemplifications of the Pindaric Ode— My diary has been running in
							arrear nearly for a Month— I keep it along only by minutes on the loose
							sheet; and in this book am now as far back as the 14<hi

							delivered an Address to the ΦB.K of Yale College, of which he sent me a

							himself had informed <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor

							afterwards preached an excellent Sermon from Titus 2.14 “Who gave
							himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify
							unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.” The peculiarity
							of the Christian Institution, as characterized by zeal for good works,
							formed the subject of the discourse, and was presented in a variety of
							very interesting points of view— Among the rest an ingenious argument
							was deduced from the position in the text, that as zeal for good works
							was pointed out as emphatically the peculiar excellence of Christianity,
							it was a conclusive consideration that it did not consist in speculative
							opinions or controvertible metaphysical doctrines— The beneficent
							effects of Christianity upon the human character and upon the life of
							men in its various relations was set forth with great eloquence—
								<persRef ref="roberdeau-mary">Miss Roberdeau</persRef> was there;
							but the Sermon was too wide from Calvinism to please her— She came from
								<persRef ref="adams-abigail2">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								Greenwood</persRef>, from Psalm 42.2. “My Soul thirsteth for God,
							for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?” The
							composition of the discourse was not entirely at variance with the tone
							of the text, but it contrasted strangely with the coldness of the
							delivery— I returned in the Evening with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							Adams to Quincy, leaving M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Nowlan in
							Boston— This morning I finished the version of the 32<hi

						<p>Finished the reading of the Bible, which I began in August of the last

							Sought. The version that I am now making of the Psalms was undertaken
							partly with a view to impress more deeply upon my own mind the
							Sentiments they contain. The reading of three chapters, and the version
							of one Stanza, twice written down occupy me from an hour and a half to
							two hours every day. I believe there is none of my time better spent:
							and yet I would I were capable of application to it, tenfold more

							come to nothing— I began with them too late in life— I have no one to
							follow them up with the same interest that I take in them— I am absent
							half the year, and they require incessant attention the whole year
							round. And other necessary occupations draw away my attention from this—

						<p><date>28. IV:45. </date>Friday— From Quincy to Dedham.</p>
						<p>Before leaving home I finished my version of the 33<hi rend="superscript"
								>d.</hi> Psalm. <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef> departed about nine
							this Morning, with our own Carriage and pair of horses—with <persRef
								ref="kirk-john">John Kirk</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Nowlan</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="pitts-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Pitts</persRef> and
							my Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John’s</persRef> infant daughter,
								<persRef ref="adams-mary4">Mary Louisa</persRef>.— She intended if
							possible to reach Providence this Evening— So that the horses might have
							a Night’s rest before being embarked in the Steam-boat— I finished my
							packing— Left <persRef ref="kirk-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Kirk</persRef> who is perhaps to go and live with
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>— <persRef
								ref="farrar-isaac">Isaac Farrar</persRef> came in, and agreed to
							take all necessary care of the house during the winter, and to deliver
							up the farm house and farm to <persRef ref="carr-john2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Carr</persRef> on the first of April
							next— I had paid off <persRef ref="farrar-salmon">Salmon
								Farrar</persRef> to the end of this month and left directions for
							him to block up the external cellar doors and windows with Sea-weed, and
							to cover the seedling plants in the Garden— But I have been obliged to
							leave my plantations greatly neglected, and fear they will come to
							nought. I have agreed to pay for <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac H.
								Adams’s</persRef> board at <persRef key="adams-thomas">his
								father’s</persRef> house 3. dollars a week, during the winter, and
							he is to copy <persRef key="adams-john">my fathers</persRef> Journals—
							We dined early and at 3. O’Clock <persRef ref="gillet-simon"
								>Gillet</persRef> sent a Coach and pair of horses with which I came
							with <persRef ref="roberdeau-mary">Mary Roberdeau</persRef> to <persRef
								ref="u">Bride’s</persRef> Hotel at Dedham. We found my brothers
							youngest son <persRef ref="adams-joseph">Joseph Harrod</persRef> had
							rode with the driver, and he returned with him to Quincy— We reached
							Dedham just before Sunset and took lodgings at Bride’s for the Night— We
							had scarcely alighted when a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Waite</persRef> came in, with a <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitcomb</persRef> from Boston— They
							had gone out to Quincy to see me there; and arrived just after I had
							left home— They followed us therefore here— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Waite is a son of <persRef ref="waite-thomas">Thomas B.
								Waite</persRef> now deceased, formerly employed by me, when in the
							Department of State to print the Journal of the Convention of 1787. and
							the Secret Journals of the Old Congress.— He had previously published
							ten Volumes of American State Papers of which Congress had taken some
							hundreds of copies, and then two additional Volumes of which they took
							few or none, and of which therefore a great portion remain on hand— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Waite proposes to petition Congress to
							take a number of Copies of the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and
								12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volumes to complete the sets which
							they had taken of the preceding ten. He asked me if I thought they would
							take them. I thought it hardly probable— The sets in ten Volumes had
							been distributed to members of former Congresses, many years ago.— There
							are very few if any now left in the Library of Congress— So that they
							would have only all the sets of the two odd Volumes which they should
							take separated from all the rest— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Waite
							made also some enquiries and observations concerning the political state
							of Europe—France—England—Poland; about which all our conjectures are
							mere pastime. Miss Roberdeau retired before 8 O’Clock in the Evening to
							bed; and <persRef ref="cobb-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J.
								H. Cobb</persRef> afterwards called and invited me to go and see his
							Machinery for the manufactory of sewing Silk, and of Silk fringe— I
							accordingly went with him and saw his spinning winding and reeling
							machines in two separate buildings— His establishment is upon a large
							scale, and he proposes to enlarge it still farther— He has an Englishman
							with him from Spitalfields who has been several years in this Country—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Cobb
							gave me a copy of the manual for the raising of Silkworms published by
							direction of the Legislature of Massachusetts— After returning to
							Bride’s, I had still a remnant of evening to pass, and wrote a minute
							for the diary of the day, marking in it that <persRef ref="adams-josiah"
								>Deacon Josiah Adams</persRef> came this morning and I had discourse
							with <pb n="287" type="ms"/>him about Oak trees dying from the top, and
							firewood— Our accounts to be settled next Spring or Summer— Isaac Farrar
							is to settle accounts at the end of his Lease with my Son Charles—
								<persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-elizabeth">Elizabeth C. Adams</persRef> dined with us and
								<persRef ref="beale-ann">Ann Beale</persRef> came after dinner to
							take leave of Miss Roberdeau. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wait told
							me that an Act had passed in the United States Senate for taking 500
							copies of the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 12<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Volumes of the State papers but did not
							get through the house— He intends to Memorialize Congress again to take
							his books, and asked for my support which I promised him— He said there
							was an Article in the last Edinburgh Review, by <persRef
								ref="brougham-henry2">Lord Chancellor Brougham</persRef> upon vested
							Rights and Titles. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cobb’s workman from
							London, is skilful in the business— His name is <persRef
								ref="brown-edward">Edward Brown</persRef>— I saw some very handsome
							fringe of their making—4000 Cocoons make a pound of Silk— Sometimes
							3000.—even 2500.—one Pound of raw silk makes 90 yards of fringe which
							sells at 1 1/4 dollar a yard— Cobb has been engaged six years in this
							business and says it is profitable— Spoke of the Morus Multicaulis or
							Chinese Mulberry as the best for the worm— It grows as a shrub. Brown
							has been in this Country five years; and told me that he had children
							born here, and would never leave the Country— After finishing my notices
							for the day, I made a version of one Stanza of Psalm 34. I have
							determined to make the experiment of continuing while travelling this
							portion of my occupations. There is time in Steam-boats and Stages, and
							at public houses which it seems to me may be well devoted to precisely
							such employment— I therefore purchased the other day an Episcopalian
							Prayer-book which contains the Psalms translated from the Septuagint or
							the Latin Vulgate, and I take this with me in my pocket— I also bought
								<persRef ref="noyes-george">George R. Noyes’s</persRef> new prose
							version of the Psalms—but that I packed in my small trunk to be sent
							round to Washington by water— My evening passed away very rapidly.</p>

						<p><date>29. IV. </date>Saturday— From Dedham to Providence— Steam-boat
							Boston— <persRef ref="u">Captain<space/>Sound</persRef>.</p>
						<p>Though I rose thus early my Morning was as short as had been the Evening.
							I shaved myself and made a version or one Stanza of Psalm 34— Roused
								<persRef ref="roberdeau-mary">Miss Roberdeau</persRef> at 6. and at
							7. breakfasted with the Passengers of the Stages from Boston going to
							Providence— In one of these two Seats had been taken by my Son <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> direction in Boston, for
							Miss Roberdeau and myself to take us up at Dedham— In this we started
							from <persRef ref="u">Bride’s</persRef> at 7. O’Clock and at 20 minutes
							past eleven, alighted at the Steamboat wharf at Providence— The Night
							had been sharp—the day was cold and clear, and there was a skin of ice
							over the ditches along the sides of the road— Our Stage company was
							taciturn and unsociable beyond every thing I had ever witnessed, and
							excepting slight occasional conversation between Miss Roberdeau and me,
							we had a silent ride— I pointed out to her the last view of the
							blue-hills as they were seen from the borders of Dedham and Walpole, and
							fell into a reverie, enquiring of myself what it was that gave to those
							hills such power of touching sensibility as I always experience at their
							first and final appearance coming to or going from home.— I traced the
							sensation to the spot of my nativity at the foot of Penn’s Hill— I
							composed five Stanza’s, upon the village on that spot between Dedham and
							Providence— We found <pb n="288" type="ms"/><persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef>, and the <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4;kirk-john;u;pitts-mary">family</persRef> with her:
							the Carriage and horses already embarked. They had slept last Night at
							Pawtucket; the bridge there being in a process of repairs. At ten
							minutes past Noon the boat left the wharf, and at half past two reached
							Newport—proceeded immediately with fine wind and fair weather; but
							blowing almost a gale, and too cold for remaining long on the decks— Of
							our fellow passengers, there was <persRef ref="apthorp-robert">Robert
								Apthorp</persRef>, Son of <persRef ref="apthorp-john">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> John T. Apthorp</persRef> a young man
							of about 20. going to New-York to embark for Europe— He is one alone
							remaining of several children who just at that period of life have
							fallen into consumptions and perished— His own Constitution is very
							delicate and <persRef ref="apthorp-mary">his parents</persRef> are in
							continual fear of losing him the same way— They took him to Europe
							themselves the last year, whence they returned in the Spring and he is
							now going alone— <persRef ref="u;u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
									M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Abbot</persRef> of
							Michillimackinac, acquaintances of the <persRef
								ref="boyd-george;boyd-harriet">Boyd family</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="cobbs-waddy">Captain Cobbs</persRef> of the United States
							Army—and others unknown— The boat not very full— The Boston, is a new
							Boat more tremulous and noisy and therefore more unpleasant to
							passengers than any other of the modern Sound-faring Steamers— The
							passage round Point Judith was rough, and the swell considerable; but
							early in the Evening the boat entered the Sound, opposite New-London
							after which the motion was less uncomfortable— Kept in the Cabin by the
							weather; and finding little conversation with the passengers, I wrote
							out the five Stanza’s upon Penn’s valley that I had composed in the
							Stage, and in the course of the Evening compos’d three more— Before
							retiring for the Night I versified also one Stanza of the 34<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm— The time passed with me
							cheerily.</p>

						<p>I had as usual little sleep last Night in the boat; and towards morning
							composed three Stanzas more of the lines upon Penn’s Valley— We landed
							at New-York this morning about 6 O’Clock or just at the dawn of day— We
							came immediately to the Washington Hotel, kept by <persRef ref="u"
								>Hamilton</persRef> and took the apartments which <persRef ref="miller-edward">Edward Miller</persRef> had
							engaged for us— A few minutes after we arrived, <persRef
								ref="tucker-fanning">Major Fanning C. Tucker</persRef> came and took
								<persRef ref="roberdeau-mary">Miss Roberdeau</persRef> with him to
							Brookline where he resides— Shortly after I received a note from
								<persRef ref="sullivan-george">George Sullivan</persRef>, who with
							his family lives at the house where we lodge, and who offered to
							accompany me to Church. I wrote out the remaining Stanzas on Penns
							Valley; and then went with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sullivan, to
							hear <persRef ref="hawks-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawks</persRef> a celebrated preacher, but he was absent gone to
							preach at Bridgport— We then went to Grace Church and heard <persRef
								ref="wainwright-jonathan">D<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright</persRef>
							from Romans 7.6. “But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead
							wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not
							in the oldness of the Letter”— D<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Mayhew is
							an excellent preacher—a grandson of the eminent <persRef
								ref="mayhew-jonathan">D<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Mayhew</persRef> of Boston, and son to a <persRef
								ref="wainwright-elizabeth">Lady</persRef> long an intimate friend of
								<persRef key="adams-abigail">my Mother’s</persRef>— I saw <persRef
								ref="blake-george">George Blake</persRef> at Church; who is a member
							of the Tariff Convention now sitting in this City. Returning from Church
							I met <persRef ref="hone-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Philip

							eminent Citizens. After Church, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
								<persRef ref="sullivan-sarah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> George
								Sullivan</persRef> paid us visits, as did <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H. Everett</persRef> a member of
							the Tariff Convention and <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph
								Blunt</persRef>— He came again this Evening, and attended me to the

									rend="superscript">r</hi> William Ware</persRef> from 2. Peter
							1.4. “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises;
							that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature; having escaped

						<p>Finished the version of the 34<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm— I

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hamblin</persRef>, the manager

							select for performance any one of several plays which I should prefer—

							given of my attendance.— I received also a written invitation signed by
								<persRef ref="wilkins-william">William Wilkins</persRef>, President
							of the Tariff Convention, to attend at their Meeting within the bar— I
							went accordingly about 11. O’Clock; but being alone, and having some

							went in among the Spectators below the bar; and being seen there by
								<persRef ref="tallmadge-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
								Tallmadge</persRef> one of the Vice-Presidents he came to me, and
							introduced me to a seat immediately behind the President within the bar—
							As I passed through the Hall, the members all rose, and on my taking the
							seat offered me gave a general manifestation of applause— <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles J.
								Ingersoll</persRef> of Philadelphia, was reading an Address to the
							People of the United States—in which he had made much progress, and
							which he continued to read for about one hour and a half longer—after
							the reading was closed there was much applause; and short speeches made
							by several members— Suggestions of slight amendments to avoid
							reflections upon The Anti-tariff Convention lately held at Philadelphia,
							and propositions for having forty thousand copies of the Address printed
							by <persRef ref="niles-hezekiah">H. Niles</persRef> at Baltimore—one of
							the Secretaries of the Convention— This body consisted of upwards of 530
							members, but they have been sitting ever since the 26<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and I was told that upwards of an
							hundred members were already gone— Among the members I recognized
								<persRef ref="roberts-jonathan">Jonathan Roberts</persRef>. <persRef

							<persRef ref="dewolf-james">James D’Wolfe</persRef>

								ref="davis-charles2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> C. A.
								Davis</persRef> began the reading of a Report, and I came away.— At
							my Lodgings I received visits from <persRef ref="crowninshield-benjamin"
								>B. W. Crowninshield</persRef>, <persRef ref="wainwright-jonathan"
									>D<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Wainwright</persRef>. <persRef

							with whom I travelled on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
							December 1829 from New-York to Philadelphia, and to whom I then
							addressed some verses, which she never saw till <persRef
								ref="roberdeau-mary">Miss Roberdeau</persRef> lately sent her a copy
							of them— She thanked me for them now. <persRef
								ref="hosack-david;hosack-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
									M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hosack</persRef>—<persRef

								Hone</persRef> and the <persRef ref="matthews-james">Rev<hi

							from <persRef ref="kent-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
								Kent</persRef>, late Chancellor of the State inviting me to dine
							with him— After dinner I paid visits to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef>, at whose
							house I met Jonathan Roberts; and to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							James Kent whom I found in his Study, and with whom I had curious
							conversation. He is preparing a new Edition of his Law Commentaries—and
							being in wit a man, simplicity a child—we talked half-wisely half
							childishly about his Commentaries; about Civil and Common Law—about
								<persRef ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef>, Yale
							College, the Φ.B.K. Society and his address to them and many other
							puerilities— I promised to dine with him to-morrow— I returned to my
							Lodgings, and went with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams</persRef>, Miss Roberdeau and
								<persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph Blunt</persRef> to the Bowery
							Theatre, where we saw Venice Preserv’d; and a German performer of
							Attitudes which pass by the name of the living Statue— A new species of
							exhibition, or at least one that I had never witness’d before. There is
							a Pedestal for a Monument on which the man dressed in a Garb, and
							coloured like Plaster stood; and threw himself successively into the
							attitudes of celebrated <pb n="290" type="ms"/>marble statues of
							antiquity, such as the fighting and the dying gladiator; the
							quoit-player, the knife-grinder, and the attitudes of some of the
							personages in <persRef ref="david-jacques">David’s</persRef> pictures—
							After this was over we came away before the farce began— The house was
							tolerably filled but not crowded— There was a militia-company which had
							been parading in one of the boxes— After the first act of the Tragedy
							was over, a man started up in the Pit, and said Three Cheers for John
							Quincy Adams; upon which they all rose waved round their hats and
							huzz’ad—immediately after which a man behind me in the same box cried
							out—Three cheers for <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Andrew
								Jackson</persRef>; and they gave three huzza’s more. All this I took
							for a farcical part of the Entertainment arranged by the Manager, as a
							compliment to me and at the same time to do honour to the President of
							the United States. It was about eleven O’Clock when we returned to our
							lodgings— Miss Roberdeau had spent the day here, and stays over Night— I
							received this Morning a Letter from <persRef ref="mckenney-thomas">T. L.
								M’Kenney</persRef> of Philadelphia; and one from my Son <persRef
								key="adams-john2">John</persRef> at Washington— This last mentioned
							the illness of <persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">his youngest
								child</persRef> in terms which alarmed us; and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams determined to leave me here, and go
							on immediately to Philadelphia, and probably to Washington.— She has
							great confidence in her own nursing of Children; and still more in that
							of <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Nowlan</persRef>. We
							had proposed to pass some days, perhaps weeks at Philadelphia; but this
							illness of our Sons child disconcerts all our purposes— She has been
							very sick for two or three Months; and <persRef ref="hellen-mary">her
								mother</persRef> has also been dangerously ill— My Son has had a
							Summer of severe trials— My own has not been light.</p>
