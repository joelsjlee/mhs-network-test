							which I have had several months under an engagement that I would write a
							Memoir of his Life for the North American Review— It was a long time

							and shortly afterwards M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stewart advised
							that the publication of the Memoir should be suspended, and finally M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Tudor explicitly enough hinted that they
							preferred it should not be published at-all— The points upon which they
							were specially sensitive were, an unwillingness that any notice of the
							fact that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tudor had ever been engaged in
							commerce—which was his profession during a great part of his life—an
							aversion to the statement that he had been an informal political agent
							in Peru, and still more that he had been Consul of the United States at
							Lima, and not Consul General in Peru— There was even an indisposition to
							have it appear that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tudor was at the time
							of his decease, but a Chargé d’Affaires of the United States at Rio de
							Janeiro— The family would have had him an Ambassador, and would
							evidently <pb n="314" type="ms"/>have been displeased to have it told
							what he was, though with the most liberal and emphatic commendation of
							what he did— I had brought the manuscripts to Washington purposely to

							asked for them. I sent them all in this Evening though M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Gardiner had written me a Letter to

						<p>It being the communion day at the second Presbyterian Church I attended

								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi><space/>of Georgetown, from Romans
							5.10—“For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the
							death of his Son much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his
							life”— The preacher was a young man, and his mode of preaching did not
							accord with the usual practice of the Episcopal Church— He had
							apparently no notes, and his discourse was apparently extemporaneous—
							Yet his language was very good, and his delivery very impressive. His
							doctrine was <persRef ref="calvin-john">calvinism</persRef> in its
							quintessence— He said the text divided all mankind into two Classes, the
							friends and the Enemies of God, and it was clear that whoever was not
							the friend was the enemy of God, or rather of his moral Government. In
							enquiring who were the enemies of God, it included almost all mankind,
							and particularly all those who possessed the highest moral virtues, such
							as charity and benevolence—but practiced them not for the glory of God—
							The <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> and his family
							were at the Church— After the service I called at <persRef

							these forty years— I told him I had modified many of mine, as admonished
							by Time and experience.— I intended to have gone to Church this
							afternoon; but there came up and apparent Snow-Storm; and seemed as if
							it would obstruct the way. I remained at home and betook myself to

						<p>The first Session of the Twenty-second Congress of the United States
							commenced— Half an hour before Noon I attended in the Hall of the House
							of Representatives and took the Seat n. 203. At Noon the Members were
							called to order, by <persRef ref="clarke-mathew">Matthew S<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Clair Clarke</persRef>, the Clerk of
							the House in the last Congress— The members were called alphabetically
							by States, and two hundred answered to their names—one or two more
							afterwards came in— The Clerk sent round the ballot-boxes to collect the
							votes for Speaker, and when the boxes were returned to his Table, asked
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
							<persRef ref="bates-james2">Bates</persRef> of Maine, <persRef
								ref="crawford-thomas">Crawford</persRef> of Pennsylvania and
								<persRef ref="mccoy-william">M’Coy</persRef> of Virginia to act as
							Tellers— There were only 195 votes returned, of which 98 were necessary
							to a choice— <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Andrew Stevenson</persRef>
							of Virginia had 98 votes, and was declared to be chosen.— <persRef
								ref="cooke-eleutheros">Elutheros Cooke</persRef> a member from Ohio,
							brought up his vote to the Table after the other votes had been given
							in.—The Tellers refused to receive it— His vote was for <persRef
								ref="sutherland-joel">Joel B. Sutherland</persRef> of Philadelphia,
							the principal competitor of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stevenson;
							who had 54 votes— If Cooke’s vote had been received Stevenson would not
							have been chosen at that ballot, and probably not at-all— There were
							votes for <persRef ref="taylor-john">John W. Taylor</persRef> 18.
								<persRef ref="wickliffe-charles">Wickliffe</persRef> 15; and <pb
								n="316" type="ms"/>some others would have rallied after two or three
							ballots upon Sutherland; the two Candidates are both men of principle
							according to their interest, and there is not the worth of a wisp of
							Straw between their value— <persRef ref="tracy-phineas">Phineas L.
								Tracy</persRef> told me that he, and his Anti-Masonic friends had
							agreed to vote for John W. Taylor and I voted for him— I was pleased
							that there was not a second ballot; for I was unwilling to be brought to
							the test whether I would under any circumstances vote either for
							Stevenson or Sutherland.— He seemed disposed to contest the election,
							and said he had known yesterday that Stevenson would have 98 votes, and
							that he could not get one more— The Speaker was conducted to the Chair
							by <persRef ref="newton-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Newton</persRef> the veteran of the house, who administered to him
							the Oath to support the Constitution of the United States— He
							administered the same Oath to all the members—calling them up by
							States—those of the largest States in two or three divisions. <persRef
								ref="speight-jesse">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jesse
								Speight</persRef> a member from North-Carolina, then moved the
							appointment of Matthew S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Clair Clarke as
							Clerk to the House by Resolution which he took from the Journal of the
							House at the first Session of the last Congress—in this form M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Speaker, I move the following Resolution—
							Then without reading it he took it to the Clerk’s table where it was
							read, and upon the question being put it passed without opposition. The
							Speaker had made his acknowledgments to the House from the Chair in a
							short Speech, prepared for the occasion, but not well adapted to the
							circumstances of his election. Resolutions of notice to the Senate, and
							for a joint Committee to notify the President were adopted— Resolutions
							also passed for furnishing the members with newspapers equivalent to
							three daily; and for the appointment of two chaplains to interchange
							weekly; and the house adjourned before two O’Clock— There were two
							districts of Massachusetts unrepresented; seven trials on each of them
							to hold the election having failed to obtain for any one person a
							majority of all the votes returned— I suggested to <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Everett</persRef> the propriety of a Letter from the delegation to
								<persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor Lincoln</persRef>, requesting

							full representation to the State at the opening of every Congress—
							Everett said if I would draw up such a Letter he would sign it. <persRef

						<p>My cough is becoming so inveterate and racks me so much that I was

								ref="frye-nathaniel;frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								>Commandeur Torlade d’Azambuja</persRef>, the Charge d’Affaires of
							the King of Portugal <persRef ref="miguel-i">Don Miguel</persRef>— He
							appears to me a very estimable man, though placed in a very unnatural
							position— There is no Country in Europe whose revolutions during the
							last forty years have been so singular as those of Portugal.— One of the
							most remarkable circumstances attending them is the removal of the Royal
							Family of Portugal to Brazil, and all the consequences of that event—The
							separation of Brazil from Portugal—The Establishment of an Imperial
							Monarchy there—The return of the <persRef ref="john-vi">old
								king</persRef> to Portugal, and all the changes that have followed
							since his decease—The abdication of the <persRef ref="pedro-iv">Emperor
								of Brazil</persRef>, and his return to Europe, an exile now in
							France, and his younger brother king of Portugal form altogether a
							series of changes more extraordinary than those in any other part of the
							world.— The Country is in a state of perpetual Revolution, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Torlade told me that he had remained the
							whole Season at Georgetown; always in a state of extreme anxiety and not
							knowing from day to day what news he might receive— He said it was Spain
							that had made Don Miguel king of Portugal, and, that the English had
							acted a very selfish part in all their Relations with that Country—M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Torlade expressed much anxiety concerning
							a new Treaty with France now before the Senate, and which stipulates for
							a reduction of our duties upon French wines— He fears that it will have
							an injurious effect upon our trade with Portugal; and tend to the
							exclusion of the wines from Madeira, Oporto and Lisbon— I told him the
							reduction of duties upon French wines would not preclude us from
							reducing them alike upon the wines of Portugal; but that we should
							perhaps expect some equivalent for it.— I wrote to <persRef
								ref="martin-samuel">Samuel Martin</persRef> of Tennessee—and sent
							him the proposals of <persRef ref="eastburn-john">J. H.

						<p>I am closing the task of bringing up the arrears of this diary, which had

							brought these Treasures. Democracy has no forefathers— It looks to no

							itself— This is the vice of Democracy and it is incurable— Democracy has
							no monuments— It strikes no Medals—It bears the head of no man upon a

						<p>Attended the House of Representatives. The appointment of the standing
							Committees was announced and I am Chairman of the Committee of
							Manufactures, a station of high responsibility, and perhaps of labour
							more burdensome than any other in the house— Far from the line of
							occupation in which all my life has been passed, and for which I feel
							myself not to be well qualified—I know not even enough of it to form an
							estimate of its difficulties—I only know that it is not the place suited
							to my acquirements and capacities such as they are. Yet as little as I
							esteem the <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker</persRef> I have no
							fault to find with him for the Appointment. The Petitions were called
							for, by States, commencing with Maine and proceeding Southward. I
							presented fifteen Petitions signed numerously by Citizens of
							Pennsylvania, praying for the abolition of Slavery and the Slave-trade
							in the District of Columbia— I moved that they should be referred to the
							Committee on the District of Columbia.— The practice is for the member
							presenting the Petition to move that the reading of it be dispensed
							with, and that it be referred to the appropriate or to a select
							Committee—but I moved that one of the Petitions presented by me should
							be read; they being all of the same tenor, and very short. It was
							accordingly read— I made a very few remarks chiefly to declare that I
							should not support that part of the Petition which prayed for the
							abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia. It is so long since I
							was in the habit of speaking to a popular Assembly—the Assemblies in
							which I had ever spoken extemporaneously have been comparatively
							speaking so little popular; and I am so little qualified by nature for
							an extemporaneous Orator, that I was at this time not a little agitated
							by the sound of my own voice— I was not more than five minutes upon my
							feet; but I was listened to with great attention, and when I sat down it
							seemed to myself as if I had performed an achievement.— So small and
							trivial are the things which often hang like burdens upon the Soul— I am
							grateful that this one has been removed— After the petitions were gone
							through the Resolutions to be offered were called for— Again by States;
							after which <persRef ref="wayne-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Wayne</persRef> of Georgia moved that the House should resolve
							itself into a Committee of the whole upon the State of the Union. The
							Speaker requested <persRef ref="adair-john">General Adair</persRef> to
							take the Chair— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wayne then offered a
							Series of Resolutions distributing the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President’s</persRef> Messages into paragraphs, and referring each
							subject to a distinct Committee most of them were adopted as proposed;
							but the one to be referred to the Committee of Ways and Means, made no
							mention of the Bank of the United States— <persRef ref="mcduffie-george"
								>George M’Duffie</persRef> Chairman of that Committee moved as an
							Amendment to the Resolution, the words “so much as relates to the Bank
							of the United States” upon which a debate between these two members
							followed, in which Wayne pointedly referred to the contradictory
							opinions respecting the rechartering of the Bank of the United States,
								<pb n="321" type="ms"/>contained in the President’s Message, and in
							the Annual Report of the Secretary of the Treasury upon the
							finances—M’Duffie’s amendment prevailed by a large majority.— <persRef
								ref="wickliffe-charles">Charles A. Wickliffe</persRef> moved an
							additional Resolution to refer the subject of internal improvement to a
							select Committee— Wayne said he had left it out, because there was
							nothing about internal improvement in the Message—and there had already
							been appointed a Committee on Internal Improvement, on a Resolution
							offered by <persRef ref="mercer-charles">C F Mercer</persRef> of
							Virginia— Wickliffe’s Resolution was adopted in Committee of the whole,
							but in the house, was laid upon the table— The House adjourned about
							half past two. I spoke to the Clerk for the papers of sundry petitioners
							for pensions and for clearing a river, concerning which I had received
							Letters from <persRef ref="richardson-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Joseph Richardson</persRef> my Predecessor as
							Representative of the District and from <persRef ref="turner-samuel">S.
								A. Turner</persRef>.— He said I should have them to-morrow Morning—
							I walked with <persRef ref="taylor-john">John W. Taylor</persRef> to his
							lodgings; but his dinner immediately came in and I promised to call upon
							him again. He said there had been a call of a meeting of National
							Republicans at <persRef ref="u">Prentiss’s</persRef> last Thursday; that
							five persons had attended. that he had received an invitation but was
							confined to his bed and could not attend— That the Anti-Masonic Members
							were not invited— <persRef key="frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript"

							stopped the Carriage to say that he came from the Subscribers to the

							was already gone— The <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker</persRef>
							took the Chair a few minutes after I reached the house; the States were
							again called over for Petitions— I presented in my turn four or five
							moving in the usual form that they should be referred to the appropriate
							Committees— <persRef ref="ellsworth-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Ellsworth</persRef> of Connecticut presented a Petition
							from a Claimant of demands upon France, before the year 1800 upon which
							a debate arose—he moved its reference to a Select Committee— Some other

								<persRef ref="howard-benjamin">Howard</persRef> of Baltimore moved
							to lay it on the table, alledging that the great body of the Claimants
							had committed their claims to the charge of one person, and did not wish
							Congress to do any thing with them this Session— But this was denied by
								<persRef ref="drayton-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Drayton</persRef> of South Carolina, who spoke for many of them—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Everett—<persRef

								Hoffman</persRef> of New-York, and <persRef ref="mcduffie-george"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Duffie</persRef> took part in
							the debate in which I also made a Speech.— I gave a short history of the
							Claims and stated their precise character to shew that they should go
							not to the Committee of foreign affairs, but to a select Committee— The
							house however by a considerable majority referred the petition to the
							Committee of Foreign Affairs— When the presenting of Petitions was gone
							through the Chaplain of the House was elected—The <persRef
								ref="post-reuben">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Reuben
								Post</persRef> was chosen— A Resolution offered by <persRef
								ref="mercer-charles">C. F. Mercer</persRef> was taken up—that here
							after there should at the commencement of each Session of Congress, be
							elected a Standing Committee upon Roads and Canals to consist of seven
							members— It was opposed by <persRef ref="mitchel-thomas2"
								>Mitchell</persRef> of South Carolina, who was replied to by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Mercer— Mitchell moved to lay the
							Resolution on the Table which the House refused— <persRef
								ref="speight-jesse">Speight</persRef> moved postponement till
							Monday—refused—then till to-morrow—refused—then to adjourn and that
							motion prevailed— I had asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett to
							consent to exchange places with me on the Committees— To take my place
							as Chairman of the Committee of Manufactures, and to give me that of
							second upon the Committee of <pb n="322" type="ms"/>foreign Relations,
							where he was placed; to which he readily agreed if the Speaker would
							consent which he said he did not believe he would— After the adjournment
							I went into the Speaker’s chamber, and proposed to him to authorize the
							exchange, but he said he had no power to make the alteration— That the
							appointment of Committees being once made was the act of the House, and
							he had no authority to change the arrangement in any manner. I referred
							him to an arrangement which had been made a few years since when
								<persRef ref="randolph-john">John Randolph</persRef>, was made
							Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, and George M’Duffie the
							second; and after a few days M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Randolph was
							at his own request excused and M’Duffie acted as Chairman of the
							Committee during the remainder of the Session— He said it was the Act of
							the House upon a Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Randolph
							himself and was granted with great reluctance— He then expatiated upon
							his discharge of his duties as Speaker upon the general expectation of
							the Nation— Upon importance of that place above all others, particularly
							at this time— I told him that so far as concerned myself I was
							satisfied— I had no complaint to make; and he had discharged his duty as
							Speaker—but I had two reasons for wishing to be excused—one that I did
							not feel myself competent for the Station which he had assigned to
							me—the other that the state of my health was not fitted to the burden
							which it imposed upon me— He repeated that he had no power over the
							arrangement of the Committees after the appointments were made. That the
							house alone could excuse me, and if they should, another distinguished
							Citizen from the East would be appointed, but not M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett— The humiliation of asking to be
							excused by the house I cannot yet endure, and I shall submit to my fate—
								<persRef ref="gales-joseph">Gales</persRef> sent to me again for a
							copy of my Speech on the relinquished claims upon France— I said he must
							send me the manuscript of his Reporter and I would revise it— I was
							obliged to write almost the whole of it over again, and it absorbed the
							Evening— I must very rarely make speeches in the house. It is double
							waste of Time—first to speak, and then to report.</p>

						<p>I was up again in the night between two and three O’Clock, and altho I
							returned to bed I had little Sleep— My mind is agitated and distressed
							with little prospect of relief, and with still less appearance of more
							favourable prospects hereafter— The Scene before me is such as might
							impel to desperation—and the wish that the Scene of earthly being were
							closed intrudes upon me, whenever I indulge in reflection— This state of
							mind brings wakeful nights of which I have now had three in succession
							with a prospect of I know not how many more— When Morning came I
							finished my version of the 51<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> Psalm
							without more satisfaction— I wrote to <persRef ref="whitson-moses">Moses
								Whitson</persRef> Salisbury Township Chester County Pennsylvania,
							from whom I received last Spring the 15 Petitions, which I presented on
							Monday to the House, and I enclosed to him a National Intelligencer
							containing my Speech on presenting the Petitions— Going to the House I
							stopped at <persRef ref="elliot-jonathan">Jonathan Elliot’s</persRef>
							shop to leave my signalement, for his Directory, which he had sent me
							yesterday with blanks, requesting that they might be filled up and the
							note returned to him— Overtook <persRef ref="tracy-phineas">Phineas L.
								Tracy</persRef> and walked with him to the Capitol— Asked him to
							dine with me next Sunday, which he promised. He says he is well
							acquainted with <persRef ref="brown-henry2">Henry Brown</persRef> the
							author of the Narrative of the Anti-masonic excitement in the Western
							Counties of New-York in 1827, 8 and 9— That Brown has lost that part of
							the Country, a bankrupt in fortune and reputation, and that his book is
							full of falsehood and misrepresentation, which I well knew before. <pb
								n="323" type="ms"/>At the House of Representatives, precisely at
							Noon <persRef ref="post-reuben">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Post</persRef> commenced the business of the day with Prayer— The
								<persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker</persRef> then took the
							Chair and called for Petitions. This occupied an hour—then came the
							unfinished business of yesterday; <persRef ref="mercer-charles"
								>Mercer’s</persRef> Resolution for the appointment hereafter, of a
							standing Committee of Roads and Canals. <persRef ref="speight-jesse"
								>Speight</persRef> made a Speech against it—and <persRef
								ref="doubleday-ulysses">Ulysses F. Doubleday</persRef> of New-York
							another. Mercer replied with great animation, and then <persRef
								ref="mitchel-thomas2">Mitchell</persRef> of South-Carolina replied
							to him— In the midst of Mitchell’s speech, the came a Message from the
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef>, which suspended
							the debate— It was about the loss of the Ship Minerva—Referred to the
							Committee of Commerce— The House adjourned about two.— I had received
							the Commission of the Committee of Manufactures, and the reference to
							them of so much of the President’s Message as related to Manufactures
							and the Modification of the Tariff— <persRef ref="mcduffie-george"
								>M’Duffie</persRef>, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means
							made several Reports. <persRef ref="hoffman-michael">Hoffman</persRef>
							the Chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs made one— I sent round a
							notification to all the members of the Committee of Manufactures,
							requesting their attendance at the room of the Committee immediately
							after the adjournment of the house— I called at the seat of <persRef
								ref="condict-lewis">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Condict</persRef>, who had been a member of the same Committee at the
							last Session, to shew me the way to the Committee room— At D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Condict’s seat I met <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, who
							appears to be in fine health— He said he would call and see me some
							Evening— He was nominated by the National Republican Convention at
							Baltimore yesterday for the Presidency of the United States at the next
							Election—165 votes out of 166. present naming him successively as their
							choice; and a Committee of 13 came last evening to inform him of his
							nomination.— I went with D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Condict to the
							Room of the Committee on Manufacturers which is in the upper Story of
							the Capitol— There was no fire in the room, but there was in the
							adjoining chamber being that of the Committee of Foreign Relations— They
							were not in Session, and we took the Room, the whole Committee
							present—the members are Lewis Condict of New-Jersey <persRef
								ref="findlay-james">James Findlay</persRef> of Ohio, <persRef
								ref="horn-henry">Henry Horn</persRef> of Pennsylvania, <persRef
								ref="dayan-charles">Charles Dayan</persRef> of New-York, <persRef
								ref="worthington-john">J. T. H. Worthington</persRef> of Maryland,
							and <persRef ref="barbour-john">John S. Barbour</persRef> of Virginia.
							There was some conversation among the members as to the best mode of
							proceeding by the Committee— A reduction of duties upon many of the
							Articles in the Tariff was understood by all to be the object to be
							effected—It was observed that it would be necessary to Review the
							Tariff’s of 1816. 1820. 1824. and 1828. and the effects severally
							produced by them.— That upon articles not in competition with our own
							the reduction might be large, and some articles made entirely free— It
							was suggested that communication might be held with the <persRef
								ref="mclane-louis">Secretary of the Treasury</persRef> to ascertain
							the views and wishes of the Executive and if they had any plan in
							preparation upon this subject, which I promised to do— It was understood
							that as soon as the whole subject should be matured a Report should be
							prepared by the Chairman and submitted to the Committee— The Memorials
							from the Free Trade and Tariff Conventions are expected— It was proposed
							by one member that the Committee should meet twice a week, but as
							nothing is yet prepared the next meeting is to be called at the
							discretion of the Chairman, and he was desired to apply for another and
							more comfortable Committee Room— Adjourned about three. After I came
							home <persRef ref="morrell-benjamin">Captain Morrell</persRef>, of the
							Schooner Antarctic was here— He says he has discovered many New Islands
							in the South Sea, and wishes to discover more— He asked for my advice,
							but I could give him none, though I told him I should be glad to give
							him all the assistance in my power.</p>

						<p>Began my version of the 52<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Psalm; and wrote
							a short Letter to my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2"
							>Charles</persRef>— Read the Journal, and Address to the People of the
							United States of the Free-Trade Convention held at Philadelphia in the
							early part of October last— The Address was written by <persRef
								ref="berrien-john">John M’Pherson Berrien</persRef>, and though
							written in a gentlemanly Style, strikes me as very feeble in thought or
							argument— <persRef ref="tracy-phineas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Tracy</persRef> of New-York called with <persRef
								ref="hiester-william">William Heister</persRef>, a member from
							Pennsylvania whom he introduced to me— Heister is the Successor of
								<persRef ref="buchanan-james2">James A Buchanan</persRef>— I
							attended at the House and was again belated— That is the Clerk was
							reading the Journal of yesterday when I entered the house— The Petitions
							were called for by States— I was just in time to present that of
								<persRef ref="oakman-constant">Constant Fobes Oakman</persRef>, a
							Soldier of the Revolutionary War, and to move its reference to the
							Committee on Revolutionary Pensions— The House goes through this course
							daily, the dulness of which is abridged by the mode of despatching it— A
							succession of Resolutions was offered by sundry members with unanimous
							consent— One instructing the Committee of Ways and Means to bring in a
							Bill for repairing the Cumberland Road— After it had passed, <persRef
								ref="mcduffie-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Duffie</persRef> moved a reconsideration; remarking that while the
							House had been three days debating a question about roads and Canals, in
							which no principle was involved, the Resolution for squandering more
							money upon that inexhaustible sink of public funds the Cumberland Road
							had passed by an unanimous, unquestioned vote— It was an Instruction not
							even to enquire into the expediency, but positively to report a Bill.—
							The <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker</persRef> asked M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Duffie if he moved a reconsideration—he
							said yes— <persRef ref="doddridge-philip">Doddridge</persRef> agreed to
							the reconsideration and that the enquiry into the expediency should be
							the Instruction instead of the order to bring in a bill; and so it
							passed—but it was all formal trifling in one case as well as in the
							other— No principle was settled by the order to bring in a Bill, which
							at any one of its three readings might be contested or rejected— The
							Resolutions offered by unanimous consent became so numerous that they
							were consuming the time, till upon one offered by <persRef
								ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef>
							<persRef ref="mercer-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Mercer</persRef> gave notice that it was the last he should suffer
							to pass— <persRef ref="sevier-ambrose">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sevier</persRef> the delegate from Arkansas Territory did
							nevertheless offer another Resolution but Mercer objected to its
							reception, and it was not received— <persRef ref="mitchel-thomas2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mitchell</persRef> of South-Carolina
							then finished his Speech against the future appointment of Standing
							Committees of Roads and Canals, <persRef ref="wilde-richard"
								>Wilde</persRef> of Georgia made a short speech against the
							Resolution, and <persRef ref="davis-john4">Davis</persRef> of
							Massachusetts a short Speech in its favour— Mitchell called for the yeas
							and nays, and the Resolution was carried by a vote of 96 to 90. It
							settled not one particle of principle; but it was a trial vote of the
							temper of the house upon the principle of internal improvement and the
							majority is so very small, in its favour that there is no doubt the
							minority will be able to defeat any project of that nature which may be
							brought forward, and which would promise any public utility— Several of
							the members voted against the Resolution upon party motives, who would
							willingly favour measures of internal improvement if they dared—
							Immediately after the question was taken the house adjourned over to
							next Monday— I found upon my Table a Letter from <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah2">President Josiah Quincy</persRef> recommending
							a person by the name of <persRef ref="robinson-henry">Henry
								Robinson</persRef>, who wishes to obtain for his <pb n="325"
								type="ms"/>son, <persRef ref="robinson-charles">Charles
								Robinson</persRef>, a Midshipman’s Warrant.— <persRef
								ref="findlay-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Findlay</persRef>
							the member from Ohio came to my table, and asked for my influence in
							behalf of the same young man I promised to speak to the <persRef
								ref="woodbury-levi">Secretary of the Navy</persRef> in his behalf—
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> said there
							was a <persRef ref="causten-james3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Caustin</persRef>
							an agent of the claimants upon France prior to 1800. belonging to
							Baltimore who wished to be introduced to me— I told him I should be glad
							to see him— A Friend came also to take me by the hand, who said he had
							met me at the late <persRef ref="peters-richard">Judge
								Peters’s</persRef> near Philadelphia in October 1824. with <persRef
								ref="lafayette">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> La
								Fayette</persRef>. In going to the Capitol this morning I met
								<persRef ref="amory-rufus">Rufus G. Amory</persRef>, just arrived,
							who questioned me about the Speeches I have made in the house; and
							particularly about my presenting Petitions and then opposing the prayer
							of them— He seemed to doubt whether I ought not to have sent them back—
							There was a fire again last Evening at Georgetown, and three dwelling
							houses were consumed— We had this day Snow followed by a clear
							sharpening Northwester and <persRef ref="fahrenheit-daniel">Fahrenheit</persRef> down to 6.</p>

						<p>The coldest Morning since January 1821—the coldest within two degrees,
							that I have witnessed at Washington, in twenty winters— But there was no

							at a higher temperature— The Thermometer rose to 26. in the course of
							the day— I finished the version of the 52 and began that of the 53<hi

						<p>Finished the version of the 53<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Psalm— The
							weather had gradually moderated all day yesterday, and I fancied a
							milder time was coming.— But just before daylight this morning the wind
							came round again to the North west with a brisk gale and a sharp frost
							stiffening all day long— My visitors this day were chiefly delegates
							from the National Republican Convention, which have just nominated
								<persRef key="clay-henry">Henry Clay</persRef> for President, and
								<persRef ref="sergeant-john">John Sergeant</persRef> for
							Vice-President of the United States— The morning visitors who came with
								<persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Blunt</persRef> talked about the
							weather— But those of the Evening spoke of the great harmony of their
							nomination at Baltimore, and of their sanguine hopes, and asked my
							opinions of their prospects— This introduced a long conversation upon
							Masonry and Anti-masonry—in which I gave my opinions with more freedom
							than discretion— They were asked, and it was not in my nature to conceal
							or disguise them. <persRef ref="paine-robert3">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Paine</persRef> brought me a Letter of Introduction from
								<persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef>. he is young
							man of great promise as a mathematician and astronomer, and is employed
							by direction of the Legislature in making the astronomic calculations
							for a new Map of the State of Massachusetts— He spoke of the

								ref="lambert-william">Joseph Lambert</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="elliot-william2">William Elliot</persRef> by order of Congress
							to fix the Longitude of the Capitol, as having placed it six Miles too

							February were still worse— But that <persRef ref="hassler-ferdinand"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hassler</persRef> had made a
							correct observation of the Eclipse. Two Gentlemen from the Relief

								<persRef ref="gray-frederick">Gray</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="bowen-charles">Bowen</persRef> of Boston; and to <persRef

								Sullivan</persRef>, as that of the young man soliciting the degree—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chapin was at his dinner— I gave him

						<p>The succession of cold weather still continues—severe beyond any thing

								ref="johnson-alexander">A. B. Johnson</persRef> of Utica. He said he
							would call upon me again— <persRef ref="burke-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Burke</persRef> was formerly Editor of
							a newspaper at Frederick and then at Rockville, Maryland. He came here
							now as a Candidate for the Office of Doorkeeper of the Senate, for which
							he asked of me a Letter of Recommendation. I declined giving it, and
							told him I had done the same with another applicant before him— These
							visitors detained me so that the House were in Session before I reached
							the Capitol— I met <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H
								Everett</persRef> just before, and he asked me to introduce him to
							the floor of the house, as a member of a State Legislature.— I did so,
							thinking that as such he was one of the privileged persons admissible
							upon the floor— I was shortly afterwards sent for <unclear>at</unclear> my Seat, and
								<persRef ref="carr-overton">Carr</persRef> the Door-keeper said that
							according to usage I must introduce M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Everett to the <persRef ref="stevenson-andrew">Speaker</persRef>. But
							the Speaker was then in the Chair and the house engaged in business— I
							asked Carr if I could introduce M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett
							to the Speaker then— He thought not— I then said the Speaker would
							doubtless have no objection to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett’s
							remaining on the floor till the adjournment of the House— I found on
							returning to my Seat, and looking to the rules of the House that members
							of the State Legislatures are not among the persons admissible upon the
							floor— Among the Petitions presented was one <unclear>from</unclear> <persRef
								ref="arnold-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Arnold</persRef>
							of Tennessee, from <persRef ref="martin-samuel">Samuel Martin</persRef>
							of Campbell’s Station—relating to the Postage upon Newspapers and
							pamphlets payable by Printers. Arnold made a short Speech on presenting
							the Petition, which at his motion was ordered to be laid upon the Table
							and printed— <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">General Dearborn</persRef>,
							offered a Resolution, instructing the Committee of Ways and Means; to
							inquire into the expediency of reducing the duties on Teas, Coffee,
							Spices, Indigo and coarse Woollen, which gave rise to a debate, in which
							I took a part, whether the Resolution should be referred to the
							Committee of Ways and Means or to the Committee on Manufactures. It
							appeared that the Subject matter had been referred to both the
							Committees—the debate was suspended by the expiration of the hour,
							allotted to the Consideration of Resolutions. The house soon after
							adjourned. <persRef ref="sutherland-joel">Joel B. Sutherland</persRef>
							came up and introduced four or five of the members from <pb n="328"

								ref="coulter-richard">Coulter</persRef>, <persRef ref="ihrie-peter"
								>Ihrie</persRef>, and <persRef ref="king-henry">King</persRef> who
							told me he was a native of Massachusetts— Sutherland wished Dearborn to
							withdraw his Resolution, but said if a vote should be taken upon it he
							should vote for referring it to the Committee on Manufactures— I walked
							with <persRef ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef> to his lodgings—
							He said there was a great effort making to get up Meetings of
							Anti-Masons to request <persRef ref="wirt-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt</persRef> to decline his
							nomination, and that they would perhaps succeed— He said also that from
							the moment of his late address at the anti Masonic Meeting, all his
							oldest Masonic friends, who had ever adhered to him before had deserted
							him,—and turned against him with extreme violence— <persRef

							of New-York, and <persRef ref="temple-robert">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Temple</persRef> of Vermont spent the Evening here—
							Stone said he had made very little progress with his book; not having
							written more than sixty pages— We had a long and earnest conversation
							about anti-masonry— But Stone did not know that the four men who
							murdered <persRef ref="morgan-william2">Morgan</persRef> were all Royal
							Arch Masons— I wrote a Letter to <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor

							the year 1800. called and introduced himself— He reminded me of an
							application which he had made to me seven or eight years since at the
							Department of State for Documents relating to these claims, and, which
							from what he now said I incline to think I refused him—but of the
							application itself I have no Memory— <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Doup</persRef> is a Virginian who
							brought me an Old parchment indenture of the year 1719–20. being a
							conveyance by Lease and Release to a person named <persRef
								ref="blunden-john">John Blunden</persRef> of what he said was a
							whole Square in the City of Kilkenny in Ireland— The Conveyance was
							executed by several persons among whom a woman named <persRef ref="u"
								>Dillon</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">her <unclear>husband</unclear></persRef> M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Doup said <persRef ref="u">his
								wife’s</persRef> uncle, named <persRef ref="u">Dillon</persRef>, was
							lineally descended from the woman who executed the Indenture and claimed
							by descent from her— I told him the first thing would be to prove the
							lineage; and for this he was not at all prepared. There are at least
							three generations to prove and no public registers to which they can
							recur— Then with regard to the title I asked M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Doup to leave the Indenture with me till to-morrow Morning
							when I would give him my opinion upon it. He left it accordingly: The
								<persRef ref="u">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Skinner</persRef> and two other
							Gentlemen from the Columbian College, came to invite my attendance at
							their Commencement to-morrow—to be held at <persRef ref="post-reuben"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Post’s</persRef> Church— I
							promised to attend as long as I could compatibly with my duty to the
							House of Representatives— I was again detained so that I found the house
							in Session— And in the call of States for the presentation of Petitions,
							Massachusetts was already past— After they had all gone through however
							I obtained the unanimous consent of the house to present a Petition from
							East-Middleborough, for the Establishment of a Post-Office there— It was
							according to the usual custom referred to the Committee on Post Offices
							and Post Roads, of which <persRef ref="johnson-richard">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Richard M. Johnson</persRef> is
							Chairman— I recommended the petition to his charge; and he promised to
							give special attention to it.— There was a debate in the house whether
							several petitions and memorials should be referred to the Committee of
							Commerce, or to that of Internal Improvement—and by a vote taken a large
							Class of Cases usually referred heretofore to the Committee of Commerce
							was now transferred to the Committee of internal improvement— <persRef
								ref="babcock-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William

							suit his convenience— On my way home from the house I stopped at the
							Treasury, and had an hour of conversation with him upon the projected
							modification of the Tariff— I told him I should propose to reserve as
							much as five Millions a year to purposes of Internal Improvement— He
							said he thought it would be impossible to obtain the assent of Congress
							or of the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> to the
							reservation of so large a sum— I argued the point with him, and he said
							he would report my remarks to the President—an effectual damper for
							them— I said there was one point of view in which perhaps the President
							might be reconciled to it—as a means of strengthening the defences of
							the Country— Such a reservation might serve the purpose of a Treasure,
							without the inconvenience of hoarding— In peace it might be applied to
							internal improvement, and in prospect of War be a fund ready provided
							for the emergencies of the Times— <persRef ref="newton-thomas">M<hi

						<p>An Italian by the name of <persRef ref="pinistri-salvator"
								>Pinistri</persRef> came with a plan for improving the Hall of the
							House of Representatives, so that the Speakers may be more easily heard.
							He said <persRef ref="verplanck-gulian">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Verplanck</persRef> was Chairman of a Committee to which his
							memorial had at the last Session of Congress been referred— I told him
							he must then go to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Verplanck again— He
							said that would be of no avail that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Verplanck had nothing to say against the plan, but that he thought it
							would cost too much— I said he must reason with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Verplanck and convince him that it would not— I returned to
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Doup</persRef> his
							Indenture which I had examined, and could find no claim of title to the
							descendants of <persRef ref="u">Dillon</persRef>, unless by a reversion
							as heirs of the grantee <persRef ref="blunden-john">John
								Blunden</persRef>. He said <persRef ref="lawless-luke">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Lawless</persRef> of Missouri knew
							the land described in the Indenture, and said that it was whole square
							in the City of Kilkenny, covered with dwelling houses, and certainly
							worth several hundred thousands of dollars— He said what had first
							called the attention of his relatives to the subject was that a
							Gentleman, who came a year or two since from Ireland had said that it
							was understood there that the heirs to this Estate were in America— He
							then asked my advice what they should do—observing that the persons who
							would be benefited by the recovery of the property, if it could be
							recovered, had met with misfortunes, and were in straitened
							circumstances— I told him I could not upon the conveyance and the facts
							as he had submitted them to me, recommend to the parties interested, any
							measure which would involve expence— They might perhaps by a
							Correspondence in Ireland, ascertain more of the present state of the
							property and they might see if they could trace the lineage down
							regularly to the claimant— These were the first things to be done and
							the result of them might lead to the expediency of them doing something
							more— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Doup asked me, what was my charge
							for my advice—and upon my answering, nothing; expressed himself as very
							grateful for it— I attended the Commencement of the Columbian College,
							at <persRef ref="post-reuben">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Post’s</persRef> Church— I found them already in the church at half
							past ten, and gave to <persRef ref="chapin-stephen">President
								Chapin</persRef> while in the pulpit the Letter for him which I
							received last Evening from <persRef ref="sullivan-george">George
								Sullivan</persRef>— I explained also the error in which I had been
							that his Son still retained the name of Sullivan— His name is now
								<persRef ref="sullivan-george3">George, Richard, James
								Bowdoin</persRef>. The President promised that the degree should be
							conferred accordingly. <pb n="330" type="ms"/>I remained until the
							performances of the Candidates for degrees were completed but could not
							wait to witness the conferring of the degrees— It was past twelve when I
							left the Church and I found the house had been in Session about half an
							hour— The turn of the members from Massachusetts for presenting
							Petitions was passed, but after the States and Territories had been all
							called I found an opportunity to present the Petition from sundry
							inhabitants of Scituate and the neighbouring Towns, for the improvement
							of North-river; which at my motion was referred to the Committee on
							internal improvement. <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett</persRef> invited me to attend
							at his lodgings this Evening a small Meeting of friends to consider the
							question with regard to the Modification of the Tariff— I had some
							conversation, with <persRef ref="mercer-charles">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> C. F. Mercer</persRef> on the same Subject; and
							intimated to him a wish that there might be about five Millions of
							Revenue reserved, annually for specific purposes of internal
							improvement. He said that he should be entirely in favour of it, but
							thought it doubtful whether it could be carried through— I have the same
							doubts perhaps in higher degree— <persRef ref="johnson-francis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Francis Johnson</persRef> of Kentucky
							with a <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Willis</persRef>
							called upon me this afternoon— The were members of the late Baltimore
							President-making Convention. At seven in the Evening I went to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett’s lodgings, and there met Mess<hi

							Committee not to be confined to the members of the present Meeting, to
							be appointed by the Chairman, Taylor, to report an opinion for
							discussion as to what further is to be done— I came home about ten— My

						<p>Finished the version of the 55<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and began

								ref="bell-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell</persRef> the
							Senator from New-Hampshire called to see me, this morning, before the
							Meeting of the Houses— He said the nomination of <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">Martin Van Buren</persRef>, as Minister to
							Great-Britain was now before the Senate, and some of the members
							inclined to reject it; but he doubted himself whether that course would
							be wise or politic— I told him I thought it so far otherwise; that I had
							not supposed any Senator would vote against the nomination with a
							purpose of rejecting it— I thought Van Buren had disgraced himself when
							Secretary of State, by pandering to palm a <persRef ref="eaton-margaret"
								>prostitute</persRef> upon decent Society—and disgraced the Country
							by his Instructions to <persRef ref="mclane-louis">M’Lane</persRef>,
							upon his Mission to England— But to reject the nomination of him now
							would bring him back with increased power to do mischief here—would make
							way for another appointment certainly not less profligate than himself;
							and would have abroad an effet unfavourable to this Country similar to
							that which his own obnoxious Instructions have produced. I thought
							therefore the rejection of him would do no good and might do much harm.
							I found the House in Session, and the Clerk reading the Journal of
							yesterday— <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Whittlesey</persRef> Chairman of the Committee of Claims
							had reported 38 bills, and about 25 of them this day passed through the
							Committee of the whole, were reported to the house without amendment,
							and then passed to the third reading— There were three successive
							Committees of the whole, of which <persRef ref="taylor-john">John W.
								Taylor</persRef>—<persRef ref="root-erastus">Jesse Root</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="condict-lewis">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Condict</persRef> were successively Chairman— The Bills were chiefly
							such as had passed the House of Representatives at the last Session of
							Congress. <pb n="331" type="ms"/>I sent round notice to the members of
							the Committee of Manufactures to meet immediately after the adjournment
							of the house. I read to them the draught of a Letter to the Secretary of
							the Treasury, which I had written enquiring for information, which was
							adopted with an amendment— <persRef ref="bouldin-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bouldin</persRef> of Virginia had
							moved in the house a Resolution calling on the Committee to obtain and
							report to the house certain information— I proposed to enclose also a

							information of him, which was agreed to— <persRef ref="worthington-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Worthington</persRef> was the
							only member of the Committee absent— Some of the members intimated that
							they would prefer hereafter to meet in the Morning, before the Meeting
							of the House— John W. Taylor called here in the Evening, and mentioned
							that he was somewhat embarrassed with regard to the appointment of the
							Committee with which he had been charged last Evening— He thought I had
							inclined not to be one of the Committee myself—in which I told him he
							had understood me correctly— He said he had thought of <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>, and <persRef ref="johnston-josiah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Josiah S. Johnston</persRef>, all of

								Davis</persRef> of whom he spoke very highly appeared to distrust a
							little the consonancy of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s views
							with the interest of internal industry in New-England— I supposed this
							might have originated in the sort of Manifesto of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s present political opinions, issued
							for him in the Richmond Whig.— <persRef ref="pleasants-john">John H.
								Pleasants’s</persRef> paper entirely devoted to him— I told Taylor I
							had some suspicion Davis was somewhat distrustful of me also, though I
							knew not exactly the reason why?— Taylor spoke of his own situation, and
							of the certainty that after the new census, his vicinage would be so
							districted as to exclude him from Congress— I told him I expected the

							of the whole House, reported and passed to a third reading— There were
							two, upon which after they had passed through the Committee of the
							whole, and were taken up in the house, <persRef ref="wickliffe-charles"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wickliffe</persRef> himself
							asked some explanations of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whittlesey—with regard to one of them he was satisfied and allowed it to
							pass— The other was a bill for the relief of the legal Representatives
							of <persRef ref="hull-william">William Hull</persRef>—an allowance of
							Salary to him as Governor of Michigan, for some Months, while he was a
							prisoner in Canada; and while he was receiving pay as a Major General—
							Wickliffe objected to the passage of this Bill, and after a short
							debate, it was lost by a considerable majority— There was not much to be
							said in its favour, excepting as an apology for a charitable donation to
							an indigent family— Yet I voted for it— I had received a Letter from
								<persRef ref="dean-nathan">Nathan Dean</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="otis-cushing">Cushing Otis</persRef> of Scituate in behalf of
								<pb n="332" type="ms"/><persRef ref="james-elisha">Elisha

							to <persRef ref="hubbard-henry">Henry Hubbard</persRef>, the Chairman of
							the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions, who promised me to report a
							Bill, at the next meeting of the House— They adjourned over till
							Tuesday, on Account of Christmas. I received a Letter from <persRef
								ref="stone-william2">W. L. Stone</persRef>, enquiring about the Acts
							of Parliament against the administration of unlawful Oaths— After the
							adjournment I went into the Library to find Stone; but he was not there—
							After this I called upon <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi

						<p>Finished my version of the 56<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and began
							that of the 57<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm. For the last two or
							three days an offuscation before my eyes has deprived me of the power of
							writing, and almost of reading in the evening—and has almost
							disqualified me before daylight in the morning— The cries of anguish of
							the <persRef ref="adams-mary4">child</persRef> over my head distract my
							mind, and pierce me to the Soul— She has the Scarlet fever very severely
							and suffering extreme pain— It absorbs my Soul till the power of
							composition sinks into impotence— A Quaker by the name of <persRef
								ref="u">Chevalier</persRef> came this morning to shew me his
							patented invention of an improved mode of driving oakum into the seams
							of the planks of ships; of which he had a drawing, and asked my opinion—
							I told him I could form no opinion about it— That it must be tested by
							experiment. <persRef ref="babcock-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> William Babcock</persRef> is a member of the House; from
							Ontario County, New-York, formerly represented by <persRef
								ref="rose-robert2">Robert R Rose</persRef>. Babcock told me his own
							Story— He was a Mason of three degrees; and connected with the
							publication of a newspaper— For sometime after the death of <persRef
								ref="morgan-william2">Morgan</persRef> he disbelieved the fact, and
							his paper treated as infamous calumnies all the charges against the
							Masons as being guilty of his blood— About a Month after the event, a
							Mason, who was under very great obligations to him, told him as a
							Masonic secret that Morgan had been murdered; at which he was so much
							shocked that he immediately renounced his connection with the order, and
							his paper from that time took the Anti-masonic side— He immediately
							became an object of violent persecution by the Masons of his
							neighbourhood, which has continued to this day— At the head of it is the
							man who gave him the information, and who owes to him everything that he
							has in the world— Every kind of slander that could be invented has been
							circulated against him— All his Masonic friends have deserted and taken
							part against him; and that has finally made him a member of Congress;
							for he is not an educated man—is a shopkeeper <unclear>miller</unclear> and mechanic—
							With all this he told me he had called to see me to give me a caution—
							He had been told by <persRef ref="wheeler-grattan">G. H.
								Wheeler</persRef>, a <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>
							member of Congress from his State, that there was now a formal design in
							process of execution, to get me into a difficulty in the House of
							Representatives— That it is of Masonic origin, and that the agent for
							its execution is <persRef ref="root-erastus">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Root</persRef>—a high Mason. M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Babcock advised me therefore not to take part in any debates
							upon trifling subjects— He thinks also that <persRef key="clay-henry"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> now expects that
							the Jackson Masons will come over to him after Jackson’s second term <pb
								n="333" type="ms"/>of Office shall have expired—but that he deceives
							himself and that <persRef ref="johnson-richard">Richard M
								Johnson</persRef> will be their man— He says Richard M Johnson may
							be plaistered up into a hero, and that will be enough to fashion him
							into a Candidate for the Office of President. I had visits from sundry
							members of Congress, and from <persRef ref="u">Colonel Woolley</persRef>
							of the army with <persRef ref="pugh-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Pugh</persRef> from the State of Illinois— This
							Gentleman has a project for making a Rail-road from Lake Michigan to the
							Illinois-river—to be substituted in the place of a Canal—for which an
							Appropriation to a large amount of public Lands, has already been made
							by Congress. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pugh wishes the
							Appropriation to be transferred, from the Canal to a Rail-way and
							solicits my assistance to carry this measure through the house— I

							<persRef ref="cambreleng-churchill">Churchill C. Cambreleng</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="slade-william">William Slade</persRef>, members of the
							House, the last from Vermont; all the rest from New-York— I called at
							the Department of State and enquired of the Chief Clerk, who is still
								<persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel
								Brent</persRef>; if the claim upon France of <persRef
								ref="holmes-william3">William Holmes</persRef> of Plymouth, from
							whom I received this morning a Letter upon the subject was upon the
							files, and I found it was— I asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent
							for a copy of the entries upon the files in that case, which he promised
							to send me next Tuesday.— He gave me also a new Catalogue of the Library
							and promised me a Collection of the documents of the last Session of
							Congress— I then called upon <persRef ref="cadwalader-thomas">General
								Cadwalader</persRef> at his lodgings, and invited him to dine with
							me to-morrow; but he said he had engaged the Senators from Pennsylvania,
								<persRef ref="wilkins-william">Wilkins</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="dallas-george">Dallas</persRef> to dine with him— Cadwalader is
							here on the concerns of the Bank of the United States, somewhat
							uncertain whether it will be proper for the Bank to apply for a new
							Charter at the present Session of Congress— He told me much of the
							result of his inquiries, and particularly a characteristic dialogue
							between him, and <persRef ref="smith-samuel2">Samuel Smith</persRef>,
							chairman of the Committee of Finance in the Senate—very anxious for the
							rechartering of the Bank; but not sure that he can vote for it, at this
							Session of Congress— I told Cadwalader that I was so decidedly in favour
							of the Bank, that I had on last passing through Philadelphia, divested
							myself of all personal interest in its concerns— He said <persRef
								ref="mcduffie-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Duffie</persRef> had told him he had done the same— I was unable
							to write this Evening— The Child Louisa most distressingly ill—and

							was this morning called away to her daughter in Law, who is in
							Childbed.</p>

						<p>A morning of much distress from the illness and cries of the <persRef
								ref="adams-mary4">child</persRef>, but hopes are given that she is
							better— I attended the morning Public worship at the Capitol, and heard
								<persRef ref="post-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Post</persRef>, from Luke 2.11. “For unto you is born this day in
							the City of <persRef ref="david">David</persRef> a Saviour: which is
							Christ the Lord.” M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Post is a Presbyterian;
							but his Sermon as well as his text was adapted to the day.— The house
							was very thin; and there was no person there to raise the tune to sing
							the first hymn: for the second and third there was— After Church I
							invited <persRef ref="bell-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bell</persRef>, the Senator from New-Hampshire, and <persRef
								ref="blunt-joseph">Blunt</persRef> to dine with me, which they did—
							I asked also <persRef ref="foot-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Foot</persRef>, Senator from Connecticut, but he was engaged— I
							called upon <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">General Dearborn</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="ellsworth-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ellsworth</persRef> of Connecticut, and invited them—but Dearborn
							was confined to the house with the Influenza, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Ellsworth was engaged— <persRef
								ref="lee-william">William Lee</persRef> came in while I was there;
							and <persRef ref="smith-samuel">Samuel H Smith</persRef> was there when
							I first went in— All conversation now is about the influenza and
							weather. <pb n="334" type="ms"/>I attended afternoon Service at the
							Presbyterian Church, and heard <persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith</persRef> from Matthew 12.38.
							[“]Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying,
							Master, we would see a sign from thee”— In this as in all M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith’s discourses, his doctrine is drawn
							by a long deduction, remotely from his text— In this case it was that
							religion was burdensome and disagreeable to the human mind—which was
							always calling for evidence and proof other than that which it
							possessed— This is ingenious; but not in the beaten track.— On returning
							home I met at my door <persRef ref="coale-e">Edward J. Coale</persRef>,
							who wanted to see my Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef>—
							Coale had seen <persRef ref="watkins-tobias">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Watkins</persRef> in prison yesterday, and found he had
							been incensed by some foolish tale of something having been said by my
							Son, which the Doctor took for an insult upon his family— I told him
							there could be no foundation for it, and I afterwards asked my Son to
							see Coale, and enable him to refute the falsehood— We had company to
							dinner— <persRef ref="appleton-nathan">Nathan Appleton</persRef>,

								Adams</persRef> has watched the two last Nights with her sick

							afflicted with the Scarlet fever. I finished the version of the 57<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and began that of the 58<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm— This employs on the average about
							two hours every morning, and is delightful occupation when I fancy
							myself successful—that is about one Psalm in five— The rest is teizing
							and bitter disappointment as especially it was this morning. I had a
							succession of visitors all this morning— <persRef
								ref="pendleton-edmund2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Pendleton</persRef>, member of the house from New York, read to me a
							set of Resolutions, which he proposes to offer to the House, declaratory
							of the appellate Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States,
							from the Courts of the States in criminal cases— Of the expediency of
							his presenting them I had some doubts; but did not think proper to
							discourage him, as he seemed anxious to make a Speech in support of
							them; and as it may be productive of good results.— He said he had as
							yet mentioned them only to <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett</persRef>—but I advised him to
							communicate them to <persRef ref="evans-george2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Evans</persRef> of Maine, <persRef ref="davis-john4"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis</persRef> of
								Massachusetts—<persRef ref="ingersoll-ralph">Ingersoll</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="ellsworth-william">Ellsworth</persRef> of Connecticut,
								<persRef ref="taylor-john">Taylor</persRef> of New-York and <persRef
								ref="doddridge-philip">Doddridge</persRef> of Virginia— He said he
							wished to bring them forward as soon as possible— Rather to-morrow than
							later— <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> asked me how I felt upon turning boy again to go into
							the House of Representatives— I told him that hitherto I had found the
							labour light enough, but the house had not yet got to business— He
							repeated several times that I should find my situation extremely
							laborious and that I knew right well before— Labour I shall not refuse
							so long as my hand—my eyes and my brain do not desert me—but what shall
							I do for that which I cannot give?— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay
							spoke of the reduction of the Tariff, and said there were other points
							to be considered, besides the taking off of the duties— One was changing
							the mode of Valuation which he deemed highly important— Another was
							shortening the credits of importations, and introducing a system of cash
							payments as for the Public Lands— A third was the expediency of
							increasing the duties upon some of the protected Articles, so <pb
								n="335" type="ms"/>so as to make them nearly prohibitory— To
							increase the duties for the express purpose of diminishing the revenue,
							was an idea well deserving of meditation, and which had not occurred to
							me— I asked whether in the gracious operation of remitting taxes, there
							would not be a mixture of harshness in extending the protective system,
							and a danger of increasing the discontents of the Southern States,
							already bitterly complaining of the unequal operation of the duties— He
							said the discontents were almost all, if not entirely imaginary or
							factitious, and in almost all the Southern States had in a great measure
							subsided— Here is one great error of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay— He spoke of the Report upon Iron to the New-York Tariff
							Convention, and of their Address to the People which he said was an
							unequal composition— I wished this conversation to be extended, but
							others came in and it was interrupted— Of the other visitors <persRef
								ref="dickerson-mahlon">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Dickerson</persRef>, the Senator from New-Jersey was the most
							remarkable, and <persRef ref="branch-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> John Branch</persRef>, late Secretary of the Navy, and
							now a member of the House from North-Carolina left a card here. <persRef
								ref="dhomergue-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								D’Homergue</persRef> the Silk man, brought me a Letter of
							Introduction from <persRef ref="duponceau-peter">P. S.
								Duponceau</persRef>— There is a Bill before the House appropriating
							forty-thousand dollars for him to instruct sixty persons in the art of
							making silk— It was reported at the last Session of Congress by the
							Committee of Agriculture, but not passed. It is to be brought forward
							again this Session— <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Huntt</persRef> visited me as my friend and
							Physician—and gave me some advice. Said my cough was nervous,—and
							recommended an issue in the arm— I walked round the Capitol Hill before
							dinner—left a return Card at <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">Asbury
								Dickins’s</persRef>, and was able, the first time for several days,
							to write the latter part of the Evening— I wrote to my Son <persRef

								Adams</persRef> still watches with <persRef ref="adams-mary4">her
								Grandchild</persRef>, who we hope is convalescent from the fever,
							but yet at the critical turn of the disease. I finished with great and
							thankless labour the version of the 58<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							Psalm— It has in it the noted passage of the deaf Adder who hears not
							the voice of the Charmer, charm he never so wisely— I have found it
							impossible to retain in the verse the force and beauty of this
							figure—and the rest of the Psalm, though announced as one of the <hi
								rend="italic">golden</hi> effusions of <persRef ref="david"
								>David</persRef>, is not among the most pleasing of the collection—
							Some of its thoughts are harsh, its images not most delicate; its

							version of it is a failure— So it is with nine in ten, but my destiny

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bouldin</persRef> offered

								Mitchell</persRef> offered also a Resolution, and after the

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee</persRef> to urge him to
							hasten it on as soon as possible; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee
							had been very unwell— I asked Mitchell what reduction of duties he
							wanted—he said to reduce the revenue to thirteen Millions— I told him we
							could not do with less than twenty— He said he had represented me to the
							South as an Anti-Tariff man— I said I was no worshiper of the Tariff—but
							of internal improvement, for the pursuit of which by Congress as a
							system I claimed to be the first mover. <pb n="336" type="ms"/>It was by
							a Resolution which I offered to the Senate of the United States on the
								23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of February 1807.— Mitchell said he

						<p>Brought up again my arrears of Diary to the day— Began the version of the
								59<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm. Wrote to <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">C. J. Ingersoll</persRef>, and having no
							visitors this Morning, I reached the Capitol just in time to hear
								<persRef ref="post-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Post’s</persRef> prayer. At the Call of Massachusetts for Petitions,
							I presented that of <persRef ref="drew-isaac">Isaac Drew</persRef> a
							Soldier and Sailor of the Revolution for a Pension, and it was referred
							to the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions— There was a debate of some
							Spirit, upon a proposition or an Amendment of <persRef
								ref="duncan-joseph">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Duncan</persRef> of Illinois, for a distribution in fact of the
							Public Lands among the States in which they are situated— Duncan made a
							Speech to shew the hardship on the new States of not giving them all the
							Lands— <persRef ref="mcduffie-george">M’Duffie</persRef>, without
							opposing the Resolution of Enquiry protested against the principles
							advanced by Duncan and said unsettled Lands were no more taxable than
							air— <persRef ref="root-erastus">Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Root</persRef> commenced a formal Speech against Duncan’s
							proposition, and went into a history of the Public Lands in which he
							claimed great part of the State of Illinois as having originally
							belonged to New-York— Root’s speech was arrested by the expiration of
							the hour allotted to Resolutions and an ineffectual attempt was made to
							suspend the rule so that he might proceed— Several bills were reported;
							read the first and second time, and referred to a Committee of the whole
							House to-morrow— There was a special order of the day upon a bill
							reported by the Military Committee for settling a claim of
							South-Carolina— The house went into a Committee of the whole <persRef
								ref="davis-john4">John Davis</persRef> in the Chair upon this Bill,
							and an amendment to it was made in Committee, and reported to the House—
								<persRef ref="drayton-william">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Drayton</persRef> Chairman of the Committee explained the Bill, and
							had the Report of the Committee in its favour read— <persRef
								ref="mccoy-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Coy</persRef>
							of Virginia, opposed the passage of the Bill, and had a Report of the
							Committee of Claims made in 1828 against it read. <pb n="337" type="ms"
								/><persRef ref="williams-lewis">Lewis Williams</persRef> sustained
							M’Coy; Drayton replied; and at last M’Coy moved the house to adjourn,
							which motion succeeded— <persRef ref="ward-aaron">A. Ward</persRef> of
							New-York as a member of the Military Committee had feebly sustained
							Drayton— I told <persRef ref="whittlesey-elisha">Elisha
								Whittlesey</persRef>, now Chairman of the Committee of Claims, that
							I thought I should move the recommitment of the Bill to that Committee;
							as the bill if passed would let in new claims to the amount of Millions;
							and I had some question of a reference of a Claim of South-Carolina to a
							Committee the Chairman of which was from that State— The practice of the
							house reposes confidence almost unbounded in their Committees—the
							Committees have great confidence in their chairmen, and Drayton stands
							in the double capacity of Chairman of the Military Committee, and of
							Representative from South Carolina— I did not wish to assume an
							appearance of opposition to the claim, or to South-Carolina, but I
							thought the claim should undergo the investigation of another Committee—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whittlesey said perhaps I had better
							ask M’Coy to make the motion— <persRef ref="condict-lewis">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Condict</persRef> gave me notice to
							attend a meeting this Evening at <persRef ref="everett-edward">Edward
								Everett’s</persRef>— <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Dearborn</persRef> came and told me
							that although he had not called upon the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President</persRef>, he had received an invitation to dine with
							him. That he meant to decline it, but wanted advice how to word his
							answer— I said I thought it would be sufficient to say, General Dearborn
							regrets to decline the President’s invitation to dinner. In the Evening
							at seven I attended the meeting at Everett’s— <persRef
								ref="appleton-nathan">Appleton</persRef>, <persRef ref="bates-isaac"

								ref="stewart-andrew">Stewart</persRef>, <persRef ref="taylor-john"
								>J. W. Taylor</persRef>, <persRef ref="vinton-samuel"
								>Vinton</persRef>, and two others were there— <persRef
								ref="allan-chilton">Chilton Allan</persRef> the Representative from
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s District in Kentucky, and
								<persRef ref="mckennan-thomas">T. M. M’Kinnan</persRef>, a member of
							the House from Pennsylvania. Niles was there at the request of some of
							the members of the Committee who reported to the Meeting— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay was chairman of the Committee; and
							the Report was the draught of a Bill to be presented forthwith to the
							Senate for the immediate and total repeal of all the duties upon tea,
							coffee, spices indigo, and many other Articles, almost the whole duty
							upon wines and effecting a diminution of revenue for the coming year
							1832 of upwards of seven millions of dollars— This is M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s Scheme, which he has already
							attempted in the Senate, as General Dearborn attempted it in the house—
							It is now to be attempted in this form— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay laid down the Law of his system— He said the Policy of our
							adversaries was obvious—to break down the American System, by
							accumulation of the revenue— Ours therefore should be specially adapted
							to counteract it, by reducing immediately the Revenue, to the amount of
							seven or eight Millions this very coming year. He would hardly wait for
							the first of January to take off the duties— And he would adhere to the
							protective system, even to the extent of increasing the duties on some
							of the protected Articles— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s manner
							with many courtesies of personal politeness, was exceedingly peremptory
							and dogmatical— There was some discussion of his Statements, but nothing
							said in opposition to them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bates
							ventured a few enquiring remarks, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Everett comparing himself to the devil’s advocate at the Canonization of
							Saints, hazarded a question whether it was not setting the South at
							defiance— I enquired whether it had been considered what would be the
							effect upon the commercial Community, of suddenly taking off such a mass
							of duties, from Articles of which they must have considerable Stocks on
							hand. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Appleton thought it was of very
							little consequence— There was much said of miscellaneous remark, upon
							woollens an immense article of importation, the duties upon which alone,
							were said to amount to eight Millions of dollars—those upon teas and
							coffee amounting to about four Millions. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay said the duties upon hemp were of no use to the hemp of our growth;
							because the European hemp was Water rotted, and ours dew rotted— The
							latter being fit only for Cotton bagging— And he was willing to allow a
							drawback perhaps even upon that—but certainly upon all rigging of ships
							exported— Dearborn said all the Ropewalks in Boston were shut up; owing
							to the duty upon <pb n="338" type="ms"/>hemp— There were sundry remarks
							relative to the frauds upon the revenue; with regard to Woollens and to
							Iron— Others upon the expediency of changing the valuation of imposted
							Article from the foreign place of production to the cost in market here—
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Condict moved that the Bill which had
							been read should be introduced into the Senate— It passed without a
							dissenting voice— I then said that I had no objection to the
							introduction of the Bill. I believed it might prepare us for a full
							consideration of the Subject— But with regard to an immediate remission
							of duties, I ought in candour to state that the Committee on
							Manufactures of the House were already committed upon the principle that
							the reduction of the duties should be prospective and not to commence
							until after the extinguishment of the National debt— If the proposed
							bill should pass the Senate which I very much doubted upon coming to the
							house it would be referred to the Committee of Ways and Means, who would
							probably report by way of amendment an additional reduction of seven or
							eight millions more— It must be distinctly understood, that I could
							support or vote for no bill which would conflict with the pledge given
							by the Committee of Manufactures to the <persRef ref="mclane-louis"
								>Secretary of the Treasury</persRef>— I observed that an immediate
							remission of duties with a declared disposition to increase the duties
							upon the protected Articles would be a defiance, not only of the South,
							as had been observed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett, but
							defiance also of the President and of the whole Administration party—and
							against them combined I thought it not possible that this bill should
							pass— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said he did not care who it
							defied. To preserve, maintain and strengthen the American System he
							would defy the South, the President and the devil— That if the Committee
							of Manufactures had committed themselves as I had stated they had given
							a very foolish and improvident pledge. There was no necessity for the
							payment of the debt on the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of March
							1833: and much more of like import To which I made a respectful, but
							very warm reply— I said that without determining whether the President’s
							passion to pay off the whole of the public debt by the fourth of March
							1833 was the wisest idea that ever entered into the heart of man, it was
							one in which I thought he ought to be indulged and not opposed— It was
							an idea which would take, greatly with the people—to oppose it would be
							invidious—and there was Justice in it too. It was true the three per
							Cents must be paid off dollar for dollar while the use of the money
							might be worth double the interest they were paying for it— But this was
							only Justice to the original holders of the 3 per Cents, which ought
							like the rest of the debt to have been paid off at six per Cent— It
							would be a great and glorious day when the United States shall be able
							to say that they owe not a dollar in the world. and this payment of the
							debt would obviate another difficulty suggested by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay— There would certainly be no
							accumulation of revenue within that time. As to the Bill, I thought it
							would be well to watch its progress with a vigilant eye; for if I
							mistook not it would produce remarkable political disclosures— I was
							much surprised to hear that the Chairman of the Committee of Finance
							would report such a Bill— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay said he
							would report it— He perhaps would not vote for it, but the Senate would
							pass it. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnstone asked if I had any
							other objection to the bill, than to the time for the remission of
							duties to commence; and he <pb n="339" type="ms"/>proposed July or
							October— I said, if the Bill should come to the house from the Senate, I
							should favour it as far as I could, reconcileably with the principles
							which the Committee of Manufactures at my own suggestion had assumed—
							There was then a proposition that the same Committee which had prepared
							this Bill should proceed to mature a plan for reducing the duties on the
							protected Articles. but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay declined,
							and moved that the Meeting should dissolve itself— He was evidently
							mortified and piqued— He had come to the Meeting to give his little
							Senate Laws— The meeting with the exception of myself was as obsequious,
							as he was super-presidential, and when I stated in candour that the
							Committee of Manufactures had declared their concurrence in the opinion
							of the President that the reduction of duties should be prospective, and
							not to take effect till after the extinguishment of the debt, he said
							“then the Committee have given a very foolish and improvident pledge.”—
							Clay’s motive is obvious— He sees that next November at the choice of
							Presidential Electors, the great and irresistible Jackson electioneering
							cry, will be the extinction of the debt— By the instant repeal of all
							these duties, he wants to withdraw seven or eight Millions from the
							Treasury, and make it impossible to extinguish it by the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March 1833— It is an electioneering
							movement, and this was the secret of these Meetings as well as of the
							desperate effort, to take the whole business of the reduction of the
							Tariff into his own hands.— When I remarked that the Bill would meet
							with opposition from many who might favour all its provisions, but would
							be governed in their votes by political and party considerations, he
							said the subject should be treated without reference to any political
							considerations, and that he regretted there were any political
							considerations connected with himself— Other members present were very
							anxious for a continuance of the meetings, but he insisted upon an
							adjournment without day—which was carried; with an understanding however
							that another Meeting shall be called whenever it may be deemed
							advisable. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s objection to the
							continuance of the Meetings was that it would have the appearance of a
							permanent association to dictate measures to Congress— There was a
							proposition for holding weekly meetings, but it did not prevail— It was
							eleven O’Clock when I got home.</p>

									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pugh</persRef> a member of the

								ref="sullivan-george">George Sullivan</persRef>, and to my Son
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, which I gave him—
							At the house, before it met I asked <persRef ref="taylor-john">J. W.
								Taylor</persRef> if I had said any thing last Evening which could be
							offensive to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay— He said not a word—
							That the question might indeed be made on the other side— That Clay came
							to the meeting a little flustered. He had been dining abroad, and talked
							more freely than he would reflect upon with pleasure— But that I had
							said nothing but what I was in honour bound to say, after what had taken
							place in the Committee of Manufactures, and although he himself should
							incline to vote for the early repeal of the duties, he did not see that
							I could avoid making the explicit Statement that I did— I told him that
							I had committed myself and the Committee of Manufactures to the
							principle assumed by the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President</persRef>, before I knew that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Clay had opposite views—but that if I had known them perhaps
							they might and perhaps they might not have modified mine— I wished
							however, most earnestly wished to give no just cause of Offence to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay— I spoke also to <persRef
								ref="mccoy-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Coy</persRef>,
							and asked him to move the <pb n="340" type="ms"/>reference of the
							South-Carolina claim bill to the Committee of Claims— I thought it not
							exactly right to pass the bill, on the report of a Committee with a
							South-Carolina chairman, when there was a report four years back of
							another Committee against it. M’Coy said he wished I would ask some
							distinguished member of the house to make the motion; for he had said
							all he could against the claim; and he did not profess to be a Speaker—
							I spoke also to <persRef ref="reed-john">J. Reed</persRef> of a rather
							blunt remark that I made to him at table last Sunday, which I said I
							hoped he had not taken as unkind. He assured me that he had not. The
							house met—and after the Petitions and Resolutions were offered—<persRef
								ref="root-erastus">General Root</persRef> resumed his Speech upon
							the Land Resolution and continued it till the expiration of the hour
							without finishing— <persRef ref="doddridge-philip">M<hi

							moved a suspension of the rule which limits to an hour the discussion of

							are required for the suspension of the Rule— The Bill for the Settlement

								<persRef ref="mitchel-thomas2">T. R. Mitchell</persRef> of
							South-Carolina brought me a Richmond Enquirer, containing an Article

							are bitter enough against me already— I bless a merciful Creator that

							with respect— When I have spoken I have been listened to with attention,

							Mitchell asked me also who was the person mentioned by me as having been
							recommended to <persRef ref="washington-george">President

							Williams’s Letter, and to return it to him— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Blair is a Stranger to me; and in this communication
							manifests a confidence which I am bound to return with kindness and
							candour—but it increases the embarrassment and the delicacy of my
							situation. I began, but did not finish an answer to the Letter.</p>
