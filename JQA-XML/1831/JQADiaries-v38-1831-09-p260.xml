						<p><date>1. V. </date>Thursday.</p>
						<p>Rising at five O’Clock, I began as usual the day with reading three
							chapters of the Bible, and by the version of one Stanza of the 18<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm.— I then revised the two half
							sheets of proof from <persRef ref="eastburn-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Eastburn</persRef>, and after an early
							Breakfast went with <persRef ref="adams-isaac">I. H. Adams</persRef> to
							Cambridge— I found <persRef ref="boylston-ward2">Ward N.
								Boylston</persRef> at the door of <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2"
								>President Quincy’s</persRef> yard, and gave him the commendatory
							Letter that I had written for him; with directions to attend at 6
							O’Clock to-morrow Morning, to pass examination for his admission: and I
							told him I would attend in the course of to-morrow Evening to ascertain
							the result of his examination.— I then attended in the President’s Study
							the Meeting of the Judges of the <persRef ref="boylston-ward"
								>Boylston</persRef> prize Declamations— There were present <persRef
								ref="bowditch-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bowditch</persRef>, <persRef ref="ward-thomas">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="gray-francis">F. C. Gray</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="pickering-john">John Pickering</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="palfrey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Palfrey</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="jackson-charles">Judge Jackson</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="gould-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gould</persRef>—
							There were two juniors ten Seniors and two graduates of the year to
							contend for the prizes; of the last was <persRef ref="cruft-edward2"
								>Edward Cruft</persRef>, who I had observed had no part in the
							performances of yesterday— There was a printed Synopsis of the Rules for
							the management of this foundation, in which the Article designating the
							persons appointed to act as Judges, had totally omitted my name and all
							reference to me as one of them—though expressly appointed as one of
							them, by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston, in the foundation
							itself— I made this remark to President Quincy who noticed it to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Bowditch—and said it should be
							corrected.— The rules it seems were drawn up and printed, in 1826— At
							nine O’Clock we went in to the Meeting house—which was not full: but of
							the auditory four fifths were Ladies— The Declamations were all
							good—marked with the same merits and imperfections as the speaking of
							yesterday—excepting that this day there was no defect of Memory—of which
							there were yesterday several instances— The Selections were from
								<persRef ref="burke-edmund">Burke</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="sheridan-richard">Sheridan</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="webster-daniel">Webster</persRef>, <persRef ref="byron-george"
								>Byron</persRef>, and other, all modern Orators except <persRef
								ref="true-charles">True</persRef> of the Senior Class, who had taken
								<persRef ref="paul">Paul’s</persRef> Speech before <persRef
								ref="herodagrippa">Agrippa</persRef>, and who spoke it with so
							general an impression of superiority; that one of the first prizes was
							awarded to him by the judges at the first ballot— The other first prize
							on a second ballot was assigned to <persRef ref="simmons-george">George
								Frederick Simmons</persRef> a Senior— The three second prizes were
							taken by <persRef ref="bennett-joseph">Bennett</persRef> a
								Senior—<persRef ref="harrington-joseph">Harrington</persRef> a
							junior, and Edward Cruft, the graduate of the year— It appeared that
							during a part of his Collegiate term he has not improved his time to the
							best advantage— There were several ballotings for the second prizes— I
							did not return to the Meeting-house to hear the announcement of the
							prizes, but attended the Meeting of the ΦΒ.Κ. Society, where I found
							them discussing the Resolution offered by <persRef
								ref="bradford-gamaliel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bradford</persRef> to restore the Rule of requisite unanimity for
							the election of members— <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett</persRef> the President was
							justifying himself from an imputation of unfairness, in calling the
							Meetings in Boston, at which the changes in the Constitution had been
							made— There were about 140 members present, and D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bradford’s Resolution was carried, by a vote of at least
							100— A motion was then made and carried, for a Committee of nine to
							revise the Constitution again and report at the next Anniversary. A
							Resolution was also adopted, that hereafter no change of the
							Constitution or Laws should be made, but at an Anniversary Meeting. The
							Society then at Noon, went in procession to the Meeting house, where an
							Oration was delivered by <persRef ref="austin-james">James T.
								Austin</persRef>, upon the duties of the educated Men of our
							Country; and a Poem upon Liberality, by the <persRef ref="kent-benjamin"
									>Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Benjamin Kent</persRef>,
							Minister of Duxbury. The Oration was beautiful composition, <pb n="261"
								type="ms"/>and was equally well delivered. I was very much pleased
							with it, but there were some passages towards the close of it,
							encroached upon topics of theological controversy, which many thought
							not suited to the occasion, and which were offensive to a portion of the
							auditory, and to the orthodox members of the Society itself— They were
							not at-all displeasing to me, and I was surprised at hearing how much
							dissatisfaction they had given. It is a very important attribute the
							how—the where and the when truths may be told to the benefit of the
							hearer, and to the advantage of the Speaker.— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Kent’s Poem was Satirical and witty— It occasioned great
							good humour and laughter, much at the expense of the personages figuring
							at Washington— The Oration was two hours in the delivery— The poem about
							half an hour.— I walked to the Meeting house with my Classmate <persRef
								ref="packard-hezekiah">Packard</persRef>; but he did not return to
							the Chapel— After returning, the <persRef ref="edes-henry">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> Henry Edes</persRef> and the <persRef
								ref="crocker-nathan">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Crocker</persRef> were put in
							nomination for election as Members—both of Providence—M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edes as Minister of the Congregational,
							and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crocker of the Episcopal Church
							there— Edes was proposed at the request of the branch of the Society at
							Providence, according to a rule established by joint consent of all the
							Branches, he having been graduated at Cambridge. On two ballots for each
							of them there was a single black ball against each of them— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Edes was then proposed to be balloted for,
							at the next anniversary Meeting; and I proposed M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Crocker for the same further trial; for which I received the
							thanks of <persRef ref="wainwright-jonathan">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Wainwright</persRef> of New-York.— We then proceeded to
							dinner in the Hall, where about ninety members attended— There were of
							invited Strangers <persRef ref="king-john3">John A. King</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ray</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Legaré</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph Blunt</persRef>— The dinner was
							jovial, convivial, and festive— Everett the President punning
							occasionally upon names— After one song, and a half a dozen toasts I
							withdrew, and called at President Quincy’s where I found him with
							Company at dinner.— I told him I should come to-morrow evening to
							ascertain the success of Ward N. Boylston, upon his examination, and I
							promised to attend on Saturday morning at the Installation of <persRef
								ref="follen-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Follen</persRef>, as Professor of the German language and Literature— I
							then visited again <persRef ref="waterhouse-benjamin">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Waterhouse</persRef>, where I saw his
							Son, <persRef ref="waterhouse-andrew">Andrew</persRef>, lately returned
							from England. I came back to Boston at dusk of Evening, and with
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> attended a large
							Evening party at the <persRef ref="winthrop-thomas">Lieut<hi
									rend="superscript">t.</hi> Governor T. L. Winthrop’s</persRef>—
							There was a Supper to which I did not stay; but about ten came back to
							Charles’s house again thoroughly wearied.</p>

							no historical pictures worth any thing—and his not the best— His Miriam

							<pb n="262" type="ms"/>was also there— Except the interest naturally
							felt in the Portraits, by those to whom the Originals, many of them now

								<persRef ref="white-joseph;white-eleanor">M<hi rend="superscript"

							Florida, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and Miss Middleton. White

							the history of Cheves, checkered with vicissitudes which account for his
							present desperation.— I dined at <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> house, with <persRef ref="hopkinson-john"
								>Doctor John Hopkinson</persRef> and <persRef ref="davis-thomas2"
								>Thomas Davis</persRef>, son of <persRef ref="davis-isaac">Isaac

								ref="boylston-ward2">Ward</persRef>—waiting the decision upon the

						<p><date>3. V. </date>Saturday.— Cambridge— Medford— Boston— Quincy.</p>
						<p>I went to Cambridge again this Morning, and met <persRef

								ref="quincy-josiah2">President Quincy’s</persRef> study the

								ref="follen-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Follen</persRef>
							to the College Chapel where this Gentleman was installed as Professor of
							the German Language and Literature for five years— There were I think
							not thirty persons present, but of those <persRef ref="perkins-thomas2"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thomas H. Perkins</persRef>
							was one— The rest were chiefly Officers of the College— The President in
							a short Latin Address announced the appointment of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r </hi>Follen as Professor of the German language
							and Literature for five years, and M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Follen
							answering also in Latin <pb n="263" type="ms"/>declared his acceptance
							of the appointment.— The President then declared him Professor of the
							German language and Literature, and he delivered an inaugural discourse
							in English, upon the character and present condition of German
							Literature. It was well written and well spoken with little of the
							foreign accent. I returned to President Quincy’s, where I met Col<hi
								rend="superscript">l.</hi> T. H. Perkins; and soon took leave and
							went back to Boston— There I saw for a few minutes <persRef
								ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph Blunt</persRef>, who proposes to leave the
							City on Monday for New-York— I went in a Chaise with <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> to Medford, and dined at
								<persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter C.
								Brooks’s</persRef>—a family party, including <persRef
								ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H. Everett</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="gorham-benjamin">Benjamin Gorham</persRef>— Just before Sunset
							we left M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Brooks’s a shower then coming on
							and returned to Boston with a very heavy rain— At Charles’s house I
							found the last half sheet of the Eulogy, from <persRef
								ref="eastburn-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Eastburn</persRef>— The rain held up, and I came home in the
							Carriage to Quincy— But on the Neck I was obliged to get out, and mount
							the Coach-box, by the side of my driver— I got home between eight and
							nine in the Evening after an absence of four racketing days. I found all
							well at home, and <persRef ref="roberdeau-mary">Mary Roberdeau</persRef>
							with <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs
								</hi>Adams</persRef>; who went and met her at Dedham on Commencement

							agitation and bustle of the last four days has affected my health, and
							admonished me that these are Scenes in which I ought no more to mingle;
							but that retirement and Study present the state most suitable to my
							Condition.— The busy and stirring Scenes of youth and middle age, are
							not adapted to the decline beyond the bounds of three Score.— The
							boiling of my blood, has gathered it in two boils on my chin and
							cheek.</p>

							merciful and gracious; long suffering and abundant in goodness and
							truth. 7 Keeping Mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and
							transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty;
							visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third,
							and to the fourth generation.” and in the afternoon from Psalm 32.1.
							“Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. 2.
							Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in
							whose spirit there is no guile.” Both these were Discourses against the
							doctrines of one portion of the Universalists, who maintain a future
							state of existence, but none of punishment. If there were any absurdity
							which some theologian had not drawn from the Bible, it would be
							surprizing that a creed excluding all retribution hereafter should be
							erected upon the basis of the Gospel— Upon this point however a number
							of the Universalist preachers have seceded from the rest; and have
							published recently a declaration announcing themselves under the
							denomination of Universal Restorationists. After the morning service I
							went to <persRef key="adams-thomas">my Brothers</persRef>; and found him

							recover. His disease is a nervous fever, with involuntary convulsive
							motions of the limbs, and delirium— He has been several months
							declining, and almost deprived of sleep except when procured by opiates.
							But with this new type of the complaint he was suddenly seized in the
							Night of last Thursday— I saw him a few minutes in his bed— He knew me,
							and talked much, but as if perfectly possessed of his reason, and
							sensible of his own Condition; except that his discourse wandered from

							Since the publication of my 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July

							having already versified the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> This work
							comes on slowly but steadily— It exemplifies to me, what I have often

							like the other faculties of the mind strengthens itself by exercise— It
							is a virtue of the first order, and connected with the moral principle
							of undertaking none but honest ends, and with sagacity to select useful
							ones, is the certain indication of a great and good man— My own
							perseverance has been and is very imperfect— My purposes have been
							honest; so far as a mortal may bear testimony to his honesty before God—
							Honest, allowing for the involuntary self-deception of the heart— My
							judgment in selecting objects for persevering action, exceedingly
							defective, and that has been the great drawback to my success in
							life—and by success I do not mean my own individual prosperity; for that
							with great vicissitudes has been far beyond my deserts—but I mean the
							success of usefulness to my fellow Creatures— I have wasted my
							perseverance upon trifling objects—the result of which could have no
							operation on the happiness of mankind— One of the best objects of
							practical perseverance with which a young man should begin life, and
							pursue to its ends, is the keeping of a diary— This I began at twelve
							years of age—but I have failed of perseverance in keeping it, at least
							twenty times, and often for long and most important intervals— Few men
							however, have in this point had perseverance equal to mine; and they
							were assuredly useful men— But I have filled my journals with trash, and
							with every whimsey that passed across my mind— This has been an idle
							waste of time and a multiplication of books to no end and without end— I
							greatly doubt the usefulness of this end upon which I am now engaged; a

							hours. He is a member of the Senate in the State of New-York, and a
							zealous Anti-Mason. He brought me a Letter of Introduction from <persRef
								ref="tracy-albert">Albert H. Tracy</persRef>, also a New-York
							Senator and Anti-Mason.— They were coming together to Boston; but Tracy
							was taken sick at Norwich in Connecticut where <persRef
								ref="tracy-philemon">his father</persRef> resides, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">r </hi>Seward came on thence without him. They
							are both members of the Anti-Masonic Convention, to meet at Baltimore
							the 26<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this month, to nominate a
							Candidate for the Office of President of the United States; and have not
							made up their minds as to the person whom they will select— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Seward told me that <persRef
								ref="ward-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henry Dana
								Ward</persRef> of New-York, one of the most active Anti-masons in
							the Union, has corresponded with <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r </hi>Calhoun</persRef> and with <persRef
								ref="mclean-john2">judge John M’lean</persRef> to ascertain their
							Sentiments concerning Masonry, and whether they would accept a
							nomination for the Presidency from the Anti-masons— That both of them
							had in their answers declared themselves adverse to the Institution of
							Masonry—but M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Calhoun’s answers were
							otherwise unsatisfactory.— Judge M’lean had answered that he would
							accept the nomination if made. That with regard to the principles of his
							Administration if elected, he referred them to those upon which the
							General Post-Office had been administered, when under his charge.—
							Seward said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ward was satisfied with
							the result of this correspondence though there had been some
							awkwardness, by the publication of part of one of judge M’lean’s Letter.
								M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Ward was in favour of nominating him—
							That he found the Anti-masons here were desirous that I should be
							nominated; and that was the feeling of the Anti-masons in Rhode-Island—
							I asked him if he had seen <persRef ref="phelps-abner">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r </hi>Phelps</persRef>. He had, and had
							heard from him what had passed between the Anti-Masonic Committee and
							me.— I repeated to him that I had not the slightest desire for a
							nomination, nor for the Office of President of the United States itself.
							That I would not reject the nomination of the Convention if made, but my
							great concern was that they should agree upon their Candidate; and I was
							very apprehensive that they would not— And my special desire was that
							they should not for one instant adhere to me, if there was any other
							person upon whom they could unite—and I could probably be more useful to
							their cause if they should not nominate me than if they should.— He said
							he believed there was no danger of their disagreeing, with respect to
							the nomination of a Candidate— That after determining to take such a
							step, they would be all sufficiently impressed with the necessity of
							union to sustain their cause, to avoid splitting up into fragments. I
							lent M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Seward a pamphlet and two newspapers
							which he promised to return before the end of the week.— I wrote Letters
							to <persRef ref="lyon-isaac">Isaac S. Lyon</persRef> of Parsippany,
							Morris County New-Jersey, inclosing copies of my Oration and Eulogy—and
							to <persRef ref="spencer-ambrose">judge Spencer</persRef> at Albany. In
							the Evening I called for half an hour at <persRef key="adams-thomas">my
								brother’s</persRef>, and afterwards spent the Evening with a party
							at <persRef ref="miller-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Miller’s</persRef>— Neither <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> nor <persRef

							Jonathan Sewall during that period, upon subjects of morals and general
							Law, of which I wish much to obtain copies— There are one or two of them
							among my fathers papers, which sharpen the appetite for the rest.— I
							received several Letters, among which one from <persRef

								<persRef ref="southard-samuel">Samuel L. Southard</persRef>, which I
