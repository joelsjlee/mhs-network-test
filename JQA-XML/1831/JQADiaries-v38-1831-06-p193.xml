                        <p>The heat continues excessive. <persRef key="adams-charles2"
                                >Charles</persRef> did not go to Boston— I wrote a short Letter to
                            my Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef>; but was disqualified
                            by the weather into idleness— Read some pages in the English
                            Horticultural Transaction, and some pages of <persRef
                                ref="waterhouse-benjamin">Waterhouse’s</persRef> Junius— After
                            dinner, between 3 and 4 O’Clock I bathed with Charles and <persRef
                                ref="adams-isaac">Isaac</persRef> at the Creek, and swam from wharf
                            to wharf. It was the most inconvenient part of the day; but the tide
                            served at no other— Towards Evening I visited my Garden and Nursery—
                            Found two or three new Seedlings up, and at least twenty that were up
                            Sun struck dead. I have endeavoured to shelter many with shingles—

                            Notice had been left by T. Greenleaf, at the houses of <persRef

                            neither of them attended. We had Conversation upon the Report to be made
                            next Monday Evening to our Constituents, and M<hi rend="superscript"

                        <p>Fifth day of Super Summer heat. My Thermometer was before breakfast at
                            87— I went into Boston with <persRef key="adams-charles2"
                                >Charles</persRef>— While we were going the wind came round to the
                            Southeast, with a refreshing breeze. I paid visits to <persRef

                                ref="wells-john">John Welles</persRef>, <persRef

                                Davis’s</persRef>—but he was not at home— With M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Welles I had much and various
                            Conversation; and with judge Hall much upon Masonry and Anti-Masonry—
                            Hall has all the feelings upon him of a Mason, as they are now
                            manifesting themselves among thousands of People— He is ashamed of the
                            Institution and yet has a deep rooted attachment to it. He speaks of it
                            as an insignificant, harmless and foolish institution, but considers the
                            opposition to it as factious, hypocritical, and persecuting— He finds
                            among the Anti-Masons no characters for whom he entertains respect— He
                            denies that he ever took any oath which he considered as incompatible
                            with the Laws of the Land; but he does not know what the Oath of the
                            Royal Arch degree is; and does not deny that it has been correctly
                            stated in the Anti-Masonic Publications— He thinks the Anti-masonic
                            excitement mischievous, hypocritical and transient; and that it will
                            very shortly blow itself out— He thinks it the duty of every good
                            citizen to check the Spirit, and cool the effervescence of Anti-masonry;
                            and with that view approves the selection made by the Legislature of
                            Senators, last week, when in every instance they chose the Masonic
                            Candidate with the smaller number of primary votes in preference to the
                            Anti-Masonic Candidate with the larger number— From these opinions I
                            warmly dissented; till it was nearly half-past twelve, when I attended
                            in the Senate chamber of the Legislature, the Semi-annual Meeting of the
                            Overseers of Harvard University— I found the <persRef

                            Brookline reading a Report of a Committee— It was followed by several
                            others, which absorbed the time for about an hour; though the reading of
                            some of them was dispensed with— There were two Vacancies in the board
                            one, by the death of the late <persRef ref="parker-isaac">Chief-Justice

                            debatable presented by the Report of a Committee, that the Seat at the
                            board of the <persRef ref="holmes-abiel">Rev<hi rend="superscript"

                                type="ms"/>was vacated in consequence of his having ceased to be the
                            Pastor of the first Congregational Church at Cambridge— The Committee
                            consisted of <persRef ref="austin-james">James T. Austin</persRef>,
                                <persRef ref="frothingham-nathaniel">N. L. Frothingham</persRef> and

                                Codman</persRef> of Dorchester, who dissented from the Report, and
                            requested that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holmes who was present
                            might be heard in defence of his right to his Seat— As there was not
                            time for this the question upon the acceptance of the Report was
                            postponed to the next Semi-annual Meeting of the Board, with an order in
                            the mean time to print the Report. It was past two, when the Meeting
                            adjourned— I met there a number of my old acquaintance and friends,
                            among whom were <persRef ref="davis-john">Judge Davis</persRef> and
                                <persRef ref="gray-thomas2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Gray</persRef> of Jamaica Plains: who had received my Letter
                            enclosing the versions of the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and
                                104<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalms, upon which he made some
                            remarks— Judge Davis mentioned to me his wish that I would deliver a
                            Discourse to the Academy of Arts and Sciences— While I was President of
                            the United States, the Academy passed a vote requesting me to deliver a
                            discourse, which was then impossible. In my answer I intimated that
                            although I could not then, I might hereafter comply with their request—
                            But at the very first Meeting of the Academy after I ceased to be
                            President of the United States, they chose <persRef
                                ref="bowditch-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Bowditch</persRef> for their President— I considered their choice as
                            a superseding of their prior request to their President to discourse to
                            them; and do not think it proper for me to remind them of that request
                            or of my intimation in answer to it. I returned with Charles to Quincy
                            to dine— After dinner visit to my Garden and Nursery— Two new Seedlings—
                            The Sun continues his ravages, upon those already up— <persRef

                            being on a party to Nantasket beach— The members here all urged me to
                            deliver the Address, to which I stated my very strong objections—but
                            said that if it could be ascertained to have been the wish of those who
                            appointed the Committee, I would undertake it rather than disappoint the
                            desires of the Inhabitants of my native place— M<hi rend="superscript"

                            should decline delivering the Address, he should be for reporting that
                            the celebration would not be expedient.</p>

                        <p>The day was cooler than those which have preceded— Morning fog, followed
                            by a clear sky, and a Westerly wind in the afternoon. <persRef
                                ref="spear-daniel">Deacon Spear</persRef> came with a message from
                                <persRef ref="webb-nancy">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
                                Webb</persRef>, the widow of <persRef ref="webb-jonathan">Deacon
                                Webb</persRef>, living in Boston; upon which I promised to write to
                                <persRef ref="greenleaf-william">W. C. Greenleaf</persRef> at
                            Washington—which I did— The Deacon told <unclear>me</unclear> that he
                            was sorry I had attended the Anti-masonic Convention at Boston; and said
                            I had told him last Fall that I was not Anti-Masonic— I told him I had
                            endeavoured to avoid taking any part in the controversy, and still
                            wished to keep free from it; but that I thought the Masons themselves
                            ought to abolish their Oaths their Secrets, their penalties, and their
                            pageantries. The Deacon is a Mason and was displaced as one of the
                            Selectmen, on that account— He complained bitterly that the Selectmen of
                            this Town, have excluded from the list whence the Jurors are taken, all
                            Freemasons, among whom are some of the most respectable Citizens—while
                            they have admitted many of far inferior characters— As to the Oaths of
                            Free Masons, he is only a Master Mason, and has taken no such Oath as
                            that of the Royal Arch degree has been reported to be. And <persRef
                                ref="harris-thaddeus">Doctor Harris</persRef> who is a Royal Arch
                            Mason tells him that no such Oath is taken— I said that if so there
                            ought to be an open declaration of the order to that effect— But the
                            truth is that <pb n="195" type="ms"/>the most obnoxious part of the
                            Royal Arch Oath, is administered in some lodges, and not in others—
                                <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> brought me out from

                            would deliver an Address to them— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey
                            wished for an immediate answer, and I wrote to him, that I had
                            engagements for the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July here at
                            Quincy, which would not admit of my delivering an Address in Boston—
                            After dinner I bathed and swam at the Creek, with <persRef

                            that I must cause the Stones to be taken away before next Monday— Curtis
                            said this would be impossible, and undertook to satisfy <persRef ref="u"

                            Land for a house lot, on my Penn’s Hill Orchard, at the price which I

                            Whitney asked me if I would go as a member from his Parish of the

                            O’Clock, the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month— I
                            mentioned to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney the proposal for
                            celebrating the Anniversary of our National Independence, and read to

                            if he thought the Choir of Singers would undertake it— He said that they

                            a Nursery than mine— He has a large bed, with a great variety of

                            the visits of their friends. We had received earnest invitations but
                            could not go. At noon I took a light dinner, and at two O’Clock I rode
                            to <persRef ref="curtis-noah">Noah Curtis’s</persRef> and there met
                                <persRef ref="humphreys-lemuel">Lemuel Humphrey</persRef> of
                            Weymouth, with whom we surveyed and laid out a half Acre of ground upon
                            my Penn’s Hill lot, which I have agreed to sell, to <persRef
                                ref="hubbard-charles">Charles Hobart</persRef>, and upon which he
                            intends to build a house— I plucked up and brought home with me four
                            seedling Apple trees which were growing on the side of the high way and
                            which I planted in my Garden. I had occupied the morning chiefly in
                            writing— On my return home I found <persRef ref="phelps-abner">D<hi

                                Farnsworth</persRef>, who came as a deputation from the Anti-Masons,
                            who said that being informed the Inhabitants of Quincy proposed to
                            celebrate the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July, at which time I
                            was to deliver an Address to them, it was the wish of their Constituents
                            that the Inhabitants of Quincy and I also should consent to transfer
                            this celebration to the Old South Church at Boston— I told them it had
                            not yet been determined that there should be a celebration of the day at
                            Quincy— That a Committee had been chosen by a portion of the Inhabitants
                            to report upon the expediency of it, and in that contingency to procure
                            an Orator— I was a member of that Committee and they were to make Report
                            this Evening but it would not be definitive— The Committee would request
                            an adjournment of the Meeting for a final determination— Some of the
                            members of the Committee had intimated a wish that I should deliver the
                            Address, and I had consented if it should be the desire of the
                            Inhabitants of the Town and my health should permit— But I doubted
                            whether it would be agreeable to them, to transfer the celebration to
                            Boston; and for myself, as <pb n="197" type="ms"/>I wished to deal with
                            them in perfect candour I should be unwilling to address the Anti-Masons
                            on the fourth of July— On that day it would be my wish to discard all
                            feelings and acts of a partial character— Besides my participation in
                            all the Sentiments appropriate to that day I had special motives of deep
                            solemnity connected with it, from its being also the anniversary of
                                <persRef key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> death— My opinions
                            concurred with those of the Anti-Masons, so far as to believe that the
                            Institution of Free-Masons ought to be abolished, or its obnoxious
                            principles discarded— But this was now a party question, and subject of
                            very angry controversy. If it should be necessary for me to take part
                            publicly in this controversy, I should prefer any other day for putting
                            on the harness to the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July— D<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Phelps then expressed himself with much
                            bitterness against the principles of Masonry; but finally said he had
                            not expected that I should comply with their request— M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r.</hi> Farnsworth said that many of them would
                            be disappointed— <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r</hi> Thomas Greenleaf</persRef> afterwards called, and I
                            requested him to make the Report from the Committee; thinking it
                            advisable after the visit from the Anti-masonic deputation to avoid
                            attending the Meeting this Evening— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Greenleaf promised to attend, and make the Report, and said he would
                            call here afterwards and inform me of the result; but he did not come
                            again this Evening.</p>

                            dinner time, the hours are still so much absorbed that I make no

                            biography or in my agricultural enquiries and dendrology— My planting
                            experiments have proven so unsuccessful, and the difficulties of raising
                            trees from the seed thicken so upon me that my wisest course would be to
                            abandon my plantations to their fate— On the contrary; disappointment
                            only stimulates— The wild Strawberry Plants which I took up from the

                            and set out in the Garden, are growing, and throwing out runners with
                            great luxuriance, but have not blossomed. <persRef

                            it; one of them having on it a Strawberry nearly ripe: I cup them up
                            from the Soil, with the ground in which their Roots were; and set them
                            out in the Garden; in the same bed with the other wild Strawberries. I
                            set out also a wild cherry seedling which I had plucked up with the
                            root— By varying, and multiplying my experiments I still hope that some
                            of them may succeed— The Volume lent me by <persRef

                            from the frost. I have nothing that grows like the Elms and the English
                            Oaks at the bottom of the Garden—but the Oak is of the tribe which

                            to work. I am writing a third discourse upon the Declaration of
                            Independence—to be delivered on the next fourth of July, to the
                            Inhabitants of Quincy, if they should hold the proposed celebration: and
                            if not, for use hereafter— To avoid repetitions of what I have said
                            before upon the same Subject, is one of the difficulties of my present
                            task. As I proceed, I perceive the effect of age upon the Style of
                            composition. I know not that the influence of age upon Style has ever

                            scruple, a thought which has ever three parts coward, then comes in and
                            mutters of consequences— Shall I speak my thoughts or shall the fear of
                            man deter me? I was bolder in youth than now— I had then consequences
                            only to myself to dread— Others are now made responsible for my words
                            and deeds— I wrote this morning what I must blot out, and I shall be
                            ashamed of myself for doing so— <persRef ref="spear-daniel">Deacon

                            repent for we were approaching to the end of the seven years of plenty.
                            This was the fourth successive Season of superabundant crops, and now
                            the grass was so thick that it would be good for nothing— Even last year
                            he knew a man who was obliged to pay for having the grass cut down and
                            carried away from his Salt Meadow— With all this my seedlings in the
                            garden, are perishing by the heat of the Sun, and for want of rain— I
                            walked down to Mount Wollaston— Three fourths of my apple-hills are yet
                            barren— The Chesnut trees have come up in the border beyond expectation.
                            The Oaks are far less numerous— The Shagbarks very few, but more of them
                            may be expected. They almost all look healthy, though surrounded and
                            overshadowed by thick grass— This is now their only preservation from
                            the Sun, and I hope will prove effective through the Summer. My layers
                            of Straw in the garden have in a great measure failed— They smother the

                                ref="adams-ann">his wife</persRef> were here in the Evening— I read
                            this afternoon in the practical Planter, the <persRef
                                ref="cruickshank-thomas">author</persRef> of which is a Forester, of
                            the <persRef ref="duff-james">Earl of Fife</persRef> in Scotland— It is
                            evident from this book that planting is as much an Art as that of
                            gardening, but it leaves me little to expect from my Plantations— The
                            book begins with introductory remarks upon the advantages of planting;
                            and errors generally committed in the cultivation of wood— As to the
                            advantages of planting, I have so long been convinced of them that no
                            argument was necessary for me— The neglect of it, as far as I know more
                            universal here than in Scotland— We are still occupied here with the
                            extirpation much more than with the cultivation of wood— In treating of
                            the errors in this cultivation the first principle laid down is that
                            Nothing is more essential to success in planting, than a proper
                            adaptation of Trees to the Soil— The second is to adapt the cultivation
                            to the Nature of the Tree— The third is economy of expence— Then pruning
                            and thinning—but he cautions especially against pruning the fir— Advises
                            the Scotch planters not too implicitly to trust more Southern writers
                            upon planting and contests some of the directions given by <persRef
                                ref="pontey-william">Pontey</persRef> and in <persRef
                                ref="loudon-john">Loudon’s</persRef> Encyclopaedia of gardening—
                            Loudon for instance says that the seeds of the Spruce, Larch and Scots
                            fir should be covered half an inch deep. He says a quarter of an inch is
                            amply sufficient. And adds that the Seeds of every kind of trees should
                                <pb n="199" type="ms"/>be covered much less sparingly in proportion
                            to their size than those of kitchen vegetables. He also earnestly
                            dissuades from forcing of Earth, in the Nursery—that is from bringing
                            mould from a distance to enrich the soil— This in a Nursery Should be
                            land suitable for the production of a crop of Corn; and it is a
                            fundamental rule that young trees should be brought up in a Nursery as
                            hardy as possible— The first Chapter is a list of the Trees whose
                            culture is described in the work— There are 19. all forest trees—but the
                            Chesnut and Hazel may be reckoned also among the fruit Trees— The second
                            Chapter Treats of the Nursery and saving of Seeds.</p>

                        <p>I went to Boston this Morning with <persRef key="adams-charles2"
                                >Charles</persRef>, and called at the lodgings of <persRef

                                Shepherd</persRef>; but he was gone to New-York— Then at <persRef
                                ref="davis-john">judge Davis’s</persRef>, and sat an hour in
                            conversation with him. He shewed me a Portrait of <persRef
                                ref="prince-thomas">Prince</persRef> the Chronologist; and spoke of
                            the Diplomatic Compilation of the Correspondence of our Ministers abroad
                            during the Revolutionary War, recently published by <persRef
                                ref="sparks-jared">Jared Sparks</persRef>— I spoke with indignation
                            of Sparks’s breach of trust in polluting this publication with his own
                            passions and prejudices in the form of Notes; paltering with truth; and
                            distorting facts to suit his own views— Judge Davis Spoke also of the
                            one year’s annuity upon one of <persRef ref="boylston-ward">W. N.
                                Boylston’s</persRef> benefactions to Harvard College, which the
                            Judge says was not paid, though M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston
                            thought it was: and for which the judge as Treasurer of the College has
                            been held responsible. I went next to Charles’s Office, and there met
                                <persRef ref="degrand-peter">P. P. F. Degrand</persRef>: who has
                            made the arrangements for a loan which I propose to make for six Months
                            from the 21<hi rend="superscript">st.</hi> of this Month— <persRef

                                Fuller</persRef> came afterwards to the Office, and it was to meet
                            him at his request that I went to the City— He said that since my
                            attendance at the Antimasonic Convention in Boston, he had been
                            questioned how far it might be considered as pledging me in opposition
                            to the Election of <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >r.</hi> Clay</persRef> as President of the United States— I
                            said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay’s election did not enter
                            into my Consideration at all as connected with this subject— I did not
                            propose to take any part in the next Presidential Election— I did not
                            know whether M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay would be supported by
                            the Anti-Masons or not— They were to hold a Convention at Baltimore next
                            September to determine upon this question— If they should fix upon
                            another Candidate than M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, it would be
                            an incident in no wise essential to the principle— The dissolution of
                            the Masonic Institution in the United States, I believe to be vastly
                            more important to us and our Posterity, than the question whether M<hi

                                >General Jackson</persRef> shall be the President chosen at the next
                            Election— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller said he was satisfied
                            with this answer— He avowed that for himself he had no partiality in
                            favour of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and intimated that his
                            preference was for <persRef ref="mclean-john2">Judge M’lean</persRef> of
                            Ohio—but that others favoured <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi

                            Boston, to deliver an Address to them on the 4<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> of July which I had declined—of which he said he was glad:
                            but he asked if I had any objection to the publication of that part of
                            my Letter to him which expressed the opinion that the Institution ought
                            to be dissolved; or to discard their Secrets, Oaths, Penalties and
                            Pageantries— I declined for the present the publication of any part of
                            my Letter— Our conversation was interrupted, and I had not the
                            opportunity to say much of what I intended— <persRef

                            indicating no prospect of his fidelity to his trust. He spoke of some
                            other transactions relating to the Execution of W. N. Boylston’s Will,
                            and said <persRef ref="boylston-john">John Boylston</persRef> had given
                            up the large farm at Princeton which had now a Tenant at the halves— I
                            proposed to him to pay to the Treasurer of Harvard College the year’s
                            Annuity, which appears to be in arrear, which he said he <pb n="200"
                                type="ms"/>he would do— He thought a new account might be settled
                            with the <persRef ref="leland-sherman">judge of Probate</persRef> next
                            August; and that <persRef ref="boylston-ward2">Ward Boylston</persRef>
                            would be prepared to enter at the University this year— I returned with
                            Charles to Quincy to dine— The heat of the weather excessive. In the

                                ref="hubbard-charles">Charles Hobart</persRef> came for his deed— I
                            called on <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">Thomas Greenleaf</persRef> and
                            at my request he came to my house and took the acknowledgment of
                                <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> and myself—
                            I delivered the Deed, and received payment— The drought and heat
                            continue; but as the Spring tide of the new Moon came in, it brought
                            with it an easterly breeze which refreshed and cooled the atmosphere— I
                            brought over from the Hills two plants of the wild Strawberry, and set
                            them out in my garden; and planted a dozen Strawberries with the seeds,
                            in white Pot N. 1— My new seedlings in the Nursery perish daily— All the
                            pears and most of the Apples are gone. The Horse Chesnuts shrink up— The
                            peaches and Wild Cherries bear the Sun apparently without suffering— A
                            new tree shewed itself in the Garden— And one or two in the Nursery— My
                            beetle-bitten grey Oak, is throwing out new shoots— In the chapter on
                            the Nursery my practical Planter recommends an average soil; not much
                            exposed—not at all sheltered says that Seedlings must attain a certain
                            size to stand the winter— That covering with beds of Straw always
                            damages the Plants; and that in thin Soils the drought of Summer causes
                            them to go off by thousands soon after they make their appearance—
                            Perennial weeds must be completely eradicated. It should be sown with
                            Turneps— Moderately manured with dung, and also with lime— The ground
                            should be trenched and ridged before Winter: and sown or planted
                            generally in March or April— Transplantation should also be performed in
                            the Spring; before the plants begin to vegetate— Cuttings should be
                            planted in February or earlier— Weeding should be performed by the hand,
                            and all young trees should be pruned. Seeds should not be gathered till
                            perfectly ripe— The Seeds of Oak and beech are seldom saved. The third
                            Chapter is upon the purchasing of Plants— The fourth on the qualities of
                            the soil suited to the varieties of forest trees— Strong clay is the
                            best Soil for Oaks—</p>

                                Parkman</persRef> of Boston, from Exodus 20.5. “For I, the Lord thy
                            God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
                            children unto the third and fourth Generation, of them that hate me; 6.
                            and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my
                            Commandments[”]— The attribution of human Passions, and especially of so
                            vicious a Passion as Jealousy, to the <pb n="201" type="ms"/>Creator of
                            the world, and the Justice of the declaration that the iniquity of the
                            fathers shall be visited upon the children to the third and fourth
                            Generation, are difficulties in this text which M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Parkman endeavoured to resolve— With regard to the
                            ascription of Jealousy to God, he considered it as only an accommodation
                            of the language to the understanding of men; and he shewed first that
                            the visitation of the iniquity of Parents upon their posterity was
                            conformable to all the Analogies of Nature—but secondly that the Law
                            itself was adapted to the circumstances of the Hebrew Nation at that
                            time— Not universal to all Mankind—nor even permanently to the <persRef
                                ref="moses">Mosaic</persRef> dispensation itself. In proof of which
                            he cited the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> chapter of <persRef
                                ref="ezekiel">Ezekiel</persRef>; and especially the 20<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> verse— “The Soul that sinneth it shall
                            die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall
                            the father bear the iniquity of the Son: the righteousness of the
                            righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be
                            upon him”— This is clear and explicit; and the whole chapter is a minute
                            developement of the principle— But the book of Ezekiel, was held of
                            doubtful authenticity by the Jews on account of this very chapter— That
                            in the dispensations of Providence children almost universally do suffer
                            for the iniquity of the fathers is certain— There is perhaps one way of
                            reconciling the precept of the Mosaic Law, with the apparently
                            contradictory exposition of the prophet. The promise of exemption to the
                            child from punishment for the iniquity of the father, is an condition
                            not only that he shall forsake the Sin of his father: but shall atone
                            for it by his own righteousness— In the 33<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
                            chapter of Ezekiel, the same promise of pardon and exemption from
                            punishment is made to the wicked man himself, on condition of his
                            turning from his iniquity by righteousness— This is the Law of Justice
                            and of Mercy— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parkman dined with us—and

                            Evening. He is going to-morrow for New-York and West Point— Reading the
                            Practical Planter— Chapter 5. contains directions for ascertaining the
                            Quality of waste Land from the Nature of the wild Plants that grow upon
                            it— These directions are all adapted to the Soil of Scotland; and their
                            exemplifications can be of no possible use to us here. The grey moss,
                            benty grass, heath, furze and broom, fern and jumper are most if not all
                            of them Strangers here; but the principle is to be observed, and the
                            plantation of Trees must always be adapted to the nature of the Soil
                            where they are to grow. All needle wood, and the Oak is suited to dry
                            land— The Ash, beech and elm, require a rich soil. Many Mineral
                            productions are unfavourable to the growth of timber, and few kinds of
                            trees will grow where Slate abounds. Freestone near the surface is
                            inimical to the production of wood—but not limestone, or granite—
                            Chapter 6. is on the planting of waste Land— Section 1. Preparation of
                            the ground for the reception of the Plants.— Enclosing—ditching—
                            Sometimes ploughing— Section 2 Of the Age which the different kinds of

                            Larches, and Spruce should be two years old. But the deciduous trees
                            Ash, beech, elm and plane should be two years in the seed bed, and then
                            two <pb n="202" type="ms"/>years in the Nursery, before removal— Oaks
                            should never be transplanted— Description of the two modes of planting
                            by Pitting and notching— Section 3. Season of planting—distances and
                            order of Plants— Roads in Plantations— Planting should be done from the
                            middle of October to the middle of March— Autumnal planting not till the
                            wood is ripened; and Spring planting not after the buds begin to swell—
                            Trees should be planted thick— Three or four thousand to an Acre—to
                            shelter, and support one another, and to be thinned, when eight or ten
                            years old, but deciduous trees to remain till large in the Nursery
                            should be from sixteen to twenty-five or thirty feet asunder, with firs
                            between them for Nurses— Trees should not be planted in straight lines;
                            the appearance of which is stiff and formal: and it makes a thoroughfare
                            for the wind between the rows— Roads, not straight should give access to
                            every part of the Plantation— Section 4. Supplementary Remarks— Shelter
                            for deciduous trees. Firs recommended—to be planted several years before

                            turbulence of the City; and took a house in the Country— Within three
                            days a Pigeon deserted or was stolen from his dove-cote [“]et me voila
                            au des espoir pour la perte d’un Pigeon”— So said the philosopher S<hi
                                rend="superscript">t.</hi> Evremont, and quickly moved back to the
                            City, so that if he must be unhappy; the causes of his distress might
                            have some substance and dignity— This Story made a deep impression upon
                            my mind when I read it; but there are little cares and anxieties in the
                            City as well as in the Country; and great ones in the Country as well as
                            in the City— My plantations are a source of amusement to me; and to my
                            friends at my expense— They afford me exercise, and contribute to my
                            health—but they absorb an unreasonable portion of my time, and engage
                            too much of my sensibility— I finished this day the first writing of my
                            proposed Address for the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July with a
                            mortified conviction of its inferiority to both my former discourses on
                            the same occasion— I feel the decay of all my Powers— Imagination,
                            Memory, and even Judgment— It is the course of Nature, and the Will of
                            Heaven— Why should I complain? I wrote also to my Son <persRef
                                key="adams-john2">John</persRef>, and read in the Practical Planter—
                            Chapter 7. on the Management of Woods— Section 1. Deciduous trees should
                            be pruned; but not the fir or the Larch— <persRef ref="pontey-william"
                                >Pontey</persRef> holds that firs should be pruned; a great error.
                            Of other trees all the lateral branches should be cropped which threaten
                            to outgrow the leader and no others— Pruning should be repeated every
                            two years, while the tree is growing, but no longer— Section 2.
                            Thinning— This must be commenced as soon as the branches of the Trees
                            begin to interfere with one another. They must be planted thick to yield
                            mutual shelter, and gradually thinned to avoid mutual collision. The
                            thinning and pruning should be effected while the plants and branches
                            are young and tender to avoid the use of the Saw. Chapter 8. on the
                            culture and management of the Oak— This is the kernel of the whole work.
                            Section 1. is an argument to refute the prevailing opinion that the Soil
                            and Climate of Scotland are not suited to the production of the Oak— His
                            main position is that in <pb n="203" type="ms"/>former Ages the Oak did
                            grow in great profusion without cultivation, and he attributes to
                            defective cultivation, all the failures to raise it in modern times—
                            Section 2. is on the defects and errors of the common method of
                            propagating Oak— The first of which is transplanting it at-all— It is a
                            tap-rooted plant, and all such inevitably suffer by transplantation— The
                            second is the mode of planting and transplanting the Oak, in Scotland
                            which is described and censured— The third is neglect of thinning and
                            pruning— Section 3. describes the new Method of rearing Oak invented by
                            the author of the book—of which more hereafter.</p>

                            was here after dinner— The rain has brought up a forest of weeds in my
                            Nursery; but little relief to my Seedlings; and the appearance of only
                            two or three new ones— I planted a few cherry Stones, of the Kentish
                            Cherry now in the Garden; and placed them between the Suckers taken up
                            and set out from my Mazzard below— There are now in the garden and
                            Nursery six different Seedling trees up, which I do not know— Rosebugs,
                            Slugworms and Caterpillars depredate upon the leaves of many. The
                            Peaches and Wild-Cherries have best stood the ordeal of the Sun beam. My
                            wild Strawberries grow and spread profusely but put forth no blossom.

                            new method of rearing Oak— His first instruction is to provide shelter
                            Scots firs and Larches two years old to be planted, four feet from each
                            other, four thousand to an Acre— To grow from four to seven years till
                            four feet high, when they will shelter every thing lower than
                            themselves— The acorns should be planted in patches two feet square,
                            notched round with a spade; trenched a foot deep, throwing out all large
                            Stones. The patches ten feet distance from each other or 500 to a scots
                            acre—one spade full of slaked lime to be put upon each patch—dig it in
                            leveling the ground, and plant five Acorns on each patch, one at the
                            centre, and four at the four Corners—all acorns that sink in water.
                            Cover them one inch deep with earth. Last week in March, or beginning of
                            April— Two years after take up all the supernumerary seedlings, leaving
                            one Oak to each patch— Thin the Oaks at five years old, and take away
                            all overshadowing Nurses— Section 4. Account of experiments illustrative
                            of this method of raising Oaks— These experiments were made from 1821.
                            to 1825. with Acorns and transplanted Seedlings, and in beds limed and
                            unlimed. The acorns in limed beds were the most thrifty— Nothing is more
                            prejudicial to the growth of trees in general than much exposure Section
                            5. Succession crops of Oak, and recovering young sickly trees— When the
                            Nurses are all cut down, the 500 Oaks to an Acre should be thinn’d down
                            to 100— When Oaks are cut down care should be taken to leave the stumps
                            or Stools in such order that they may produce new shoots: which two or
                            three years after should be thinn’d to four or six shoots for each
                            Stool— Pruning should be performed once every two years— Shoots from
                            Oak-Stools trained for timber are called wavers. More than one stem or
                            bole to each Stool should not be encouraged— Oak coppice requires
                            shelter as much as the Seedlings; as much as it should be left standing
                            as is necessary for that purpose— To recover unthrifty Oaks they should
                            be headed down, between January and March to within one inch of the
                            ground. Hide bound trees should have their bark slit up and down and
                            along the principal branches— Lime is salutary to revive all deciduous
                            trees.</p>

                            Method of giving immediate effect to wood; that is of transplanting
                            large Trees— The practical directions are 1. Selection of Subjects for
                            removal. 2. Preparation of the soil for their reception— 3. Preparation
                            of the Trees previous to removal. 4. Taking up and transportation of the
                            Trees. 5. Planting of them in their new Situations. 6. After-management—
                            Sir Henry Steuart never props or supports a tree after removal— He has
                            not had one blown down in the course of 30 years, and he loses by death
                            not more than one in from forty to forty-five— Yet I cannot believe that

                            Greenleaf</persRef>— Read the Practical Planter, Chapter 12. Hints for
                            giving quick effect to wood, in the Pleasure grounds of Gentlemen’s
                            Seats and Villa’s— That is of raising trees for ornament round a house,
                            in a very short time— 1. To plant trees of quick growth— Poplars,
                            Willows, Birch, Mountain Ash— Laburnum, Willows and Poplars rise to 25
                            or 30 feet in 10 or 12 years— Birch to 15 or 20.— 2. To plant none but
                            choice and thrifty trees— None that have stood more than four years in
                            the Nursery line. Oaks should never be transplanted— 3. Preparation of
                            ground. In planting with a view to profit, let the ground remain in its
                            original state, or nearly so, to avoid both expense, and deteriorating
                            the quality of the wood, which in many species of Trees will happen if
                            their growth be greatly accelerated by artificial means— But in planting
                            for Ornament, plough trench and manure— Ashes, Lime, Street dung and
                            mixing of Soils— The Trees should be planted at any time between
                            November and March. Regularity of distance not material. Oak— Elm— Ash
                            30 feet from each other; but less, according to the depth of the Soil.
                            Straight lines should be avoided, except on the sides of Avenues. Rows
                            give easy admittance to the wind; an evil of the first magnitude— Trees
                            of different kinds should be intermixed, with attention to the different
                            shades of foliage— The shape and bearing of the Trees is worthy of
                            regard—and <pb n="206" type="ms"/>above all things keep the Plantation
                            clear of Cattle, Sheep, Nurses and Children, weeds and Schoolboys— For
                            five or six years there should be five or six hoeings every Summer. Dry
                            weather should be chosen for hoeing, and stirring the ground. The trees
                            must not be touched. Pruning should be gradual and sparing— Thinning

                            discourse for the 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July— Why is it
                            that I feel more anxiety and more apprehension of failure on this
                            occasion than I ever did in youth, when success was important to my
                            standing in the world, and to the hopes of a long anticipated futurity
                            upon Earth? Success or failure is now of little consequence to me, who
                            have and can have but a few days to live— I fear the exhibition of
                            faculties in decay— I fear a severity of judgment of the hearers, and
                            yet more of after readers— I experienced this on my second 4<hi

                            ten years since at the Meridian of my Life— I shall now assail Passions
                            and Prejudices as earnestly as then, deeming it now as I deem’d it then
                            my duty—but I cannot now flatter myself that what I shall say will be
                            received even with so much indulgence— I intended to have been short;
                            but I have written more than the length of any Oration heretofore
                            delivered by me, my subject spreads upon me as I proceed, and I find
                            myself unwilling to abridge— The Style of my first draught is so plain,

                            audacious and tormenting. Mosquitos the same— Excessively addicted to
                            animal food, and blood thirstier than wolves or Tygers— There has been
                            already more Summer-heat than in the whole of the last Season or of the
                            year before, and the multiplication of Insects has been proportional to
                            the heat— <persRef ref="holmes-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John

                            I made this day some additions, and should have made more curtailments—
                            Visited twice my Garden and Nursery; but having forbidden myself to go
                            into them before dinner, I am now compelled to make my visit to them
                            short and fruitless— The Seedlings have now generally ceased to come up,

                        <p>I gave my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> a Letter of
                            Attorney to transfer fifty Shares of New-England Insurance Company Stock
                            as collateral security for a Note to the American Insurance Company in

                            a half per Cent a year. The Note signed by me, and the Letter of
                            Attorney Charles took to Boston, made the transfer, and received the
                            money, which he deposited in the Branch Bank to the credit of my Son
                                <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> whom I have authorized to
                            draw for that amount to take up the Note to the Union Bank at

                            authorising him to draw for the money on the Branch Bank at Boston. I
                            bathed and swam at the Creek with <persRef ref="adams-isaac"
                                >Isaac</persRef> at ten, and the rest of the morning was busy with
                            my revisal— The day was showery with distant Thunder and oppressively
                            sultry— After dinner I finished reading <persRef
                                ref="cruickshank-thomas">Cruickshank’s</persRef> Practical Planter—
                            Chapter 13. upon the properties and uses of timber, enumerates
                            successively all the forest trees and specifies the uses to which each
                            of them is usually appropriated— There are twenty kinds— Alder, Ash,
                            Balm of Gilead, Beech, Birch, Chesnut, Elm, Fir, Hazel, Hawthorn, Holly,
                            Laburnum, Larch, Lime, Oak, Pine, Plane, Poplar, Spruce and Willow— Of
                            several of these there are numerous varieties, and they do not include
                            the Maples Tulip Trees, Locusts or Walnuts of all which we have many.—
                            There is an Appendix to the Book, containing Remarks upon draining and
                            fencing; and Tables of the prices of forest-trees, and of Evergreen and
                            flowering shrubs— The measurement of Timber, and shewing the number of
                            trees that can be planted upon an Acre. On the whole the book has given
                            me much information concerning the plantation of forest trees, but has
                            demonstrated to me that all I have done hitherto upon that project has
                            been waste of time and of labour. To take five years of preparation to
                            provide a shelter for my Acorns, would bring me to the probable
                            termination of my Life, and there is no one to come after me who would
                            pursue my undertaking with that Spirit which would be essential to its
                            success— I must resign the hope of raising a forest at Mount Wollaston,
                            and be prepared to see all the trees which have come up so well,
                            successively perish— Of the Orchard there is yet some hope.</p>

                                    >r</hi> Gourgas</persRef> was here in the Evening— I was engaged
                            all day upon the revisal of my lengthening discourse— Towards Evening I
                            went with Isaac H. Adams to my grounds over the brook North of my
                            house—plucked up six bearing Plants of Strawberry Vines, which we
                            brought and set out in my Nursery. I took the Plants with the
                            Strawberries upon them to be sure of having bearers— Nothing on Earth
                            ever spread more luxuriantly <pb n="208" type="ms"/>than the six roots
                            which I transplanted from near the Railway last October, into the
                            Garden— They are rapidly spreading over the whole bed where they were
                            set out; but they have not blossomed, and I am strongly suspicious will
                            prove no better than barren weeds, which I shall have more trouble to
                            eradicate than I have had to set them out. The straw which I some time
                            since laid down to protect the seedling fruit trees from the Sun, has
                            stifled almost all of them— I have taken most of it away to save those
                            yet remaining alive— <persRef ref="farrar-isaac">Farrar</persRef> hoed
                            up the weeds in the Nursery; and with the weeds uprooted several of the
                            seedling trees— I have one self planted Shag bark, come up under my tree
                            in the Garden. I took up also beyond the brook a Maple yearling tree and
                            set it out in the Garden— The four Strawberry vines, which I plucked up
                            over the hills and set out in the garden, are putting forth new leaves—
                            I sowed in one of the glass Tumblers some white Strawberry Seeds.</p>

                        <p>North-East rain all the morning and part of the afternoon— <persRef
                                key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> did not go to Boston— I
                            settled with <persRef ref="farrar-isaac">Isaac Farrar</persRef> for his
                            Rent to the first of last April— His reason for cutting down a
                            beautiful, large, wild Cherry tree over the Hill was that he wanted
                            fire-wood, and there was none to be bought at the wharf— My remedy for
                            this and other losses and disappointments is Patience— I continued to
                            work upon the revisal of my proposed discourse— Took a short walk in the
                            Evening as far as the Temple, and returned— In the Garden I found a new
                            Shagbark walnut up in the Summer house Cellar— The other Plants were
                            drooping with the Rain— The Seedlings vanishing one by one— Every one of
                            the old Peach Trees is date— Two or three which were just coming into
                            bearing are dying— Other Peach trees in this Neighbourhood are in little
                            better condition; yet the cause of their decay is unknown— A few days
                            since I found one Morning the ground all round the Peach trees strewed
                            with their leaves which had fallen from them in the Night— Yet it had
                            been calm— One and the same cause had operated upon them all— But that
                            cause was a mystery of Nature. My Oats or Oat grass are prostrated by
                            the Rain— They had been so before and had partly risen again— Of ten
                            thousand seeds and Stones, I certainly planted not less last Summer and
                            Autumn in the Garden and Nursery, less than five hundred have come up;
                            and those in such Clusters, that most of them choak one another. My
                            expedients for saving them from the Sun, have killed more than they have
                            preserved— I once heard <persRef ref="pownall-thomas">Governor
                                Pownall</persRef> say that he had spent his life in avoiding to
                            acquire habits— I have often thought that a man should guard himself
                            against all propensities— I have found this however as impossible as to
                            make my Oak Trees grow up straight— They will take bents by nature— They
                            will receive biasses from external pressure— It is almost as difficult
                            to educate a Tree, as a child. </p>

                            is tediously long, and contains much controversial matter— There was a
                            time when I should have said it all with very little concern or none—
                            But as men grow old the judgments of the world upon them and their works
                            grow more severe— More is expected from them, less allowances are made
                            for them. The world and Fortune favour the young. Why do I <pb n="209"
                                type="ms"/>linger upon the Stage?— Walk alone to Mount Wollaston,
                            and partly round the border of my new Orchard— The Orchard itself is in
                            tolerable and promising Order— The border is over run with grass and
                            weeds from four to five feet high. There have come up, several hundreds
                            of Oaks, Chesnuts and Walnuts, from four to nine inches high, almost all
                            flourishing, and sheltered from the Sun, and from Insects, by the grass
                            and weeds which surround them— This shelter is so essential to them,
                            that I found several of the Seedlings from around which we had plucked
                            up the grass and weeds, now killed by the Sun, and none others— This is
                            perfectly conformable to the case mentioned in <persRef
                                ref="cruickshank-thomas">Cruickshank’s</persRef> practical Planter,
                            of a Plantation of Oaks in a lot which had been covered with furze— The
                            furze had been grubbed up, to plant the Acorns on five sixths of the
                            ground— In the hurry of work it had been left standing on one sixth. At
                            the end of nine or ten years the Oaks on the ground where the furze had
                            been left standing were fewer than where the ground had been left bare;
                            but they had grown three times more—because, says he they had been
                            protected from winds and frosts at the first outset—he should have added
                            also, from the Sun, and from Insects— My seedlings at Mount Wollaston,
                            are far more advanced than in the garden and Nursery which I have kept
                            so assiduously weeded. Whether however this will answer so well for
                            fruit trees—Apples, pears, plums and peaches may be doubted— From the
                            Mount I walked to <persRef key="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef>— He
                            and <persRef ref="adams-ann">his wife</persRef> returned this Morning
                            from Medford. <persRef ref="beale-george2">George Beale</persRef> with

                                ref="adams-isaac">Hull</persRef> came home with me— I read two
                            papers in the Horticultural Transactions Vol. 1. one by <persRef
                                ref="wilmot-john">John Wilmot</persRef>, very strongly disapproving
                            the practice recently introduced of budding or grafting trees within a
                            few inches of the ground— Because in gardens, by additional manure, the
                            wild stock soon gets wholly covered; decays and perishes— And because
                            the bearing stem suffers vitally by accidental injuries, which the wild
                            stock would bear with little injury— The other paper is <persRef

                            majority of only 45 votes. His Speech is complimentary to me, and to my
                            Administration—and severe, upon what he calls the late Administration;

                                >Branch</persRef>. I read this morning my proposed Discourse for the
                                4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July, and it took me an hour and
                            a half— Very distressing; for I know not where to abridge; and the
                            Patience of the Auditory will never hold out for that length of Time—
                            Wrote to my Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef>, and visited
                            my garden and Nursery after dinner, and again in the Evening. I had a
                            seedling which came up in the Keen Earthen Pot N. 1— The Stem rose as
                            much as three Inches above the surface of the ground— The Seed-leaves,
                            and the first pair proceeding from them were well developed, but had a
                            pale and sickly look. I attempted to remove it, and all the Earth in the
                            Pot around it to the Garden, but failed. The Plant came out alone— All
                            the earth round its root, falling away— I nevertheless did set it out— I
                            have not yet succeeded in transplanting one seedling— I found one
                            chesnut seedling up in the bed; which must have been planted on the
                                13<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May; from those which I had
                            kept in sand over winter— I had concluded they were all mouldy, and that
                            none of them would come up— I had planted at the same time a row of
                            walnuts, but none of them have come up— We had this day the first
                            Raspberries— After Sunset I walked to <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi

                                Whitney</persRef> in the Morning from John 18.38. “<persRef
                                ref="pontiuspilate">Pilate</persRef> saith unto him, What is truth.”
                            And in the afternoon, from Job 14.14. “If a man die, shall he live
                            again?” In both these discourses, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney
                            gave some of his own peculiar opinions, and in that of the afternoon
                            inveighed vehemently against <persRef ref="wright-frances">Fanny
                                Wright</persRef> an English female Atheist who has been delivering
                            Lectures in the principal cities of the United States, against Slavery,
                            Marriage and Christianity. She has every where gained numerous
                            Proselytes, and there is a party scattered all over the Country, who
                            call themselves the working men’s Party; but who are generally called by
                            others Fanny Wright’s Party— Fanny makes no pretension to believe in a
                            future State; nor even in the existence of a God; but she has an
                            inveterate aversion to Slavery of all kinds. To African
                            Slavery—Matrimonial Slavery—Religious Slavery— She declaims against them
                            all, and never wants an Auditory— There is a Religious Sect rapidly
                            growing in this part of the Country denominated Universalists who
                            approach very nearly to the doctrines of Fanny, but they profess to be
                            Christians— They suppose the Soul and body to perish together, but that
                            the Soul at the judgment day will revive or be created afresh, to enjoy
                            eternal happiness— And particularly that there will be no future State
                            of punishment— This is a compound of Atheism, and Superstition well
                            suited to the inconsistencies and absurdities incident to the reasoning
                            faculties of men; and the Sect is spreading marvellously— They have had
                            preachers here, for these two years, and have taken from M<hi
                                rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney, about one third of his
                            Parishioners. They have now the project of building a Church, though
                            with Slender means to incur the expence, and still less for supporting a
                            Pastor— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney himself inclines to
                            believe the ultimate Salvation and happiness of all mankind—but he
                            believes a state of retribution, and that vice and crimes here will be
                            punished hereafter.— The question of Pilate; and the question of
                                <persRef ref="job">Job</persRef> furnish therefore objects of
                            interesting enquiry to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney— <persRef

                            visited my garden and Nursery— The Seedlings of my last Summer and
                            Autumn Plantations, have totally ceased coming up— Certainly not one in
                            ten have appeared, and of these it is doubtful whether one in ten will
                            live— I have however Oaks, Chesnuts, Shagbarks, Pignuts, Apples, Pears,
                            Peaches, Plums, Apricots, Strangers, Honey Locusts and two or three
                            unknown, upon whose destinies I fear I shall watch till I see them all
                            die— I read over again my discourse prepared for the fourth of July and
                            marked about one third of it to be struck out.</p>

                            the Telegraph of Friday the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> there was
                            an Editorial Article, containing the following words— “It is proved that
                            the families of the <persRef ref="ingham-samuel">Secretaries of the

                                >Eaton’s</persRef> wife) on the same Evening Eaton wrote a note to
                            S. D. Ingham[”]—misquoting this paragraph as if it had said “the
                            Secretary of the Treasury; of the Secretary of the Navy, and of the
                            Attorney General, refused to associate with her”—and call it a Remark of
                            his (Eaton’s) wife— He then says the publication appears in a paper
                            which professes to be friendly to Ingham, and that it is brought forth
                            under his immediate eye— He desires to know, whether he sanctions or
                            will disavow it, and says the relation they have sustained to each other
                            authorizes him to demand an immediate answer— Ingham answers on the
                                18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> that he is unable to ascertain from
                            Eaton’s note whether it is the publication or the fact which he asks him
                            if he has sanctioned or will disavow— If the first; the demand is too
                            absurd to merit an answer— If the last, he might find authority for the
                            same fact in a Philadelphia Paper of about the first of April, as
                            friendly to Eaton, as the Telegraph might be to Ingham. He adds that
                            Eaton must be not a little deranged to imagine that any blustering of
                            his would induce Ingham to disavow what all the Inhabitants of the City
                            know, and perhaps half the People of the United States believe to be
                            true— Eaton replies by a challenge and calls Ingham’s answer impudent
                            and insolent— The 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> was Sunday— Ingham
                            answers Eaton’s challenge on Monday, the 20<hi rend="superscript"
                                >th.</hi> and says that Eaton’s brother in Law <persRef

                                Randolph</persRef>, intruded himself into Ingham’s room with threats
                            of personal violence— That he Ingham understands perfectly the part he
                            Eaton is made to play in the farce now acting before the American
                            People— That he is not to be intimidated by threats or provoked by abuse
                            to any act inconsistent with the pity and contempt which Eaton’s
                            condition and conduct inspire— Eaton closes the correspondence by a note
                            in which he introduces a retort of imputation upon <persRef
                                ref="ingham-deborah">Ingham’s wife</persRef>— Eaton had ceased his

                            and D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Randolph assumed the duties as Acting

                            and was to have left Washington on the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>—
                            On that day the correspondence between him and Eaton was published in
                            the Telegraph—and on the same evening Ingham wrote a Letter to the
                            President affirming that he had been way laid that day, both at the
                            Treasury, and till a late hour in the Streets near his lodgings, by

                            interview with him, but he had left the City— The President wrote a
                            Letter to Campbell, Smith, Randolph and Lewis, enclosing Ingham’s
                            Letter, and enquiring if they had any and what agency in Ingham’s
                            difficulty— Randolph’s answer was ambiguous and evasive— The rest most
                            explicitly deny the charges of Ingham, and declare they had no agency or
                            concern whatever in the attack of Eaton upon Ingham— There is a further
                            rumour that Eaton pursued <pb n="212" type="ms"/>Ingham on his way to
                            Baltimore, but did not overtake him— Eaton’s Letters, as if to console
                            him for his failure to break Ingham’s head, break <persRef

                            proper application to his superficial sensibilities, as he had no
                            others. He declares his regret that he had made any allusion to <persRef

                            for his irritated and indignant feelings, and declaring that he had no

                            before the public—but he does not retract it— There is also the

                            other Members of the Cabinet took place— His Letter of Resignation is
                            dated at Washington the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi
                                rend="superscript">t:</hi> very courteous in manner, and handsomely
                            written— He explains why he had not tendered his resignation, when he
                            first saw the President’s communication to the Secretary of the Treasury
                            announcing his determination to organize anew his Cabinet. He had not
                            the reasons for resigning alledged by the Secretaries of War and
                                <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">of State</persRef> and says he was
                            totally ignorant of any want of harmony in the Cabinet, which either had
                            or ought to have impeded the operations of the Administration; and that
                            he resigns his Office simply in obedience to the President’s Will— The
                            President’s answer, dated the same day, accepts his resignation, and
                            though also courteously expressed says that he had felt himself bound in
                            duty to change his Cabinet in Justice to those who had been alike
                            invited to maintain near him the Relation of confidential advisers— And
                            because the harmony in feeling necessary to an efficient administration,
                            had failed in a considerable degree to mark the course of this— There is
                            a second Letter from Berrien, dated the 22<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi>
                            announcing that the arrangements necessary to put the office of Attorney
                            General in a condition for the reception of his Successor, and stating
                            that misrepresentations in the newspaper made it proper that the
                            Correspondence should be published— The President’s answer on the same
                            day consents to the publication. On the point of harmony in the
                            Administration, the Correspondents are at issue about as direct as they
                            could be; but Berrien is the only member of the Cabinet who has gone out
                            of Office with dignity. He has <pb n="213" type="ms"/>also treated the

                            requested me also to add to them any other toasts which I might chuse to
                            propose— I remarked upon one of their Toasts, and requested them to omit
                            one, in honour of myself; observing that I disliked the practice of
                            toasting a man to his face— They said the usage of toasting the Orator
                            of the day was so universal that it could not well be omitted— I then
                            requested that the toast might be postponed until after I shall have
                            withdrawn from the Hall— They said it was proposed, that the procession
                            should go from the Town-Hall, first to <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney’s</persRef>— Then round by
                                <persRef ref="potter-alonzo">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Potter’s</persRef>, to take them up, and then come to my house— I
                            thought this procession would be too long— I urged that the Toasts
                            should avoid as much as possible all controversial Sentiment; and
                            therefore that a compliment to the harmony of my Administration, which
                            they had introduced into the Toasts, should be omitted, as containing an
                            indirect reproof of the present Times.— I said I should in my own
                            discourse which I feared would be an hour long carefully avoid all
                            offensive allusion to the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">present
                                Administration</persRef>, the main scope of it being an argument
                            against the South-Carolinian doctrine of nullification— It was probable
                            from present appearances, that the Successors to the last Administration
                            would do justice to themselves; and I felt no inclination to assist them
                            in the performance of the Task— I propose to confer with these gentlemen
                            again, before the day, which I am expecting; with an anxiety and
                            dejection of Spirit, almost incredible to myself, and of which I am
                            ashamed— I walked to <persRef key="adams-thomas">my brothers</persRef>—
                            Met <persRef ref="adams-ann">his wife</persRef>, his daughter <persRef

                                ref="adams-joseph">Joseph</persRef> in a Chaise; and afterwards
                            overtook him with <persRef ref="beale-george">G. W. Beale</persRef>
                            walking— Returning from his House with his Son <persRef

                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marston</persRef>, who told me
                            that he was coming to-morrow with an <persRef ref="buxton-jarvis"
                                >Episcopal Clergyman</persRef> from North-Carolina; who wished an
                            introduction to me, and who would also be a beggar for a contribution in
                            behalf of the Inhabitants of Fayetteville, which place has recently been
                            almost destroyed by fire— I read before dinner a few pages of <persRef
                                key="adams-john">my father’s</persRef> Journals, and towards Evening
                            a few pages of <persRef ref="loudon-john">Loudon’s</persRef>
                            Encyclopaedia of gardening— Live and learn says the Adage—but at my time
                            of life is it possible to learn any thing?— They say <persRef
                                ref="cato-marcus">Cato</persRef>, learnt Greek after he was sixty— I
                            doubt if he learnt it well— Wrote to my son <persRef key="adams-john2"

                            Digging to plant Plum and Althaea Seedlings I struck upon two pignuts
                            planted 13 May, both of which had taken root. I had even forgotten where
                            I had planted them— A runner is going out from the Strawberry plant,
                            which I brought from over the Hill— Thimble berries ripening.</p>

                                >th.</hi> of July, which took me one hour— I omitted about one
                            third, of what I had written— Saw <persRef ref="miller-edward">Edward
                                Miller</persRef> at <persRef ref="u">French’s</persRef> Tavern—
                            Returning home, I met <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my

                                >Charles’s</persRef>, and rode with them to Braintree— Stopp’d at
                                <persRef ref="thayer-solomon">Solomon Thayer’s</persRef>— He now
                            calls his unknown grain wheat; but it appears to be neither wheat, nor
                            Oats, nor Oat grass— He shewed me some flour ground from the kernel:
                            Says that horses and fowls prefer it to any other grain: that he sold
                            nine quarts of it last year for four dollars a quart— That it will
                            produce a hundred bushels to an Acre; and that he is going on Saturday,
                            by appointment, to meet the agricultural Society at Boston, to exhibit
                            the grain to them, and confer with them concerning it— I asked him to
                            call at my house on his way, and look at my grain growing from his seed,
                            which he said he would. Mine is taller than his, and more mature, but
                            has been prostrated by the Rain— He has also raised Silkworms and has
                            some white Mulberry trees. After returning home I called at <persRef

                                Greenleaf’s</persRef> and told him that to shorten the procession
                            next Monday, I would readily meet them at <persRef ref="whitney-peter"
                                    >M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney’s</persRef> house— He
                            thought it would be better for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney
                            and <persRef ref="potter-alonzo">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                                Potter</persRef>, to call at mine: so that the procession might
                            call, and take us all up there— I said either arrangement would be
                            equally agreeable to me— I borrowed his List of Toasts to look them
                            over— In the garden and Nursery I found several walnut seedlings just
                            piercing the ground— There are now three under my old walnut tree of
                            1804— I have been obliged to remove all the Straw, which had been laid
                            to preserve my seedling fruit trees from the Sun— The Straw itself
                            having killed two thirds of the Plants. <persRef ref="loudon-john"
                                >Loudon’s</persRef> Encyclopaedia of Gardening says that by the last
                            of June the Seedlings are safe from the ardent gaze of the Sun— I see
                            that all Transplantation is extremely dangerous to trees, and a long
                            draw back upon their growth.</p>

                            have not made profitable use of my time— The composition of a discourse
                            for the fourth of July, and writing it twice over has engaged much of
                            it; and of the remainder, the greater part has been wasted. I repine at
                            the dispensations of Providence, and am neither duly sensible of the
                            blessings I enjoy, nor watchful to improve them for the good of my
                            fellow creatures— My own health though constantly drooping is better

                            thankful— The prospect forward is oppressive; but the deepest of my
                            afflictions is the comparison of the age I have attained with the
                            nothing I have done for mankind, and the insatiable longing to do
                            something with the conscious shame that it will never be done— I dare no
