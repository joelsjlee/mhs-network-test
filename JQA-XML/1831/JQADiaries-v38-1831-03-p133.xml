						<p>My cough is tormenting but I walk’d round the Capitol Square before
							breakfast. Morning visit from <persRef ref="niles-hezekiah">H.
								Niles</persRef>, Editor of the Baltimore Register with whom I had
							much conversation— He said he should publish all the papers of this new
								<persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> controversy in his paper, and I
							told him I should perhaps address to him a statement of my own upon the
							subject, for publication— I said that in the progress of the controversy
							both M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun and <persRef
								key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Crawford</persRef> had introduced my name without delicacy or
							reserve; and with unfounded and unjust imputations; but as these were
							merely personal, I had not thought, and should not think proper to come
							before the public in my own vindication. I believed my character would
							not gain so much by the explanations which would refute the insinuations
							against me, as it would lose by an appearance of readiness to obtrude
							myself upon the notice of the public in the midst of this <hi
								rend="italic">bagarre</hi>: but circumstances might arise under
							which I should deem it necessary to lay before the public the grounds
							and principles upon which I had defended the conduct of General Jackson,
							in taking the Spanish Ports of S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Marks and
							Pensacola— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Niles what those
							principles were, observing that they never had been laid before the
							Public—my Correspondence with the Spanish Minister <persRef
								ref="onis-luis">Onis</persRef>, and my Letter of Instructions to
								<persRef ref="erving-george">G. W. Erving</persRef> having discussed
							the question, only in its foreign aspect, as bearing upon our Relations
							with Spain, and not in its connection with our own Constitution.— I
							asked Niles also to publish the recent vindication of <persRef
								ref="bayard-james">James A. Bayard</persRef>, by <persRef
								ref="bayard-james2;bayard-richard">his two Sons</persRef>, which he
							promised he would. <persRef ref="tayloe-benjamin;dickinson-julia">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> B.
								O. Tayloe</persRef>, also paid us a morning visit, with <persRef
								ref="halleck-fitzgreene">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Halleck</persRef> of New-York—whether the Poet or not, I failed to
							ascertain— <persRef key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Frye</persRef> was here in the Evening and gave me several papers
							relating to the statements and demands of <persRef ref="hobby-william"
								>William Hobby</persRef>. After we had retired to bed, the Globe of
							to morrow Morning was brought, in which were several publications
							relating to the controversy between President Jackson, and
							Vice-President Calhoun, and among the rest a Statement not from the
							President, but in his behalf, accounting for the enquiries of <persRef
								ref="hamilton-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James A.
								Hamilton</persRef>— It brings in somewhat equivocally a statement of
							the correspondence which took place four years since between General
							Jackson, and <persRef ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Southard</persRef>, of which it presents a gross
							misrepresentation, and tells of <persRef ref="white-hugh">H. L.
								White’s</persRef> toast and speech, on the 8<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of January 1828. and of his subsequent Correspondence
							concerning it with <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Monroe</persRef>. It connects all these transactions
							with Hamilton’s inquisitions, and presents the hero prying into the
							privacies of a dinner table, as eagerly as into the antiquated and
							violated confidence of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s
							Cabinet.</p>

						<p>The Spring is advancing and the first time for the Season, I had no fire
							made in my writing chamber— Very little in the adjoining bed-chamber—
							Walking round the Capitol Square, I met <persRef ref="cranch-william"
								>Judge Cranch</persRef>— Morning visit from <persRef
								ref="williams-lewis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Williams</persRef> of North-Carolina, who introduced to me his
							friend from Tennessee— Also from <persRef ref="kent-joseph">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Kent</persRef> the former Governor of
							Maryland and Member of Congress, and afterwards from <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun</persRef>
							the Vice-President— This is the first time that he has called upon me
							since the last Administration closed. He said something about political
							Considerations as he had done in one of his Letters to which I made no
							reply then or now. Explanation can do nothing. I meet M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s advances to a renewal of the
							intercourse of common civility, because I cannot reject them— But I once
							had confidence in the qualities of his heart— It is not totally
							destroyed, but so impaired that it can never be fully restored. M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhouns Friendships and Enmities are
							regulated exclusively by his interests— His opinions are the <pb n="134"
								type="ms"/>sport of every popular blast, and his career as a
							Statesman has been marked by a Series of the most flagrant
							inconsistencies— <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford</persRef> is more desperately reckless in his changes, and
							capable of more wilful perfidy— Calhoun veers round in his politics, to
							be always before the wind—and makes his intellect the pander to his
							will. Crawford makes his memory tributary to the course of Events, and
							like one, [“]who having unto truth, by telling of it, made such a sinner
							of his Memory to credit his own lie” begins by deceiving himself.
							Calhoun said much of him this day— I mentioned the Statement in the
							Globe of this Morning; that the confidential Letter of <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun of 9. September 1818, and a
							copy of it were put into <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">General
								Jackson’s</persRef> possession by persons in the Confidence of
							Calhoun, and as Jackson supposed with his assent—he said it was entirely
							without foundation: that he knew not by whom it had been taken from his
							files, nor who had given it to Jackson— I conversed freely with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun upon the transactions in the
							Cabinet of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe— He said that his
							intimation to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe of the expediency of
							his making an explanation to General Jackson concerning his Letter of 6.
								Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1818 which he did by the Letter of
							22 December 1818 was given shortly before and certainly not immediately
							after the arrival of <persRef ref="hambly-unknown">Hambly</persRef>. He
							said too that his remark in the Cabinet Meeting in reply to my argument
							that Jackson’s taking the Spanish Forts had been defensive to meet the
							threats of <persRef ref="masot-jose">Masot</persRef>—namely that Jackson
							had determined to take the Province before was not with allusion to the
							Letter of 6 Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 1818. but to a rumour that
							Jackson had been personally interested in a previous Land Speculation at
							Pensacola— <persRef ref="frye-nathaniel;frye-carolina">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Frye</persRef>, and their Son <persRef ref="frye-thomas"

								ref="chambers-ezekiel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Chambers</persRef>, the Senator newly re-elected by the Legislature

							<persRef ref="crowninshield-benjamin">Crowninshield</persRef>, <persRef

							to attend— I requested M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peters to make a
							written statement in the form of a Letter to me, of what had been said
							to him by <persRef ref="maxcy-virgil">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							Calhoun to be communicated to me—of what he had said to me—of what I had

								>r</hi> Maxcy— He promised that he would, and said he intended to
							have proposed it to me but he wished in consideration of the present
							situation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maxcy to keep his name
							uncommitted, to which I readily agreed— We came home at eight in the

						<p>This day closed the Constitutional Term of the 21<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> Congress, and the Career of its second Session. <persRef
								ref="davis-matthew">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Davis</persRef>
							called and spent about two hours with me in conversation upon
							Politics—entirely personal politics. He has been here during the whole
							Session of Congress, and says that he has often been in direct
							communication with <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>— Says
							he told him he was the strong man of South, and expected to obtain the
							votes of all the Southern States except Georgia— Davis understood him
							that he intended to be a Candidate against <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>Jackson</persRef> at the approaching Election; a purpose which it
							may be his policy to announce, as the Supporters of Jackson, will not
							support him on their ticket for the Vice-Presidency. Davis says he told
							Calhoun he was opposed to him, and should oppose him, and that he must
							be careful to say nothing to him of a <pb n="135" type="ms"
							/>confidential nature, because he might have occasion to use what he
							should say and should feel himself entirely at Liberty to say it— That
							Calhoun told him he had no desire to interfere with his views; but only
							asked for fair play, in public; and if the election should come to the
							House of Representatives— I asked him if the Jackson party proposed to
							elect <persRef key="crawford-william-harris">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Crawford</persRef> Vice-President— He said no— That
								<persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren</persRef> was not for him, nor <persRef ref="forsyth-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Forsyth</persRef>—but <persRef
								ref="troup-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Troup</persRef>
							was— As to Forsyth’s disposition he had but recently ascertained
							it—having firmly believed till lately that he was for him—but he now
							knew he was not— I asked him what <persRef ref="granger-francis"
								>Granger</persRef> was here for— He said to be out of the way from
							home, that he might not be elected a delegate to the National
							Anti-masonic Meeting at Baltimore, next September— That Granger was
							weary of his position as the head of the Anti-masonic party, and wanted
							to withdraw from it— He said he was himself a Mason, and was willing, to
							let the Antimasons have their Governor and State Legislature, upon
							condition that they should yield the Electoral Ticket— That could not be
							conceded to them— He expected this arrangement would ultimately take
							effect— He further said that <persRef ref="sanford-nathan">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Sanford</persRef> might possibly be
							run for Governor, and that <persRef ref="marcy-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Marcy</persRef> who is to come to the
							Senate in his place would take an Independent stand, and in no wise make
							himself subservient to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren— He said
							he had long known M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marcy intimately— That
							he was Son-in-Law to <persRef ref="knower-benjamin">Benjamin
								Knower</persRef> a man of great wealth, and shrewd intelligence, who
							dissuaded him from running as Governor, that he might not be too much
							under the operation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren’s
							influence and who would not be willing that he should be so now—
							Congress passed last Evening a Bill making a new grant of twenty-nine or
							thirty-thousand dollars to <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>— Davis says <persRef
								ref="clayton-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clayton</persRef>
							of Delaware was the Senator by whose means it was called up out of turn
							and passed, though it was <persRef ref="hayne-robert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Hayne</persRef> who made the motion—
							They adjourned between seven and eight this Evening— The President
							signed the internal improvement Bill—which he was expected to return
							with his objections— The offensive proviso to the General Appropriation
							Bill was struck out.</p>

						<p>The Thermometer before Sun rise was down to the freezing point, but the
							day was like Spring—almost like Summer— <persRef ref="cranch-william"
								>Judge Cranch</persRef> called upon me, and said that the Columbian
							Institute had requested its members to prepare papers to be read at its
							weekly Meetings next Winter, and <persRef ref="dickins-asbury">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickins</persRef> had desired him to
							enquire of me whether I should be willing if requested by the Society to
							deliver the next Anniversary address— I said I had two answers to give
							him—one for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickins and the Society—the
							other for himself— The first was the same I had given last year to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Dickins, when urged to accept the
							re-election of the Society as their President— That the Circumstances in
							which I am situated had brought me to the determination to live in
							retirement— I frequented no Society— I entertained no company at home. I
							had thus passed already two Winters and intended to pass in the same
							manner the next. It was true the People of my District in Massachusetts
							had thought proper to assign to me a Seat in the House of
							Representatives in Congress, which it was my present intention to take:
							but the discharge of my duties in that Station, will be my only motive
							for appearing in public more than I have done for the last two years— In
							other respects I shall continue to live in retirement, and do not
							propose to attend the Meetings of the Columbian Institute, though <pb
								n="136" type="ms"/>though I shall never cease to be grateful for the
							favours bestowed upon me by them. The other reason, solely for himself
							was that there are now several members of the Institute, with whom I can
							take no pleasure in associating; and one with whom I never will
							voluntarily associate any where— I refused to take his hand which he had
							the impudence to offer me last Winter at the Capitol when <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Everett</persRef> delivered his address to the Columbian Institute,
							and never will take his hand again, unless he should make me an apology
							and reparation for the wilful falsehoods he has circulated, both in
							Congress and before the public to ruin my character— There was yet one
							other reason for me to decline delivering an Address. It was impossible
							for me to open my lips, or write a sentence before the public, but there
							were Liars in wait—to catch, to garble, to misrepresent, to falsify what
							I say— They had raked up every vote I ever gave in the Senate from
							twenty-five to thirty years ago to belie their purposes and my
							motives—they had ransacked my Lectures upon Rhetoric to distort and
							misrepresent them— They had rifled my Silesian Letters to abuse me for
							Scandal upon <persRef ref="carroll-john">Archbishop Carroll</persRef>,
							because I had spoken irreverently of Jesuits and spurious Relics— With
							all this experience it was warning enough to me for keeping silence
							unless every word I should utter were a two edged sword— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cranch said he believed there never had
							been a man so scandalously used as I had been in this respect: but he
							believed the time for that had now passed— However with my present
							determination he would see that no proposal should be made to me by the
							Institute to deliver the address— <persRef ref="handy-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Handy</persRef> came and spoke of
								<persRef ref="baker-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Daniel
								Bakers</persRef> conveyance of title of his house— He says that by
							the Law of the District the Execution of the Deed at Savannah must be
							attested here by one of the witnesses to it in person— Whether an
							Execution before the <persRef ref="waring-william">Mayor of
								Savannah</persRef> authenticated by the Corporation Seal would be
							sufficient M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Handy said he would ascertain
							and let me know— He told me that a young preacher by the name of
								<persRef ref="smith-edward">Smith</persRef> was to be ordained and
							installed at the second Presbyterian Church next Wednesday Evening—
								<persRef ref="campbell-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Campbell</persRef> left them last Summer and went to Albany— I
							returned this Morning the <persRef ref="calhoun-john"

								<persRef ref="taylor-john">J. W. Taylor</persRef>, <persRef

							playful wit, and shrewd sagacity— He will be a loss to the House, for as
							he laughs at every thing, often in the heat of angry and fierce debate
							he throws in a joke, which turns it all to good humour. He is one of
								<persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay’s</persRef> most intimate and devoted friends of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and was the person who informed me
							on the first of January 1825 that two-thirds of the Kentucky delegation

								/><persRef ref="taylor-john">John W. Taylor</persRef> paid me a

							anonymous Address to the People of the United States, published this

								<persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Webster</persRef>— They have had all the Session weekly opposition

							since appointed Webster and <persRef ref="everett-edward"
								>Everett</persRef> a writing Committee, and Webster a few days ago
							told him that he had written a page or two and torn it up— He finds
							himself hard to please— The paper is short, so that it may be
							transferred into the opposition papers all over the Country— Taylor said
								<persRef ref="davis-matthew">Matthew L Davis</persRef> had told him
							that <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> would certainly be a
							Candidate for the Presidency against Jackson— He asked my opinion, and I

							about it—but he thinks the Anti-Masons will finally settle down for
							Clay— I went to the Office of <persRef ref="hall-david">D. A.
								Hall</persRef> who has been appointed by the Governor of

						<p>Heard this morning <persRef ref="palfrey-cazneau">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Palfrey</persRef> from Matthew 26–26. [“]And as they
							were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it and brake it, and gave it
							to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. 27. And he took
							the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of
							it; 28. For this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for
							many, for the remission of Sins.”— Upon this text he gave a historical
							Statement of the institution of the Lord’s supper, with his views of its
							design, and character— He discountenanced the doctrine that any peculiar
							sanctity or perfection was required for admission to the Communion—or
							that any distinction should be made between the members of the Church
							and Congregation— He said it was probable from the narrative of the
							Evangelists that <persRef ref="judas-iscariot">Judas</persRef>, who
							betrayed Jesus, was not present at the Institution of the Supper, but
							that <persRef ref="peter">Peter</persRef> who so soon afterwards denied
							his Lord was; and that the object of the Institution was to obtain the
							aid of divine Power in support of struggling virtue— He administered the
							Communion after the Service— I then called upon <persRef
								ref="peters-richard2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Peters</persRef> with whom I found <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Henderson</persRef> of Rhode Island—
								<persRef ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef> was not at his
							lodgings. Peters told me that he had drawn up the Statement, of the
							transaction between <persRef ref="maxcy-virgil">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Maxcy</persRef>, and him relating to the Communications
							between <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> and me— He said he had shewn it to M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Maxcy and was waiting only for time to
							make out a copy of it for me— I visited also <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward
								Everett</persRef>, who is going for home to-morrow Morning— I
							desired him to mention to his brother <persRef ref="everett-alexander"
								>Alexander</persRef>
							<persRef ref="tudor-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Tudor’s</persRef> request that I would not write the proposed
							biographical Article upon <persRef ref="tudor-william2">William
								Tudor</persRef> for the North-American Review— Sergeant and Peters
							dined with us— Everett called in the Evening; as afterwards did <persRef
								ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey</persRef>,
							who proposes also to go for home to-morrow Morning— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey is under some perplexity to
							determine upon what occupation to follow after his present retirement
							from public life— He said if he had been a graduate of Harvard
							University, he should have sought some employment there, <pb n="138"
								type="ms"/>being very much attached to literary pursuits. I asked
							him if he did not expect to take the place soon to be vacated by
								<persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">General Dearborn</persRef> in the
							Senate of Massachusetts— He said <persRef ref="morton-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Morton</persRef> of Milton had written
							to him, mentioning that he had been desirous of this arrangement; but
							had been met by an objection from the anti-masonics; that as they had
							been deceived in General Dearborn, they might be so in him— I mentioned
							to him what I had heard of the objects and designs of <persRef
								ref="granger-francis">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Granger</persRef> in his long visit to the City this Winter; and
							observed that if the anti-masonic interests were to dwindle into a
							negotiation for the political advancement of their apparent leader, it
							would scarcely worthy the attention of any honest man to take a concern
							in them— I was this day, particularly towards Evening threatened with a
							return of the inflammation of my eyes and could neither read nor
							write.</p>

						<p>Long morning visit from <persRef ref="thomas-james2">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Thomas</persRef> who is to leave the
							City to-morrow and returns to Maine— The <persRef ref="william-i">king of
								the Netherlands</persRef> has decided the question of our
							North-eastern boundary— The decision is not yet formally known, and the
							substance of it is variously represented in several paragraphs from
							English Newspapers— The king has fixed upon a middle term between the
							pretensions of the two parties— The English are dissatisfied with the
							decision, and say that <persRef ref="preble-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Preble</persRef> is equally so— Thomas
							says that <persRef ref="ingham-samuel">Ingham</persRef> the Secretary of
							the Treasury told <persRef ref="evans-george2">George Evans</persRef>
							one of the Members of the House of the Representatives from Maine, that
							the people of that State ought to be satisfied with the decision— Thomas
							says that <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Van Buren</persRef> complains bitterly of the insupportable burdens
							of his Office— He did the same to <persRef ref="sergeant-john">J.
								Sergeant</persRef>. Thomas thinks he will resign; which I think not
							improbable— There is not one of the great public Offices but is getting
							into inextricable confusion; by the mere incompetency of the heads of
							Department who occupy them— The general Post-Office being the most
							complicated of them all, and the most easily disordered, has already
							fallen into the most disgrace, even to grave imputations of fraud and
							forgery disclosed almost the last day of the late Session of Congress—
							It is in current circulation that the habits of <persRef
								ref="barry-william">Barry</persRef> the Postmaster General are
							intemperate, but Thomas says this is not certain. <persRef
								ref="stewart-delia">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Stewart</persRef> sent me a Note requesting to see me and I called
							upon her. She spoke of the biography of <persRef ref="tudor-william2"
								>her brother</persRef> which she wished to be written like a
							recently published life of <persRef ref="heber-reginald">Bishop
								Heber</persRef>, or like <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President
								Quincy’s</persRef> Memoir of the Life of <persRef
								ref="quincy-josiah3">his father</persRef>; with many of his Letters
							interspersed throughout the Book. She wished particularly that his
							Public Official Correspondence might be introduced; but there are no
							copies of it among the papers which were sent to me— They could be
							obtained only by applying to the Department of State— M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stewart said if she could have a loan of
							the books, she herself would make the copies. She wished also that many
							of his private Letters should be inserted, particularly of those in
							which his affection for her, and his good opinion of her were expressed.
							She wishes in Truth a book which may contain under the shelter of his
							biography the lives of all of the family— She read me a Letter from
							William, about his official Coat, to his brother <persRef
								ref="tudor-frederic">Frederick</persRef> which she thought witty,
							and excellent for publication— I was not exactly of the same opinion.
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Stewart also gave me, and requested
							me to read to her, a Translation in verse by her daughter <persRef
								ref="stewart-delia2">Delia</persRef> of the Episode of <persRef
								ref="orpheus">Orpheus</persRef> and <persRef ref="eurydice"
								>Eurydice</persRef> in <persRef ref="virgil">Virgil’s</persRef>
							Georgics; and she noted as I <pb n="139" type="ms"/>read, the lines
							which she thought peculiarly beautiful— And her taste was good— She told
							me Delia was not yet fifteen— I wrote this Evening part of a Letter to
							my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> to the manifest
							injury of my eyes.</p>

						<p>It is a doctrine of the medical faculty that bodily exercise to be
							salutary, should be taken with a vacant mind, and such is the precept of
								<persRef ref="jefferson-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Jefferson</persRef>. By the instruction of <persRef
								ref="buchan-william">Buchan</persRef> I have during the greater part
							of my life, followed this rule, and it has saved me from the composition
							of mechans vers douze fois, douze cens and ten times more— At certain
							Seasons, however the propensity becomes too strong for me— I walk and
							muse, and pour forth premeditated verse, which it takes me six or nine
							months to lay by, and then resume to find it good for nothing— It never
							appears so to me, when I compose it— In a few instances I have suffered
							the publication of my effusions, and I am accredited as one of the
							smallest Poets of my Country— Very short fugitive pieces and
							translations are the only rhymes I have ever committed to the press— One
							short poem; the lines to <persRef ref="hellen-ann">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hellen</persRef> on the death of
								<persRef ref="hellen-washington;hellen-walter3">her two
								children</persRef>—and one translation: the 13<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Satire of <persRef ref="juvenal">Juvenal</persRef> have
							been favourably noticed. One Satirical song, overlooked when first
							published was dragged into light twenty years afterwards, for political
							effect against me because it laughed at the party Lama Jefferson. All
							the rest of my published poetry has passed from the press into the
							waters of Lethe— One of these rhyming fits is now upon me—brought on by
							the inflammation of my eye, which debarred me from reading and writing,
							and threw me back upon my own scanty resources— I write every morning
							one Stanza of paraphrase from the Bible; and in my morning walk from two
							to three Stanzas of a Tale which I have undertaken, far beyond my depth,
							and which I shall obviously never get through— But so totally does it
							absorb my attention while engaged upon it, that in my morning walk round
							the capitol square, I go out and return almost without consciousness of
							the passage of Time—the melancholy madness of Poetry without the
							inspiration— I cooked up this morning one Stanza before rising from bed—
							Then after reading three Chapters of <persRef ref="isaiah"
								>Isaiah</persRef>—one Stanza of paraphrase from the 3<hi
								rend="superscript">d.</hi> Chapter of Proverbs— Then in my walk
							three Stanzas more of the Tale and this Evening after dinner, severely
							threatened with an inflammation of my left eye, and therefore daring
							neither to read nor write, took up an old Ode of <persRef ref="horace"
								>Horace</persRef>, exquisitely beautiful, from which more than
							twenty-five years ago I had wrung three Stanzas, and then given up the
							rest in despair— They were three of the best Stanzas I ever wrote—to
							which I now added two of the worst— The thoughts of Horace, are as
							unmalleable as Platina. <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi

								<persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward D.

							kneeling. In the Congregational Churches he stands— The introductory
							prayer and the Sermon, from 2. Timothy 4.5. “Make full proof of thy
							Ministry,” was by a person whom I did not know—the Ordaining prayer and
							right hand of fellowship by <persRef ref="post-reuben">M<hi

								Balch</persRef> of Georgetown, an old Man, upwards of eighty, whose

						<p>In my morning walk I met <persRef ref="hagner-peter">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter Hagner</persRef>, and we walk’d
							together till we parted at the market— He told me he had ten children
							and had never lost one. And that he always made it a practice to prevent
							their getting their feet wet, and to make them wear flannels. I lost one
							or two Stanza’s of <persRef ref="macmurrough-dermot">Dermot</persRef> by
							my walk with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hagner, and should therefore
							get something by way of composition— As I proceed with Dermot, the
							subject opens upon me and I feel distressingly my wants— I supposed I
							could make out of it a Tale of about 50 Stanza’s— I now think I cannot
							get through with it in less than one hundred. My Style is the mock
							heroic; but it wants vivacity, humour, poetical invention and a large
							command of Language— I want besides, a knowledge of Ireland, physical
							moral and political— A knowledge of the manners, usages, prevailing
							opinions, modes of life, social habits and dress of the twelfth century—
							I want a faculty of inventing and delineating character; of naturalizing
							familiar dialogue, and of spicing my treat with keen and cutting Satire—
							I want the faculty of picturesque description: of penetrating into the
							inmost recesses of human Nature—of moralizing in harmonious verse—of
							passing from grave to gay, from lively to severe—of touching the chords
							of sympathy with the tender and sublime—and to consecrate the whole by a
							perpetual tendency to a pure and elevated morality— I do not believe
							there is in human history a happier subject for a Mock-heroic Poem than
							the Conquest of Ireland by <persRef ref="henry-ii">Henry the
								second</persRef>— But where are the legendary fables of Ireland for
							Machinery—where the Art of painting the intrigues of Dermot at the Court
							of Henry; where the art of describing Battles, and Sieges, the
							desolation of the Country during the progress of the Conquest the
							destruction of Fernez the Capitol of Leinster; the interior of the
							Monastery where Dermot concealed himself upon his return after his
							expulsion— All this a true Poet might point with touches of the terribly
							sublime— If I had undertaken it forty years ago I might have made
							something of it now— At present, I might as well undertake to paint a
							Scene of the Deluge upon Canvas; or to compose the Music of an Opera—or
							to execute the Pediment of the Capitol which I designed. <persRef

							now holding up <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

								ref="vaughan-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Vaughan</persRef>, the British Minister, likewise on the point of

							a Poet, and a Lover of the fine Arts— He has a valuable collection of
							Pictures, Prints, Sculptures, Antique, and copies from the Antique, a
							few small Etruscan Vases, Lacrimatories, and other curiosities of
							antiquity— These are not to be sold— He takes them back to France. The
							House being open for the Auction I went to see the Pictures— They are of
							the French, Italian and Flemish Schools, and of various value— Many of
							them were pleasing to me and I could have idled away three hours a day
							for a week before them, had it been consistent with bienséance— A death
							of <persRef ref="abel">Abel</persRef> passed for the most thrilling
							Representation of human Passions, and a herd of cows reposing on the
							ground, for the truest usage of still life, in the collection— There
							were Holy families, and Heathen Gods, <persRef ref="mary"
								>Madonas</persRef> and <persRef ref="marymagdalen"
								>Magdalens</persRef>, infant Jesus’s, fawns and Satyrs in the usual

								ref="menou-charles">Count de Menou</persRef>, formerly the Charge
							d’Affaires from France, who has been absent all the recent Winter, and
							who told me he was but now recovering from the hurt of a fall about six

							upper Chambers; and went up, and called M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Roux himself who came down and repeated the invitation himself. I went
							accordingly and found the chambers emptied of furniture, but hung round
							with <persRef ref="volpato-giovanni">Volpato’s</persRef> engravings of
								<persRef ref="sanzio-raffaello">Raphaels</persRef> fresco paintings
							on the Cieling of the Sestine Chapel, and many other engravings, and

							and <persRef ref="chateaubriand-francois">Chateaubriand</persRef> of the
							number— <persRef ref="rouxderochelle-adelaide">Madame Roux</persRef>
							invited me also into her Chambers, where were good Portraits of her

							one most admirably executed of the expatriated king, <persRef
								ref="artois-charles">Charles the 10<hi rend="superscript"

							from France to figure in the most conspicuous place of the Minister’s
							Saloon, <pb n="142" type="ms"/>but M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Roux
							told me he had removed it to this recess, after the change— Ce bon
							Charles dix! said Madame Roux— Ou est il à présent? On le dit en
							Angleterre— She said no more—but evidently thought and felt much— I
							changed the subject and talked of Raphael and <persRef
								ref="michelangelo">Michael-Angelo</persRef>— The Transfiguration and
							Arabesques—the Madona of <persRef ref="saintsixtus-ii">Saint
								Sixtus</persRef> and the Madona of the Chair— Upon all which M<hi

							real Antique Marble Busts— A whole small antique human figure in bronze.
							A large, poor, half antique Marble Bust of <persRef ref="cicero-marcus"
								>Cicero</persRef>, and several copies in Marble from Antiques. Not

						<p>Morning walk omitted. Proportional deduction from the progress of
								<persRef ref="macmurrough-dermot">Dermot</persRef>— After breakfast
							I walked to the Capitol, and heard <persRef ref="sergeant-john">J.
								Sergeant</persRef> for about three hours before the Supreme Court,
							upon the Injunction prayed by the Cherokee Nation of Indians against the
							State of Georgia, the Legislature of which has passed a Law, extending
							the Jurisdiction of the State over them and their Lands— The question is
							upon the Jurisdiction of the Court— The <persRef ref="gilmer-george"
								>Governor of Georgia</persRef> was summoned to appear, but refused;
							and the Legislature passed Resolutions denying the right of the Court to
							issue the Summons, and declaring their <hi rend="italic">regret</hi>
							that <persRef ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice Marshall</persRef> had
							issued it— Sergeant and <persRef ref="wirt-william">Wirt</persRef> are
							now arguing the question of Jurisdiction, without any Counsel to oppose
							them—but the weight of the State will be too heavy for them— The old
							vice of Confederacies is pressing upon us, anarchy in the members.
							whenever a State does set itself in defiance against the Laws or power
							of the Union, they are prostrated— This is what the States having Indian
							Tribes within their limits are now doing with impunity—and all the
							powers of the General Government for protection of the Indians, or the
							execution of the Treaties with them are nullified— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sergeants argument made it necessary for
							him to maintain that the Cherokee Nation are a Foreign State, and this
							is the very point upon which the judgment of the Court may be against
							him.— The argument was cold and dry, resting upon Constructions of
							passages in the Constitution, and precedents of authorities— There were
							however several Ladies among the auditory who sat and heard him with
							exemplary Patience— <persRef ref="peters-richard2">R. Peters</persRef>
							gave me the paper he had promised me, being a Letter addressed to me
							containing a Statement of the transaction between <persRef

							Hotel <persRef ref="pearce-dutee">D. J. Pearce</persRef> whom I likewise
							invited— On reaching home I found <pb n="143" type="ms"/>there was a

						<p>Finished the first Canto of <persRef ref="macmurrough-dermot"

							Smith</persRef>—the first Sermon after his Ordination—from Jeremiah.
							1.18— “For behold, I have made thee this day, a defenced city, and an
							iron pillar and brazen walls against the whole Land, against the kings
							of Judah, against the Princes thereof, against the Priests thereof, and
							against the People of the Land— 19 And they shall fight against thee;
							but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the
							Lord, to deliver thee.” He began the service in a voice so low, and a
							manner so inanimate that I thought little could be expected from him—
							His text excited curiosity; because it was not common place, and
							because, as having an obvious allusion to his own situation, it appeared
							to require address as well as delicacy to handle it in a suitable
							manner— I was soon agreeably surprized, at the well adjusted consistency
							of his discourse, at the number and variety of historical details, which
							he adduced from the biography of <persRef ref="jeremiah"
								>Jeremiah</persRef>, at the accurate discernment with which he
							delineated the character of that prophet, at the elegance of language
							which was continued and sustained through an unwritten Sermon, at the
							propriety, energy, and occasional temperate warmth of the delivery, and
							at the ingenious and unassuming application, left rather to the
							inferences of the Auditory than expressly affirmed of the prophets
							circumstances at the time when he received this promise of protection,
							support and success in the discharge of his duties— He gave notice that
							there would be no service at the Church this afternoon; there being a
							Stranger to preach at <persRef ref="post-reuben">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Post’s</persRef>— After I returned home, <persRef
								key="smith-william-steuben">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. S.
								Smith</persRef>, and <persRef ref="brent-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Brent</persRef> successively called—
							Brent spoke of the recent decision by the <persRef ref="william-i">king
								of the Netherlands</persRef>, of the question of our North-eastern
							boundary; of which he said a Copy had been received through <persRef
								ref="mclane-louis">Louis M’Lane</persRef> the Minister at London;
							but the original forwarded by <persRef ref="preble-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Preble</persRef> by the way of Havre
							has not yet been received— The English are or affect to be very much
							dissatisfied with this award— Preble is dissatisfied with it, and so are
							the People of the State of Maine— The Legislature of the State upon
							hearing of it held a secret Session the result of which is not public—
							Brent says that Preble, in a Letter of the 7<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> of January wrote to the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin"
								>Secretary of State</persRef>, that he had no reason to suspect the
							decision would be other than in our favour— The king’s Award was made on
							the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and announced to the two Ministers
							on the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>—just so it was with M’Lane— Two
							days before the downfall of the <persRef ref="wellington-arthur"
								>Wellington</persRef> Administration, he wrote to Van Buren that the
							Duke was seated firmly beyond the power of shaking him— These Dunces are
							not content to be silent in their ignorance; but must foretell, just in
							time to be contradicted by the Event— Brent said he had just told M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Van Buren, that he thought the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President</persRef> ought to proceed
							immediately to carry the award into Execution. Of this I had some
							doubts— The king of the Netherlands was no longer the Independent
							Sovereign that he was when selected as the umpire between the parties—
							He had lost more than half his kingdom, and had been placed in a state
							of absolute dependence upon European Powers, one of which was the party
							against us— Besides which it is stated that the king’s award has gone
							beyond the bounds of the submission— That was only to designate the
							actual Geography of the boundary described in the Treaty of Peace of
							1783. but he has made a composition <pb n="144" type="ms"/>between the
							pretensions of the British and our Claims— He has departed from the
							Surveys on both sides, and drawn an arbitrary line which neither party
							can acknowledge as the boundary defined by the Treaty of Peace— And as
							neither party can be satisfied with this, I said a further direct
							Negotiation with Great Britain might end in a Settlement of the line
							more satisfactory to both parties than that drawn by the award of the
							Arbitrator. <persRef ref="hoffman-david">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

						<p>The Stanza, before rising from bed came with much difficulty this

							and chiefly on the Jurisdiction of the Court, he concluded by a short
							appeal to the sympathies of the case, in a low tone of voice and that
							accent of sensibility which becomes doubly impressive by being half
							subdued— The deep attention of the auditory was the indelible proof of
							its power. His argument was little more than a repetition of what had
							been said by <persRef ref="sergeant-john">Sergeant</persRef>— His Pathos

						<p>I thought myself this morning brought completely to a stand with my
								<persRef ref="macmurrough-dermot">Dermot</persRef>. <persRef
								ref="woodside-james">Captain Woodside</persRef> who told me that he
							was in the Register’s Office at the Treasury Department, came and
							informed me that he had discovered the Quadrature of the Circle by the
							process of weighing— He had a book with certificates signed by a number
							of very respectable persons since the middle of February attesting the
							fact of the discovery; and its certainty— He wished me also to subscribe
							my name to this book which I declined, although he had a dissection of a
							square and circle upon pasteboard to demonstrate his theorem—which is
							that after inscribing a square of the angle of 45 within the given
							circle seven segments of the Circle equal to the four outside of the
							square, are equal to the whole inscribed square—he demonstrated this to
							me with his sections of Pasteboard, but said he had first discovered it
							by comparing the weight of the pieces together. He could not describe it
							either by Geometry or by Algebra— He also mentioned to me several other
							discoveries and inventions of his—such as to ascertain the Longitude by
							Lunar observations or by the bearing of the Pointer of the Great Bear
							upon the Polestar and several others some of which I could not
							understand— He has been many years a Mariner and Sea-Captain and told me
							had crossed the equinoctial Line 22 Times— He enquired if I thought
							Congress had the power of granting a reward for the discovery of
							squaring the Circle— I told him I thought they had; but many others
							believed they had not—and observed that the only effectual way for him
							to ascertain it would be to petition Congress. He asked me also what was
							the premium offered for this discovery by the British Parliament, which
							I was not able to tell him— I called and paid a visit to <persRef
								ref="vaughan-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Vaughan</persRef>, the British Minister, and had a desultory
							Conversation with him of about two hours— He is suffering severely with
							the rhumatism, and much affected in Spirits by the state of Affairs in
							Europe, and particularly in his own Country— He told me of his
							intercourse with <persRef ref="u">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Parr</persRef> at Oxford; and of his aggregation to the celebrated
							Literary Club in London— He does not however profess to be a Literary
							man, though educated at Oxford— He spoke in terms of high respect of
								<persRef ref="grey-charles">Earl Grey</persRef>, the head of the
							present Ministry, but dreads the effect of the democratic movements for
							Parliamentary reform— It rained, and after returning home I kept house
							the remainder of the day.— The eight Lined Stanza of the Italian Poets
							or Ottava Rima, with triple alternate lines and a couplet, has been I
							think introduced into English Poetry by <persRef ref="byron-george">Lord
								Byron</persRef>, and the Poems he has published in that Stanza, are
							to me by far the most pleasing that he has written— I am using it for
							Dermot, and finding the verification too easy, I took up this day his
								<persRef ref="beppo">Beppo</persRef>, the first Poem in which he
							used this Stanza, to examine wherein the secret of its difficulty lies—
							There is every appearance that to him it was easier than prose— The
							familiarity of the Language fits it for comic humour and facetious
							dialogue— The Stanza makes it epigrammatic. This is the character of all
							composition in Stanzas— Serious or gay they should all end in a Point.
							There is a sprightliness about the Stanzas of Byron, which cannot be
							imitated precisely because it is original. The unexpected and lively
							terms of thought, with the extravagant and highly diversified
							combinations of Rhyme give it an irresistible charm, while the ton
							grivois, and satirical shrewdness possess a power which can never be
							exercised by the loftier elocution of heroic poetry— The unapproachable
							difference between Beppo, and Dermot is the difference between Tokay and
							small beer— Flashes of high poetical imagery gleam in every line of
							Beppo— The thoughts in Dermot are more prosaic than the verse— One of
							the advantages of this Stanza is that it admits of transitions between
							the very highest and lowest flights of poetical composition— It would
							suit equally the storm or the <pb n="146" type="ms"/>Episode of <persRef
								ref="orpheus">Orpheus</persRef> and <persRef ref="eurydice"
								>Eurydice</persRef> in the Georgics; the lines upon <persRef
								ref="marcellus-marcus">Marcellus</persRef> in the Eneid, and the
							squabbles of the Shepherds in the Bucolics— <persRef ref="virgil"
								>Virgil</persRef> gives all these alike in Hexameters— But <persRef
								ref="ovid">Ovid’s</persRef> Elegiacs and <persRef ref="horace"
								>Horace’s</persRef> Lyrics sufficiently prove the power of
							diversified measures in the Latin Language, and if <persRef
								ref="pope-alexander">Pope</persRef> had familiarized himself with
							the Ottava rima and practised it we should have seen it in much higher
							perfection than in Byron.</p>

						<p><date>17. V— </date>Thursday— S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Patrick’s
							day.</p>
						<p>My occupation of idleness encroaches upon the slumbers of the Night. A
							pressure of uneasiness at the failure of invention, waked me between two
							and three this Morning. From that Time till five I lay and compos’d five
							Stanza’s of digression— Then rose, wrote one Stanza of paraphrase from
								<persRef ref="isaiah">Isaiah</persRef>— Walked round the Capitol
							Square, and in that walk composed six Stanzas more of <persRef
								ref="macmurrough-dermot">Dermot</persRef>; one or two of them among
							the best yet written. Two upon the National character of the Irish,
							specially suited to the day. There came a gust of wind, in the morning
							which was followed by a strong gale from the Northwest, and a sharp
							frost even at midday— There was no temptation to leave the house— I
							wrote a short Letter to my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef>, and finding after the lighting of my Evening
							Lamp that I could not prudently read or write, I composed a couple of
							Stanza’s from Fancy; taking a hint from the Song in <persRef
								ref="marmontel-jean">Marmontel’s</persRef> Opera, of L’Ami de la
							Maison— [“]Rien ne plait tant aux yeux des belles” to which I added a
							Stanza not very congenial with it— The thought occurred to me of
							introducing somewhere in the Story of Dermot an Irish banquet, with a
							Harper and to make him sing these Stanza’s for a song— But my poem has
							already grown to terrific length, and I feel much as I did when swamped
							in the middle of the Potowmac river clogged with half my cloathing, and
							having to reach the shore by swimming— This solicitude is absurd, since
							after all I have but to consider my poetical inspirations as
							waste-paper— But if I should ever finish this tale the temptation to
							communicate it at least in manuscript to some of my friends will be
							irresistible; and that of attempting something else perhaps not less—and
							considering that I have this day composed and written upwards of one
							hundred lines of rhymes the facilities before me are even more alarming
							than the difficulties— I read this afternoon in the number of the
							American Quarterly Review, a fantastical article upon ennui full of
							affectation, and ascribing to that apathetic state of mind, some of the
							deepest agonies recorded in history— There is also an Article upon
								<persRef ref="morgan-sydney">Lady Morgan’s</persRef> France in 1829
							and 1830—very severe and somewhat petulant. This Lady has for at least
							25 years been treated very uncourteously by all the Reviewers, but
							perseveres in publishing, as if in defiance of them all, and still finds
							readers— Snow and Gale.</p>

								Ticknor</persRef> had published the Manuscript at Boston— She
							desired me to ask M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt to call upon her

							acquaintance—who was not now in the City but at Baltimore, and to whom
							he should scarcely know what to say. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

							That which she had mentioned to me— The belief in his irresistible
							eloquence— He said she had told him as much— I thought 2 that her motive
							was to influence the Commodore by the fame and reputation of her
							Advocate and 3. perhaps to awe him a little with the contemplated
							possibility of a Lawsuit in the end— I wished to have had further
							Conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wirt, but the <persRef

						<p>The sharp frost of Winter continued till this morning; but the
							Northwester then departed probably not to return again this Season. The
							wind came round Southerly and the weather moderated. From the beginning
							of February to this time, there has been almost a constant succession of

								2<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of this Month has fallen back nearly

							loss between real and apparent time— I walked this morning to the
							Race-ground, musing <persRef ref="macmurrough-dermot">Dermot</persRef>
							as I went and came— I read <persRef ref="byron-george">Lord
								Byron’s</persRef> Vision of Judgment, to examine further his use of
							this measure. He began with it first in <persRef ref="beppo"
								>Beppo</persRef>, and after once adopting, evidently took a
							partiality for it; as is proved by <persRef ref="donjuan">Don
								Juan</persRef>, the Vision of Judgment, and the Translation of the
							first Canto of the Morgante Maggiore of <persRef ref="pulci-luigi"
								>Pulci</persRef>— It is the most delightful of all measures for the
							mock heroic, or for any gay or lively narrative— <persRef
								ref="butler-samuel3">Butler’s</persRef> Hudibras or <persRef
								ref="pope-alexander">Pope’s</persRef> rape of the Lock, would have
							been exceedingly improved by it— But it requires a continual coruscation
							of thought and perpetual repetition of Anti-thesis— Almost every Stanza
							in Byron is an Epigram— And it is very much so in <persRef
								ref="ariosto-ludovico">Ariosto</persRef>, and in <persRef
								ref="wieland-christoph">Wieland’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="oberon">Oberon</persRef>— With a greatly increased power
							of poetical inversion, with the freest use of prosaic and colloquial
							language, and with rhymes of double and treble terminations, and a
							prodigal use of the cesura, this species of verse is scarcely more
							difficult to write than prose— But Byron as he became familiar with the
							staff indulged himself more and more with all its licenses till his
							verse almost dissolved into prose— There is much more musical harmony in
							the composition of Beppo, than in that of the Vision of Judgment, and
							much more in the early than in the later Cantos of Don Juan— <persRef

						<p>Walk again round the Capitol Square, and finished the second Canto of

							and the want of many Books for consultation— This day especially I
							wanted a History of Monastic Orders, and the condition <pb n="150"

								>Leland’s</persRef> History of Ireland— I had first read the Story
							of <persRef ref="macmurrough-dermot">Dermot M’Morrogh</persRef> only in
								<persRef ref="hume-david">Hume’s</persRef> History, where it
							occupies only two or three pages. There is more in <persRef
								ref="lingard-john">Lingard</persRef>; but as I proceed I feel the
							want of a connected narrative, which is amply contained in the work of
							Leland— It professedly begins with the Invasion by <persRef
								ref="henry-ii">Henry the second</persRef>, and the History till
							Henry’s Death is related in five chapters and contains upward of 150
							pages of the Quarto Volume. Leland was an Irishman, and insists with
							great earnestness that the acquisitions of Henry in Ireland were not a
							conquest— This is altogether immaterial to my Tale—but on a cursory
							perusal of Leland’s narrative, I see a formidable difficulty in
							determining when and how to bring my Subject to a close— Nothing would
							be easier than with the historical materials now furnished me, to add a
							fourth Canto of the Adventures and exploits of Henry till the conquest
							should be completed— But this would be tedious and uninteresting, a sing
							song mere versification of History, which I find already creeping upon
							me. My subject is one, and must end with the Death of Dermot— To include
							within it the subsequent Deeds of Henry, they must be chronologically
							misplaced—not however to the extent of <persRef ref="virgil"
								>Virgil’s</persRef> licence in making <persRef ref="aeneas"
								>AEneas</persRef> and <persRef ref="dido">Dido</persRef>
							cotemporaries. I found in Leland immediately, at the precise point of
							the Story where I am, materials for several Stanza’s, and particularly
							an incident characteristic of Dermot very suitable for the Poem. I was
							engaged the whole Evening in shaping it into four Stanza’s at last very
							indifferently composed— The names of these Irish Chiefs are somewhat
							unmanageable and are differently spelt by different writers. Leland
							calls Dermot <pb n="151" type="ms"/>Mac Murchad— Hume names him Mac
							Morrogh, which I have assumed— This poem now absorbs almost all my time

						<p>At the Unitarian Church, and heard <persRef ref="palfrey-cazneau">M<hi

							“For we have not an high-priest which cannot be touched with the feeling
							of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet
							without sin.”— Let me observe that this sentence is ungrammatical, and
							confused in its construction— The first part of it is negative, with two
							negations which in the English language is equivalent to a positive—but
							the form of the sentence is a negation— It is only the sort of high
							Priest that we have not. The two negations apply to two different
							objects the first to us the second to the qualities of the High Priest.
							Two such negations cannot form an affirmation— When <persRef
								ref="milton-john">Milton</persRef> says “nor was he not”— The two
							negatives apply to one person— It is the same as if it said “he was.”
							But he the second negative does not reverse the first—because it applies
							not to us— It might be expressed thus—we have not a hard hearted high
							Priest— It does not affirm that we have any high Priest at-all—but the
							second part of the sentence, implies that the first had been a positive
							assertion that we have a High-Priest not insensible to our infirmities:
							there is therefore no nominative case to the word <hi rend="italic"
								>was</hi> in the second half of the text— Ask the question who was,
							and the verse affords no answer. This error is of the translation, and
							it is one of a great multitude of glaring grammatical inaccuracies with
							which the common English Translation abounds although considered as a
							classical book in the English language. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Palfrey’s discourse was upon the character of Jesus—a continuation of
							his Sermon of last Sunday Morning.— I received and answered a Letter
							from <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">Abigail S. Adams</persRef>, and wrote

						<p>A morning visit of two or three hours from <persRef ref="fendall-philip"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fendall</persRef>— There are in
							the Intelligencer of this Morning two Articles; one extracted from the
							Telegraph of last Friday Evening, and one from the Globe of Saturday
							Morning— That in the Telegraph is a statement by <persRef
								ref="green-duff">Duff Green</persRef> its Editor; in defence of
							himself against the attacks of <persRef ref="blair-francis"
								>Blair</persRef> the ostensible, and <persRef ref="kendall-amos"
								>Amos Kendall</persRef>, the efficient Editor of the Globe. He
							produces a Letter from each of them, written to him some time last
							autumn, to conciliate him upon the proposed Establishment of the Globe,
							which compared with their attacks upon him now disclose all the
							treachery and hypocrisy which belong to the tribe of literary
							lampooners— Among the most infamous of these, Amos Kendall is already
							well known, who for his treachery to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, and his services as a
							Libeller has been appointed fourth Auditor of the Treasury. The Article
							from the Globe, contains a Letter from <persRef ref="eaton-john">John H.
								Eaton</persRef>, Secretary of War— The Globe produces it as a
							refutation of a previous statement which had appeared in the Telegraph,
							which was that previous to the publication of <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun’s</persRef> pamphlet, it had been submitted to <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson’s</persRef> most intimate and
							confidential friend; by whom no objection had been made to its
							publication— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eaton’s Letter is no
							refutation of that Statement but a confirmation of it— He says that
							before the publication of the pamphlet, <persRef ref="grundy-felix">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Grundy</persRef> informed him that it
							would be published and expressed an earnest wish that there might be
							nothing in it which General Jackson would think it necessary to
							answer—in which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eaton concurred— That at
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grundy’s invitation he went to his
							lodgings where Grundy read to <pb n="153" type="ms"/>him M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Calhoun’s address to the People, to some
							passages of which he Eaton, made objections, and proposed alterations,
							all of which Grundy afterwards informed him had been adopted— That M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Eaton was requested to mention to the
							President that the pamphlet would be published but did not do so— It
							seems probable that this Letter of Eaton’s is published to pacify
							Jackson’s irritation, upon seeing a statement that Calhoun’s pamphlet
							had been exhibited previous to its publication to his bosom friend,
							without meeting any objection from him— We have now had no intelligence
							from Europe these three weeks— I am distracted between Parnassus and the
							flour market— Yesterday I finished the copy of the first Canto of
								<persRef ref="macmurrough-dermot">Dermot</persRef>, and this day
							began that of the second Canto— The composition of the third is so far
							advanced, that I have ascertained it will require a fourth, and that the
							whole Poem, if ever finished will comprize about 220 Stanza’s— I have
							brought my plan so far within the compass of execution as to secure the
							unity of action; and a perfectly natural division into four Parts— The
							want of poetical language and of a creative Imagination, however, is
							incurable, and I struggle against it in vain— And it is as flattering
							upon my paraphrase of the Psalms as upon the Tale of Dermot— The only
							benefit of my Morning paraphrase is to shew me sometime the chain of
							ideas in the original where I had never seen it before—</p>

						<p>Rain—all last Night and great part of this day— The weather from Summer
							heat has changed again to a raw, chilling Northeaster— In the middle of
							the day, I walked to the Capitol, and returned to the Library <persRef
								ref="jacob-william">Jacobs</persRef> Report upon the Corn Trade.— I
							met there <persRef ref="cranch-william2">William Cranch jun<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi></persRef> to whom I gave a Letter for
								<persRef ref="cranch-anna">his mother</persRef> which I had received
							from Quincy— At the Capitol, visited the Library, and looked at some
							books respecting Ireland, in which I thought I might find some
							information to use in the composition of <persRef
								ref="macmurrough-dermot">Dermot</persRef>— First <persRef
								ref="carey-mathew">Matthew Carey’s</persRef> Vindiciae Hibernicae—
							but in that there was evidently nothing— I then examined <persRef
								ref="lawless-john">Lawless’s</persRef> Compendium of the History of
							Ireland—two Volumes 8<hi rend="superscript">vo.</hi> 1823— <persRef
								ref="odriscol-john">O’Driscol’s</persRef> History of Ireland 2.

								ref="wakefield-edward">Edward Wakefield’s</persRef> Statistical and
							Political Account of Ireland. 2 Volumes 4<hi rend="superscript">to.</hi>
							1812. The two modern Histories are light compilations apparently of a
							party character— Wakefield’s is a heavy book of Statistics not
							historical, but in which there is an immense mass of information
							relating to the Island. I have no doubt that by taking time to study it,
							there is much matter which might be woven into my Poem, but my
							consciousness tells me that I have already wasted too much time upon
							this trifle, which is yet far from drawing near to its end— There is a
							map in Wakefield’s Book, in which Ferns and Castle Dermot are laid down—
							I took out of the Library the first Volumes of Wakefield and of
							O’Driscol— In the appendix to the first Volume of O’Driscol are a
							Translation of <persRef ref="popeadrian-iv">Pope Adrian’s</persRef> Bull
							to <persRef ref="henry-ii">Henry the Second</persRef> and the Treaty in
							Latin between Henry and <persRef ref="oconnor-roderic">Roderick
								O’Connor</persRef> made in 1177. and which is said to be the lawful
							Title of the English kings to the Lordship of Ireland—and O’Driscol in
							his preface says that the only History of Ireland that deserves the
							name, though a heavy work overburthened with details—partial and servile
							to the British authority— They all complain bitterly of the contemptuous
							terms in which <persRef ref="hume-david">Hume</persRef> uniformly speaks
							of Ireland— The details of <persRef ref="leland-thomas">Leland</persRef>
							supply me so abundantly with facts that I have only the difficulty of
							selecting, abridging and versifying— There is nothing that deserves the
							name of a Battle to describe— The incidents are flat— No Machinery— No
							marvellous— The extreme simplicity of my Tale is that from which I fear
							it will prove irredeemably tedious—and therefore illegible— There is an
							original writer cotemporary with Henry the second, and who went with him
							to Ireland, named <persRef ref="cambrensis-giraldus">Giraldus
								Cambrensis</persRef>— His work is a History of the Conquest and he
							is the principal Source, from <pb n="154" type="ms"/>whom all the modern
							historians draw their narrative— Hume barely cites him. <persRef
								ref="lingard-john">Lingard</persRef> sometimes prefers the Irish
							Annalist, to him— Leland cites a work expressly written to discredit him
							called Cambrensis Eversus and there is a book of a <persRef
								ref="oconor-charles">Reverend M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								O’Connor</persRef> said to be a lineal descendent from the Roderick
							O’Connor king of Connaught who submitted to the Sovereignty of Henry the
							second. I know not whether a single copy of any of these Books exists in
							America— Giraldus I have no doubt would be of service to me, by helping
							me to some superstitious incidents, better for poetry than mere facts— I
							lost this Evening almost entirely, being very unwell—</p>

						<p>My indisposition of the last Evening passed off in the Night, but the

							before dinner, round the Capitol Square, and as I was returning was
							overtaken by <persRef ref="mercer-john2">Major Mercer</persRef> the Son
							in Law of <persRef ref="swann-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Swann</persRef>— Walking with me, he had returned last week from

								ref="goldsborough-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Goldsborough</persRef>, as a Commissioner from the State of Maryland
							upon some question concerning a road or boundary between the two States
							to be settled by the Legislature— He said he had been some time at
							Harrisburg, and seen much of the members of the Legislature— That he had
							seen but one man, who spoke in terms of approbation of the present
							Administration, and that was a Senator by the name of <persRef
								ref="krepps-james">Krepps</persRef>, the same with whom <persRef
								ref="donelson-andrew">Major Donelson</persRef>, has had a
							correspondence respecting the nomination of <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">General Jackson</persRef>, for re-election, by
							the members of the Pennsylvania Legislature— This nomination was made by
							a meeting of more than half the members of the Legislature; although
							every one of them except Krepps was open mouthed against him— He said he
							asked several of them why holding and expressing such opinions they
							could vote a nomination of him again— They said the People had not been
							disabused of their prejudice in his favour, and, if they should hesitate
							about his re-election, they would be turned out by their Constituents—
							The United States <persRef ref="wilkins-william">judge</persRef> of the
							Western District of Pennsylvania, was elected to the Senate of the
							United States and resigned his judicial Office. a Member of Congress
							named <persRef ref="irwin-thomas">Irwin</persRef> was appointed in his
							place— Great Interest was made in behalf of an old federalist named
								<persRef ref="ross-james">James Ross</persRef> prostrated thirty
							years ago for federalism, then a Senator of the United States and never
							since able to get into public life again— For the last seven years he
							has been seeking political redemption by Jacksonism— It has as yet
							profited him nothing— A deputation was sent hither from Harrisburg to
							plead in his behalf. Jackson told them that Ross was undoubtedly the man
							best qualified for the Office in Pennsylvania, but that he could not
							encounter by nominating him the prejudices of the great democratic
							party. He was reminded of his Letter to <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>, but without avail—
							This day was showery, but it cleared away towards Evening— I finished
							the third Canto of <persRef ref="macmurrough-dermot">Dermot</persRef>
							and have now before me the most difficult part of my task— Received a
							Letter from my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>, and
							ventured most deeply into the experiment of the commerce des grains— I
							have now by purchase a stock on hand equal to what would have been made
							at the Mills had they been in constant active operations during the
							three Months that they have been blocked up at a burdensome expence—
							There has been for 25 days no intelligence from England the principal
							market— This day there are accounts from Havre to the 9<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> of February, by a vessel arrived at
							Boston. Accounts from Liverpool to the same and later dates are awaited
							with great and anxious expectation—</p>

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi></date> While the inspiration is upon me
							(of Ale or viler liquors) the whole course of my Time has taken a new
							and peculiar turn— It commenced early in February, first occasioned by
							the inflammation of my eye, which disqualified me for writing or
							reading, and confined me at the same time to the house— From the middle
							of that month, I have composed every morning one Stanza of paraphrase
							from the Psalms or other scriptural books, at the time when immediately
							after rising in the morning I read three chapters of the Bible— On the
								23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of February I began the tale of
								<persRef ref="macmurrough-dermot">Dermot</persRef>, expecting to
							finish it, if ever in about fifty Stanzas— I have already written nearly
							two hundred, and shall not get through with less than fifty more— I
							usually compose one, sometimes two, occasionally three before rising,
							between three and five O’Clock, and usually from three to five in my
							walk round the Capitol Square— These Stanzas I retain in Memory and
							write down after returning home, sometimes before, sometimes after
							breakfast. It very seldom happens that after arranging a Stanza while I
							am walking, I forget part of the composition before committing it to
							writing; and then I am obliged to supply its place— Both the original
							and the substitute are then among the worst Stanzas of my poem— I never
							forget a Stanza, or a line which my self complacency whispers to me to
							be worth remembering— The rhyme is sometimes an excrutiating task— I
							read every day to <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef>, what I have composed in the twenty-four hours— She
							objected decidedly to the 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Stanza of the
							second Canto, and coming this day to the fair Copy of it I added two new
							ones to take off in part the force of the objection— I could not omit
							the Stanza without some substitution or leaving the action of the fable
							imperfect in one of its most important points— In the Evening I
							sometimes compose one, two or three Stanzas more, and my reading,
							independent of the Newspapers is now chiefly confined to Irish History,
							or to <persRef ref="byron-george">Lord Byron’s</persRef> poems in the
							Ottava Rima—a measure which he adopted not till after he had become
							familiar with the Italian Poets, but which after he had adopted it
							evidently became his favourite, and is to me the only pleasing part of
							his works. There is a vivacity, variety, and brilliancy in his use of
							the Stanza; well suited to keep my Poem at least nine years in my desk—
							He took from the Poets of <persRef ref="ariosto-ludovico"
								>Ariosto’s</persRef> School that tone of Irony or <hi rend="italic"
								>Persiflage</hi>, which constitutes the principal charm of all those
							writers and is that of <persRef ref="voltaire-francois"
								>Voltaire</persRef>. This I take up occasionally, but have found it
							impossible to preserve consistently—yet I am well aware that it is the
							Soul of this species of composition.</p>
