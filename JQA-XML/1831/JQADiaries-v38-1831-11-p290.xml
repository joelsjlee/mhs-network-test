						<p>Begun the version of the 35<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm—
								<persRef ref="roberdeau-mary">Miss Roberdeau</persRef> made for me a
							copy of my Stanzas upon the Valley at the foot of Penn’s Hill— I wrote a
							Letter to <persRef ref="quincy-eliza2">Miss E Susan Quincy</persRef>
							enclosing them for an Inscription to the drawing which she made some
							years since of the house in which I was born and of which I have
							requested from her a copy. <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="wainwright-jonathan">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wainwright</persRef> called on me at ten to accompany me to the
							Meeting of the Literary Convention, to which I had received a printed
							circular invitation.— They asked me if I should be willing to preside at
							the Meeting.— I told them I had understood that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gallatin had presided at the last year’s Meeting— He was
							certainly much more competent to the same service now than me, who had
							not been informed even of the objects of the Meeting. They said M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin had not presided last year; but a
								<persRef ref="bates-joshua2">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Bates</persRef> the President of Middlebury College, and that as the
							Meeting was attended by a considerable number of Gentlemen from other
							States who came by invitation, it was thought particularly desirable
							that the President should not be a resident of New-York. I said, in <pb
								n="291" type="ms"/>that case my services should be at the disposal
							of the Meeting. I accompanied them immediately. The Convention was held
							at the Assistant Alderman’s room in the City Hall— I was elected
							President of the Convention by nomination— Albert Gallatin and <persRef
								ref="livingston-edward3">Edward P. Livingston</persRef>, the
								Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi> Governor of the State were
							chosen Vice-Presidents—<persRef ref="delafield-john">John
								Delafield</persRef>, and<space/>Secretaries. For the proceedings of
							this Convention I must refer myself to the Newspapers, and to the
							pamphlet in which they are to be published. I found myself in a
							situation totally new and unexpected. Called to preside over a Meeting
							of Literary men, held in public, to discuss subjects of literature and
							Science, but of what specific character I had received no previous
							intimation— Of my unfitness for this station I had the most profound
							conviction—the meeting being not only public, but with Stenographers
							attending to report the proceedings in several of the daily papers;
							besides <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Stansberry</persRef> employed to report for the Convention itself— I
							had come without the most distant idea of presiding, and intending
							rather to listen than to take an active part in the proceedings myself—
							What could I do but implore a blessing from him who directs the steps of
							the man that walketh?— What can I do but abide in humble submission by
							his will? The Meeting was opened by prayer— A Letter was read from
								<persRef ref="u">Professor Pesaro</persRef>, and several Letters of
							excuse and apology— After some initiatory proceedings the meeting was
							adjourned till ten to-morrow Morning— Returning to my lodgings I
							received several visitors and numerous Cards— <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> with the portion of our family now journeying with
							us had left the City at Noon; proceeding to Philadelphia— Among my
							visitors was <persRef ref="radcliff-william">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Ratcliff</persRef>, heretofore Consul of the United
							States at Lima in Peru—appointed by me— He has a plan for making a
							Railway across the Isthmus of Panama, concerning which he left a Memoir
							with me; for which he is to call again before the end of the week and
							resume a conversation with me— I dined with the <persRef
								ref="kent-james">Ex-Chancellor Kent</persRef>. His relatives
								<persRef ref="hone-philip;hone-john">Philip and John Hone</persRef>,
							were there, and two or three other Gentlemen— <persRef
								ref="kent-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Kent</persRef>
							the only Lady.— In the Evening I called to see in his chamber <persRef
								ref="wolcott-oliver">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Oliver
								Wolcott</persRef>, who is lodging at this house— Had an hour’s
							conversation with him, and found him declining in the vale of years—
								<persRef ref="stone-william2">W. L. Stone</persRef>, the Editor of
							the Commercial Advertiser called, and spoke of his intention to address
							to me a series of Letters upon the subject of Masonry and Anti-Masonry—
							He said there was great misrepresentation upon the subject derogatory to
							the Memory of <persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt Clinton</persRef>,
							which it would be in his power to rectify— He is to see me again.— I
							spent the remainder of the Evening and supped with <persRef
								ref="sampson-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Sampson</persRef>, the Irish refugee, who was some years an
							inhabitant of Georgetown, near Washington— Met there <persRef

						<p><date>2. VI. </date>Wednesday.</p>
						<p>Attended the Literary Convention Morning and afternoon— A paper was read
							by <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lleras</persRef> of
							the Republic of Columbia, upon the subject of the State of Education in
							South-America generally, and in that Republic especially— A Committee
							was appointed to report a plan, for a National Literary and Scientific
							Institution— A Resolution that it is expedient to establish such an
							institution had been adopted by the last year’s Convention.— I was now
							placed upon this Committee— After the adjournment of the morning the
							Committee met at the house of the <persRef ref="matthews-james">Rev<hi
									rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
								M. Matthews</persRef>, and discussed the plan— Questions were
							started, what should be the title of the Society—Academy—Association
							Society—Institute—Institution; not very momentous which— Whether the
							numbers should be limited— How divided into Classes whether of domestic
							and foreign members—of Resident and honorary? and under what divisions
							of the Sciences— The practice of the French Institute was referred to—
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Matthews <pb n="292" type="ms"
							/>undertook to draw up the report— I dined in the Apartment of <persRef
								ref="sullivan-george">George Sullivan</persRef>, with him and his
							family— There was also a young Lawyer named <persRef ref="u"
								>Warner</persRef> engaged with Sullivan in a cause now upon trial
							before the <persRef ref="walworth-reuben">Chancellor of the State
								Walworth</persRef> in which individuals are claimants against the
							Trinity Church of this City.— A cause involving as M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sullivan says rights of property to the
							amount of two or three Millions of dollars.— The Convention met at 5 in
							the afternoon, and the plan for a National Literary and Scientific
							Society was reported. There was some discussion upon the title to be
							adopted, but that point was soon postponed for further consideration,
							and the main debate, a warm one was upon the question whether should be
							of a limited number. It was half past eight when the Convention
							adjourned— I had yesterday received invitations to visit the Libraries
							of the Mercantile and of the Mechanic Associations. A <persRef
								ref="wood-william5">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								Wood</persRef> had called upon me with a Letter from <persRef
								ref="brown-robert2">R. B. Brown</persRef> President of the
							Mercantile Library and I had agreed to go whenever I should have the
							time and this day I received a similar invitation to visit the
							Apprentices Library from <persRef ref="stephens-john2">John Stephens
									jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef> President of that
							Society— A second invitation this day from M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Brown included the members of the Convention, and I read it
							to them. The Presidents and a Committee from Both the Societies,
							attended the afternoon Meeting of the Convention, and immediately after
							the adjournment I accompanied the Committee’s and visited both the
							Libraries and reading room. As also the Lecture room of the American
							Lyceum— These are excellent Institutions. the Mercantile Library is for
							the benefit of the Merchants Clerks, and that of the Apprentices for the
							youth of the Mechanic Professions— At both I saw numbers of young men
							assiduously reading and both the Catalogues of the books, and several
							other pamphlets relating to both Institutions were given me— Also the
							pamphlet containing the proceedings of a Convention in May last, to form
							an American Lyceum— There was a Type-foundery which I was also to have
							seen but the adjournment of the Convention was too late, and it was shut
							up— After I returned to my lodgings M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Sullivan came and sat with me an hour in Conversation.</p>

						<p>I called this morning early upon my old friend <persRef
								ref="pitcairn-joseph">Joseph Pitcairn</persRef> who had visited me,
							and sent me an invitation to dine with him on Saturday.— I told him it
							was my intention to leave the City Saturday Morning; but that if I
							should not I would accept his invitation— I likewise called on <persRef
								ref="cushing-hannah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Cushing</persRef> at her relation’s 21. Beekman Street and made a
							small payment to her as had been requested by my Son <persRef
								key="adams-john2">John</persRef>— A ten O’Clock I attended the
							Meeting of the Literary Convention and took the Chair.— The Plan for a
							National Literary and Scientific Society was fully debated, and there
							was so much diversity and divergence of views upon exceedingly
							unessential and even minute that they were on the point of taking a
							question to postpone the further consideration of the subject until the
							annual Convention of the next year; when I took the Liberty of
							addressing to the Meeting some remarks— I observed that at the last
							Annual Meeting of the Convention, a Committee had been appointed <pb
								n="293" type="ms"/>to examine and report upon the expediency of
							establishing such a Society— That Committee had reported a Resolution to
							that effect which was adopted by the Convention. They had therefore
							resolved that such a Society should be instituted. The present
							Convention concurring in that opinion had appointed a Committee to form
							a plan, which was now before the Convention for consideration— The
							public would certainly expect that this Convention should do something
							more— There were debates and diversity of opinions upon points which I
							thought could easily be conciliated. The organization of such a Society
							would after all be a very simple thing— I presumed a Constitution for it
							could be drawn up by a Committee in 24 hours; but if after having been
							postponed from the last year to this, it should again be postponed from
							this year to the next, I saw no other prospect than that it would be
							postponed indefinitely— If such an institution should be established
							here, its principal utility must be effected by the Resident Members— It
							might derive and confer benefit by assembling at an annual meeting a few
							of its members from other parts of the Union— The fault of most of the
							Institutions of this kind in the United States was that they were little
							better than dead bodies— It was hardly worthwhile to create another of
							them, but much of the same character would it be to resolve every year
							that such a Society should be instituted and then have it undone, to be
							debated again the next year, when other men would be here, to whom the
							subject will be new, as it was now to me, and who would have to go over
							again the ground that we have explored. There was immediately proposed
							the appointment of a Committee to draw up and report a Constitution for
							the Society— <persRef ref="u">Lieutenant Park</persRef> as a delegate
							from West-Point read a paper proposing a National Institute of a very
							extensive character to be identified with this <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Ogilby</persRef> a young
							School-master of the City read a long paper upon a plan of instruction
							upon new principles as exemplified in a School of a <persRef
								ref="jacotot-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Jacotot</persRef> in Belgium— It was referred to a Committee— I
							dined at <persRef ref="wainwright-jonathan">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Wainwright’s</persRef> and met there <persRef
								ref="jay-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter A.
								Jay</persRef>, <persRef ref="ogden-david3">David B. Ogden</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hone</persRef>, and
							several other Gentlemen— After dinner at 6. I returned to the
							Convention, which had been already an hour in Session— <persRef
								ref="woodbridge-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Woodbridge</persRef> was reading a Report upon the expediency of
							introducing the Bible as a Classic to be studied in Schools and
							Colleges. After the Convention adjourned, the Committee to draw up a
							Constitution met and agreed upon the substance of the Articles—Members
							not to exceed two hundred—Resident and foreign Members—4. Classes 1.
							Mathematical and Physical Science 2 Moral and Intellectual Science 3.
							Literature 4. Fine Arts—An electing Committee of 15 to constitute the
							Society—Application to be made to the Legislature of New-York for an Act

							Morning for Washington— To have her Carriage and horses there, and to

							noon.— <persRef ref="radcliff-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Ratcliff</persRef> came again this morning, and I returned his

							practicability and expediency of a Railway across the Isthmus of Panama—
							And said it would no where have to encounter <pb n="294" type="ms"/>an
							elevation of more than 300 feet— The principal obstacle to the

								<persRef ref="channing-henry2">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Henry

								<persRef ref="dewindt-john">Mr De Wint</persRef> was in the City.—
							He said he had just paid a visit to <persRef ref="wolcott-oliver">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Wolcott</persRef>, but found him much
							changed and as he thought decayed in mind— Attended the Literary
							Convention— The Constitution of the National Literary and Scientific

							there shall be a Committee of fifteen, to be appointed by this
							Convention, who, or a majority of whom shall have power to elect
							eighty-five others, and these with the Committee or so many of them as
							may assemble at the call of the Committee shall constitute the first

							A Resolution was passed authorizing the Committee to call the first
							Meeting of the Society at such time and place as they may deem
							expedient—and that they take measures to obtain an act of incorporation—
							It was agreed that the Convention should adjourn to-morrow— I did not
							attend this afternoon’s Meeting.— In the decisive measures for
							constituting the Society the only difficulties were in the Committee—
							There were none in the Convention— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Gallatin and other members had a repugnance almost invincible to assume
							the attitude of constituting ourselves a National Society of Literature
							Science, and the Arts—and M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Gallatin
							proposed that we should elect 100 members to constitute the Society,
							excluding ourselves altogether— I said it seemed to me that under the
							appearance of a fastidious delicacy this would be assuming much more
							than it would be to invite associates to join us in the formation of a
							Society— For while disclaiming all pretensions of literature and science
							ourselves, we should select one hundred men without consulting them and
							without concert among them—and summon them to constitute a Literary and
							Scientific Society— We were placed in the dilemma of forming a
							self-constituted Society, or passing a Self-denying ordinance, and of
							the two I preferred the former— After the adjournment I called to visit
								<persRef ref="davis-charles2;u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
									M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> C. A. Davis</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="lawrence-william2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W B.

								ref="mcilvaine-charles">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Ilvaine</persRef> of Brookline
							attended the Convention this morning, and I requested him to inform
								<persRef ref="roberdeau-mary">Miss Roberdeau</persRef> that I should
							not leave the City till Monday Morning, which he promised to do.— I
							dined at <persRef ref="hone-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Philip Hone’s</persRef> with a large party of Gentlemen and several
							Ladies. I had much conversation with <persRef ref="kent-james"
								>Ex-Chancellor Kent</persRef> and urged him earnestly to give his
							aid to the establishment of this new Society which he said he would; but
							faintly— It is considered as an Institution hostile to the Columbia
							College— I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kent I would shew him
							some of my Poetry— We had at table much Conversation upon <persRef
								ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef>
							<persRef ref="othello">Othello</persRef> and <persRef ref="hamlet"
								>Hamlet</persRef>— And M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hone invited

								Sullivan</persRef> spent half an hour with me this Morning.— A
							person by the name of <persRef ref="hunt-davis">Davis Hunt</persRef>
							came and introduced himself to me as an Anti-Mason— He gave me a Sermon,
							preached by <persRef ref="armstrong-lebbeus">Lebbeus Armstrong</persRef>
							a seceding Mason late Pastor of the Presbyterian Church of Northampton
							and Edinburgh in the State of New-York. It was delivered in Edinburgh,
							Saratoga County on the 12<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of September
							last; and published by request— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Armstrong’s Sermon is upon the murder of <persRef ref="morgan-william2"
								>Morgan</persRef>, but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hunt is a
							disappointed applicant for an Office in the Custom-house, and suggested
							to me that there was much mismanagement in that department since a
							newspaper libeller, a Jew by the name of <persRef ref="noah-mordecai"
								>Noah</persRef> has been appointed Surveyor of the Port— He says he
							has filled the subordinate offices of the Customs with Jews, his
							relatives and that they are fattening like leaches upon public plunder—
							I attended the Literary Convention, which after some closing business,
							and a prayer from <persRef ref="yates-andrew">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r.</hi> Yates</persRef>, adjourned without day— A vote of
							thanks was passed to the City Corporation for the use of the Hall and to
							the President for the fair and impartial discharge of his duties— I
							returned my thanks as well as I was able, but with a mortified feeling
							of deficiency in words to express that which I would have said.— My
							remarks were well received, and perhaps not the worse for their
							unpretending simplicity— That this business has gone through without
							discreditable exposure of incompetency for so high and distinguished a
							position I give thanks to God— After the adjournment of the Convention,
							the Committee for electing members of the Literary Society remained in
							Session about an hour— Each member present gave a list of the persons in
							the United States whom he thought best qualified to be members of the
							Institution and they were classed, each in one of the four divisions of
							the Society. I gave a list chiefly of Citizens of Massachusetts.— The
							members of the Committee Residents in the City of New-York agreed to
							have a meeting next Thursday Evening to proceed further in making their
							Selections. I returned to my lodgings. <persRef ref="swift-joseph"
								>General Swift</persRef> and <persRef ref="monroe-james2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> James Monroe</persRef> called on me
							there— General Swift brought me a note from <persRef
								ref="roberdeau-mary">Miss Roberdeau</persRef> mentioning her
							disappointment that I had not gone this Morning and saying that she must
							go on Monday— I desired General Swift to assure her that I would meet
							her at the boat Monday Morning— James Monroe appeared to be under great
							anxiety, from a fear of the publication of <persRef ref="rhea-john">John
								Rhea’s</persRef> Letter, stating as facts things which <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>

								Gouverneur</persRef> had called upon me several times, but I had
							been absent from my lodgings— I dined with the <persRef
								ref="matthews-james">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> D<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Matthews</persRef> with only his
							family. <persRef ref="mathews-ann">His wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="mathews-joanna;mathews-gertrude">two daughters</persRef>— He is
							a presbyterian Clergyman of great respectability, and has taken the most
							active interest in these Literary Conventions, in the Establishment of
							the new University, and in the formation of the new Literary Society— He
							had early in the week invited me to dine with him this day; but I had
							then declined under the expectation of leaving the City this Morning.
							Afterwards I made a conditional engagement with <persRef
								ref="pitcairn-joseph">Mr Pitcairn</persRef>— But when I concluded to
							remain till Monday D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Matthews immediately
							claimed his former invitation as an engagement, and I wrote a note of
							apology to M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Pitcairn, who had reminded me
							of my conditional promise to him—and I offered to dine with him
							to-morrow if it should suit his convenience, but he was engaged. D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Matthews conversed with me fully upon his
							anxiety for the Establishment of this new Literary and Scientific
							Institution; and seemed to expect much aid to it from my co-operation.
								<pb n="296" type="ms"/>I assured him I should be happy to give it
							any assistance in my power, but expressed to him my full conviction that
							all the real usefulness of such an Institution must be accomplished by
							the zeal and energy of the members Resident in the City— Of this he
							appeared to be sensible, but he enquired, if upon the organization of
							the Society, I should be elected its President, I should be willing to
							deliver an Inaugural Discourse at its first Meeting— I told him I should
							be willing to do any thing within the compass of my power— From dinner I
							went and spent part of an Evening with <persRef ref="kent-james"
								>Ex-Chancellor Kent</persRef>—talking of his Commentaries—of
								<persRef ref="blackstone-william">Blackstone</persRef> and <persRef

								ref="littleton-thomas">Littletons</persRef> Tenures and <persRef
								ref="justinian">Justinian</persRef>. I read to him my Stanza’s on

							much both of <persRef ref="gray-thomas">Gray’s</persRef> Elegy and of
								<persRef ref="goldsmith-oliver">Goldsmith’s</persRef> deserted
							Village— I also talked with him and <persRef ref="kent-william">his

								>Shakespear’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="othello">Othello</persRef> and <persRef ref="desdemona"
								>Desdemona</persRef>, <persRef ref="juliet">Juliet</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="imogen">Imogen</persRef> and <persRef ref="miranda"
								>Miranda</persRef>.— I observed to him how much of the charm and
							interest of the Tragedy of <persRef ref="romeo">Romeo</persRef> and
							Juliet, depended upon the age of Juliet—a child—in her fourteenth year.
							How emphatically the Poet had marked that age; and how stupidly the
							Stagemen had changed the age from fourteen to nineteen— I said I took
							little interest in the character of Desdemona; whose sensual passions I
							thought over ardent so as to reconcile her to a passion for a black man—
							And although faithful to him I thought the Poet had painted her as a
							Lady of rather easy virtue—very different from the innocence of Miranda,
							or the rosy prudency of Imogen— The Chancellor did not entirely agree
							with me in this estimate of Desdemona— His Son still less— They thought
							better of my view of the character of <persRef ref="hamlet"
								>Hamlet</persRef>.— I spent the close of the Evening with George
							Sullivan, and his family.— I have taken a very severe Cold and Cough— I
							received Notes from <persRef ref="burr-david">D. H. Burr</persRef> with

						<p>I set out this morning with <persRef ref="sullivan-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Sullivan</persRef>, to go and
							hear <persRef ref="hawks-francis">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hawkes</persRef> preach; but on the way we met one of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sullivan’s <persRef ref="u">sons</persRef>
							returning who told us that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hawkes was
							confined at home, with a cold and hoarseness, and would not preach
							either morning or afternoon. We went therefore and heard <persRef
								ref="matthews-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Matthews</persRef> preacher at what is called the Dutch Church—but
							there is nothing of the dutch language left in the City— The only
							difference to be remarked in the forms of service in this Church from
							those of the Presbyterian and Congregational Churches is that here the
							people sit during the Pastor’s prayer as well as during the Sermon. They
							perform no part of the service either standing or kneeling—the Sermon of
								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Matthew’s was temperate and
							sensible—not brilliant— Its doctrine was not <persRef ref="calvin-john"
								>Calvinistic</persRef>—for his doctrine was that the Salvation of
							men depended upon themselves— He gave notice that <persRef
								ref="cox-samuel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Coxe</persRef> would
							preach at that Church at seven this Evening, on revivals in Religion.
							After Church I called upon <persRef ref="stone-william2">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> William L. Stone</persRef> Editor of
							the Commercial Advertiser at his lodgings— He had sent me word by
								<persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stansbury</persRef>
							that he was confined to his chamber by a severe attack of the influenza.
							I found him still in his chamber though convalescent— I had a
							conversation of an hour with him upon the proposal which he had made to
							me, of publishing addressed to me a series of Letters upon Masonry and
							Anti-Masonry— I asked him, if I understood him well, that his object in
							that publication would be the abolition of the Institution of
							Free-Masonry in the United States— He said certainly—that was and had
							long been his most earnest desire. I then observed that I hoped he would
							then take no views of the subject; the tendency of which <pb n="297"
								type="ms"/>would be favourable to the continuance of the order— I
							had reference chiefly to a passage of his letter to me in which he
							stated that one object of his publication, would be to give a view of
							the good which Masonry had done and was designed to produce heretofore.
							I told him that since my last Conversation with him, a Sermon by
								<persRef ref="armstrong-lebbeus">Lebbeus Armstrong</persRef> had
							been put into my hands, in which it is charged not positively as a fact,
							but as a report— It is said, that the grand Generalissimo of the
							American Encampment, wrote to some of the Western Lodges directing that
								<persRef ref="morgan-william2">Morgan’s</persRef> publication must
							be suppressed cost what it would, even to the shedding of blood— The
							Generalissimo of the American Encampment is not named, but it was
								<persRef ref="clinton-dewitt">De Witt Clinton</persRef>— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Stone said M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r.</hi> Clinton had been grossly slandered upon this subject— That
							when the manuscript was fraudulently obtained from him, a special
							Messenger had been employed to bring it to New-York— That the Grand
							Chapter were then in Session, and there were then delegations meeting
							with them from other grand lodges in various parts of the United States—
							That <persRef ref="knapp-samuel">Samuel L. Knapp</persRef> was then a
							delegate from the grand lodge at Boston— That the Messenger delivered
							the Manuscript, in great agitation— That it was referred to a Committee
							of which Knapp was Chairman—who reported that the manuscript was private
							property and should be returned to the person to whom it belonged— And
							Stone said he never heard a severer rebuke than was then given by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clinton who presided in the Chapter to the
							Messenger who had brought the manuscript and who was very unwilling to
							take it back— This was on the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of
							September and the Messenger must have left Batavia, before Morgan’s
							arrest which was on the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>— This Story of
							Morgan in the hands of <persRef ref="scott-walter">Scott</persRef> or
								<persRef ref="cooper-james">Cooper</persRef> would make a novel or
							romance of irresistible pathos—and what a Drama would <persRef
								ref="shakespeare-william">Shakespear</persRef> have made of it?—
								<persRef ref="storrs-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> H. W.
								Storrs</persRef> heretofore a member of Congress from the western
							part of the State, but now a resident in the City, and a fellow lodger
							in the same house with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stone came up to
							his chamber after dinner— And also <persRef ref="stone-susannah">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Stone</persRef>— I came away, and
							dined in family with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sullivan— After
							dinner I visited <persRef ref="gouverneur-samuel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r.</hi> Sam<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> L.
								Gouverneur</persRef>—and saw there <persRef ref="monroe-maria">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Gouverneur</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="hay-eliza">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hay</persRef>—and
								Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
							<persRef ref="u">Price</persRef>, <persRef ref="livingston-edward3"
								>Livingston</persRef>, and <persRef ref="u">De Peyster</persRef> who
							had been dining there— In the Evening I went with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sullivan, and heard D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Samuel H. Cox deliver a Sermon upon
							Revivals of Religion— He took three texts one from the <persRef
								ref="zechariah">Prophet Zachariah</persRef>—one from <persRef
								ref="paul">Paul’s</persRef> Epistle to the Galatians, and one from
							the Epistle to the Ephesians as illustrative of each other— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> Cox is eloquent— His mode of delivery is
							rather that of grace, and interesting conversation than of written
							composition.— His language is scriptural, not wholly void of elegance,
							but not remarkable for it— He made an observation upon <persRef
								ref="hume-david">Hume’s</persRef> argument against the credibility
							of Miracles, which struck me as new and ingenious— He said the Evidence
							of the Miracles of Christ was so full, so strong and irresistible that
							Hume despaired of questioning the facts, and that his forlorn hope of
							argument was to maintain that no Evidence could prove Miracles— He knew
							that if the evidence could once be admitted, it was overwhelming it was
							vain to attempt with standing it— His only resource was to exclude it
							altogether— The house was very much crowded, and I understood there was
							now a Revival in full operation in the midst of this City— D<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Cox, with whom I some years since made a
							passage in a Steam-boat to Providence has been very kind, and civil to
							me here— He has constantly attended the Literary Convention; and has
							taken an active part in their proceedings.— He brought and introduced to
							me <persRef ref="coxe-arthur;cox-samuel2">his two Sons</persRef>; and
							sent me a Sermon recently preached and published by him—entitled
							Salvation achieved only in the present Life—which I am to read
							hereafter— I went home and supped with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Sullivan. <persRef ref="francis-john">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								John W. Francis</persRef> came in and sat with me an hour— He took
							back the life of <persRef ref="davy-humphrey">Sir Humphrey
								Davy</persRef> in two Volumes— I regretted I could not even skim
							over it; but who is sufficient for these things? Every instant of my
							time here has been absorbed— D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Francis
							gave me his Address delivered on the 15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							of May last to the Philolexian Society in Columbia College, in which
							there is a very interesting biographical Memoir of the late <persRef

							written Letters this Morning to my Sons <persRef key="adams-john2"
								>John</persRef> at Washington and <persRef key="adams-charles2"

								Physick</persRef> came this morning as he had promised, and after a
							full and severe examination had no other advice to give me than
							patience— He thought if he should take away the immediate cause of my
							complaint it would be thrown back upon my lungs—and that to remove the
							superfluous tumour on the head would require confinement for several
							days and might be followed by an attack of Erisypelas. I requested his
							bill, but he said he had none—for he had done nothing— I received this
							Morning a Letter from <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">my
								wife</persRef>; who speaks doubtfully of coming here, but thinks if
							she does of bringing <persRef key="adams-john2">John’s</persRef>
							<persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">youngest child</persRef> with her— She
							desired me to apply to <persRef ref="mease-isabella">Miss
								Mease</persRef>, to ascertain if lodgings could be procured at
								<persRef ref="u">Madame Coulon’s</persRef> where some years since
								<persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Thomas B. Johnson</persRef> lodged. <persRef ref="mease-james">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Mease</persRef> called on me, and said
							that Miss Mease was confined to the house with a swollen face, but
							offered to go with me himself to Madame Coulon’s and went— The
							apartments are not so neat as when they were occupied by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson, and the furniture is several
							years older After a short visit to the Athenaeum I went with <persRef
								ref="mckenney-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								M’Kenney</persRef> to the Rooms of a young Artist by the name of
								<persRef ref="inman-henry">Inman</persRef> a very promising painter—
							He had there a very fine Portrait of <persRef ref="marshall-john">Chief
								Justice Marshall</persRef>—much superior as it appeared to me to
							that of <persRef ref="harding-chester">Harding</persRef>. There was also
							a Lithographic establishment engaged upon a work of Natural History by
							two young men of the name of <persRef ref="doughty-john2;doughty-thomas"
								>Doughty</persRef>—and for which work I subscribed— I wrote to
								<persRef ref="middleton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Middleton</persRef> making the enquiries concerning the Russian
							Platina Coins and metal, and left my Letter at his lodgings not finding
							him at home— I made enquiries also upon the same subject of Platina, of
								<persRef ref="keating-william">Professor Keating</persRef>, who
							promised to inform me where I could find the best account of that
							Metal.— <persRef ref="poger-frederick">Frederick Poger</persRef>, was a

								M’Kenney</persRef> was here again to day, and I paid several morning

								Middleton’s</persRef> lodgings, but he was not at home— At <persRef
								ref="ingersoll-charles">Charles J. Ingersoll’s</persRef>— He told me
							that his brother <persRef ref="ingersoll-edward">Edward</persRef> was a
							Mason; though he himself was not—nor his brother <persRef

						<p><date>12. V. </date>Saturday.— From Philadelphia to Baltimore.</p>
						<p>At seven this Morning I left Philadelphia in the Steam-boat William Penn,

								ref="vaughan-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John

							introducing to me, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Barclay</persRef> a respectable citizen of Philadelphia, a fellow
							passenger to Baltimore on a visit to <persRef ref="u;u">his two
								Sons</persRef>, whom he had placed at the Jesuits College there. His
							reason for placing them there he said was that the discipline at that
							College was more severe than at any other in the United States— There
							were numerous other passengers, none of them however known to me, except
								<persRef ref="adams-william3">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> William
								B. Adams</persRef> of Marblehead, who claimed acquaintance with me,
							from the time of my Residence at S<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							Petersburg in 1810. and whom I saw at Marblehead when I visited that
							place with the late <persRef ref="eustis-william">Governor
								Eustis</persRef> in 1824— He has been since, and may be now a member
							of the Massachusetts Legislature; and being a <pb n="302" type="ms"/>man
							of pliable principles, is going to Washington I suppose in search of a
							place. There was a <persRef ref="janvier-william">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Janvier</persRef> of Philadelphia, who
							introduced himself to me, but who disembarked with his horse at
							Newcastle.— At Chester there came on board three new passengers
							concerning whom suspicions were circulated round the boat that they were
							of the order of Industry; but they exhibited no proofs of it this day—
							At half past ten we took the barge at the Delaware City— Passed the lock
							and a marble Tablet erected on the bank of the Canal to commemorate the
							accomplishment of the work— We reached the black River landing at one,
							and took the Steamboat Charles Carroll of Carrollton <persRef
								ref="chaytor-james">Captain Chaytor</persRef>— The weather, chilling
							cold confined me almost the whole day to the Cabins of the boats— I had
							no book to read, no pleasant fellow traveller for conversation, but I
							composed four Stanza’s of the version of the 37<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Psalm, and they amused the day— At six in the Evening we
							reached Baltimore, and I took a bed-chamber at <persRef
								ref="barnum-david">Barnum’s</persRef> Hotel supped at the Ordinary.
							In the Evening I was visited by <persRef ref="goldsborough-robert">M<hi

								<persRef ref="munro-isaac">Isaac Munro</persRef>, the Editor of the

							I return to Washington with less tranquility of mind than at the last
							and the preceding Winter— That before me is of an aspect to which I look
							with an aching heart.— One experiment which I have made upon this
							Journey has been successful as far as it could succeed— I mean that of
							employing my time— I have lost none— Since I left Quincy I have composed
							23 Stanzas of versions of the Psalms—all bad—but as good as I could make

						<p>According to my practices heretofore I resumed the reading of three

							Clergymen of Boston; but the Committee were authorised to send it to
							other individuals—whomsoever they thought fit—and they have sent one to
							me— I began writing an answer, but did not finish it— I began reading
								<persRef ref="bernard-david">Bernard’s</persRef> Light on Masonry;
							and read the forms of admission of the entered Apprentice and Fellow
							Craft— It is matter of curious speculation, how such degrading forms,
							such execrable Oaths and such cannibal penalties should have been
							submitted to by wise, spirited and virtuous men— It is humiliating to
							the human character— Is it interest?—fear? pride? the danger or the
							mortification of retreating? Or is there something in the wild,
							incoherent mixture of pure morals and high religious devotion with
							secret and mystical rites and atrocious cruelty that has an irresistible
							influence over human action— The <persRef ref="mahomet"
								>Mahometan</persRef> Religion is a memorable example of this— Some
							of the bloody sacrifices of antiquity are to be accounted for only thus—
							I cannot think of it but with melancholy feelings.</p>

						<p>Began the version of the 34<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm—one of
							those with which I have found the greatest difficulty and of which I
							have been obliged finally to put up with a complete failure— There are
							some of which the versification comes to me almost as easily as prose—
							Some which I labour painfully for hours, and give up in despair;
							substituting a mutilated fragment for the whole Psalm—and some, upon
							which after ranging through many varieties of expression altogether
							dissatisfactory, I finally alight upon a turn which pleases my fancy—
							There is an agitation of mind in this habit of composition resembling
							the intense interest of a gamester in the fluctuations of his fortune;
							and not unfrequently I am quite delighted with my success in producing a
							Stanza, which upon reperusal a week after sickens me as flat stale and

							in answering the Circular from the Committee on the question of
							imprisonment for debt: my opinions are not all favourable to their
							views, and it might be more prudent for me to give a short and unmeaning
							answer to them; evading in substance their question—but it is not in my

							and until lately, with occasional and great success— But the runs of
							luck in life, are as at whist— The tide in the Affairs of men when it
							has once begun to ebb, will go down— This free and bold expression of my

							form only one, I have therefore now finished the latter in the same

									>r</hi> Clay’s</persRef> prospects for the Presidency, but much
							gratified at his election to the Senate of the U.S—by the Legislature of

								Sewall</persRef>— Had conversation with him upon the different modes
							of warming rooms— I told him I had a suspicion that the Anthracite Coal,
							emitted into the atmosphere a subtle and impalpable dust which settled
							upon the lungs, and occasioned inflammation, colds and coughs— And
							generalizing the remark I expressed that all the modes of warming the
							atmosphere in cold weather, had material influence upon the health, and
							especially upon all persons with weak lungs— I advised him to write a
							Dissertation or Lecture upon the subject, which he seemed much inclined
							to do; and I thought it would come within the scope of <persRef
								ref="thompson-benjamin">Count Rumford’s</persRef> donation to the
							Academy of Arts and Sciences at Boston, for prize dissertations on heat—
							He enumerated the different modes of warming rooms—by Coal of various
							kinds—by wood of various kinds—by open chimneys, by grates—by heated
							Stoves of brick and of iron—by Charcoal and by heated air circulated
							through pipes and flues from fires below— Each of these processes for
							communicating artificial heat to the atmosphere must affect in different
							degrees the lungs by <pb n="310" type="ms"/>which it is breathed, and to
							these sources I believe may be traced a large portion of the
							consumptions which terminate so many lives— I received this morning a
							printed invitation signed by several inhabitants of this place, to
							attend a Meeting at the City Hall at half past six this Evening to
							consider the expediency of establishing a Lyceum in this City— I went
							accordingly— There were thirty or forty persons present— I was chosen
							Chairman, a Committee of five were appointed to report a plan of
							Constitution for a Lyceum which they did, and it was adopted Article by
							Article— A Committee was appointed to nominate Officers— They nominated
							me for President and <persRef ref="laurie-james">D<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Laurie</persRef> for corresponding Secretary— I desired
							to be excused, not being a permanent resident here; and when here much
							occupied— I was excused and <persRef ref="smith-samuel">Samuel Harrison
								Smith</persRef> chosen President. The Meeting passed a vote of
							thanks to me for presiding; and a member proposed that I should be
							elected an honorary member— I had entered my name as an ordinary member
							and requested the mover to withdraw his motion which he did. I came home
							between nine and ten— There is a Letter in the Newspapers from <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>, in
							answer to an Anti masonic Committee in Indiana— He refuses to say what

							Reform which had passed the House of Commons— An Article upon the

							in the North American Review last July has been republished in London,
							and was much quoted in that debate, chiefly by the Peers in opposition
							to the Bill— I had read in the New-York American, an extract from a
							Speech by <persRef ref="boscawen-edward">Lord Falmouth</persRef> in
							which this Article was noticed— Everett had not seen it, and I sent him
							the New-York American, containing the extract from the Speech— After

								Dana</persRef> has in the Intelligencer of this Morning an
							Advertisement of a full column announcing the publication by him of a
							great work upon the Geography of North and South America— He brought me
							this Morning a Petition to Congress, that they would order all the
							Surveyors, and Officers of the Land-Office to furnish him with materials
							for his book, and that they would grant him the privilege of franking
							Letters by the Post-Office— The man appeared to me to be so illiterate,
							that I should have doubted his power to spell his own name. I told him I
							thought there would be great difficulty to obtain from Congress the
							prayers of his petition, for they could not enjoin upon any of their
							officers to furnish him materials for his book without making them
							compensation for extra labour; which they could not do from the public
							funds—and they could not set the example of granting to one individual
							the privilege of franking Letters, without obliging them to grant the
							same right to many others— He said he believed then he would give it up;
							although the work had been his employment for many years, and had cost
							him many thousand dollars. He kept me I think upwards of an hour,
							talking to me what I thought nonsense. I walked before dinner and called

						<p>Finished the version of the 44<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm—and

							Remarkably different from all the other Psalms—and especially
							noticeable, as quoted in the Epistle to the Hebrews. Chapter 1, v. 8, 9.
							and there directly applied to Christ the Son of God— I selected for this
							Psalm a different measure from that which I have generally used for the
							rest; a six line instead of an eight line Stanza— I expected to have
							more difficulty than with any of the rest, and approached it with
							terror— I found it the easiest of all, and am better satisfied with it
							than with that of any other than I have yet undertaken— <persRef
								ref="coburn-john">John Coburn</persRef> was here— He was several

							before dinner— I went in to the Hall of the House of Representatives,
