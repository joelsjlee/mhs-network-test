						<p>Hiccocks</p>
						<p>A man by the name of <persRef ref="u">Hiccocks</persRef> came to propose
							that he should brush a wash over all the Gilt-Picture and Looking-glass
							frames Lamps or indeed any thing Gilt, at 75 Cents or a dollar each— He
							said it was a Chinese wash, and he had been to China to procure it— The
							object is to protect the gilding from flies, or from tarnishing— I got
							rid of him by allowing him to try the experiment of his wash upon the
							frame of <persRef key="adams-john">my fathers</persRef> last Portrait by
								<persRef ref="stuart-gilbert">Stewart</persRef>. My Son <persRef
								key="adams-john2">John</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="greenleaf-william">W. C. Greenleaf</persRef>, spent the whole
							day at Georgetown, engaged upon the inspection and housing of flour—
							After an interval of 25 days news is at last received from Liverpool—but
							it comes from Charleston South-Carolina brought by a British vessel
							which sailed on the 14<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of February— The
							political intelligence is of an undecided character and so is the
							commercial— <persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Adams</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="hellen-mary">Mary</persRef> spent this Evening at <persRef
								key="frye-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Frye’s</persRef>. My composition and my copying occupied the day— The
							first Stanzas of the fourth Canto of <persRef ref="macmurrough-dermot"
								>Dermot</persRef>, were easy, and one of them among the most
							pleasing to myself in the Poem; but I have now come to one of the most
							difficult passages of the Story and one Stanza worried me the whole
							Evening— The constant tension of mind which now engages even my walking
							hours has already produced a cessation of bodily circulations the effect
							of which is threatening— I read about half the first Canto of <persRef
								ref="donjuan">Don Juan</persRef>; a poem about as licentious as
								<persRef ref="voltaire-francois">Voltaire’s</persRef> Pucelle, or
								<persRef ref="lafontaine-jean">La Fontaines</persRef> Tales— I took
							a second walk after dinner of about half an hour— Wrote to my Son
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>.</p>

						<p>I walked before Breakfast to Georgetown, and saw the wharves covered with

								key="frye-carolina">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi> Frye</persRef>
							and her son <persRef ref="frye-thomas">Thomas</persRef> dined with us— I
							drew a check upon the U.S. Branch Bank at Boston for 2000 dollars,
							deposited at the Branch Bank here and a check for the same in favour of
							my Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef>— Signed also with him a
							Note to the Union Bank at Georgetown for 5000 dollars at 60 days— The
							Packet Sylvanus Jenkins arrived at New-York the 31<hi rend="superscript"
								>st.</hi> of March— Sailed from Liverpool 13. February, one day
							before the British Ship arrived at Charleston— The information brought
							by her being of the same character. I finished the fair copy of the
							second Canto of <persRef ref="macmurrough-dermot">Dermot</persRef>;
							severely labouring upon three or four Stanzas of the fourth— There is an
							account in <persRef ref="leland-thomas">Leland</persRef> of a battle won
							by <persRef ref="declare-richard">Strongbow’s</persRef> first detachment
							of Britons by their driving upon the people of Waterford a herd of
							cattle which they had gathered by foraging parties for their subsistence
							in the Fort— This incident partaking of the ludicrous appeared proper to
							be introduced into a burlesque Poem— But the bullocks gored me almost as
							badly as they did the men of Waterford, and I was finally obliged to
							drive through them scourge in hand and at the risk of a tossing— I
							bethought myself of looking into <persRef ref="plutarch">Plutarch’s</persRef> Life of <persRef ref="pyrrhus">Pyrrhus</persRef> for the
							battle won by him over the Romans by the trampling of his Elephants
							which might furnish a simile or parallel for the Irish Bulls— I found
							the incident twice mentioned by Plutarch, but no details and nothing
							descriptive— So I gave up my Simile but I fell upon another anecdote in
							the life of Pyrrhus that was so exquisitely ridiculous that I could not
							resist the temptation of throwing it into a Stanza: though not
							perceiving that I can any where introduce it into my Tale of Dermot—
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> went home with M<hi rend="superscript"

								grivois</hi> (the English Language has no word to express such

						<p><date>3. IV:30. </date>Easter Sunday— Sun rose 5.43</p>
						<p>W. S. and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Smith</p>
						<p>Walk to the race ground before breakfast. At the Presbyterian Church,
							heard <persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Smith</persRef> from Hebrews 7:26 “For such an high Priest became
							us, who is holy harmless, undefiled, separate from Sinners, and made
							higher than the Heavens.” A communion discourse, upon the atonement and
							far less pleasing to me than the last I had heard from the same person—
							Solemn nonsense, and inconceivable absurdity— This is the impression,
							which I never can remove from my mind, when I hear a Calvinistic
							preacher hammering upon that everlasting anvil of the atonement.
							“Incredulus adi”— I disbelieve and I hate— It is always to me an
							admonition of the weakness of the human intellect— That the execution as
							a malefactor of one person, the Creator of all worlds, eighteen hundred
							years ago, should have redeemed me, born nearly eighteen Centuries after
							his death from eternal damnation, is not only too shocking for my
							belief, but I ask myself what there can be above the level of the beasts
							which perish, in the animated being that can believe it— A melancholy
							monument of mental aberration and impotence— M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Smith’s administration of the Communion was nevertheless
							solemn and impressive— Members of other Churches were as usual
							invited—but I did not partake— Not from any scruple of my own; but
							because disbelieving their creed, sharing the communion with them, might
							seem to them, either a profession of their faith or an intrusion upon
							their Solemnities— The ceremony was long, and it was two O’Clock before
							I got home— <persRef ref="smith-william-steuben;smith-catherine-johnson"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>and<hi rend="superscript"

								<persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Johnsons</persRef> at Weston. There came up suddenly a heavy
							thundergust; followed by rain all the Evening— I added two Stanza’s upon
								<persRef ref="pyrrhus">Pyrrhus’s</persRef> method of curing the
							Spleen, and laboured all the Evening upon one Stanza of <persRef
								ref="macmurrough-dermot">Dermot</persRef>, without deliverance.</p>

						<p>Rain almost the whole Night, and great part of this day— Fog and a Sultry
							South East wind. I suffered severely with the Tooth-ache, and
							inflammation of the Cheek— Finished this Morning the versification of
							the 104<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm—composed in the course of
							the day seven or eight Stanzas of <persRef ref="macmurrough-dermot"
								>Dermot</persRef>—copying also twelve Stanzas of the third Canto— In

								Cranch</persRef> who told me that he had prepared a paper upon the
							Common Law, to be read next Winter at the Columbian Institute, which he
							proposed to send to me, and requested me to read— I promised to read it
							attentively. There was further news from Europe, an arrival from Havre
							accounts from Paris to the 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of February—
							A reported Insurrection at Modena in Italy— I read about half the second
							Canto of <persRef ref="donjuan">Don Juan</persRef>— The Description of
							the Shipwreck is terrific— There is in this writer a profusion of
							thought, beyond every other with whom I ever All his descriptions are
							minute, much more so than that of any Flemish Painter— And he is equally
							remarkable in catching the picturesque of natural Scenery of Human
							Passion and of Sentiment— There is not a nerve, a sinew a capillary tube
							in the human frame, but he will turn it into a Stanza— And there is a
							perpetual coniscation of brilliant wit running through the whole— His
							descriptions of sexual Sensuality, are those of a man meditating upon
							his own excesses, and supplying so far as he can by Speculation the
							place of pleasures he can no longer enjoy. The imagination of a Eunuch
							dwells more and longer upon the material of Love than that of man or
							woman— It is such a mind too, brutified by the same cause, which could
							alone give such a description as he does of the Shipwreck— Animal Life
							and Death is all that he sees or feels— He has no Sentiment but
							sensuality.</p>

						<p>There was a very heavy gale of wind in the Night— Almost a hurricane—then
							it cleared off this morning with a brisk Northwester: blew fresh all day
							and subsided to a cool calm in the Evening. I was severely suffering all
							day with a tooth-ache—and swolen right cheek. I visited before dinner
								<persRef ref="gunnell-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gunnell</persRef> the dentist, to get him to extract what I took to
							be a fish bone, and which has been troublesome to me, from a few days
							after my teeth were last put in order, by a dentist— That is about
							eighteen Months— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gunnell took it out, but
							assured me it was not a fish-bone; but an infant tooth— It did not at
							all relieve my pain, which on the contrary my dinner sharpened beyond
							any thing I had suffered before. My thorn in the flesh must be pricking
							me somewhere: and when dislodged from one spot nestles in another— I
							walked round the Capitol Square before breakfast, and stopp’d at
								<persRef ref="elliot-jonathan">Jonathan Elliots</persRef> to answer
							a question in a note received from him but he was gone to market.
								<persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Huntt</persRef> was here with a projection of the intended Rail-road
							from Baltimore to this City. <persRef ref="polk-josiah">M<hi

							had been formerly introduced to me by <persRef ref="chambers-ezekiel"
									>Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Chambers</persRef> the
							Senator from Maryland. He has resided several years among the
							Northwestern Indians, and has a Manuscript Volume concerning them which
							he wishes to publish— He desired me to read it, and if I should approve
							it to give a recommendatory Certificate to that effect; which I declined
							in conformity with my established rule— He said he had intended to
							publish it in this Country by Subscription, but the Booksellers in
							Philadelphia said such Books would not sell here— But <persRef
								ref="cresson-elliott">Elliot Cresson</persRef> was going to England:
							to embark the 20<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of this Month, and had
							promised to take the manuscript with him, to offer to publishing
							Booksellers at London— This was what he wanted the recommendatory
							certificates for— He had two or three of them which he shewed me—
								<persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Johnson</persRef> dined with us. Just before dinner <persRef
								ref="poussin-william">Captain Poussin</persRef> came to tell me that
							he had received a Letter from <persRef ref="bernard-simon">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Bernard</persRef> at Paris 4
							February: He had arrived 31. January and had been received a bras

									>Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> La Fayette</persRef>, who had
							treated him like a father— Presented him to the King, by whom he had
							also been treated most kindly— His Letter says there is a very great
							probability that the affairs of Belgium will give rise to a War. Poussin
							told me that he came to tell me this because he remembered my
							Conversation with Gen<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Bernard before he
							embarked for Europe. I received this day a copy of <persRef
								ref="waterhouse-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Waterhouse</persRef> upon Junius and a proof copy from <persRef
								ref="thayer-sylvanus">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>

						<p>A foot bath last Night and a poultice of Elder flowers upon the Cheek,
							were followed by a Night of tolerable repose, and a morning of relief
							from the severe pain of tooth-ache which I had been four days suffering.
							The day was warm and I walk’d before breakfast round the Capitol Square—
								<persRef ref="cranch-william">Judge Cranch</persRef> called and left
							with me his paper upon the Common Law, to be read at the next
							Anniversary of the Columbian Institute; which considering the trifles
							upon which I am wasting my Time, I felt almost asham’d and unworthy to
							read— He asked me after reading it, to return it to his House, if I
							should go this Month for Quincy; he intending to go next Monday to
							Alexandria where the Circuit Court is to be held for several weeks—
								<persRef ref="woodside-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Woodsides</persRef> called again with a mathematical demonstration
							as he called it of the Quadrature of the Circle— It was however rather
							arithmetical— He left his demonstration and a diagram with me to
							examine; and wishes me to give him a certificate, which I shall decline—
							There is a publication by him in the Intelligencer of this Morning,
							announcing his discovery and that he has applied through <persRef
								ref="vaughan-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Vaughan</persRef> and <persRef ref="mclane-louis">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Lane</persRef> for the premium
							offered by the British Parliament— I am not mathematician enough to know
							whether he has made any discovery. His problem bears the proof of
							demonstration to the eye; and it seems to be proved also by his
							arithmetical proportions; but it does not furnish the length of the side
							of the square, which would equal in superficial Contents of any given
							circle— I cannot persuade myself that his proportions if correct should
							not be already familiarly known to Mathematicians, as I accordingly
							believe they are— But if they had ever been known to me, I have no
							remembrance of them— He had also a device for measuring the
							circumference of a Circle, which was no other than revolving it from any
							given point upon a level surface— This operation I told him was
							familiarly known; but that it would not give him his periphery; at which
							he seemed surpriz’d— I copied nothing of my Poem, much of the day having
							slipped off in dissipation of Spirits—occasioned partly by the relief
							from the pressure of pain; partly by the relaxation from intensity of
							thought upon my poem, which is drawing to a close and partly by the
							agitating news received by the York Packet, which sailed from Liverpool
							on the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of February, and brings accounts
							of a state of political convulsion in Paris portentous of War and
							Revolution— Accounts also affecting the commercial Markets in a manner
							unexpected and embarrassing— An extraordinary <pb n="160" type="ms"
							/>aspect of the grain and flour markets rapidly and steadily rising
							throughout Great-Britain, and at the same time falling at Liverpool.
							This is an Operation of the British Corn Laws of which I was not aware,
							and has thrown hazards into my undertaking which may terminate in
							disappointment— I still hold up however in hope. <persRef
								key="adams-john2">John</persRef> chartered this day a Schooner
							called the Delight in Hope, <persRef ref="chase-job">Captain
								Chase</persRef>; to take a Cargo of Flour to New-York. This day’s
							Journal of Commerce brought an account of the decease at New-York of my
							old friend and Classmate <persRef ref="lloyd-james">James
								Lloyd</persRef>— He had removed about four years since from Boston
							to Philadelphia—and had been nearly a year at New-York— He died of a
							consumption.</p>

							lading: the Capitol, and Delight in Hope. The first was laden ready to

						<p>A sharp frost which must have destroyed most of the Apricots peaches and

							morning and Evening— <persRef ref="smith-edward">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Smith’s</persRef> morning Sermon was from Acts 1.10.
							[“]And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold
							two men stood by them in white apparel; 11. Which also said, ye Men of
							Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is
							taken up from you into Heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have
							seen him go into Heaven.”— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith’s
							discourse assumed the incident related in this text, as the momentous
							event which consummated a revolution in the characters of the disciples;
							which finally removed the delusion under which they had then laboured;
							first in supposing that the Kingdom of the Messiah was temporal, and
							secondly, in considering the crucifixion of Jesus as a final
							annihilation of his Cause. <pb n="161" type="ms"/>The discourse was
							historical, argumentative, descriptive and characteristic—beginning with
							a Statement of the situation and temper of mind, in which the disciples
							must have been at that moment—describing the change which this
							miraculous evanescence must have effected in them, and the irresistible
							power and energy which they exhibited thenceforth in establishing the
							cause of Christianity— This is not common place <persRef
								ref="calvin-john">Calvinism</persRef>— His evening text was from 1.
							Timothy 1.19 “Holding faith, and a good Conscience; which some having
							put away concerning faith have made shipwreck.”— This was more
							doctrinal, and more juvenile; but still not remarkably Sectarian— There
							was some metaphysical abstraction about Conscience, and knowledge; but
							no marked allusion, as might have been expected from the text, to other
							denominations of Christians— Both the Sermons were meditated; but
							unwritten— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith is a young man of
							considerable promise— There was almost the whole of this day a Gale from
							the Southwest, nearly as violent as that of yesterday from the
							Northwest— It subsided towards Evening, and return’d again before
							Midnight from Northwest with rain— I began this Morning the
							versification of the first Psalm— Wrote perhaps the last Stanza’s of
								<persRef ref="macmurrough-dermot">Dermot</persRef>, but feeling the
							necessity to keep up the habit of jingling bethought myself of an
							attempt at the Anapestic measure— For the convenience of having the
							thoughts provided for me, I took out the Epistle from <persRef

								<persRef ref="woodside-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							furnished the means of equalizing the given superficial Contents of a
							Circle by a Square, but I doubted whether it had not been known for
							ages— It did not solve the old problem of proportion between the
							Diameter and the surface of a Circle— He himself shewed me a stated
							problem in one of the Annuals, containing nearly the whole substance of
							his supposed discovery and which he said had been furnished him by
								<persRef ref="kearney-lawrence">Captain Kearney</persRef>— And he

								>Ovid’s</persRef> Epistle from <persRef ref="penelope"
								>Penelope</persRef> to <persRef ref="ulysses">Ulysses</persRef>— I
							found not much difficulty in making the Rhymes; but much in adjusting
							the measure— The emphatic accent must be upon every third syllable, and
							there is much less freedom for transposing the accent, than in the
							trochaic measure where it falls upon every alternate syllable. I am
							however fully satisfied that this anapaestic measure is incomparably the
							best for a translation of Ovids Heroids—notwithstanding <persRef
								ref="pope-alexander">Pope’s</persRef> version of the Epistle of

							In walking before dinner round the Capitol Square, I perceived that I
							could not compose any considerable Series of lines and retain them as I
							could with the eight lined Stanza— This brought me to waste two or three
							hours upon them at home, and I composed in the course of the day 50

							Read the 10<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Book of <persRef

							the Night, when they took the horses of <persRef ref="rhesusofthrace"
								>Rhesus</persRef>, and killed him and <persRef ref="dolon"
								>Dolon</persRef>— The harmony of Pope’s versification is as
							enchanting to me as ever—and I now remarked more than ever the power and
							minuteness of the Poets descriptions— <persRef ref="gibbon-edward"
								>Gibbon</persRef> quotes the original passage of <persRef

								<persRef ref="menelaus">Menelaüs</persRef>, and marks the perfection
							of the picture in the operation of shooting the arrow. This is also one
							of the most perfect passages in Pope’s translation— But all Homer is the
							same. The Poet is always a Painter— Every individual in his Poem is a
							Portrait— You see him—hear him—almost feel him— The art of Pope in
							giving grace and delicacy to the description of low and vulgar objects
							surpasses perhaps that of his original— When Ulysses takes the Horses
							and Chariot of Rhesus, in his haste he forgets the whip, and when
							returning to the Grecian Camp unstrings at one end his bow, to use it as
							a substitute— How trivial the incident, yet how graphic—how
							poetical—that is to say how inventive! I walked over to Georgetown
							before dinner. <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> and <persRef

							a short and sensible moral Treatise; argumentative and earnest—without a

							Liberty of Religious opinions and the adherence exclusively to the
							Scriptures as a rule of faith, in which the practice of all the

							down to them— Rational Conclusions of mind rest upon their own

							therefor— Wyer had put this Letter under cover to <persRef
								ref="clark-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clarke</persRef>
							member of the late Congress from Kentucky, to be shewn to <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>— I
							asked him if he thought he should do this without Cadwalader’s consent—
							He said no, upon Reflection, and that he would not do it— He said much
							of the Editor of the Telegraph, <persRef ref="green-duff">Duff
								Green</persRef>, who in two successive Papers of the 14<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> and 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> has
							been giving a history of the internal convulsions of the present
							Administration, which he represents as having arisen from the
							appointment of <persRef ref="eaton-john">John H. Eaton</persRef> as
							Secretary of War, and from the influence of his domestic concerns <pb
								n="165" type="ms"/>upon the Government. Green details his own
							Conversations with the President, with Eaton himself, and with <persRef
								ref="vanburen-martin">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Van
								Buren</persRef> in all which he appears to be a primary personage.
							He alludes in a manner affectedly respectful to the similarity of
							Jackson’s own case with <persRef ref="jackson-rachel">his
							wife</persRef>, with that of Eaton and <persRef ref="eaton-margaret"
								>his</persRef>— Jackson lived some time in Adultery with his wife;
							for which her prior husband obtained a regular divorce—but this was
							nearly forty years ago, and she had lived as Jackson’s wife an
							inoffensive, amiable and charitable life, and had become quite a pious
							old woman— In the Presidential Canvass her character and history had
							been very freely handled; and she died in the very month of his election
							to the Presidency— Eaton was married to his wife about the same time, he
							had lived very openly with her during the life of her former husband
								<persRef ref="timberlake-john">Timberlake</persRef>, who was a
							purser in the Navy; who did not indeed obtain a divorce from his wife,
							but whose death has been generally attributed to his dishonour— <persRef
								ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef>—and three members of Jacksons
								Administration—<persRef ref="ingham-samuel">Ingham</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="branch-john">Branch</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="berrien-john">Berrien</persRef> would not permit the <persRef
								ref="ingham-deborah;branch-elizabeth;berrien-eliza;u">females of
								their families</persRef> to associate with Eaton’s wife, and even
								<persRef ref="donelson-emily">M<hi rend="superscript">rs.</hi>
								Donelson</persRef>, wife to <persRef ref="donelson-andrew">Jackson’s
								private Secretary</persRef>, and living in the President’s house did
							the same— This state of things, produced during the first year of the
							Administration, Scenes, equally disgusting and ludicrous— Jackson having
							with all the violence of his temper taken up the cause of Eaton and his
							wife, as his own— Green now with all his respect for Jackson, and with
							equally affected veneration for M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Jackson,
							says it was from <hi rend="italic">Sympathy</hi>—and that Van Buren
							became the champion and negotiator for Eaton’s wife, because he was a
							Widower. He says too that Van Buren took this opportunity to ingratiate
							himself with Eaton and his wife, and with Jackson, and to kindle
							Jackson’s jealousies against Calhoun, by making him believe that
							Calhoun’s moral puritanism against Eaton’s wife, was only a political
							cant of hypocrisy to head a party against the Administration, and
							prevent the re-election of Jackson— And hence Green deduces Van-Buren’s
							conspiracy to destroy the character of Calhoun, and his intrigues with
								<persRef key="crawford-william-harris">Crawford</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="forsyth-john">Forsyth</persRef>, <persRef ref="lewis-william3"
								>Major Lewis</persRef>, Eaton’s brother in Law, and Chief Clerk, and
								<persRef ref="hamilton-james">James A. Hamilton</persRef> of
							New-York— Wyer says that a young man named <persRef ref="u"
								>M’lean</persRef> assists Green in writing these papers; and that he
							wishes to pay his respects personally to me— I told him I should be glad
							to see him, but that I should in two or three days leave the City— He
							said he would call to-morrow— I went with <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> and dined with <persRef ref="johnson-thomas-baker"
								>her brother</persRef> at Weston— She took our Grandchild <persRef

							be nominated <persRef ref="calhoun-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Calhoun</persRef> would not be a Candidate; but if he should not be,

						<p>The National Intelligencer of this Morning besides the Letter of
							Resignation of the <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Secretary of
								State</persRef>, and the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
								>President’s</persRef> answer, contains also the Letter of <persRef
								ref="eaton-john">John H. Eaton</persRef>, resigning the Office of
							Secretary of War, dated the 7<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> and the
							answer of the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> accepting his
							Resignation— The reason assigned by Van-Buren for himself is that he is
							much against his own Will, a Candidate for the succession to the
							Presidency, and that a person, bearing such a Relation to the Country,
							cannot with propriety be a member of the Cabinet— And that he is
							desirous of setting an example to the Country— The reason assigned by
							Eaton for himself is, that he accepted his appointment much against his
							own will, and at the President’s urgent solicitation— That the
							principles of the Administration being now fully settled and before the
							People for their judgment, he hopes the President will indulge him in
							his wish to retire. The President in both instances accedes to the
							desire of the Candidate for dismission, and there is a very sufficient
							dose of reciprocal compliments in all the Letters— The Reasons for the
							Resignation of the <persRef ref="ingham-samuel;branch-john">two other
								Secretaries</persRef> are not given— The rumour is that <persRef
								ref="berrien-john">Berrien</persRef> the Attorney General has also
							been requested to resign, and that <persRef ref="barry-william"
								>Barry</persRef> the Postmaster General offered his resignation, but
							was prevailed upon by the President to continue in Office— I was
							occupied all this Morning with preparations for my departure— <persRef

							<persRef ref="adams-georgeanna">youngest child</persRef> has been
							several days unwell, and <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Huntt</persRef> this morning says she
							has the Meazles. There is an eruption appearing upon her skin— The Stage
							came for me a quarter past one— <persRef ref="poussin-william">Major
								Poussin</persRef> came in a few minutes before, and read me part of
							a Letter he has just received from <persRef ref="bernard-simon">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Bernard</persRef>, dated 12. March,
							totally differing in character from the last, and full of
							dissatisfaction— He says that <persRef ref="lafayette">La
								Fayette</persRef> is cajoled at the Palais Royal, and treated with
							undisguised contempt by the <persRef ref="louis-philippe"
								>king’s</persRef> party elsewhere— That the policy of the present
							government is to bring things back to their old condition, and that they
							are in fact no better than when under <persRef ref="louis-xvi">Louis
								16</persRef> or <persRef ref="artois-charles">Charles 10</persRef>—
							He thinks there will be a general War of all Europe against France, and
							for the restoration of despotism. Bernard says that his own name has
							been restored upon the rolls of the army, but that he will not re-enter
							upon the service— He will on the contrary hasten back to this happy
							Country, where he has already experienced hospitality— The Stage was at
							the door, and I had no time for conversation with Major Poussin. John
							and <persRef ref="greenleaf-william">William C. Greenleaf</persRef> came
							in from Georgetown and John gave me up the Note of 2000 dollars to the
							Union Bank at Georgetown, which he had paid this Morning. The Stage
							stopp’d at <persRef ref="gadsby-john">Gadsby’s</persRef>, where <persRef
								ref="wyer-edward">E. Wyer</persRef> put a Letter into my hand, and
							told me that <persRef ref="barbour-philip">Philip P. Barbour</persRef>
							was to be Attorney-General— There were twelve passengers in the Stage;
							among which one woman— About 6. Miles short of Baltimore, in crossing a
							Run, where there was a dilapidated Bridge, the leader horses broke one
							of the leading bars, and thus broke loose from their traces— While the
							driver went back to repair his tackle, I walked on, and with two or
							three of my fellow-passengers was taken up by another Stage, which
							overtook us, and landed me at the dusk of Evening at <persRef
								ref="barnum-david">Barnum’s</persRef> Hotel in Baltimore. When my
							own Stage came in it was found that <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams’s</persRef> trunk had been left at Washington— She could not
							proceed without it, and we are compelled to wait for it here to-morrow.
							At the entrance of Barnum’s house I met <persRef ref="gales-joseph"
								>Joseph Gales jun<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi></persRef>
							<pb n="168" type="ms"/>returning from Philadelphia, <persRef
								ref="munro-isaac">Isaac Munro</persRef> Editor of the Baltimore
							Patriot, and <persRef ref="skinner-john">Skinner</persRef> the
							Postmaster. Gales is going to-morrow Morning for Washington, and took a
							Letter from M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Adams to our Son, desiring
							that the trunk may be sent on by the Stage to-morrow.</p>

						<p><date>24. V.30. </date>Sunday— Philadelphia.</p>
						<p>This Morning we received a Trunk from Washington, and afterwards by the
							Mail, a Letter from my Son <persRef key="adams-john2">John</persRef> and
							a Key— The Trunk however which had been left behind was sent on by a
							Schooner bound to Boston— I wrote and despatched a Letter to John: and I
							attended public worship, morning and afternoon at the Episcopal Church
							in Eighth Street and heard <persRef ref="bedell-gregory">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Bedell</persRef>— Prayers were read
							for the third Sunday after Easter, by another person at the Morning, and
							yet another at the Evening service— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Bedell’s morning text was from Isaiah 28.16. “a <hi rend="italic"
								>sure</hi> foundation”—with emphasis upon the word <hi rend="italic"
								>sure</hi>, as implying a contrast with a <hi rend="italic"
								>false</hi> foundation— This he illustrated by the concluding
							paragraph of Christ’s Sermon upon the Mount, marking the difference
							between the House founded upon a Rock, and the house founded upon sand—
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bedell told his hearers that he knew
							the houses of many of them were built upon the sand— That he saw before
							him many, who he knew were going rapidly to eternal ruin— That his own
							painful duty was one of destruction—to destroy the false foundation upon
							which they were placing their reliance, and that his object was to argue
							the matter with them— The conclusion of course was that the only sure
							foundation was the atoning blood of the Saviour— His afternoon Sermon
							was from the Book of Revelations from verse 11 to 15 inclusive, the
							opening of the Books at the day of Judgment, when the Sea and Death and
							Hell (or Hades) shall give up their dead—so that the whole human race

							one theme— I was on that account less satisfied with them than I should
							have been, with more of variety— A great part of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Bedell’s merit as a preacher is in his delivery— The house
							though large was crowded, both morning and afternoon; and it was not
							without difficulty, that I obtained seats; with I know not whom in the

							name of Newbold— <persRef ref="vaughan-john">M<hi rend="superscript"

							and offered me a seat at the Unitarian Church, but said <persRef
								ref="furness-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

							preferr’d hearing M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bedell— Between the

							I consulted him concerning the state of my health, which is drooping,
							and I believe irretrievable— My most distressing complaint at present is
							the inflammation of my eyes which reduces me to a state of inaction both
							of body and mind— I gave him an account of my ailment and he gave me his
							advice— But as I could not conveniently stay here at this time several
							days, I agreed to pass a week at Philadelphia, if so it please God, on

							of <persRef ref="huntt-henry">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Huntt</persRef> to open an issue in my knee— He was thunderstruck

							Letters to the two last were apparently written by Jackson himself, and
							they afford matter for much amusement. Ingham and Branch were not
							inclined to resign: and he was not willing to pass for having requested
							them to resign— He puts it upon the ground that his Cabinet proper was a
							Unit which had come together in great harmony—and as two individuals of
							the Unit had voluntarily withdrawn, he thought it necessary to
							reorganize the whole Cabinet— There was a Caricature published here on
							Saturday upon this incident, called the Rats leaving a falling house—
							Four black rats, with faces of recognizable likeness to the four
							Secretaries are scampering away upon the flour. Jackson is struggling to
							sustain himself in a Chair that is breaking under him; and his right
							foot is pressing upon Van-Buren’s tail, as if to detain him— An altar of
							Reform is falling over, with an imp having the head of an Ass, the body
							of a monkey, and the wings of a bat, armed with a broom— The room is
							hung round with Papers on each of which is inscribed Resignation and the
							President’s spitting box and broken tobacco pipe are on the floor— Two
							thousand copies of this Print have been sold in Philadelphia this day—
							Ten thousand Copies were struck off; and will all be disposed of within

							a degree that it was scarcely possible to move from one part of it to
							the other— Of the Passengers, I knew <persRef ref="smith-waters">judge

							seemed exhausted by the exertion of speaking. I did not protract my

								>Joseph Blunt</persRef> dined with us— At 5. we walk’d to the bottom

							had been gradually clouding up; and threatened a Northeast Storm—
								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> was desirous of postponing our
							departure, and wished me to accept the invitation to Verplanck’s dinner—
							But I have a strong aversion to postponements of departure, especially
							for appearances of weather, and never flinch from embarking when my
							Captain is willing to go— I persisted and we embarked— The storm came on
							just as we left the wharf; and by the time we came to Sands’s point, and
							entered Long-Island Sound it blew a heavy gale of wind— The evening was
							dull and gloomy, and many of the Passengers were sick.</p>

						<p><date>28. VII. </date>Thursday— Stonington Harbour.</p>
						<p>The Night was very severe, and the gale violent, but the Moon had only
							two days passed the full, and it was not very dark. The boat is the
							finest on the line, and the effect of a Storm upon a Steam-boat is
							altogether different from that upon a sharp-keeled ship with high masts
							and Sails— The Steam-boats floats upon the wave like a log— Her pitching
							and rolling are scarcely perceptible in comparison with the vehement
							lurches of a ship— The principal dangers of a Steam-boat are to her
							paddles and her boilers— We had the wind directly ahead; and the Engines
							being heavily charged with Steam, the Surges came continually in violent
							shocks upon her bow, every one of which seemed as if it would stave it
							in; and made the whole body of the boat tremble like a person in a fit
							of the ague. I slept not a wink the whole Night, but did not rise till
							seven— Not half the Passengers were at breakfast, and <pb n="173"
								type="ms"/>no Ladies— Our progress in the teeth of the wind was
							slow— The boat usually performs her passage from New-York to Providence
							in 15 hours— We had been 17 hours on board, and were barely opposite to
							New-London— Many of the passengers were alarmed at the Prospect, of
							passing round Point Judith; and the <persRef ref="bunker-robert">Captain</persRef> himself became apprehensive
							that his fuel, might fall short— His Coal was already nearly exhausted,
							and his Stock of Wood was quite small. He took the passage through
							Fisher’s Island Sound, and about eleven in the morning in the midst of a
							furious squall of wind, and rain came to anchor in the harbour of
							Stonington— Here we remained the rest of the day, which would scarcely
							have been tedious to me, but that the inflammation of my eyes would not
							permit me to read— I made several attempts but was as repeatedly
							compelled to desist— Separated from my own family, the <persRef

							Evening, and retired again to bed between nine and ten at Night.</p>

						<p>I had a very good Night’s rest. Dulness always sleeps well. Rose at half

							blowing with unabated fury— There was talk among the Passengers that the
							<persRef ref="bunker-robert">Captain</persRef> had concluded to go back to New-London to procure a fresh supply
							of Coal— At six the Anchor was weighed, and the Boat struck upon the
							Bar. This delayed us about an hour, and as the tide rose she floated—
							The Pilot, my old friend <persRef ref="justin-john">Captain
								Justin</persRef> took his course towards his Port; at half past ten
							we doubled Point Judith; reached the harbour of Newport at Noon, and the
							wharf at Providence three hours later—without accident of harm to the

							I was quite unable to express— I had never experienced a more boisterous

							also from using any importunity with the Captain, or obtruding any
							advice upon the Captain; which M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> White
							told me he had done; and as did others of the Passengers— I preferred

						<p>I took an early breakfast this Morning at Dedham, and then took a horse
							Chaise and driver who brought me over to Quincy— The wind of the Storm
							has abated, but there was a remnant of drizzling rain— I reached home at
							eight O’Clock and found <persRef ref="kirk-elizabeth">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs </hi>Kirk</persRef> who has passed the
							winter at the House— Began the reading suspended by my departure from
							Washington—Ezekiel 19— Versified a Stanza of the 23<hi
								rend="superscript">d</hi> Psalm—with extreme difficulty— Nothing
							else— I am utterly unable to comprehend why during the Months of
							February and March, and until I left Washington, I could write verse
							almost as easily as prose while I can now scarcely strain from hard
							bound brains eight lines a day—especially as the rhymes that come the
							hardest, are the worst— I found here, the only copy extant of the
							Epistle to <persRef key="adams-abigail">my mother</persRef>, written at
							Ealing in 1816. I read part of it, and perceived all its platitude—
							Visited my Garden, and witnessed some of the effects of my labours, the
							last Season— The severity of the Winter has made considerable
							destruction of my plants, but has spared more of them than I had
							expected to live— Of the Downton Strawberry vines, given me, by <persRef
								ref="sumner-william">W. H. Sumner</persRef> 2. Sept<hi
								rend="superscript">r.</hi> 1830. there are 16 plants yet alive, and
							so are three of the five Wild Strawberry plants which I took up in
							November at the Railway. The weight of the Snow has broken off the
							double Stem of the finest elm in the Summer house cellar; also the
							finest horse Chesnut tree; and has made almost all the others crooked.
							The young trees, which I set out in the garden and nursery are almost
							all alive: and there are about 150 trees up from the seeds which I sowed
							last year; chiefly Apples— I dined alone, and after dinner called at
								<persRef key="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef>— Found him and
								<persRef ref="adams-ann">his wife</persRef> in great
								distress—<persRef ref="adams-elizabeth">both their
								daughters</persRef> being ill— <persRef ref="adams-abigail2"
								>Abigail</persRef> very severely with a bilious fever— Soon after I
							returned home my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							came in from Boston—and about 6 O’Clock, <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">my wife</persRef> with our
							Grand-daughter <persRef ref="adams-mary4">Louisa</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Nowlan</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="pitts-mary">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Pitts</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirk</persRef>, arrived with our own
							Carriage and Horses from Providence, whence they came this morning. I
							duly felt the blessing of having thus accomplished our journey without
							evil accident, and arriving all in good health, excepting the affliction
							of my eyes— Charles returned to Boston. <persRef ref="spear-elijah"
								>Elijah Spear</persRef>, called here this afternoon, and spoke of
							the Necessity of fencing the town-river Salt-marsh lot.</p>
