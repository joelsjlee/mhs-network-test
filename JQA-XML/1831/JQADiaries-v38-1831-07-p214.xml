						<p>Showery, Sultry damp depressing day. My face has been four or five days
							inflaming and swelling, till it became doubtful whether I should be able
							to speak or even to appear in Public next Monday. This afternoon the
							swelling abated— <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> as
							usual went to Boston, and returned to dine— <persRef key="adams-thomas"
								>My brother</persRef> was here after dinner— I received a Letter
							from <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph Blunt</persRef> at New-York,
							which I answered, and I wrote a page of a Chapter for the next Volume
								<pb n="215" type="ms"/>of the American Annual Register. <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="adams-abigail4">Charles’s</persRef> took tea at my brother’s.
							His daughter <persRef ref="adams-abigail2">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Angier</persRef> is there, from Medford— I called in
							the Evening. Found <persRef ref="marston-john">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Marston</persRef>, and <persRef ref="smith-louisa"
								>Louisa C. Smith</persRef> there— Home before dark— Aurora Borealis—
							In my garden and Nursery the plants were drooping under heavy showers—
							No new vegetation where expected— Gathered a few thimble berries, large
							as Raspberries, from a single bush which I had trained. Charles brought
							from Boston some poor Mazzard Cherries, and a fine Musk Melon; a present
							from <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Brooks</persRef>— He brought also the number this day published of
							the North-American Review; of which I turned over the leaves with a
							cursory perusal— It contains eleven Articles— The first upon the Laws of
							Population and Wages—a Review of three work by a <persRef
								ref="senior-nassau">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Senior</persRef>,
							professor of political Economy at Oxford— This Man is of the <persRef
								ref="malthus-thomas">Malthus</persRef> School, and the Reviewer
							treats him as he had done M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Malthus
							himself.</p>
						<lg><l>Critics I saw, that others names deface</l>
						<l>And fix their own, with labour, in their place:</l></lg>
						<p>this is especially true of the writers upon the modern Science of
							political Economy—the history of which from <persRef
								ref="quesnay-francois">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Quesnay</persRef> down would be a great curiosity— Of the other
							Articles, one is a reply to an Article in the Edinburgh Review for June
							1829 against Mechanical Philosophy—one upon the Cherokee case, in which
							the writer censures the recent decision of the Supreme Court of the
							United States. One upon the Prospect of Reform in Europe— The writer
							commenting upon an Article of <persRef ref="sismondi-jean"
								>Sismondi</persRef> in the Revue Encyclopedique, predicts the
							Establishment of Republican Governments throughout Europe— An Article
							upon the popular Sports and festivals of England—one upon Italian Poetry
							and Romance— One upon <persRef ref="gray-francis">F. C. Gray’s</persRef>
							Letter to the <persRef ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor</persRef> relating
							to Harvard University. One upon the life of <persRef
								ref="brougham-henry">Henry Brougham</persRef>, and one upon our
							Northeastern boundary question— On the whole the number is a good one,
							though bearing strong features of the bold and dashing Spirit of
								<persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H. Everett</persRef>, the
							present Editor of the Review.</p>

								Thayer</persRef> called at my house this morning on his way to
							Boston, to meet the Agricultural Society with samples of his grain, in
							the Straw, threshed, and ground to flour— He looked at mine, and said he
							thought it would be fit to reap in about ten days— It has been much
							beaten down by the rain—but he thought I should have two bushels of it
							on the patch in my Nursery— He advised in the sowing of the seed, not to
							sow more than a bushel and a half to an Acre— He stopp’d again as he
							returned from Boston after dinner, but I did not see him— He had not yet
							settled the name of his grain; nor ascertained whether it was a known
							plant, or a new discovery— A <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Turner</persRef> came on a visit of curiosity. He
							belongs to Wiscasset in the State of Maine, but has been to visit his

								<persRef key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>rs</hi> Adams</persRef> was very unwell all day; but rode out
							with <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">Charles’s wife</persRef> in the
							Evening— I sowed Strawberry seeds under the western fence in the Garden;
							where all of my wild Strawberry vines are planted— Raspberry seeds under
							the Eastern fence near <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							cropp’d Oaks in the Nursery— Thimble berries in the same patch opposite
							to Charles’s solitary Elm, and Mazzard Cherries with alternate Stones
							under the Northern fence, in the same row where I planted last year and
							where a single cherry, and a single peach Seedling have come up— I now
							repeat the experiment; and that of raising Strawberries, Raspberries,
							and Thimbleberries from the Seed. The Strawberry seeds I pressed out
							from the berries, separated from the pulp, and washed with Water— The
							Raspberries and thimble-berries, were crushed, and kneeded up with
							Earth, which I strewed along in a furrow not half an inch deep— Of all
							the currants which I sowed last Summer, one only has thrown up
							plants—there seem to be six or eight of them in one spot; but I have not
							ventured to separate them— I think I have also several blackberry Vines
							up from Seeds in two of the Book-boxes, but their growth is yet so slow
							that <pb n="216" type="ms"/>they are not completely authenticated— I
							wrote to <persRef ref="blunt-joseph">Joseph Blunt</persRef>, and part of
							a page for the Chapter of the American Annual Register— But my time and
							thoughts are absorbed by other things—anxieties disqualify for
							action.</p>

						<p>Heard <persRef ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peter
								Whitney</persRef> this forenoon from John 20.30. “And many other
							signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not
							written in this book: 31. But these are written, that ye might believe,
							that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might
							have life through his name”— And in the afternoon from Matthew 25.30.
							“And cast ye the unprofitable Servant into utter darkness: there shall
							be weeping, and gnashing of Teeth.” The first upon the Miracles
							performed by Jesus Christ, as Evidences of his divine Mission; the
							second as a Testimonial of punishments to be inflicted in a future
							State, not only for his sins committed, but for profitable duties
							omitted, in the present Life— <persRef ref="turner-peter">Peter
								Turner</persRef> had an infant boy baptized by the name of <persRef
								ref="turner-peter2">Peter Boylston Adams</persRef>— There was a
							Collection taken to purchase an additional number of Children’s books
							for the Sunday School. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney gave
							notice, that the <persRef ref="buxton-jarvis">Rev<hi rend="superscript"
									>d.</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Buxton</persRef> from
							Fayetteville North-Carolina would preach at the Episcopal Church, at
							Early Candlelight this Evening— <persRef
								ref="angier-john;adams-abigail2">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and
									M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Angier</persRef> called to see
							us after the Service— I bathed with <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> and swam at the wharf— There was a Sloop, laden
							with Granite which left the wharf at the high-tide— <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> dined with us— In the
							Evening I went to the Episcopal Church, where Prayers were read by
								<persRef ref="potter-alonzo">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Potter</persRef>, and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Buxton preached
							from Luke 10.5 “And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be
							to this house.” an Evangelical, and well composed regular
							Discourse—divided into Peace Spiritual— Peace Temporal— Peace Eternal.
							At the close of the Sermon he referred to the distressed and bereaved
							condition of his flock under the calamity which has befallen them and
							solicited Charity; modestly, and without importunity, as if to beg
							ashamed— Before the Service I went in to <persRef ref="greenleaf-john"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> John Greenleaf’s</persRef>—where
							were <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel;greenleaf-elizabeth">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Daniel Greenleaf</persRef>, <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript"

								ref="greenleaf-mary2">his wife</persRef> and four young Children;
								<persRef ref="greenleaf-richard">Richard C. Greenleaf</persRef>— I
							was occupied much of the day in writing a closing paragraph for my
							Discourse— At this late hour I absolutely sickened at that which I had
							written— It was gloomy, inauspicious, and affectedly rather than
							affectingly full of myself— The new paragraph, totally changed its
							character, gave to the future an aspect of hope and gladness instead of
							despondency—urged to generous and energetic action, and to calm reliance
							on a superintending Providence—leaving a slight allusion to my own age
							and proximity to my end, at the close; but merely to give additional
							Solemnity to the dying Sentiment of <persRef key="adams-john">my
								father</persRef>, and linking the perpetuity of Union with that of
							Independence pointing all at the same time to the future Prospects of my
							Auditory— As it is, my judgment pronounces the Peroration good— As it
							was till this very day, it was execrably bad, and I was utterly unaware
							of it— My self-criticism, was disarmed by the pathos of a close, in the
							last words of my father, and I had not remarked the aukwardness of
							manner in which I had brought it forth— How severe a Censor, it behooves
							me to be upon myself—</p>

								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney</persRef>
							was at the Meeting-House— The procession consisted of the Quincy Light
							Infantry Company, preceded by a Band of Music—the Committee of
							Arrangements and Inhabitants of Quincy and the neighbouring Towns. When
							the procession arrived at the Meeting House, they were detained nearly a
							quarter of an hour— The house had never before been filled, an
							impression had been circulated abroad that the house was slightly built—
							That the Slate-roof was too heavy for the Granite Walls; and that the
							Galleries were not duly supported— <persRef ref="brooks-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Charles Brooks</persRef> told me before we left my house that it was circulated
							much among the People, that the Walls of our Temple would this day
							crumble into ruin—and just before we reached the house, there had been a
							loud cracking at the South-west corner of the Gallery, and a great
							alarm, among the Ladies seated there— Some new shoring was put under the
							galleries; and we entered the house which was soon filled to
							overflowing— The order of the Performances, was 1. Voluntary— Song. The
							Pilgrim Fathers; by <persRef ref="hemans-felicia">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hemans</persRef>— Sung by <persRef
								ref="u">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Newhall</persRef>—with the

							Anthem <persRef ref="byron-george">Lord Byron’s</persRef> Hebrew Melody—
							[“]Go forth to the Mount, bring the Olive-branch home.”— 4. Declaration
							of Independence—read by the Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Potter—Minister of the Episcopal Church.
							5. Psalm written for the Occasion— My own version of the 149<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm— 6. Oration by John Quincy Adams—
							7. The Trumpet of Liberty—a Song— Final benediction by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney.— My Discourse occupied an hour
							and twenty-five minutes in the delivery, and I omitted, about one third
							of what I had written— It was well received—frequently interrupted by
							applause, and closed with Plaudits long continued— The procession then
							moved to the Town Hall, where was a dinner of about one hundred and
							twenty persons, <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Thomas Greenleaf</persRef> presided— The dinner was
							<unclear>too</unclear> long; and after six or seven of the Toasts, had been given,
							alternating with Symphonies and Songs, I rose and said—Friends,
							Neighbours, and Fellow Townsmen—I will now with your permission, take my
							leave of you, for the present; and before parting from you, wish to add
							a few, a very few more last words, to the many, which you have already
							heard this day, from me, with so much indulgence— They are, first to
							thank you heartily for that Indulgence; and then to propose a Toast in
							honour of the primitive Mother of New England— May I add, the primitive
							Mother of those principles which have made this day, a day of Glory and
							of Joy— The Plymouth Colony.</p>
						<p>To that Colony, our native Town, did not originally belong— But I see
							around me more than one, of those who number among their Sires, the
							fortunate youth, from the Mayflower, who first alighted upon the Rock—
							The Legislature of this Commonwealth have seen fit to link you in
							political Association with the District of Plymouth; and to that
							Association I am indebted for the honour of having of having been
							selected as their and your Representative in the Councils of the
							Union—an honour the more preciously prized by me, as a spontaneous and
							unexpected testimonial of confidence from that, which above all other
							Lands I am entitled to call <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">own,</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">my</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">native</hi>
							<hi rend="italic">Land</hi>— Upon this day, I cannot forget Plymouth and
							her History— I cannot forget the Mayflower, and the social compact of
							her Pilgrims— I propose to you the following Toast— “The Root <pb
								n="218" type="ms"/>The Root, struck from the Seed of the Mayflower;
							and the Plant ascending from it—Salutary—Fruitful—Perennial— It shall
							rise to Heaven, and Overspread the Earth.” This was received with three
							times three, and I left the Hall and walked home— There was a fresh
							breeze of air all day; but the Sun was blazing and the Thermometer above
							90— I never experienced atmospherical heat more intensely than from the
							Time, when I left my house in the morning till my return to it after
							dinner— In delivering the Discourse, I began a pitch too high, and
							before I had got through the first page strained my voice till it broke—
							I thought I should be totally disabled from proceeding, but by lowering
							the pitch gradually found relief and spoke much more easily towards the
							close, than at the beginning— <persRef ref="degrand-peter"

						<p>I finished yesterday the version of the 119<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> Psalm in 44. Stanzas, and this morning began that of the
								145<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm. It is perhaps impossible
							to make a spirited Translation of the 119<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>
							which consists of a continual series of repetitions— There is a division
							of eight verses for each of the twenty-two Letters of the Hebrew
							Alphabet, and in the 176 verses, not one without reference to the
							Scriptures under the varied denominations of the Word, Precepts, Laws,
							Commandments, Judgments and Testimonies— I suppose only one division and
							its Letter, were read in the Synagogues at a Time— I have not been able
							to avoid some repetitions of the same line— I have gone through the
							Psalm in forty-four days—one Stanza each day. Of course Little Verve— I
							received this morning several Letters—one from my Son <persRef
								key="adams-john2">John</persRef> at Washington of 30. June— The
							house had been entered and robbed the preceding Night—one a blank cover,
							Post-marked Providence; enclosing a slip from a Providence Newspaper,
							nearly three years old, abusive upon me for my controversy with the
							federalists— One from <persRef ref="tefft-israel">I. K. Tefft</persRef>,
							with a duplicate of a Letter dated last November, requesting Autographs
							of <persRef key="adams-john">my father</persRef> and myself— He now also
							forwards a recommendation from <persRef ref="mcallister-matthew">M. H.
								M’Allister</persRef>— <persRef ref="spear-daniel">Deacon
								Spear</persRef> was here; I paid to him, and took up—<persRef
								ref="greenleaf-william">W. C. Greenleafs</persRef> two Notes to
								<persRef ref="webb-lucy">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lucy
								Webb</persRef>; I spoke with him about the Sale at Auction, of the
							crops standing upon my unleased Lots of Land; and of some other
							concerns. At high water this Evening just before Sunset—I bathed and
							swam in the Creek; with <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef>
							and <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac</persRef>— In the Garden and
							Nursery, the pignuts are coming up— Not one where I expected them, and
							always in clusters with other seedlings, making transplantation
							indispensible— There are two new ones up in the book box, fronting my
							window. The newspapers contain a long Speech, of <persRef
								ref="ingham-samuel">Samuel D. Ingham</persRef>, Secretary of the
							Treasury lately resigned in obedience to the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">President’s</persRef> will— Ingham was received
							by a procession and Escort, and a concourse of People on his return home
							to Bucks County Pennsylvania— A public dinner was given him, and an
							address presented to him, by a Committee of Citizens, who requested of
							him a statement of the causes of the dissolution of the late Cabinet—
							This he declined, though declaring his approbation of the enquiry; but
							slyly alledging that it is the President’s duty to give this information
								<pb n="219" type="ms"/>to the People; and generously offering any
							assistance which might be required of him for that purpose— They then
							requested of him a statement of the Circumstances of an attempt of
							personal assault upon him by his late Colleague the Ex-Secretary of War
								<persRef ref="eaton-john">John H. Eaton</persRef>, which Ingham had
							magnified into a conspiracy to assassinate him; and he accordingly
							related to them the particulars, which were in the ordinary
							semi-barbarian Style of backwoods quarreling— Eaton absurdly enough
							called upon him to acknowledge or disavow a paragraph in the Telegraph
							Newspaper concerning <persRef ref="eaton-margaret">Eaton’s
								wife</persRef>; and upon receiving an insulting answer, challenged
							him to fight a duel, which he answered by more insult—upon which Eaton
							did way-lay him both at the Department, and at Ingham’s lodgings till he
							left the City. The whole affair would be disreputable to any other
							Administration, but is strictly congenial to the whole tenour of
							Jackson’s life, and to the prevailing manners of the Southwestern
							portion of the Union— Jackson lived in open Adultery with <persRef
								ref="jackson-rachel">his wife</persRef>, from whom <persRef
								ref="robards-lewis">her first husband</persRef> was divorced for
							that cause by an Act of the Legislature of Virginia, and a regular
							Sentence of a judicial Court in Kentucky— This was brought up against
							him in the late Presidential Canvas; but it rather aided than impeded
							his election— Her first husband had been many years dead— She had lived
							reputably enough with Jackson for the last thirty years; had become an
							old woman, with some pretensions to sanctity by methodistical
							regeneration. The Priestly propagators of the new birth took her under
							their protection; the White washing Committee at Nashville, patched her
							up into a very mother Cole, of Sanctity; and then the political Snakes
							hissed at the defamation of an innocent, and virtuous and persecuted
							female— She died at Nashville, just at the time of Jackson’s Election,
							and he of course held her up as a Saint and Martyr— Eaton had wormed
							himself into Jackson’s Affections, first by trumping up a book about
							him, called his Life, and in which he palmed him off upon the world as a
							hero— When Jackson came to form his Administration, he must needs have
							Eaton for his Secretary of War— Eaton had just married the widow of
								<persRef ref="timberlake-john">Timberlake</persRef>, a purser in the
							Navy, daughter of a <persRef ref="oneal-william">Tavern keeper</persRef>
							at Washington at whose house Eaton and Jackson had both lodged— So it
							was that Fame, whisper’d light Tales of Eaton’s dame— There was much
							intriguing with Jackson at the Time to prevent the appointment of Eaton,
							on that account, but Jackson having brazen’d it out himself;
							familiarized himself with the infamy of adultery, and made the People of
							his neighbourhood in Tennessee as familiar with it as himself, fancied
							he could perform the same operation at Washington, stubbornly persisted
							in the appointment of Eaton— And such was at that time the rabid and
							putrid infection of Jackson’s popularity, that he would perhaps have
							succeeded in this outrage upon the private morals of the Country, but
							that <persRef ref="calhoun-john">Calhoun</persRef> his Vice President
							saw in it an instrument for thwarting and discrediting Jacksons
							Administration, and of advancing his own popularity as the champion of
							morals— Nor ought in Candour, some credit to be denied him for an honest
							adherence to principle— Perhaps an equal or greater share of this credit
							is due to <persRef ref="calhoun-floride">his wife</persRef>, who from
							the first refused to associate with Eaton’s wife, and did not return her
							visit— The example thus set was followed by the wives and daughters of
							the Secretaries of the Treasury, and Navy, and the Attorney General,
							Ingham, <persRef ref="branch-john">Branch</persRef>, and <persRef
								ref="berrien-john">Berrien</persRef>. The fires of AEtna have been
							burning in the bowels of the Administration, kindled by this Torch of
							the furies, and after many smoakings, and outflashings, have at <pb
								n="220" type="ms"/>last blazed out, and swept the whole Cabinet
							away— <persRef ref="vanburen-martin">Van Buren</persRef> in this affair
							took the part of <persRef ref="pandarus">Sir Pandarus of Troy</persRef>—
							Being himself a widower, tainted female reputation was but a haut gout
							to him— He constrained the <persRef ref="rives-judith;mclane-catherine"
								>wives</persRef> of <persRef ref="rives-william">Rives</persRef> and
								<persRef ref="mclane-louis">M’lane</persRef> the new Ministers to
							France and England to visit M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Eaton; he
							prevailed upon the <persRef ref="buchanan-mary;dudley-blandina"
								>wives</persRef> of the Senators from New-York, <persRef
								ref="sanford-nathan">Sanford</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="dudley-charles">Dudley</persRef> to do the same— He pleaded
							with <persRef ref="donelson-emily">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Donelson</persRef>, Jackson’s niece and wife of <persRef
								ref="donelson-andrew">his private Secretary</persRef>, till she

								<persRef ref="huygens-bangeman">Dutch Minister</persRef> till she
							proclaimed him a liar, all this was more than twelve Months before the
							dissolution of the Cabinet— The Self-degradation of Van Buren in lending
							himself to such despicable Offices, contrasts curiously with the lofty
							display of Patriotic principle, in his Letter to the President,
							tendering the resignation of his Office as Secretary of State.</p>

							been much afflicted, contrasting deeply with that triumphal procession
							which he made through the Union in the years 1817. and 1819— I went to

						<p>I have been quite unwell the last three days, and especially so last
							Night and this Morning— The heat of the Season has been overpowering,
							and it operates upon me by a prostration of strength which disables me
							for all active exertion— It confined me to the house all this day,
							except a turn towards Evening in my Garden, and Nursery— Great part of

							opinion that the dissolution of the Lodges would be expedient— Yet Stone
							discovers in his conversation an attachment to the Institution, which he
							disclaims and which he probably disguises to himself— In my Garden and
							Nursery I found a considerable number of the hickory Trees yet coming
							up— I remark the spreading of the Strawberry Vines, and other phenomena
							of vegetation for which I am utterly unable to account— My Apple
							Seedlings of the second year, stopped growing near a month since, and
							most of them look as if they would die—many of this Years Oak seedlings
							are now putting forth a second shoot— A pear tree, grafted upon a sucker
							bears this year for the first time— It is at least 25 years old— Bears
							full on two or three branches, and not at all upon the rest— The
							inability to trace the links from effect to cause renders all my
							observations useless— I cannot even tell why all my seedlings that do
							come up come in clusters which make it impossible for them to grow
							together— Nothing but the Peach-trees, and those in one of the patches
							at the bottom of the Nursery, comes up in Rows as I planted them— Of
							Oaks from the Acorn, there are not ten up in the Nursery— Every thing
							but the walnuts has ceased coming up; and they appear in very different
							forms, their first leaves differing so much that one could not imagine
							them to be the same kind of tree.</p>

							of the Transactions of the Horticultural Society a very good Article by
								<persRef ref="daniell-john">John Frederic Daniell</persRef> upon
							climate considered with regard to Horticulture— It is a dissertation
							upon the raising and naturalizing the Plants of warm Latitudes in cold

							insists upon the importance not only of heat and light but of relative
							dryness and moisture in the atmosphere—<pb n="223" type="ms"/>shewing
							that for the artificial cultivation of plants under glass the hygrometer
							is an instrument perhaps more important than the thermometer— The writer
							mentions his Meteorological Essays, and speaks with high commendation of
								<persRef ref="wells-william3">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Wells’s</persRef> Essay upon dew— The injurious effects of cold
							occur chiefly in hollow places, and frosts are less severe upon hills
							than in neighbouring plains— “The advantages of placing a garden upon a
							gentle slope must be hence very apparent, a running stream at its foot
							would secure the further benefit of a contiguous surface, not liable to
							refrigeration, and would prevent any injurious stagnation of the air”—
							The ground Northward of my house is made by Nature, as if on purpose,
							for a garden, upon this theory— He says that the experiment of keeping
							the floor of the hot-house continually wet has been tried at the
							Society’s Garden, at his suggestion with great success— He proposes the
							keeping of Registers of the State of the climate both in houses, and out
							of doors.— I finished the 145<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm.</p>

						<p>Sudden and great change of weather— Cool— Heard <persRef
								ref="whitney-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney</persRef>— Morning from Ephesians 5.16. “Redeeming the time”—and
							afternoon from 2. Corinthians 5.11. “Knowing therefore the Terror of the
							Lord, we persuade men.”— The preciousness of Time, and the duty of
							redeeming it are common-place Topics, but the afternoon discourse, on
							the Terror of the Lord, was upon the doctrine of a future State of
							retribution— The System of the Universalists is becoming the favourite
							religion— They suppose a future State; but no future punishment— All
							hope, and no fear. This is about as rational as phrenology— Human
							ratiocination makes what it pleases of human language— The Universalists
							profess to believe the Bible— So does M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Whitney— So do the Calvinists—and so does the <persRef
								ref="gregory-xvi">Pope</persRef> at Rome— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney thinks it a delightful creed that
							the whole human race are destined to ultimate Salvation and happiness—he
							hopes, but dares not absolutely believe it— The Scriptures bear decisive
							testimony to human depravity, and they threaten severe future judgments
							to a very large portion of the race of man— It is impossible to settle
							in any rational belief of futurity, but by recurring to the Scriptures—
							The desire of endless existence is implanted in the human heart; and
							arguments for believing it, are within the compass of human Reason. But
							the adverse arguments are at least equally powerful and equal opposite
							weights in mind as well as in matter, destroy each other— There is left
							therefore nothing but the desire, as the foundation for the belief— To
							bring life and immortality to light was the professed and avowed object
							of the Mission of Christ; and he brought it as glad tidings of great
							joy, to all people— But he certainly did denounce terrible punishments
							to the wicked, and I see not how those who disbelieve the denunciations
							can believe the promises. <persRef ref="bacon-francis">Lord
								Bacon</persRef> says he had rather believe all the fables in the
							legend, and the Talmud, and the Alcoran, than that this universal frame
							is without a mind— He had rather—that is the foundation of his belief is
							desire, not reason; Passion, not judgment— And this is the foundation of
							all religious belief— In the Evening I attended at the Episcopal Church
							and heard <persRef ref="griswold-alexander">Bishop Griswold</persRef>
							from Deuteronomy 29.29 “The secret things belong unto the Lord our God:
							but those things which are revealed, belong unto us, and to our children
							for ever, that we may do all the words of this Law.” This was an
							ingenious discourse upon the Trinity— The Bishop said the Church was
							unfairly and untruly charged, with requiring the belief of things not
							contained in the Scriptures. The Church required no such thing; but if
							the Scriptures said he, declare that in Christ, dwelleth the fulness of
							the father bodily; believe it—and then he gave a succession of all the
							texts which countenance the Trinitarian creed, putting them all
							hypothetically, and adding at the close of each text—believe it— To
							which with not less ingenuity he subjoined, if there <pb n="224"
								type="ms"/>be any thing irrational or absurd required by the Church
							on Articles of Faith, it is not in the Scriptures. Now this is plausible
							but not sound Logic— The Unitarians might quote all the Texts which
							recognize the inferiority of Christ to God, and require of their
							auditory to believe them— The Unitarians might say the Doctrine of the
							Trinity is absurd, and therefore is not in Scripture— Arguments which
							may be adduced with equal force on both sides of a question can not be
							conclusive in favour of either— The Bishop’s manner of delivery is not
							very animated, nor absolutely cold— I called at <persRef
								key="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef> before going to Church and
							saw <persRef ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> there.

								ref="phelps-abner">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Abner
								Phelps</persRef>, to attend this afternoon at half past four
							O’Clock, at the delivery of an Anti-masonic Oration by <persRef
								ref="fuller-timothy">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Timothy
								Fuller</persRef>— I accordingly went in with <persRef
								ref="kirk-john">John Kirke</persRef>— When I arrived, I was met at
							the door of Faneuil Hall, by the Sheriff of the County, <persRef
								ref="sumner-charles">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles P.
								Sumner</persRef>, who introduced me to a Seat in the Hall at the
							right hand of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller— At his left was
								<persRef ref="beecher-lyman">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Beecher</persRef> the Clergyman, then opening the Meeting with
							Prayer— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fuller’s Oration took about three
							quarters of an hour in the delivery; and was succeeded by the reading of
							a Salter from <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Rush</persRef> of 22 folio-pages; in answer to one addressed to him
							by a Committee of the late Anti-Masonic Convention in Boston— It was
							read by a young man named <persRef ref="u">Walker</persRef>, but he was
							not familiar with the hand writing, and did not read it impressively—
							The Oration and the Letter were both ardent against the Institution— The
							most stirring passage in Rush’s Letter is the Statement that not one of
							the men convicted in the State of New-York, of agency in the kidnapping
							of <persRef ref="morgan-william2">Morgan</persRef> has been expelled
							from the Lodge to which he belongs— When I went in to Faneuil Hall, it
							was well filled but not crowded— There were many indifferent Spectators
							some of whom were continually going away, and in the midst of the
							reading of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush’s Letter, a parading
							Militia Company, marched with drum and fife in the Street by the Hall
							which drew off certainly more than a hundred of the Auditory. Some of
							the Anti-masons seemed to think this was purposely done; but it might be
							otherwise— Of my Boston acquaintance I saw very few— Of the Aristocracy,
							not one. There were a few Ladies—not more than twenty— There is scarcely
							any popular feeling on the subject; a large body of mechanics being
							employed upon the building of a Magnificent Masonic Hall— The
							application of a blister upon the bosom of the public is wanting— A
							Melodrame— A Transparency a popular ballad well composed would run like
							wild fire; but there is no dramatist, Painter, or ballad-monger to
							produce it— <persRef ref="bailey-john">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								John Bailey</persRef> was there; I took to town, and gave him the
							recommendatory Letter to <persRef ref="gallatin-albert">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Gallatin</persRef> which he had
							requested, and with which I had enclosed his pamphlet on the Rights of
							Governments— He said he wished <pb n="225" type="ms"/>for some
							conversation with me, and finding we could not conveniently hold it
							there, I agreed to stop at his house on my way home— He rode home with
								<persRef ref="morton-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph
								Morton</persRef>, and I reached his house before them. I walked back
							and met them, when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey left M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Morton’s Chaise and joined me. He said
								<persRef ref="stone-william2">Stone</persRef> the Editor of the
							New-York Commercial Advertiser, wished me to write a Series of Essays,
							five or six in number, exposing the present condition of the Country to
							be published in his paper, but under an injunction of secrecy. I told
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey, that he might say in answer
							to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stone, that my engagements did not
							allow me time to comply with his request—but I said there was another
							difficulty in the way— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stone and I might
							perhaps not differ about the evil—but we should about the remedy; and
							such Essays, as I should write would not suit him— I added that I was
							informed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush that <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef>
							declined all concession to Anti-Masonry, and that I thought M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay was in secret Masonic Communication,
							with the Masons, his supporters— I further observed that if the
							Anti-masons, did not propose to support M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Clay, it was of the last importance to them to communicate with each
							other in the different States upon the Candidate to be assumed by them,
							before their contemplated meeting at Baltimore in September: else they
							would certainly disagree there— The fiend would creep into the fold;
							turn them to his own use. They would break up in discord, and not only
							have no common candidate but would irretrievably ruin their cause— They
							ought in my opinion without a second thought take up Rush— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Bailey said he had hoped I should be their
							Candidate— I told him I had not the slightest desire to be so, and
							wished not even to be thought of— It was near ten at Night when I
							reached home— The Evening very cold. I found <persRef
								ref="nicklin-philip">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nicklin</persRef> with <persRef ref="nicklin-juliana">his
								wife</persRef> and <persRef ref="u">daughter</persRef> had been
							here, and he had left for me; a Letter from <persRef
								ref="southard-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Southard</persRef>. He said he had also a verbal message to deliver
							me from him, and expressed a strong wish to see me— He had said the same
							thing to me on the fourth, at the Meeting-house, immediately after I
							finished my Oration— I was much surprized to see him there, not having
							before known that he was absent from Philadelphia. My wheat from
								<persRef ref="thayer-solomon">Solomon Thayer’s</persRef> seed was
							reaped this day.</p>

							between them. I lived four years in <persRef ref="welsh-thomas">his

							critical and agitated years of my youth—when the world was all before
							me, and Providence my guide— He was afterwards four years my Secretary
							at Berlin—since which he had passed through various vicissitudes of
							Fortune, prosperous and adverse— Five short years since he was an
							Alderman of the City of Boston—a Member of the Senate of the
							Commonwealth, in affluent Circumstances, very popular in the City, and
							with a fair prospect of succeeding <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">M<hi

							which he had lived with his aged father, and <persRef
								ref="welsh-harriet">his maiden Sister</persRef>, and to live himself
							at a boarding house— His father died some time last Spring. He was

							the prostration and ruin of all ones friends be added to the cup of
							bitterness? May I bear with fortitude that which I am doomed to feel—
							Charles came out immediately after the funeral. M<hi rend="superscript"

							Psalm, sung by the Choir, immediately before I spoke— Thus goes into the

							successful— The great error in setting out Apple-trees he says is in
							setting their Roots too deep. They should be altogether
							superficial—barely covered with earth— This accords with my experience.
							He says that varieties of the Potato must be raised by planting the

							a few days since— They are withered up, but the seeds are in perfect

							a man with whom I have no acquaintance—but dated at Cincinnati Ohio—
								<persRef ref="spear-alpheus">Alpheus Spear</persRef> was here this

							spoke also of mowing or reaping the grass, growing upon the border round
							the Apple Orchard which I set out last fall, and overshadowing the
							seedling forest trees from the Nuts and Acorns then planted— I also told
							him, I wanted him to sow the grain raised from the seed which I got two
							years ago, from <persRef ref="thayer-solomon">Solomon Thayer</persRef>,
							and which has been just got in— I continued writing a rambling

								ref="dickson-william">Editor</persRef> of Massillon’s works, says
							that this Oration was the third of his funeral Eulogies— That it was
							much applauded when delivered, and much criticised afterwards when

							with the compliments to the persons of their families present to hear

							Anti-Masonry— <persRef ref="waterhouse-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript"

							returned early in the afternoon to Cambridge— He has recently returned

								>daughter</persRef> married to a <persRef ref="ware-henry2"
								>Son</persRef> of <persRef ref="ware-henry">Professor
							Ware</persRef>— He met there <persRef ref="channing-walter">Doctor
								Channing</persRef> of Boston—and mentioned to me the purport of some

							Portrait Painter, <persRef ref="stuart-gilbert">Gilbert
							Stuart</persRef>— But he says <persRef ref="stuart-charlotte">Stuart’s

							The Doctor shewed me a Letter from <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi

							a copy of his book upon Junius— A polite Letter, assuring him that the

							what was my opinion— I said I thought much like M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Madison— I said I was unwilling to believe <persRef

							because it would lower him in my opinion: but I added I should not be

								D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Waterhouse compiled a sort of

							now thoughts of revising and publishing it again with his own name. I
							thought it would not now be likely to succeed so well as it did
							formerly. The subject being now of less general interest— I urged him
							rather to collect and republish the papers of his controversy concerning
							his professorship at Harvard University— He took back the Volumes of the
							Patriot which he had lent me containing those papers— I visited my
							Garden and Nursery, where the <pb n="229" type="ms"/>Walnut seedlings,
							are yet coming up in considerable numbers— All others have long since
							ceased to shew themselves— I cut off a twig from my walnut tree of 1804.

							bough, leaving only skeletons of the leaves— Great part of the day was

						<p>Finished my version of the second Psalm; more difficult than any one that
							I had undertaken—intelligible only by being considered as prophetical of
							Jesus Christ, and so expressly twice quoted by <persRef ref="paul">Saint
								Paul</persRef> in the Epistle to the Hebrews 1.5. and 5.5— I felt a
							repugnance even at attempting it—but the versions of <persRef
								ref="tate-nahum">Tate</persRef> and <persRef ref="watts-isaac"
								>Watts</persRef> are both unsatisfactory— Mine is no better but is
							as good as I could make it— I was occupied from breakfast to dinner time
							almost entirely in refreshing my Memory upon the important Military
							Events of our Revolutionary War— <persRef key="monroe-james">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s</persRef> career of public
							life began with it— From 1776 to 1779 he was in <persRef
								ref="washington-george">General Washington’s</persRef> Army, and was
							present at the most important Events in it, through the Series of those
							years— He was also occasionally engaged in other Military Service till
							the close of the War— He was wounded by a Ball through the shoulder at
							the battle of Princeton. It will be indispensable to notice this part of
							his life in delivering his Eulogy— I must therefore renew my familiarity
							with the history of the War—for which purpose I read many pages of
								<persRef ref="pitkin-timothy">Pitkin’s</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="belsham-william">Belsham’s</persRef> Histories—of <persRef
								ref="stedman-charles">Stedman’s</persRef> History of the War; of the
							Remembrancer, and of Washington’s Letters to Congress— These gave me
							distinct recollections of the campaigns of 1776. and of the affair at
							Princeton in January 1777— Going back to those times seems almost like a
							resurrection from the dead—but while reading so much I could write but
							little, and made scarcely any progress with my Eulogy, and otherwise
							fell in Arrear of my ordinary tasks— <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles</persRef> borrowed for me at the Athenaeum, and brought out

							<pb n="230" type="ms"/>British Spy, written in 1802 when M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe was Governor of Virginia; in the

								<persRef ref="marshall-john">Chief Justice Marshall</persRef>. It is
							chiefly remarkable as containing a prediction that M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe would be one day President of the
							United States— Charles brought me also a message from <persRef ref="u"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ballister</persRef>, which gave
							me cause enough for Meditation, and he gave me advice, which ought by me
							to be pondered still more— I visited my Garden and Nursery and
							transplanted several wild Cherry and Apple-seedlings from the Book-box
							to the Garden— My disappointments in these Speculations have this
							consolation—that they are not very costly— I cannot say the same of
							others— Black Ants and white lice their offspring, are now the fatal

							Months, from the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of May, and have made
							our residence here very cheerful— But she is expecting to be confined
							shortly, and they both prefer that this Event should take place in
							Boston— It is probably a full month distant, but I have forborne to
							utter a word of interference with their inclinations, in a matter so
							immediately concerning themselves— If there is a lesson necessary for my
							peace of mind in this world, it is to form no strong attachment to any
							person or thing that it contains; and if I have a weakness growing upon
							me above all others it is that of attaching myself inordinately both to
							persons and things— To persons from whom I must part— To things which

							Letters, <persRef ref="pitkin-timothy">Pitkin</persRef> and <persRef

							and two of <persRef ref="gordon-william">Gordon’s</persRef> History of

								>r.</hi> Monroe took his Seat in Congress, December 1783 at

						<p>Finished my version of the third Psalm; still with entire
							dissatisfaction, a Sentiment which hangs upon every thing that I do.—
							The Psalms appear to a person taking them in hand for translation a
							series of perpetual repetitions— Yet in every one of them there is some
							thought not expressed in any other— To seize that <unclear>is</unclear> the peculiar duty
							of the Translator, and as there is in a great many of them an assemblage
							of ideas the connection between which is not easily perceived, it
							becomes no easy task, to join upon them the links necessary to form
							their concatenation— The third Psalm obviously requires the supposition
							of a lapse of time between the first and last verses— It is said to have
							been composed by <persRef ref="david">David</persRef> when he fled
							before his Son <persRef ref="absalom">Absalom</persRef>— But it seems to
							have been begun when he fled, and finished after the rebellion was
							subdued— For the first part in an agonizing prayer; and the last a shout
							of triumph— Unless with this key the Psalm is all inconsistency. With
							it, the beautiful disorder, is the effect of art— I bathed at the Creek,
							and swam with <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac H. Adams</persRef>
							immediately after breakfast— <persRef ref="adams-elizabeth"
								>Elizabeth</persRef> went with <persRef ref="gourgas-john">M<hi

							for 17 dollars— The Penny-ferry lot for six— And yesterday set up the
							Cherry-tree lot at auction; but could get no bid— He is however offered
							six dollars for it which I consented to take. This afternoon I planted
							An Atherton last year’s Apple Core and the seeds of another, and also
							some Strawberry Seeds— I have at last Blackberry vines and currant
							seedlings from the seeds of last year— A ripening early pear in the
							centre of the garden— My other Seedlings numerous but devoted to
							unavoidable destruction— The portion of my Nursery where the wheat was
							has just been spaded up—but the heat of the Summer forbids my working
							with the Spade— <persRef ref="farrar-john">Professor Farrar</persRef>
							sent a Messenger for his Letters and they were given to him— I returned
							the second and third sheets of my Oration corrected, and received the
							fourth and fifth, which is the last— I read some pages of the Life of

						<p>Began my version of the fourth Psalm, and sent the last two half sheets
							of my Oration to the <persRef
								ref="richardson-eleazar;lord-melvin;holbrook-john"
								>printers</persRef> in Boston— I went in with <persRef
								ref="kirk-john">John Kirke</persRef> myself and attended a Meeting
							of the ФB.K. Society, which had been called by <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> their President, by an
							Advertisement in the Newspapers— I was surprized to find assembled at
							the Hall of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences between fifty and
							sixty Members— The President soon after I entered called the Meeting to
							order and stated his object in calling it—which was to consider the
							propriety of revising the charter and fundamental Laws of the Society;
							which he read— He read also that part of a recent publication of
								<persRef ref="allyn-avery">Avery Allyn</persRef> upon Free-Masonry,
							which relates to the Ф.B.K. Society—and in which an account in some
							respects erroneous of the Origin and character of the Institution is
							given— And he further read a Letter to him from <persRef
								ref="short-william">William Short</persRef> now at Philadelphia.
							William Short was the first signer at William and Mary College,
							Virginia, of the Charter of the Ф.B.K. society at Harvard University—
							This Charter was granted to <persRef ref="parmele-elisha">Elisha
								Parmele</persRef> in 1779: and in the Statutes of the Institution
							there is the form of an Oath to be administered to every member at his
							admission. Short says the Society was formed by a fellow Student of his
							at the College of Williamsburg, because he prided himself in being the
							first Hellenist of the College, and that it was to rivalise another
							Society with Latin initials— After these Papers I enquired what other
							branches of the Society were known to exist at this <unclear>Time</unclear> <pb n="232"
								type="ms"/>with a view to propose some communication with them
							before adopting any definitive measure— <persRef ref="story-joseph"
								>Judge Story</persRef> moved that a Committee should be appointed to
							take the charter and Laws of the Society into Consideration, and report
							a revision of them to the Society at an <unclear>adjoint</unclear> Meeting. While the
							Judge was reducing his Motion to writing, I offered one, not to
							supersede his but to be adopted with it— I enquired if the elections
							were already completed, of the Members of the Class now passing from the
							Junior to the Senior Class— Nobody knew; but it was believed that part
							of them were chosen, and the rest remained to be elected— I moved a
							Resolution that no Oath should be administered to any Member of the
							Society to be hereafter elected, and no promise of secrecy required—
							Judge Story withdrew his motion to allow mine to be debated— Many
							amendments were proposed to my motion, which were debated at least two
							hours— No direct opposition to it was avowed—but substitutes and
							Amendments rapidly succeeded one another, and the debate was running
							into a snarl— <persRef ref="dexter-franklin">Franklin Dexter</persRef>
							at last proposed as an Amendment to my Resolution, that no Secret should
							be <hi rend="italic">disclosed</hi> to any member to be admitted
							hereafter— I accepted it as a part of my Motion deeming it a mere verbal
							addition, signifying nothing, but it raised a fourfold array of
							objections, and my motion was finally voted to be laid on the Table—
							Judge Story’s motion was then taken up and after some discussion
							adopted— He moved that the Committee should consist of nine, and be
							nominated by the President, which was agreed to. The Committee are Judge
							Story, J. Q. Adams, <persRef ref="fuller-henry">H. H. Fuller</persRef>,
								<persRef ref="lowell-charles">D<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>
								Lowell</persRef>, <persRef ref="everett-alexander">A. H.

								Loring</persRef>, <persRef ref="baldwin-loammi">L.
							Baldwin</persRef>, <persRef ref="austin-james">J. T. Austin</persRef>,
							and <persRef ref="jackson-charles">Judge C Jackson</persRef>— I then
							moved that the form of Oath in the Record Book should be repealed, to
							which J. T. Austin objected as not in order, after the appointment of
							the Committee and the President so divided— But M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Loring moved that no new member should be admitted till
							after the Committee shall have reported, and that vote passed— It is now
							vacation at the College so that none can be admitted— The Meeting
							adjourned to Thursday the 11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of next
							Month, and Judge Story notified the members of the Committee to meet
							next Monday Morning at ten. We adjourned at half past one— The views of
							Judge Story extend to a total remodeling of the Society—to abolish the
							rule requiring unanimity, at the election of the Members, and to turn
							the Society into an Academy of Literature— He declared his
							disapprobation of all secret Societies, and declared the Administration
							of the Oath illegal— As I returned from the Meeting to <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> Office, I met before it
								<persRef ref="hall-joseph">Judge Hall</persRef>, who went in there
							with me for a few minutes, and then to the Judge’s House where he

							saw <persRef ref="adams-abigail4">his wife</persRef>— He was not at

							All is changed around me— Of my cotemporaries how few remain— Of my
							Seniors scarce any yet how vain and profitless the reflection
							incessantly pressed upon me that a few short days only can pass, before
							I must follow my fathers to the grave, and leave my dwelling to I know

							fifty-five years since I saw <persRef key="adams-abigail">my

							<persRef ref="smith-elizabeth">Mother</persRef> deposited— She had been
							a second mother to me, and my memory never recurs to her but with a
							feeling of melancholy affection.— Death fixes forever the relation
							existing between the departed Spirit and the Survivors upon Earth— My
							Grandmother Smith can never be to me any other than a guardian Angel of
							my Childhood; nor I to her other than a child of her guardian care— I
							cannot realize that I am now seven years older than she was when she
							died, nor conceive that if we meet in heaven it must be under very
							different relations than those in which we were separated by her death—

									rend="superscript">r</hi> George Parkman</persRef>, who went up
							with me and witnessed the Execution of the Deeds— I then went
							immediately to the Hall of the American Academy, and there met the ФBK
							Committee, <persRef ref="story-joseph">judge Story</persRef> presiding—
							We there discussed for four hours the report to be made to the Society—
							After much desultory discussion—I moved that the Committee should report
							a Resolution repealing all parts of the Charter and Laws which require
							the Administration of an Oath, and any promise of Secrecy— This after
							much discussion was adopted, <persRef ref="baldwin-loammi">Col<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Baldwin</persRef> only voting against
							it— He preferred to continue the Society as it is, and wished for no

								<persRef ref="everett-alexander">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> A.
								H. Everett</persRef> moved that in future members should be elected
							by a vote of two thirds of the members present— I opposed this

							the Charter and Laws necessary, than that which had been adopted, and
							secondly because the rule requiring unanimity for the choice of members
							depended upon that part of the Institution which declared one of its
							great objects to be Friendship. I finally moved as an Amendment to
							Everett’s Resolution, that all the parts of the Charter and Laws, which
							have any relation to Friendship should be repealed; leaving it a mere
							literary Association— This was rejected by a vote of five to three and
							Everett’s Resolution passed by the same vote— <persRef

							then proposed and passed <pb n="235" type="ms"/>that all nominations for
							election of members but of under graduates should be made a year

							we had already more than matter enough for one day’s debate of the
							Society— A Sub-Committee of three, judge Story, A. H. Everett and
								<persRef ref="jackson-charles">judge Jackson</persRef>, was then
							appointed to report a revised Constitution and Code, at an adjourned
							Meeting of the Committee on Monday the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi>

							delivered eight Lectures of his course at Cambridge against
							Nullification and <persRef ref="blackstone-william"
								>Blackstone’s</persRef> definition of Sovereignty. He said he
							proposed to publish his Lectures next year, and should cite me as
							authority for his doctrine— He said too he was glad I had named
							Massachusetts as one of the States which had countenanced the absurdity
							of nullification— It was two O’Clock, when the Committee adjourned— I

							would be duly grateful, as I am now to pass through an ordeal far more

								ref="berrien-john">John M. Berrien</persRef> late Attorney General
							of the United States to the Public, with much collateral Correspondence.
							The Telegraph newspaper some time since affirmed that a member of

								ref="eaton-margaret">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>

								>Blair</persRef> the Editor of the Globe extremely insolent and

								>Major Eaton</persRef> from his Cabinet, it would be considered of—
							This Paper Berrien and Ingham positively declare never was read to them.
								<pb n="236" type="ms"/>They both declare that <persRef

							Johnson, stating that the President had expressly disclaimed any

							revisal of my fourth of July Oration for the press, when the application
							came from the corporation of Boston, to deliver an Eulogy upon <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>
							which I had scarcely the right, and could not have the inclination to
							decline— But it has from that time oppressed me with reading and writing
							almost night and day, in the heart of a Summer damp and sultry beyond
							example— And I have been not less oppressed with anxiety than with
							labour— The Oration succeeded far beyond expectation and has been
							hitherto spared very generally by malignant criticism— Non nobis domine
							sed nomini tuo sit gloria— It touched upon popular topics, and presented
							them under new views— This I cannot again do, nor can I do Justice to
							the subject without coming in collision with Passions and Resentments
							which will not sleep— There is a combination of parties against me
							including almost the whole population of the Country, and of which my
							former supporters are the most inveterate— The <persRef key="clay-henry"
								>Clay</persRef> Masons, and so called National Republicans— This
							Eulogy will furnish them an occasion to assail me— I now employ the day
							from morning dawn till dark in reading and writing, and all other
							business runs in arrear—</p>
