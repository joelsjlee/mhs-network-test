							the Earth: 26. And though after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in
							my flesh shall I see God: 27. Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes
							shall behold, and not another; though my veins be consumed within me”
							The morning discourse, was <pb n="242" type="ms"/>occasional upon the
							Communion which was administered immediately after it. <persRef
								ref="smith-louisa">Louisa C. Smith</persRef> and <persRef
								key="adams-thomas">my brother’s</persRef> Son <persRef
								ref="adams-joseph">Joseph</persRef> dined with us— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Whitney’s commentary upon his afternoon
							text was not very satisfactory— The meaning of the text itself is
							obscure and uncertain— It forms part of the funeral Service of the
							Episcopal Church, and has been considered as not only asserting the
							doctrine of the immortality of the Soul, but as prophetically referring
							to Jesus Christ the redeemer of the world, at least fifteen hundred
							years before he was born in the body.— M<hi rend="superscript">r
							</hi>Whitney does not understand the passage in this Sense— The English
							Translation to make out an intelligible meaning to the passage has added
							some very emphatical but questionable words— The Book of <persRef
								ref="job">Job</persRef> has been ascribed to <persRef ref="moses"
								>Moses</persRef> and <persRef ref="ezekiel">Ezekiel</persRef>, who
							lived at a distance of at least seven hundred years from each other. In
							the Book of Ezekiel Job is named—but in that of Job there is not the
							most distant allusion to any portion of the Hebrew History or
							Scriptures— <persRef ref="satan">Satan</persRef> figures in it indeed,
							and he was a historical Hebrew character— But he is presented in Job, as
							holding in his rebellious State an intercourse rather more familiar with
							the Creator, than comports with the sentence to which he was doomed at
							the fall— The rebellion of the Angels which preceded the Creation of Man
							is but obscurely alluded to in the Scriptures— I heard the late <persRef
								ref="gardiner-john2">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Gardiner</persRef> once preach a Sermon in which he said that Satan
							was a mysterious personage often mentioned in the sacred Books— I walked

						<p>Finished the version of the 9<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm
							yesterday— Began the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> this Morning. A
							pamphlet was left at my house this Morning; and a Letter signed <persRef
								ref="shedel-james">James Shedel</persRef>—with a message that the
							writer would call in the course of the day— The Letter was an argument
							threatening and persuading me to pay for suppressing the pamphlet— I
							went to Boston, and attended the Meeting of the Committee of the ΦΒ.Κ
							Society which sat from 10 till past 2. <persRef ref="story-joseph">Judge
								Story</persRef> the Chairman had a Report prepared which was
							earnestly and warmly debated for four hours— It was in substance a new
							Constitution for the Society, making several essential changes in its
							Laws; of which the abolition of all Secrets and promises was one— I was
							desirous that the alteration should be confined to this and to one other
							By-Law which subjected the members of the graduating Class to all the
							expenses of the Anniversary Celebration— There was no direct opposition
							to the Articles of the Report abolishing Secrets and Promises, except
							from <persRef ref="baldwin-loammi">Colonel Baldwin</persRef>, who said
							he wished for no change, and preferred that the Society should continue
							as it was, but used no argument— All the other Articles of the Report
							were carried by bare majorities— I strongly opposed the Article for
							altering the mode of Election.— It has always hitherto required, an
							unanimous vote— The change proposed is, that a vote of two thirds of the
							voters present shall be sufficient for admission. <persRef
								ref="everett-edward">Edward Everett</persRef> the President, and
							Judge Story are both exceedingly bent upon effecting this alteration,
							and have been labouring to accomplish it for eight or ten years— I think
							it will change entirely the character of the Society and make it less
							select—for one improper exclusion which it will prevent, it will secure
							the admission of ten pale-coloured candidates of little or no value to
							Literature or to the reputation of the Society— Judge Story, argued the
							point with great earnestness; and carried the Article by a bare
							majority, seven members only of the Committee being present The <pb
								n="243" type="ms"/>Judge was called out for an hour to attend a
							Garden and Cemetery Meeting, and placed me in the Chair during his
							absence. While he was gone, one Article of his Report was set aside, and
							to the rest excepting that which I opposed there was little or no
							objection— But the judge was a little discomposed at the loss even of
							one Article of his Report, which he considered as forming one entire and
							perfect system, the symmetry of which would be lost by the omission of
							any part of it— He asked for a reconsideration of the vote, by which the
							Article had been rejected, and <persRef ref="lowell-charles">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowell</persRef> moved the
							reconsideration— But two members of the Committee had withdrawn since
							the vote had been taken, and upon my adverting to the usual rule of
							deliberative assemblies that decided questions shall not be reconsidered
							by smaller numbers than when the vote was taken, had been present, the
							Judge gave up the point. He had now two Volumes of the Records of the
							Society which had not been produced at the meeting of the Society or at
							the former meeting of the Committee— By these it appears that in 1806.
							the Oath had been abolished, and the solemn promise of secrecy
							substituted in its place—and that the promise of assisting a brother
							with Life and fortune had been discarded— And that in 1825. an entire
							new System of Laws had been adopted—compiled by Edward Everett— The
							Report of Judge Story confirmed the whole of this Code, with two or
							three exceptions; and I objected that although I was not aware of any
							change which I should wish to be made in the existing Laws, yet I was
							equally unprepared to report a confirmation of what I had not read; and
							exceptions for which I did not see the necessity— Every vote was however
							carried against me, and even Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi> Baldwin,
							who was averse to any alteration voted for the Support and every Article
							of it—to avail himself of the objections against every Article, and
							thereby secure if possible against the whole a vote of rejection—
								<persRef ref="jackson-charles">Judge Jackson</persRef> did much the
							same, though he said not one word, against the Article to abolish the
							Secrets and Promises— I asked judge Story for a copy of those two
							Articles, which he gave me, and I told him that when the Report should
							be made, I should move to lay it on the table, and take up those
							Articles alone— And I said my object would be to limit the discussion to
							them fearing that by scattering it over several other objects, the Sense
							of the Society upon that could not be obtained— He said that nothing
							would be done. That there was a great diversity of opinion among the
							members, upon the abolition of the Secrets; and that there was an
							opposition organizing against the whole measure— The judge said that the
							members elect of the Class now commencing Seniors at the University had
							declined accepting the membership, burdened as it now is with a tax of
							fifteen dollars each on admission, to defray the expenses of the
							anniversary.— The Report proposes to discard the Medal and Ribbons, and
							that the expenses shall be defrayed; as the Society may from time to
							time direct— I suggested the expediency of retrenching many of the
							expenses; such as the band of Music—and even the dinner— The
							Consideration of this was postponed— When the Article for changing the
							mode of election was apparently about to pass, I moved as an amendment
							to it that every thing having reference to <hi rend="italic">friendship,
							</hi>as being one of the objects of the Institution, should be
							expunged—leaving it a mere literary Society— This struck them
							disagreeably; and I assured them I proposed it only as what appeared to
							me a consistent consequence following from the change in the mode of
							election— A Society of Friends should admit no new member but with the
							unanimous consent of all the old— A Society merely literary may exist
							without any other link of Association— The Report however was adopted,
							and is to be made to the Society at their adjourned Meeting next
							Thursday— I dined at <persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef>
							house, and <persRef ref="brooks-peter">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Peter C. Brooks</persRef> was there— In the Evening <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Adams</persRef> came home with me to Quincy. <pb n="244" type="ms"
							/>On my arrival at home about Sunset I found there a man who said his
							name was <persRef ref="colburn-joshua">Joshua Colburn</persRef>— That he
							had been a Scholar at Harvard University, but was now a Clerk in a
							Counting House— He had been sitting waiting for me from three O’Clock in
							the afternoon— He said he had accidentally gone into a Printing Office,
							where he had seen a pamphlet which he thought calculated to do very
							great injury to me—and he had urged the printer not to publish it— That
							he was himself a warm friend to me and my character. That it was known,
							from Maine from New-Hampshire and other States, that it was expected I
							should be nominated by the Anti-Masonic Convention, to be held next
							Month at Baltimore, for election to the Presidency of the United States—
							That the Masons knew of this pamphlet and would circulate immense
							numbers of them— That many thousands of them were ordered from New-York,
							Philadelphia, and the Southern and Western States. That the Printer was
							a poor man, and said he did not want to hurt me, but that printing was
							his profession and he must live by it— That <persRef ref="henshaw-david"
								>David Henshaw</persRef>, the Collector at Boston; and <persRef
								ref="greene-nathaniel">Nat Green</persRef> the Postmaster had
							ordered great numbers of the pamphlet and the <persRef
								ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>-men and Masons would
							circulate it all over the Country. I asked him who had printed the
							pamphlet he said <persRef ref="homer-joseph">Joseph Homer</persRef>— I
							asked whether he was of the firm of <persRef ref="beals-william"
								>Beals</persRef> and <persRef ref="homer-james">Homer</persRef>: he
							said, No—but they would support him in issuing the publication— I asked
							him who had informed him that Henshaw and Greene had bespoken so many of
							the pamphlet. He said <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Doolittle</persRef>— I asked him how it was expected to suppress a
							pamphlet of which so many copies had been ordered from all parts of the
							Country— He said the copy right would be worth about five thousand
							dollars. But that the Edition that had been printed would not cost so
							much— That not one copy of it had gone out of the Printers hands; and he
							was willing to sell the whole of it— I told him the Printer had deceived
							him, if he had told him, that not one copy of it had gone out of his
							hands—for I had a copy of it myself— I believed the pamphlet was full of
							falsehoods—but if events in which I had no part, and over which I could
							have no controul were to injure my character, I could not help it— If
							the Jackson men and Masons were apprehensive that I should be nominated
							by the Anti-Masonic Convention at Baltimore, they might set themselves
							at ease— I had no reason to believe that any of the Antimasons had such
							intention, but directly the reverse, I had— But however that might be, I
							would not give one dollar to suppress any thing that any human being can
							publish of me, true or false— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colburn
							then took his leave and went away. Henshaw and Green are at the bottom
							of this as they were of the <persRef ref="cunningham-william"
								>Cunningham</persRef> Correspondence— Their sting is now invenomed
							by the fear of losing their places.— There is also Masonic Charity in
							the Cup—</p>

								Curtis</persRef> and <persRef ref="boylston-alicia">M<hi
									rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston</persRef> came about 9
							O’Clock this morning and we were occupied all the forenoon, in examining
							the Account which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis had prepared for
							Settlement at the Probate office, and in conferring upon the management
							of the Estate. I had received a Letter from <persRef ref="gray-horace"
								>Horace Gray</persRef>, proposing to purchase or to rent for years
							the lot of Land belonging to <persRef ref="boylston-ward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Boylston’s</persRef> Estate at
							Charlestown.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis said that <persRef
								ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Devens</persRef> an
							Inhabitant of Charlestown who owns land adjoining upon it, had also
							applied to know the price of which it was to be sold. <pb n="245"
								type="ms"/>There are about 16000 feet of the lot, and at the
							appraisement of the Estate, it was valued at 4000 dollars for the whole
							or 25 Cents a square foot.— It would not have brought that price at the
							time; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis says it would now
							readily sell at 35 cents a foot— The reason of this appretiation is that
							it is believed the projected Railway from Lowell must come to Horace
							Gray’s wharf at the deepest water and safest mooring ground of Boston
							Harbour, and this Land adjoining upon it is the best in that
							neighbourhood for the erection of warehouses upon it.— If the Railway
							should come there, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis thinks it will
							enhance very greatly the value of this lot— As we are under no necessity
							of selling it immediately we all thought it most advisable to reserve
							for the benefit of the Estate, the chances of its rising value and with
							the concurrence both of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Curtis and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston, I answered M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray, that our price for the land would be
							at the rate of a dollar a foot, and that if he preferred renting it we
							would name a price if he would inform us for a term of how many years he
							wished to take it— As it was apparent that M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Gray would decline any further Treaty upon the subject we
							agreed to ask the same price of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Devens,
							and keep the land for the chances of future Appretiation— About Noon we
							went to the Probate Court, where the <persRef ref="leland-sherman">judge</persRef> in a very few minutes
							received and swore us to the account which he immediately passed— We
							confirmed the Sales of two of the Lots at Princetown— And I agreed with
								M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston that I would go with my
							ward, <persRef ref="boylston-ward2">Ward Nicholas Boylston</persRef>, to
							Cambridge on the day of his Examination for admission at the University
							which will be the Friday after Commencement— Ward has an excellent
							Certificate from his Preceptor— But <persRef ref="boylston-thomas"
								>Thomas</persRef> has no disposition for study, and M<hi
								rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston wishes that he may not be sent
							to College— I promised to enquire of <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2"

								>Editors</persRef> of the National Intelligencer of the New-York
							Spectator and Commercial Advertiser have published the whole Oration,
							and the Boston publishers suggest the enquiry whether suits should not
							be brought against them, for violation of the copy-right— I said there
							could be no doubt that the publication was a breach of copy right, by
							the Editors of the Newspapers, but whether in such a case a Jury would
							give in damages a sum sufficient to pay the costs of the suit might be
							doubted—Fourth of July Orations were generally considered, as public
							property, and copy-rights of them had seldom been taken out— I had
							besides understood <persRef ref="lord-melvin">M<hi rend="superscript"

							had been granted, at least in mitigation of damages—and it was very
							doubtful, whether the damages recovered would be sufficient to pay the
							costs and charges of a suit— I thought the best course for the Printers
							would be, to write to the Editors of Newspapers who have published the
							whole Oration, complaining of the breach of Copy right, as to
							professional brothers and asking them some compensation for the injury—
							They concluded to give— <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">Price

						<p><date>11. IV. </date>Thursday. Sun rose 5.2.</p>
						<p>I went in to Boston early this Morning, and immediately attended the
							Meeting of the Φ.Β.K. Society. In the morning it was held in the Hall of
							the American Academy in State Street. I met in the Room below <persRef
								ref="story-joseph">Judge Story</persRef>, the Chairman of the
							Committee who had a short Article prepared for his Report, in place of
							that which was rejected in Committee on Monday; and who seemed to think
							it absolutely necessary, to make the Report itself entire I agreed that
							he should Report it— <persRef ref="everett-edward">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Everett</persRef> the President
							immediately called the Meeting to order. The Report was read, upon which
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Everett requested <persRef
								ref="phillips-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S. C.
								Phillips</persRef> of Salem to take the Chair, in Committee of the
							whole— I then immediately moved that the Report of the Committee should
							be laid on the Table to take up two Resolutions which I offered; which
							were to remove all injunction of Secresy, by the Society upon any
							present member; and no secret of any kind should ever be imposed, or
							promise exacted from any member to be admitted hereafter— There arose
							immediately questions of order, whether this motion could be received in
							Committee of the whole and I finally varied it by moving to amend the
							Report, by striking it all out, except the introductory words, and to
							insert my two Resolutions in the place— This brought on the whole
							discussion. I assigned my Reasons for my Motion—which were, first that I
							thought no other alteration of the Constitution and Laws of the Society
							necessary, but the abolition of Secrets and promises— Secondly that I
							disapproved all the other alterations proposed in the Report, and
							thirdly that I wished to keep the discussion confined to those objects
							alone; apprehending that if the whole Report should be debated it would
							be only a waste of time and that nothing would eventually be done. There
							was much discussion upon forms; and finally the Committee rose and
							reported that they had come to no Resolution— The President resumed the
							Chair with a general assent that he should without leaving it again, be
							at Liberty to enter into the debate— I renewed my proposition to strike
							out and amend the Report, which Judge Story, Edward Everett and S.C.
							Phillips opposed— I was not sustained by any one— At last <persRef
								ref="parsons-theophilus">Theophilus Parsons</persRef>, moved that
							the whole subject should be indefinitely postponed, and made a Speech to
							sustain his motion somewhat rude and personal upon me— He said it would
							be remembered, that at the former meeting of the Society, I had made the
							same motion which I had now repeated and that after a full and thorough
							discussion of the subject my motion had received the solitary vote of
							the mover— That a respectable Committee had been raised to make Report
							at this Meeting. They had now reported, and the first thing I did was to
							renew the very same motion, <pb n="247" type="ms"/>which had already
							been unanimously rejected— This he thought would be highly disrespectful
							to the Committee— That the Reason I had assigned for the abolition of
							Secresy was only that there happened to be at this time a popular
							excitement against it; which he thought was the very reason for
							retaining it— <persRef ref="everett-alexander">Alexander H.
								Everett</persRef> then rose to speak, and an objection was made that
							upon a motion of indefinite postponement there could be no debate— He
							persisted however, and with much opposition observed that Parsons had
							made a motion, said to admit of no debate, but was allowed to make a
							Speech with it, not only debateable, but departing from the subject to
							cast personal reflections upon me.— He was there allowed to proceed so
							far as to say, there was nothing disrespectful in proposing a substitute
							for the Report of a Committee— Parsons was now silenced; and after much
							debate my proposition was rejected, and the Report was again taken up—
							It was near two O’Clock. Parsons crossed the room, and whispered to
								<persRef ref="jackson-charles">Judge Jackson</persRef>, who shortly
							after renewed the Motion for an indefinite postponement of the whole
							subject; and again sustained his motion by a Speech which could not be
							answered, because the motion admitted of no debate— Of this I
							complained, and with the assent of judge Jackson was allowed to answer
							his argument; which was that the Secrets of the Society ought not to be
							removed, because it would be yielding to a more momentary popular
							clamour— That there was nothing worth retaining in the Secrets
							themselves, but that to abolish them in deference to an artificial
							excitement got up among the People, was unworthy of the Society— I
							answered in substances first disclaiming all intention of disrespect to
							the Committee, and taking no other notice whatever of Parsons’s Speech—
							I then replied to judge Jackson, that the excitement to which he had
							alluded was the very reason why I earnestly desired the abolition of the
							Secrets—to relieve the Society from the Odium of holding them.— I
							considered the excitement prevailing in the public mind on this subject
							just, and well founded— I believed it would increase and prevail more
							and more—that if we disregard it now, it will press upon us again till
							we shall be obliged to do upon compulsion that which would now be
							voluntary. I observed that Judge Jackson had voted in Committee for the
							whole Report, and for these Articles particularly; he approved then of
							the Abolition of Secresy— He thought it right. he agreed with the
							principle upon which the public feeling was excited, but because a large
							portion of the People in addition to this sense of right, had a deep
							anxious and earnest feeling on the same side, he was now for setting
							both the feeling and the right at defiance—he would reject that which he
							approved, because it was intensely desired by multitudes who approved it
							also. This was a process of logic widely different from that which was
							natural to the judge’s mind, and to which I hoped he would not upon full
							consideration adhere— He replied that he had indeed agreed to the whole
							Report, but this was the Article that he liked least in it; or rather he
							disliked it— Judge Story spoke also very earnestly against the
							postponement, and the vote was of more than two to one against it— The
							meeting there adjourned to meet at four in the afternoon at the
							Athenaeum Lecture room— <persRef ref="fuller-timothy">Timothy
								Fuller</persRef> told me I had <persRef ref="russell-jonathan"
								>Jonathan-Russell’d</persRef> Judge Jackson, but I doubt whether I
							should have carried the vote against him; if Judge Story had not on this
							question been with me. On leaving the Hall I met <persRef
								ref="harris-richard2">Alderman R. D. Harris</persRef> whom I
							informed that I should be ready to deliver the Eulogy on <persRef
								key="monroe-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe</persRef>,
							either the 24<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> or 25<hi rend="superscript"
								>th.</hi> of this Month— He said the examination of the Public
							Schools would be on the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>— That my day
							might be either the 23<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> or the 25<hi
								rend="superscript">th:</hi> I told him either would suit me. He
							promised to consult the Council, and let me know the result— I asked him
								<hi rend="italic">where</hi> they proposed it should be— He said
							they had first thought of Faneuil Hall; but as that place was not
							favourable for the Voice, they now <pb n="248" type="ms"/>probably would
							chuse the Old South Church, which I told him would suit me better than
							Faneuil Hall— I asked him if they intended to have any religious
							Solemnities— He said perhaps a Prayer, by the eldest Clergyman in the
							City— I said that M<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Monroe having been of
							the Episcopal Church it might perhaps be proper to have parts of their
							funeral Service read— To which he said he would attend— I next met
								<persRef ref="curtis-nathaniel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Nathaniel Curtis</persRef>, and told him <persRef ref="gray-horace"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Horace Gray</persRef> had
							answered our Letter relating to the Land at Charlestown, as I had
							expected declining further Treaty— He said <persRef
								ref="jackson-patrick">Patrick Jackson</persRef>, of the Lowell
							Railway Company had just applied to him for the same Land, and we agreed
							to give him the same answer as we gave to Gray. <persRef
								ref="degrand-peter">DeGrand</persRef> walked with me to my Son
								<persRef key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> house and left me
							at the door— I dined there and at 4 P.M. attended the adjourned meeting
							of the ΦΒ.Κ at the Athenaeum Lecture Room— The Report of the Committee
							was taken up and debated Article by Article— The Articles for all
							secresy in future were not contested— <persRef ref="austin-james">James
								T. Austin</persRef> proposed an addition removing all injunction of
							Secresy upon present members which was adopted— The main debate was upon
							the change in the mode of election from an unanimous vote to two thirds—
							I opposed the change with great earnestness— Judge Story, and Edward
							Everett supported it with equal fervour— The judge in a long Speech—
								<persRef ref="baldwin-loammi">Col<hi rend="superscript">l.</hi>
								Baldwin</persRef> made a few remarks against the change, and moved
							to strike out the Article from the Report. No other member supported me,
							and <persRef ref="savage-james">James Savage</persRef>, who had not
							attended any of the other Meetings was there and replied to me in aid of
							Story and Everett— <persRef ref="gould-benjamin">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r </hi>Gould</persRef> moved that the proportion of votes for
							election should be nine tenths but that was rejected— It was drawing
							towards Sunset when the vote was taken and was a tie 32 and 32. which
							Everett the President decided was a vote against striking out: though I
							claimed that it was a vote against the Article which ought not to be
							adopted but by a positive majority and referred to the practice of the
							Old Congress where the question upon words moved to be stricken out,
							always was, shall the words stand and a positive majority was required,
							or they were stricken out. The vote however was taken upon each Article
							separately; and on coming to that <persRef ref="lowell-charles">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Lowell</persRef> moved that the
							proportion of two thirds should be struck out, and three fourths
							inserted, which prevailed and then the Article was adopted by a very
							small majority. All the remainder of the Report was accepted; and a vote
							passed that the expenses of this years anniversary celebration, should
							be paid from the fund of the Society, with a small assessment upon the
							class now to be graduated—the meeting closed after Sunset, and I then
							immediately returned to Quincy— I received this Morning a note from
								<persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Madison</persRef> acknowledging the receipt of the copy which I had
							sent him of my 4<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July Oration— His

						<p><date>25. III.30. </date>Thursday— Boston Eulogy on <persRef

						<p>Finished my version of the 17<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm—a very
							bad one— Wrote a Letter to <persRef ref="buchanan-robert">Lieut<hi

								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of July Oration. <persRef
								key="adams-louisa-catherine">My wife</persRef> was very imperfectly
							recovered from her yesterday’s indisposition; but went with me to
							Boston— As we came to my Son <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> house I met <persRef ref="sprague-joseph">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Joseph E. Sprague</persRef> of Salem,
							who went in, and sat with me upwards of an hour conversing upon
							Politics— The recent Elections in Kentucky have turned out less
							favourably to <persRef key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Clay</persRef> than his friends had expected, and the party here who
							obtained for him a nomination in Legislative Caucus last winter, are
							somewhat discouraged at the prospects before them— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Sprague asked me what they should do— I
							answered him that as he spoke with me confidentially I would answer him
							in perfect confidence— By their Legislative Caucus nomination of M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay for the Presidency last Winter, they
							had put it out of their power now to choose what they would do. He said
							that was altogether the act of <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2">Gen<hi
									rend="superscript">l.</hi> Dearborn</persRef>— I said they had
							further kicked and buffeted the anti masonic party, till it was
							impossible they should support M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, and
							they could not fail to lose by that operation, from 60 to 70 electoral
							votes— I alluded to the election of County Senators in the Legislature
							last May; particularly <pb n="254" type="ms"/>that of a Senator for the
							County of Plymouth— A <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>
							man, preferred to a National Republican, who had from 3 to 400 more of
							the votes of the People— He said that was an imposition upon the
							Legislature, and they had much regretted their choice when they found it
							out— I said it proved then that they were acting under an influence of
							which they were not aware— And it was Masonry— I asked him if he was a
							Mason; he said he was an Anti-Mason— I said I did not see then how he
							could support M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay, who was now, the head
							of the united Masonic and so called National Republican party. He said
								M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay must be withdrawn. Since the
							Kentucky Elections it was clear he could not succeed— He finally said he
							wished to bring out <persRef ref="madison-james">M<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi> Madison</persRef> and me; which I well understood, but
							made upon it no remark— I said I had spoken to him with the utmost
							confidence, with the express understanding that what I said should be
							exclusively between him and me— It was upon the supposition that what he
							said to me had been upon his own account alone— I had never been
							consulted, and never desired to be consulted upon the movements of the
							party since the 3<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> of March 1829— But that
							if he wished to ask my opinions for any other than himself, I was
							willing to give them, upon condition of knowing by whom and for whom
							they were asked— After he left me, I went to the Old South Church, to
							examine the arrangements made there for the performance. Met there
								<persRef ref="harris-richard2">Alderman Harris</persRef>, and
								<persRef ref="mccleary-samuel">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								M’Cleary</persRef> the City Clerk— The house was dark, and I
							strongly apprehended that as the Night should come on I should not be
							able to get through with my Discourse— I went to <persRef
								key="adams-charles2">Charles’s</persRef> Office, and at one O Clock
							took a very light dinner at his house— The procession was to go from the
							State house at half past three, and I was to have walked with it, but
							there came on a very heavy rain, and I went with M<hi rend="superscript"
								>rs</hi> Adams and Charles in a hack— At the door of the house in
							getting out of the Carriage, my wife fell upon the Side-walk pavement;
							but was saved in falling so as to have apparently received no injury.
							The inner door of the Church was so faithfully kept shut that it was
							with difficulty I obtained admission. <persRef ref="doane-george">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Doane</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="croswell-william">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Croswell</persRef>, Ministers of the Episcopal Church soon came into
							the Pulpit. The procession moved from the State-house at the appointed
							time and came through a pouring rain, entering the Church about a
							quarter past four— A voluntary on the organ, and the prayers of the
							Episcopal Service with a long occasional one composed by M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Doane, made it full five before I began—
							The house was crowded to suffocation; the heat excessive—crowds of
							People at the Church door wrangling and fighting to get in— Trucks,
							Waggons and Carriages rolling over the pavement in the Streets adjoining
							the Church, all the Time I was speaking; and as the Sun went down it
							grew so dark that it was becoming impossible for me to read my
							Manuscript— I was forced to read so rapidly that my articulation became
							indistinct, and my voice and my eyes affected both by the State of the
							Atmosphere were constantly threatening to fail me— My situation was
							distressing but I pushed on— I shortened the discourse much more than I
							had intended, and finally overleaped ten or twelve pages at once. They
							lighted at last the two lamps at the sides of the Pulpit, and I got
							through in an hour and a half, omitting more than half of what I had
							written— There was constant attention in the auditory— Occasional
							applause in one or two instances long continued and repeated— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> M’Cleary came up and observing that the
							auditory had been highly delighted asked if I would join the returning
							procession, which I declined— <persRef ref="eastburn-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Eastburn</persRef> the City printer
							came and bespoke the printing, which I promised him he should have— As
							soon as the Church was thinn’d off I found my family, returned to <pb

							wife and <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								Nowlan</persRef> to Quincy, where we reached home, about nine in the
							Evening; my heart full of gratitude for having escaped an ignominious
							failure— Such a variety of discouraging circumstances had occurred that
							my anxiety was over weaning— I was thoroughly exhausted and
							relieved.</p>

						<p>Began a version of the 18<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm— <persRef
								ref="spear-daniel">Deacon Spear</persRef> was here this Morning,
							with minutes for a Record of a fence round my Cherry tree lot of
							Saltmarsh land. He also paid me for the standing grass on that and two
							other Lots; and shewed me a circular printed invitation to him to attend
							a Convention to be held the first of next Month at Worcester to agree
							upon a Candidate for Governor of the Commonwealth, the ensuing year.
							This is called a <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson</persRef>
							Convention— And the circular is signed by <persRef ref="seaver-ebenezer"
								>Ebenezer Seaver</persRef> as Chairman and <persRef
								ref="henshaw-john2">John Henshaw</persRef> as Secretary— I asked him
							if he proposed to attend the Convention: he said no: it would take time
							and money; and he did not chuse to trouble himself for a cause in which
							there would be no profit to himself— He said Seaver had promised to
							appoint him an assistant for taking the census; and then had appointed
							another man—and this seems to have quite extinguished the deacon’s
							Jacksonism.— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>

									>r</hi> Richardson</persRef>, the Preceptor of the Academy at

							offered next week, but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richardson has
							heard so much of the rigour of the examination, that he is apprehensive
							Ward may not be found thoroughly fitted; and he proposes that I should
							examine him myself and thinks it might be advisable that he should
							return to the Academy and study another year before being offered for
							admission. But to this neither M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Boylston
							nor Ward himself would consent— I observed it would be of no use for me
							to examine him, as I know not what the standard for admission was; but I
							promised to see and converse with <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2"
								>President Quincy</persRef> concerning it—and to attend myself at
							Cambridge, both on Commencement day and on the day of examination, which
							is the Friday after. We had also conversation upon the arrangements for

							and <persRef ref="odiorne-george">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Odiorne</persRef> came out from Boston to see me—<unclear>as a</unclear> Committee
							from the Anti-Masons of Boston. They said they had learnt with regret
							the positive determination of <persRef key="rush-richard">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush</persRef> to decline the
							nomination for the Presidency of the United States, by the Anti-masonic
							Convention which is to assemble at Baltimore, on the 26<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> of next Month— That since his refusal
							had been known their attention <pb n="256" type="ms"/>had been drawn to
							me, and they came to enquire if in the event of my being nominated, by
							that Convention, I would accept the nomination— D<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Phelps shewed me at the same time a Letter from Pittsburg in
							Pennsylvania urging the expediency of ascertaining my Sentiments upon
							Masonry, and of proposing me to the Convention— I told them that I
							presumed my Sentiments on the present questions between Masons and
							Antimasons were sufficiently known to them, and that I had authorised
								<persRef ref="bates-stephen">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bates</persRef> to publish a Letter from me, which would leave no
							doubt of my views upon this subject on the mind of any man who should
							read it— I had supposed it would be published before this, and knew not
							why it had not been. I read the Letter to them from my own Letter-book.
							As to the nomination—I neither desired it—nor even the Office of
							President of the United States itself— I would give no pledge, and make
							no promise to any man or body of men, to obtain it— Nor should I feel
							myself called upon to decline a nomination, either by a single
							individual, or by any body of men— I never had asked, and never should
							ask the vote of any person for any Office I saw no necessity for
							declining any nomination, which anyone might please to make— I had had
							no reason to believe that the Antimasons had thought of me any where,
							and I regretted that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rush had declined
							the nomination offered to him, because I believed it would have been
							unanimous I was very apprehensive it would not be so now; and if they
							should propose my name, my only intreaty was that they should not press
							it one instant, after ascertaining that any other name would be likely
							to secure a more unanimous vote— With this they declared themselves
							entirely satisfied and left me. Lieut<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>

								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe attested by two witnesses; and
							solemnly denying the Truth of Rhea’s Statement— I have retained copies
							of Rhea’s Letter, and of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe’s
							declaration contradicting it.— There is a depth of depravity in this
							Transaction, at which the heart sickens— A total disregard to Truth, is
							chargeable upon so many men of the very highest standing, in this age
							and Country as well as in all others; that in the estimation of the
							world, it seems scarcely to carry with it an imputation— But the working
							up of a circumstantial fabrication, by practising upon the driveling
							dotage of a political parasite is beyond the comprehension of an honest
							mind. <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">Jackson’s</persRef> excessive
							anxiety to rest the justification of his invasion of Florida, upon a
							secret, collusive and unconstitutional correspondence with M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, can be explained only by an effort
							to quiet the stings of his conscience for the baseness of his
							ingratitude to me— Writhing under the consciousness of the return which
							he has made to me; for saving him from public indignation, and defending
							him triumphantly against the vengeance of Britain and Spain, the
							Impeachment of Congress, the disavowal of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
							Monroe, and the Court Martial of <persRef ref="calhoun-john"
								>Calhoun</persRef> and <persRef key="crawford-william-harris"
								>Crawford</persRef>, he struggles to bring his cause before the
							world and before posterity upon another basis— This basis is itself as
							rotten as his own heart— It is that his conquest of Florida, was
							undertaken and accomplished, not as I had successfully contended for
							him, upon principles, warranted by the Laws of Nations, and consistent
							with the Constitution of the United States, but by a secret fraudulent
							concert between him and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, in direct
							violation of the Constitution, and of all its conservative principles.—
							To establish this he resorts to his own unprincipled Letter, which I
							never saw, to the recreant desperation of Crawford, and to the ravenous
							imbecillity of John Rhea—he has succeeded with them both—both have made
							themselves by impudent, unblushing falsehoods Pandars to his unnatural
							Passions, and to glut his revenge upon me, for benefits such as he never
							received from any other man he has been labouring not only to blast the
							good name of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe, but to cover with
							infamy his own— His moral perceptions are so confused, and decomposed by
							his convulsive Passions, that in his eagerness to throw off his
							obligations to me, and to ruin the reputation of M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Monroe, he blinds himself entirely to the inevitable recoil
							upon himself. It is fortunate that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Monroe
							lived and retained his faculties to make a solemn and authentic
							declaration of the total falsehood of John Rhea’s abominable statement.
								<pb n="258" type="ms"/>This afternoon <persRef ref="blunt-joseph"
								>Joseph Blunt</persRef> came in from New-York by the way of Newport,
							New-Bedford and Hyannis—going to Boston for a few days; to look to the
							publication of the next volume of his Annual Register— He urged me much
							for the chapter, which I had undertaken to furnish for him, and I told
							him the reasons which have prevented me from the accomplishment of the
							work hitherto, and the delay which will be un-avoidable still. He stops
							to pass the Night here, and told me that the National Republicans in
							New-York were satisfied since the result of the Elections in Kentucky,
							that there was no prospect of success in the Election of <persRef
								key="clay-henry">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clay</persRef> to
							the Presidency; and that it would be advisable to fix upon another
							Candidate.— He spoke of <persRef ref="webster-daniel">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Webster</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="marshall-john">Chief-Justice Marshall</persRef>; and supposed,
							if there should be a nomination of me by the Anti-Masonic Convention at
							Baltimore, my name would also come before the Convention to meet there
							next December; of which Blunt himself is a Member I told him the
							Anti-masons had not until within a very few days thought of me any
							where; and now I apprehended it was too late— I was apprehensive that
							they would not agree; and that their party would fall off to different
							Candidates to the ruin of their Cause. </p>

						<p><date>31. IV. </date>Wednesday— Commencement. Cambridge.</p>
						<p><persRef ref="blunt-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Blunt</persRef> went into Boston with me— And <persRef
								ref="adams-isaac">Isaac Hull Adams</persRef>— Blunt alighted at the
							Tremont-House— I went to <persRef key="adams-charles2"
								>Charles’s</persRef> for a few minutes, and thence with I. H. Adams
							to Cambridge— Alighting at the entrance of the College-Yard, I met
								<persRef ref="hull-isaac">Commodore Hull</persRef>, just from
							Washington— I went into the Library Chamber, where I met the <persRef
								ref="lincoln-levi2">Governor</persRef>, <persRef
								ref="winthrop-thomas">Lieutenant Governor</persRef>, many members of
							the Corporation and Overseers. <persRef ref="quincy-josiah2">President
								Quincy</persRef>, and a number of Strangers— There was a Meeting of
							the Overseers, at which the honorary degrees, proposed to be conferred
							this day by the Corporation, were confirmed—<persRef
								ref="hopkinson-joseph">Judge Hopkinson</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="jay-peter">Peter A. Jay</persRef> to be Doctors of Laws— The
							procession was formed and I walked with <persRef ref="davis-john">judge
								Davis</persRef>. The merit of the Performances was beyond the usual
							average— The speaking incomparably better, on the whole than I ever
							before heard at Cambridge— <persRef ref="barber-jonathan">D<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Barber</persRef> the Englishman who
							was some years since at Washington is now here, a teacher of Elocution,
							and his instructions have greatly improved the general style of
							speaking— Of the undergraduate performances the two Orations of <persRef
								ref="eames-charles">Eames</persRef> and <persRef
								ref="simmons-william">Simmons</persRef> were most remarked, with one
							part of a Conference by <persRef ref="phillips-wendell">Wendell
								Phillips</persRef> the youngest Son of my old friend and associate
								<persRef ref="phillips-john">John Phillips</persRef>— I thought
							however that there had been rather too great a transition from tameness
							to over vehemence in the delivery, and that there was a corresponding
							change discernible in the composition, now somewhat exceptionable for
							exaggerated Sentiments and startling paradoxes— I made the remark to
							Judge Davis at whose side I sat, but he said he thought paradox was the
							usual defect of Commencement compositions— The English Oration for the
							Master’s degree by <persRef ref="u">Millard</persRef>, affected me
							beyond expression I thought it the most beautiful and pathetic effusion
							that I had ever heard. The Latin Valedictory by <persRef ref="u"
								>Chapman</persRef> was short, and with touches of pleasantry which
							closed the performances of the day with much good humour— The degrees
							were then conferred. Bachelors and Masters of Arts and Doctors of
							Medicine— Then the procession proceeded to the College dining hall,
							where the dinner was succeeded by the singing of the 78<hi
								rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm Tune, S<hi rend="superscript"
								>t.</hi> Martin’s— Grace was said by <persRef ref="day-jeremiah"
									>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Day</persRef> the President of
							Middlebury College Vermont, and thanks returned by my old Classmate
								<persRef ref="packard-hezekiah">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Hezekiah Packard</persRef>, whom I recognized only on enquiring who
							he was after he had performed that ceremony. He was <pb n="259"
								type="ms"/>the only Classmate whom I met, in the course of the day—
							Among the Strangers present were <persRef ref="berrien-john">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi> Berrien</persRef>, late Attorney
							General of the United States—<persRef ref="white-joseph">Joseph M.
								White</persRef> the Delegate from Florida, <persRef ref="u">M<hi
									rend="superscript">r </hi>Legaré</persRef> from Charleston
							South-Carolina; and others— Before leaving the Hall <persRef
								ref="warren-charles3">C. H. Warren</persRef>; told me there would be
							a meeting of members of the Φ.Β.Κ. this Evening at Concert Hall, which I
							was requested to attend; which I promised to do— I then called upon
								<persRef ref="waterhouse-benjamin">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Waterhouse</persRef>, and spent half an hour with him— His youngest
							daughter <persRef ref="ware-elizabeth">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
								H. Ware</persRef> with two or three children was there— I then
							visited President Quincy’s where a numerous company were assembled— At
							dusk of Evening I returned to Boston with I. H. Adams; and after a few
							minutes of repose, attended the Meeting at Concert Hall— About forty
							Members attended— I was chosen Chairman; and after observation by
							several members a Resolution was adopted requesting the members present
							to attend the Φ.Β.Κ. meeting to-morrow, and support a Resolution to
							repeal the Article of the New Constitution adopted at the Meeting of the
								11<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">t.</hi>
							authorizing elections of members by three fourths of the voters present,
							and to restore the rule requiring unanimity for election— A vote passed
							requesting me to offer this Resolution; but I stated the necessity that
							I should be under, of attending the <persRef ref="boylston-ward"
								>Boylston</persRef> Prize declamations, and the consequent inability
							of attending the ΦΒΚ. meeting at its opening. It was finally determined
							that <persRef ref="bradford-gamaliel">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bradford</persRef> should offer the Resolution, and I promised to
							attend the Meeting if possible before a vote should be taken— I
							suggested the expediency of having the proposition requesting the
							restoration of the old Rule, signed by the members present, but upon
							this most of them left the Hall, without opposing the proposal— The
							Meeting adjourned about nine in the Evening—and I went to <persRef
								ref="parkman-george">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> George
								Parkman’s</persRef> where there was an Evening party— Governor
							Lincoln was there—<persRef ref="middleton-henry">M<hi rend="superscript"

							White of Florida—<persRef ref="clay-thomas2">M<hi rend="superscript">r
								</hi>Clay</persRef> of Georgia, and many more— M<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi> White gave me an account of an interview
							which he lately had with <persRef ref="jackson-andrew">President
								Jackson</persRef>, who expressed an extreme aversion to the
							publication of certain Letters from himself to <persRef
								ref="bronaugh-james">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
								Bronaugh</persRef> on account of their spelling. It was about eleven
							at Night when I came home to my Son Charles’s house, exhausted by the
							bustling varieties of the interval, from four in the Morning when I had
							risen— I found two half-sheets of proof, from <persRef

						<p><date><hi rend="italic">Day.</hi></date> My occupations have discomposed

							refuses its office for writing. The arrears of my Diary make me uneasy
