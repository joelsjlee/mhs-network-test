                        <p>I versified one Stanza of the 53<hi rend="superscript">d.</hi> Psalm; but
                            it took me all the morning to my breakfast time— I am willing to think
                            the increase of difficulty is not entirely owing to the hebetation of my
                            faculties; but that it is partly intrinsic— In the 53<hi
                                rend="superscript">d</hi> Psalm—though consisting only of six
                            verses, there are three transitions of persons; the congruity of thought
                            is as often broken— The subjects are changed, and there is no apparent
                            connection between them— It begins by declaring the Atheist a fool— It
                            proceeds by asserting the universal depravity of mankind— It then turns
                            to the workers of iniquity as <pb n="175" type="ms"/>eating up the
                            People of God like bread— Then apostrophises some one, as having put
                            them to shame, because God despised them— And concludes by a prayer for
                            the Salvation of Israel— In such diversities of thought, it is not
                            possible to infuse a principle of unity— I followed the transitions, and
                            shall make the Psalm a collection of Scraps— I heard <persRef

                            the afternoon, from John 18.36. “Jesus answered, My Kingdom is not of

                            there is not satisfactory; and he wishes to take him away. I told him if
                            he did so, and Isaac wrote a good hand, he might pass the Summer with
                            me, and I should employ him to copy Letters, and our papers for me— His
                            board for which he now pays three dollars a week would then cost him
                            nothing, and I would allow for such additional compensation as I could
                            reasonably afford. His Son <persRef ref="adams-john3">John

                            He thought some further arrangements might likewise be expedient, of his
                            Notes and Mortgages to me— The Medford Estate having been when mortgaged
                            to me in 1819 held in common with <persRef ref="felt-joseph">M<hi

                            paid me 279 dollars, the balance of his Note given last November for the
                            wood sold standing, near the Railway— I had some conversation with him
                            also respecting my property here; part of which remains undisposed of— I
                            visited my Garden. The Apple trees best up are those planted in the book
                            boxes, and nearest the surface. There is also in the book-box N. 2. a
                            row of 12 wild cherries up from the Stone— The Wood-house Apple, and the
                            Penn’s Hill Redstreak come up with certainty from the seed— I am not
                            sure of any others— Almost all the Inscriptions upon my Stakes are
                            effaced— Those upon the Stories remain— I was occupied almost the whole
                            day upon the arrears of this day, struggling with the suffusion of my
                            sight, and the impotence of my hand.</p>

                            promised to come and spend part of the Summer with us— After dinner I

                            out three or four days— I took them to be Horse Chesnuts— At Mount

                            the bark of a few of them eroded by field mice; from two to three feet

                        <p>most of the Pears are from seeds of the Saint Germain tree from which I
                            planted 5. Cores and 10 seeds on the<space/>of November— Of these about 30
                            trees have come up and the experiment has thus far been successful— The
                            seeds of the Saint Germain pear in the Garden are prolific. The
                            wood-house Apple, and the Penn’s hill Redstreak are equally certain— I
                            have as yet certainly ascertained nothing else. <persRef

                            perplexing in the extreme; and I am searching in vain to discover why I

                            make no progress— By way of enquiry and consolation I thought of reading
                            some dull Poetry with harmonious versification— I read about half the

                            of Canaan, which is of that description— Visited my Garden and Nursery—
                            Found only three or four new comers; or perhaps plants which were out,
                            but which I had not before <pb n="177" type="ms"/>perceived— Towards
                            Evening I walked to Mount Wollaston, and examined every hill where I had
                            planted pomace last November of the hundred hills, there are fourteen
                            only on which one or more plants from the seed have appeared— I propose
                            to make the examination once a week until the whole Season of the
                            appearance of plants shall have passed— I walked home by the ride, and
                            attempted to read a Chapter of <persRef ref="scott-walter">Walter

                            at their Square Table of Whist— I passed much of the Morning in my
                            Garden and Nursery— Found only four new seedlings— Peach and Apple— But
                            I laid out two beds in the garden for transplanting the Seedlings which
                            have come up in my flower Pots and book-boxes— Took up 21 Seedling Trees
                            from the Pots where I had planted five Cores and ten Seeds of Saint
                            Germain 17. November last, and set them out near the Summer-house Cellar
                            where the Vine has been extirpated, leaving still nine or ten Seedlings
                            in the Pot— I took up four of the five Horse Chesnuts in the
                            Summer-house Cellar, and set them out at the four corners of my new
                            seedling-bed; and I had twenty suckers taken up from under the Mazzard
                            Cherry tree in the lower Orchard and set out in my seedling bed— The
                            transplantation of my Seedlings from the flower Pots and book boxes is
                            now my most critical operation; but if one third of those that have come
                            up will live, I shall have a large stock of young Trees of the present
                            year— But I fear that nine tenths of my last years Plantations will fail
                            to come up from having been planted too deep— Of my seedling Apple trees
                            of 1829. there are ten which have survived the Winter, and I am now in
                            hopes will live to bear engrafting in two or three years— My Elms and
                            English Oaks are all flourishing; but the latter have grown up hideously
                            crooked— My Poetry languishes as my Nursery thrives— Matter of fact and
                            imagination do not well amalgamate together— I read half the first Book

                        <p>The Morning is still absorbed in composing one Stanza of versification of
                            a Psalm; and being now upon the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> I have
                            a peculiar ambition to do it well— If in those sacred writings it may be
                            allowable to compare one with another, I should say this is one of the
                            most beautiful, if not the most beautiful of the whole collection of the
                            Psalms— It contains two great associated ideas— First that the firmament
                            of Heaven is a demonstration of an omnipotent creator— And secondly that
                            his Laws, Statutes, and Judgments are the demonstration of his moral
                            perfection— The illustrations of these two ideas, are very impressive—
                            The personification of Day and Night, with the Description of the Sun
                            and his daily course over the firmament, and the similitudes of the
                            Bridegroom, and the strong racer form a body of oriental imagery of
                            great power; while the conclusion of devout prayer for purification from
                                <pb n="178" type="ms"/>open and secret Sin, and for acceptance of
                            thought and word by the creator of the universe spread over the whole
                            Psalm an unction of tenderness and piety at once pathetic and sublime.
                                <persRef ref="addison-joseph">Addison</persRef> has paraphrased only
                            the first part of the Psalm, which relates to the physical Creation
                            only— <persRef ref="rousseau-john">Rousseau</persRef> has taken the
                            whole Psalm, and has made up from it the most beautiful of his Odes— The
                            versions of <persRef ref="tate-nahum">Tate</persRef> and <persRef
                                ref="watts-isaac">Watts</persRef> are failures; though Watts has
                            tuned it to three different measures— I am not worthy to attempt a
                            version of it, after these masters— <persRef ref="pope-alexander"
                                >Pope</persRef> in his serious mood should have versified the
                            Psalms— Not however as he did travesty the first Psalm— It is said in
                            the Biographical Dictionary, that Pope’s inextinguishable hatred of
                                <persRef ref="blackmore-richard">Blackmore</persRef> originated in a
                            remark published by Blackmore censuring him for this scandalous and most
                            indecent parody— I read this day the remainder of the first Book of
                            Blackmore’s Creation— It is only a paraphrase of the 19<hi
                                rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm; as indeed is the whole Poem. In
                            looking into the Volumes of Additions to Pope, I found a short Poem of
                            21. Stanza’s in the regular, Italian Ottava Rima Stanza; which I thought
                            had been first introduced into English by <persRef ref="byron-george"

                                Whitney</persRef> of Hingham, in the Morning from Proverbs 3:35.
                            “The wise shall inherit glory.” He explained the meaning of the term <hi
                                rend="italic">wise</hi> in this text as synonymous with religious;
                            and that glory meant honour. He analysed the other sources of honour as
                            held in the estimation of the world, and compared them with the honour
                            derivable from religion, both in this and the future life, and shewed
                            how far the honour resulting from religion, transcended all others. His
                            afternoon text was from 1. Thessalonians 4.11. “And that ye study to be
                            quiet, and to do your own business.”—first part of the verse— M<hi

                        <p>First morning since my arrival here, that the Sun has risen clear. I
                            believe that on the average of the year round this incident occurs twice
                            at Washington to once that it does here. The wind came round to
                            Northwest and grew colder as the day proceeded— <persRef

                            and Nursery I discover every day some new tree from seed or Stone,
                            coming up; but never where I look for them; never where I had planted
                            with the greatest care and pains— One cherry tree this day first
                            appeared, from the rows which I planted at the lower end of my Nursery,
                            and there is no sign of more— I had several Slips of Current bushes set
                            out; and after dinner emptied one of my Quart Tumblers where on the
                                15<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of October last I buried seven
                            white Oak Acorns— Every one of them has a tap-root extending to the
                            bottom of the Tumbler; and two had put up a sickly shoot above the
                            Surface— I set them all out in the Garden, and also planted a number of
                            pignuts which had been kept over the Winter— My red Oak commencing upon
                            its fourth year is putting out vigorous shoots; but has been much bent
                            by the Snow— One of the two small Oaks of the second year has survived
                            the Winter, and is putting forth shoots— The other is dead— I took a
                            walk this afternoon, over the hills, and found that my Tenant <persRef

                            entirely unconsumed— I set them out in the Garden, and planted also a

                            />Prologue— My brother was here: going to Boston— In my Nursery I
                            discovered only one new Peach and one Cherry seedling tree— Broke up the
                            Surface of the ground in several rows, where the seeds and Stones were
                            planted too deep— Attended the Town meeting this afternoon— There were
                            indeed two Town Meetings; and a Parish Meeting between them— The first
                            was to choose a Representative in the State Legislature—<persRef
                                ref="souther-john">Captain John Souther</persRef> was re-elected—and
                            also to take the vote of the Inhabitants upon a proposed amendment to
                            the Constitution of the State— So that there should be only one Session
                            of the Legislature yearly; and that to commence in January— The vote of
                            the Town was 45. for this Amendment, and 63 against it— This
                            town-meeting was over before I got to the house— A Parish Meeting was
                            then held—at which various business was transacted. <persRef

                            business of this Meeting done; the second Town-Meeting was held. A
                            moderator was chosen by Nomination, and I found myself most unexpectedly
                            called to take that place— I was so hoarse that I could scarcely speak;
                            but I thought it would be affectation to make an excuse, and I took the
                            place without hesitation— There were six or seven Articles in the
                            Warrant of the Meeting, upon all which the Inhabitants acted with much
                            harmony, and prompt despatch; and the Meeting adjourned about Sunset— I

                            to invest in the Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance Company— She then

                            authorise to receive the yearly interest for her— While transacting this

                            transacting, I had much miscellaneous Conversation with them; chiefly
                            upon European Politics. On returning to Charles’s Office I gave him the
                            deed and powers; to finish the business with Abigail, who is to be
                            married next week— I dined with Charles, and after dinner visited my old

                            engagements of business— <persRef ref="hall-ellis">His Son</persRef>,

                            not yet suffered from the Calamities which crowd upon old Age— We had a
                            long, animated Conversation; chiefly upon the late decision of the
                            Supreme Court of the United States on the case of the Cherokee Indians;
                            with which he was not satisfied— He thinks the Cherokees a foreign
                            State— I thought the decision <pb n="181" type="ms"/>right and we had
                            some discussion upon the question of Indian Rights. Returning to
                            Charles’s house, I went with him and his wife, and I. H. Adams to the
                            exhibition of Statuary by <persRef ref="greenough-horatio">H.
                                Greenough</persRef>— A group of two boy Angels reading a scroll

                            was also there—a very fine likeness— There were two large oval

                            Morning and Night, by an Italian Artist, who to represent Night has a

                            strange conceit, but very beautifully executed— We then left Charles and
                            his wife, and I returned home to Quincy— <persRef ref="greenleaf-thomas"

                        <p><persRef ref="field-william">W. Field</persRef> called here this Morning,
                            upon the subject of the House and Land at the foot of Penn’s Hill which
                            he proposes to rent of me for five years— I was not prepared for making
                            arrangements with him, and asked him to call again to-morrow, which he
                            promised to do— I planted this day part of the Nuts and Acorns which I
                            had kept over winter, for Spring planting— The Chesnuts are all mouldy—
                            The walnuts and Acorns all float— I do not expect that one of them will
                            ever come up. Yet they were kept in a large box, deeply buried in sand.
                            My next experiment should be to bury them deep in the ground sub Jove—
                            The vegetation in my Nursery is sluggish— Horse chesnuts, Peaches, and
                            here and there an Apple and more rarely a cherry tree, continue to come
                            up— But the Sun begins already to kill them— I am not now surprised that
                            so few persons raise fruit trees from the seed and Stone— It is an
                            exceedingly delicate and difficult operation— Perhaps one good mode of
                            raising Seedlings is to plant them under the old trees probandum est—
                            After dinner I emptied the flour pot in which I had buried the nuts of
                            the Pinus Pinea given me last Autumn by <persRef ref="dearborn-henry2"
                                >General Dearborn</persRef> (16. October 1830) Almost all of them
                            were in full vegetation; had sent roots down to the bottom of the Pot,
                            and were putting out their shoots at the surface of the Pot— I set them
                            out at various places of the Garden— Walk to the Mount-Wollaston Orchard
                            with <persRef ref="adams-isaac">Isaac H. Adams</persRef>— Found seedling
                            Apples up in 22 of the 100 hills— The ground was not sufficiently broken
                            up, and the seeds in many of the Hills, appear to have been choaked by
                            the luxuriant growth of grass. Of the border plantations Isaac
                            discovered three Chesnut seedlings just up, and I one Chesnut Oak. No
                            Walnuts— No Buttons—but a few Self-planted Limes, under the Trees— We
                            took up in front of <persRef ref="greenleaf-daniel">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> D. Greenleaf’s</persRef> Garden, a few
                            Seedling Limes, and Cherries, self planted, and set them out in my
                            Garden— The Horse Chesnut and the Lilacs in my front yard, are this day
                            opening— There is a short notice of the state of the Season, published
                            in the Daily Advertiser, by <persRef ref="lowell-john">John
                                Lowell</persRef>, signed a Roxbury farmer— He dates the first
                            blossoming of Cherries this year 23. April— Pears opening blossoms 1.
                            May. Apples 6. May. He says on the whole the vegetation is earlier than
                            for 17 years before— I assume that of each tree, the fall seedling
                            should come up just at the time when the Parent tree begins to blossom.
                            I read a few pages this Evening, of <persRef ref="moore-thomas"

                                ref="murray-john3">Murray</persRef>, characteristic— The rapidity
                            with which he wrote his Poems, and the pertinacity with which he
                            revised, and corrected, and added to them in the process of publication
                            are observable— His extreme sensitiveness to the slightest misprint is
                            ludicrous— He was a strange compound of Genius and Profligacy—despising
                            and adoring fame—pursued forever by the Scourge of Remorse, and flying
                            from the Torture of his own Conscience to the composition of Poetry— In
                            moralizing upon Fame, he measures it by the Sale of his writings, and is
                            much annoyed at the thought that <persRef ref="glass-hannah">Hannah

                            Savage, with alternations of voracious intemperance and long inanition.
                            Moore is a friendly biographer, and having no more moral principle, than
                            Byron himself palliates his vices, and embroiders his good qualities
                            till he makes him a purely great man— In my Nursery I discovered one
                            Chesnut seedling up, and one Apple seed leaf from row of whole
                            Wood-house Apples, planted 31. August last. After dinner I planted in
                            the book-box fronting my chamber window, several rows of seeds which I
                            have kept from last Summer. Whortleberry, Black berry, Thimble berry,
                            Grape-seeds, and Apple-seeds—experiments repeated to ascertain how these
                            plants can be raised from the seed. In throwing up the Earth from the
                            box I destroyed several apple-seedlings which had not reached the
                            surface. I also turned up a pignut in the drape, which had shot forth a
                            tap-root about two inches deep. The Seedling trees we plucked up and
                            planted last Evening are dead—but I found two seedling peach trees up on
                            one of the stands which I spaded up last Summer, under the old
                            Pear-trees.</p>

                                Gray</persRef>, of Jamaica Plains, in the morning from Psalm 104.30.
                            “Thou renewest the face of the Earth.”— A Sermon upon the Spring— Its
                            beauties—its enjoyments, its prospects, its hopes— Its obligations, and
                            its liabilities to disappointment. With the analogies which it supplies
                            to the moral condition and vicissitudes of human Life— His afternoon
                            text was from Matthew 7.14. “Because strait is the gate, and narrow is
                            the way, which leadeth unto life; and few there be that find it.” a
                            verse not so congenial to Unitarian Doctrines— Doctor Gray dined with
                            us; and happening in Conversation to mention to him that having been
                            abridged of my reading and writing by the weakness and inflammation of
                            my eyes, I had fallen to musing in verse, and had versified with some
                            others the Psalm from which his text was taken, he wished to see my
                            version— I read to him that of the 19<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
                            which he asked my leave to take a copy— I promised to send him one, and
                            also of the 104<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> I had as yet no fair Copy
                            of either— He promised to call upon me again— <persRef

                            read a few pages of <persRef ref="moore-thomas">Moore’s</persRef>
                            <persRef ref="byron-george">Byron</persRef>. My brother is quite unwell—
                            I visited my Garden and Nursery twice this day— After breakfast
                            alone—and towards Evening with my nephews T. B. and J. H. Adams— In the
                            morning I first saw a second Chesnut tree; in the Evening a new Horse
                            Chesnut— Several of the <pb n="183" type="ms"/>trees had suffered a
                            blight— Yesterday the Wind was at Southwest, with a clear sky, and Sun
                            at Summer heat— This morning there was a dense fog— Wind North of East—
                            No Rain, but the atmosphere so damp that on the trees it condensated
                            into a dropping distillation which watered all the ground beneath and
                            around them— The wind continued Easterly all day; without rain; and
                            remaining cloudy; the fog clearing off after Sun rise— This fog comes
                            from the Sea— It deposits a heavy dew, not amounting to mist upon all
                            the verdure of vegetation. But the heat or the fog following so closely
                            upon it, has parched up and crisped the delicate just expanding leaves,
                            particularly of the growing Oaks; and of some of the young Apple-trees—
                            Is it not such weather which rusts all the wheat sown in this part of
                            the Country—and forms the film which I have seen arresting the growth,
                            and cutting off the maturity of young Gooseberries?</p>

                            in the State of New-York, who had a pair of Carriage horses of which he
                            wished to make sale to me, but which I did not want— While we were at

                            from a workman who lives with Farrar— I was three fourths of this day,
                            Morning and afternoon in my Garden and Nursery— <persRef

                            My experiments are now so multiplied, that it would be a waste of time
                            to record them— I emptied all the Earthen Pots, and Green buckets, in
                            which seeds and Stones had been deposited last Autumn, and set those
                            which had come up, out at the North-west corner of the Garden, covering
                            them almost entirely from the radiance of the Sun with Straw— Between
                            every two of the Seedlings I planted one of the large Shellbarks, kept
                            over Winter at Washington—though on cracking three or four of them, they
                            appeared too much dried up, to leave a hope that they would vegetate— In
                            the hook’d bucket, we turned out a whole Nest of Ants, in their winged
                            state—of which there were many thousands— There were other Insects also;
                            and an Oak, which was growing in it, apparently very flourishing, had
                            the tap-root eaten off so close to its neck that it must undoubtedly
                            die— Among the Transplantations was an Apricot from one of the Stones

                            my Apricots, from one of which he took out several worms— None of the
                            rest were attacked. The new vegetation of Seedlings, is about equal to
                            the disappearance of the Sun Struck— A third Chesnut seedling appears;
                            and a tree with Seed leaves different from the Apple Pear or Cherry, and
                            which I hope is the Ash— Horse Chesnuts, and Peaches come up numerously;
                            five or six of each this day— No Appearance of Oaks; which certainly is
                            because they were planted too deep— In the Evening I read a few pages of

                            thick and rank— Horse Chesnuts and Lilacs in full, open blossoms— Pear
                            and Cherry blossoms gone— Apple-blossoms going— I wrote for about an
                            hour— Then from 6 to 1/2 past 7. Rode my horse to Braintree, round by

                                >Charles</persRef> went to Boston, and returned to dine. I finished
                            the version of the 8<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> Psalm. <persRef
                                ref="curtis-noah">Noah Curtis</persRef> was here and paid me the
                            rent of Goose Pasture for the last year to 31. March— He mentioned the
                            desire of <persRef ref="hubbard-charles">Charles Hubbard</persRef> to
                            purchase half an Acre of Land to build a dwelling House upon it, at the
                            Corner of my Penn’s Hill Orchard— I asked him his opinion of its value—
                            He said he thought it was worth 150 dollars— I promised him an answer by
                            this day week— I made some enquiries of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
                            Curtis concerning his business. He, and his two Sons <persRef

                            />making large fortunes by the business— He told me that for several
                            years they had kept upwards of thirty men constantly at work, in making
                            boots and shoes, chiefly for exportation to Baltimore— Charleston S.C.
                            Savannah, Augusta and most of all to New-Orleans— They ship them all in
                            coasting vessels from Boston, and have Agents in each of those Southern
                            Cities who make the Sales for them— They have their hides for Sole
                            leather chiefly from Philadelphia, where they are tann’d with white Oak
                            bark— It gives the leather a pale saffron colour. The tanning here is
                            done with Hemlock bark and the colour is a dark deep dingy red— I asked
                            him why there was no Tanner in this Town? He said the business required
                            some capital, and there was considerable delay in obtaining returns—
                            That since the failure of <persRef ref="webb-jonathan">Deacon

                            come.” upon the Parable of the Talents and the Napkin; and in the
                            afternoon from Romans 13.10. “Love worketh no ill to his neighbour:
                            therefore Love is the fulfilling of the Law.” This is the fourth Sunday
                            since my return to Quincy, and the first that M<hi rend="superscript"
                                >r</hi> Whitney has preached, in his own pulpit— This has been his
                            usual practice from his first Settlement in this Parish—nearly thirty
                            two years— There has been great harmony among his People until lately—
                            They are now considerably divided, and he has lost much of his
                            popularity— He was for some years much sustained by his ardent Politics,
                            in unison with those of a majority of his Parishioners. The episcopal
                            church afterwards took off several of his Society, but that has fallen
                            off since the removal of <persRef ref="cutler-benjamin2">M<hi
                                    rend="superscript">r</hi> Cutler</persRef>— The sect of
                            Universalists is now the most thriving— They preach not only the
                            doctrine of universal Salvation, but that there is no future
                            retribution—no punishment hereafter for deeds done in the body— Yet they
                            preach the immortality of the Soul, and that the life hereafter is a
                            state of perpetual enjoyment to the whole human race— They call, and
                            believe themselves Christians. To reconcile the belief of a future life,
                            with that of a total exemption from all punishment in it is within the
                            compass of the reasoning faculties of man and is absurd enough to be
                            embraced as a creed— <persRef ref="adams-thomas2">Lieutenant

                            Speech at the Anti-Masonic Convention; last Friday, but his personal
                            appearance is so <pb n="187" type="ms"/>much altered by age, that I did
                            not then entirely recognize him. He came now to consult me upon a
                            project which he had formed for a universal Language— He wishes that an
                            address should be forwarded to the <persRef ref="jackson-andrew"
                                >President of the United States</persRef>, requesting him to

                            accredited— He thinks the Italian language would be best adapted to the
                            purpose— I expressed to him some doubts of the practicability of the
                            project; but he said although the members of the Lyceum, near Milton
                            Bridge were divided in opinion upon the subject a majority of them were
                            decidedly in favour of it— I mentioned to him that a similar purpose had
                            once been recommended by <persRef ref="maupertuis-pierrelouis"
                                >Maupertuis</persRef> but that the language he preferred was the
                            Latin. He said he had never heard of it— Churchill was two years after

                                Russell</persRef>— A visit of mere curiosity. <persRef

                            and see his ditching upon the Salt Meadow— I rode the horse, which
                                <persRef ref="kirk-john">John Kirk</persRef> brought out from Boston

                            that I could not come to-morrow as I had promised; but would come
                            Wednesday afternoon at four O’Clock— It was dusk when I returned home,
                            and I found the horses trot insupportably hard— Charles read a few pages

                            in truth the inventive faculty; a rare gift of Heaven— I perceive in my
                            Nursery this day two new Chesnut trees up—but almost the whole of my
                            last Summer, and Autumn’s plantations of seeds were too deep; so that
                            nine tenths of them will never come up. Those in my book boxes have
                            succeeded best— The Pomace seeds do not come up well. Whole Apples and
                            the Cores of Pears should be planted; barely covered with earth— The
                            Sun, the frost, the woods, insects, mice, rabbits and Squirrels, Rain,
                            and how many other enemies I know not, are fatal to young Plants— It is
                            not surprizing therefore that the common farmers think it labour lost to
                            attempt raising them.</p>

                            and attended the Meeting of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

                            several volumes of the Transactions of the English Horticultural

                            ordinary Session of the Legislature, every year, and that is to be held
                            in January— The Northeast Wind, Rain and fog, continued nearly the whole

                            appearance in Book-box N. 1. of a new Apple-seedling, shewed that the
                            vegetation of that fruit has not yet ceased— Nursery Appearance of

                            Rent— There was a growth of standing Pine-wood upon that lot sold in
                            November 1829. and cut down that Winter— I now saw a beautiful growth of
                            Oak, Chiefly white Oak, but intermixed with, black, grey, and barren’s
                            scrub Oak, on the same Spot— I had heard and read of this phenomenon,
                            but now witnessed it with my own eyes— There is fencing wanted upon the
                            lot, and I agreed to give Capen an old dead apple tree, to put up a
                            patch of wall near where it stands. I made sundry observations as I went
                            along, which I might turn to account— Plucked up one tree or shrub,
                            which I set out in my Garden— Saw many flowers in blossom; but neither
                            Capen nor I knew what they were— Several wild strawberries, in blossom—
                            The low Blackberries are also in Blossom— I walk’d home by the way of

                            it was somewhat affected by the heat of the Sun— It was a day of extreme

                            Society— There are 17 papers out of 65 in the first Volume, by <persRef

                            contains matter for remembrance; if my Memory were now what it once was—
                            My object now is chiefly to collect what is to be known upon Hybrid
                            Plants. The propagation of Apple-trees by cuttings was a novelty to me;
                            quite incredible— The acquisition of Apples, in three years from the
                            seed, equally marvellous— But notwithstanding the heat I visited my
                            Garden and Nursery after dinner— Found many seedling Trees killed by the
                            Sun— Many drooping to die—Apple, Pear, Cherry— The Peach, Horse Chesnut,
                            Plum, and Oak yet hold out— New Vegetation, next to nothing— One ash
                            pod, in the last Western Stony barren row. One additional puny
                            Chesnut—one unknown tree—perhaps the spurious Juniper— One which I took
                            for the Sweet gum; and I believe some Currants from the seed— A peach
                            out of place in an alley; and a button wood cutting which I stuck into
                            the ground at a corner for a stake, putting out shoots— My grey Oakling
                            has now its this year’s upward stem gnaw’d off by the beetle bugs; and
                            all the collateral this years shoots the same— I sympathize with the
                            prophet <persRef ref="jonah">Jonah</persRef> upon the loss of his gourd;
                            but yet hope the tree will not die. I fear its growth for this year is
                            stunted— I remark the creeping runners from the Wild Strawberry; but no
                            blossom— Knight sets out his Strawberry beds every year anew— <persRef

                            the Stone Temple on the next fourth of July— <persRef
                                key="adams-charles2">Charles</persRef> brought out from Boston two
                            pots of Keen Seedling Strawberry Vines, in bearing which we set out this
                            Evening in the Garden— <persRef ref="greenleaf-ezekial">Price
                                Greenleaf</persRef> was returning from the Creek Bath, when I
                            invited him in and he visited my garden and nursery. The Sun is killing
                            my fresh seedling trees with fearful fatality— Scarcely one appearance
                            of a new plant— It is the Pestilence that walketh at Noonday: as the
                            beetle bug is the desolator of the Night— The Seedlings in the
                            Book-boxes have hitherto escaped and are very flourishing— I found this
                            day one Walnut which came up the 25<hi rend="superscript">th.</hi> of
                            May; but which I then took for a Chesnut. What I took for Currants are
                            probably wild blackberries. The first Lesson for an experimenter in
                            Plantations, must be to bear disappointments with equanimity; and to
                            expect them in the proportion of a hundred failures to one successful
                            operation— In the Evening I called upon <persRef ref="beale-george">M<hi

                            Committee, at seven O’Clock to morrow Evening at my house— Charles told
                            me that a man had called upon him and wished to have a Conversation with
                            him on the Subject of my Correspondence with <persRef key="rush-richard"
                                >R. Rush</persRef> upon Anti-masonry— Charles is afraid of the
                            consequences of my expressing any opinion upon the Masonic contrary;
                            supposing it will be imputed to selfish motives— But this is the vital
                            essence of all political collisions— No man can escape them— And a man
                            susceptible of being intimidated by them, is not fit for any useful
                            agency in public affairs. I have for nearly five years abstained from
                            taking part in the Masonic Controversy, as much as possible; but upon
                            such questions there is a time when it becomes the duty of a good
                            Citizen to take his side. In the conflict between Free-Masonry and its
                            adversaries, I apprehend the Time is approaching when my duty to my
                            Country, will require a free and open avowal of my opinions, and
                            whatever may be the consequences I shall not flinch from it— The danger
                            is not imaginary—nor I hope underrated by me— Consideration is a
                            Guardian Angel—</p>
